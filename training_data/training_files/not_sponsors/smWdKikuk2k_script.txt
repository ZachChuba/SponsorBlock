you know that we love fire even better we love throwing fire now flamethrowers are nothing new and people have been known to throw fire since the ancient times in fact the greeks had used it at sea possibly as far back as 673 back then it was a device consisting of a hand pump that shot bursts of greek fire using a siphon tube and a piston and ignited it with a match fast forward 1300 years and here i am with propane a mini saber and cornstarch curious let's go the flamethrower i want to build today though i want to be our most powerful and our most practical one and i want it to be relatively safe for us to use in special effects let's see what we have here now if you've seen our mandalorian flamethrower episode you know we used cornstarch and propane for the flamethrower and we did this as this gave us a huge flame that was bright orange and relatively safe compared to liquid flame throwers so i kind of want to do the same thing since we're going to be using this for practical effects i want to make sure it's easy to refill easy to use and relatively safe to operate first up we have some empty dry chemical fire extinguishers now i know what you're thinking we're going to use a fire extinguisher as a flamethrower yes we are here's a cool thing with fire extinguishers these are meant to disperse a powder basically baking soda you pressurize one of these tanks you see there's a hose right here and when this lever gets pressed that causes the pressure to push the powder out and through the nozzle that's exactly what we want to do but instead of using baking soda we're going to be using cornstarch now cornstarch is pretty cool because normally it's not flammable unless it's well dispersed in air watch this um i want to stand there if i were you i'd move over a little ready doesn't work damn it i'm getting covered in corn starch hey dylan do you ever have two apples for a test or like any kind of like fruit that we can light on fire that might work take a look at the cantaloupe for example let's say it accidentally gets some cornstarch on it while it's playing with fire right look at my hands completely covered couldn't be good at all right but look cornstarch doesn't burn normally so even though this candle is completely covered in flammable cornstarch it's not on fire it's actually pretty safe let's compare that to gasoline safety first this is not a flamethrower yet now let's say we use gasoline for our flamethrower which is pretty common for uh for flamethrowers nowadays imagine that uh that you're the cantaloupe and you get some gasoline on you well here's the thing kind of a pretty bad day see that cantaloupe that is not a happy cantaloupe the uh the cornstarch cantaloupe was a much much happier cantaloupe yeah as you can see this is uh this is a pretty bad day for him you guys just wait for this to bite out now that we know how much safer cornstarch is than gasoline let me show you how it does ignite there you go so if it's well dispersed we can't get cornstarch to catch on fire which is what we're going to be doing this is the tank we used for our mandalorian flamethrower and it lasts about three to five seconds of fire but i want to go bigger so i got this one instead which is significantly bigger and she gave us a lot more fire for a lot longer to pressurize our fire extinguisher with its cornstarch we're going to use a flammable gas the slammable gas not only allows us to get the system pressure we need but it also helps with ignition when the flame is still dispersing in our mandalorian flamethrower we use propane but for this one i think i'm gonna go with map gas because i like the color combination so we know we're using cornstarch as our fuel we're using mad gas as a pressurizer and we're using an old fire extinguisher as a storage tank now we just need some fittings to put this all together all right we have a lot of fittings what do we want got a couple of different sizes of nozzle some tubing to connect all this some couplers probably too now i want a nice big valve so we have a large passageway and it doesn't get clogged up with cornstarch imagine if we have something like this on top and you just like close it and you can open it put a whole bunch of cornstarch in there close it again fire it for now this will do i want to make it so that this thing is always open that way we can pressurize it and then use our own valve to get the most flow out of this as possible let's start by taking it apart basically i want to remove these two handles first see if we can get rid of that valve all right there we go so we have this valve here and that valve is not going to get us as much flow as we want i want to get rid of it so i can't weld onto this what can i do and uh here's this valve that we're trying to remove so we can get that valve out [Music] does not want to go out [Music] there we go that's a good start okay so we have the entire valve completely disassembled and this is made out of brass so we can't weld to it but we can do is we can tap this with an npt thread so we can screw this into it or this one here and that way we can attach this valve we can attach whatever hosing we want to it we can attach our nozzle and then have the front of the flame thrower all completed why is this still here all right so i've got a whole bunch of different fittings and i think i've come up with a design that'll work quite well now i want to include a big valve at the top for easy filling of the entire system but if i put that awkwardly off to the side or on the bottom that won't be the case so instead i'm going to attach it straight to the middle and i'm going to replace the old valve completely here's what i'm planning to do i've got this t-fitting which the big valve can bolt into we can weld that t-fitting on top of this cylinder so for this fitting here we can plumb a 90 degree connector with a big piece of steel as the siphon tube that goes out the front to which we can connect our main valve and our nozzle so that's what it'll look like and basically what that'll mean is we can open this put cornstarch right in there close this pressurize the system and then we can open this main valve here to let all the cornstarch out really quickly so for our siphon tube we're gonna use this 90 welded to this eighth inch coupler so that we can have the rest of the hosing go on just like that and that should go quite well with our valve that should all be able to join up let's go weld these clean this edge up [Music] ready for some welding look at that weld that should be a perfect flamethrower weld that's the first part of this part number two is gonna be that piece of steel that we just got that's one piece welded let's figure out how long this tube is if this is sitting on here we need the length of this 313 millimeters from there if we do that that should give us a perfect center exit we're trying to replicate this piece right here so it's got a little notch there and it's about that long go make it [Music] like that and then let's bring it back over there and do that notch [Music] oh [Music] gotta clean this edge up and we're ready to weld now we can weld this piece into here like that and that means that our cortex can go in this way and out that way okay so i want that to sit right there so let's weld it into place here we go that will hopefully hold now the next step is this is going to be welded like that we have to make that hole a little bit bigger so we're going to cut off that entire piece off the top [Music] check out our pressure chamber so cornstarch goes on there cornstarch comes out of there just got to weld it up [Music] all right let's clean this up and see how it turned out that's what we got i'm really worried about those welds i don't know if there's gonna be any leaks there or not okay so i'm gonna try to attach this right there as a pressurization line so pressure will go in here and force the cornstarch out of here all right i have no clue if i can drill this cast iron here oh yeah no problem there [Music] there it is there's all of our fittings welded together all right let's put it together we should have just about everything we need first up we're gonna need i also got a gauge it goes up to 160. we need to hook this guy up into here then this needs to go like that got this hose for it so at what point in history did they make a plane through it like well you see fire was one of the most important inventions in human history as that allowed people to uh cook food therefore getting more nutrition out of it giving them more time instead of making food so when the cavemen invented fire they also invented the plain thrower of course so i got my teflon tape got all my fittings let's put this together got a gauge installed got our fill valve installed time to install the two smaller valves and now we got a way to add pressure pressure off fill on go off finally it's out of nozzle so with these all three of these closed we should be able to pressurize the system and have it not explode hacksmith industries is full of curious minds and uh every time we see something cool we think how can i make that and if you have a curious mind too you should definitely check out engineering that built the world on the history channel each episode takes an in-depth look at defining moments of innovation like the golden gate bridge the statue of liberty and the hoover dam iconic structures that have both shaped and defined our world is the ultimate story of man versus nature our connector is done let's go pressure test it so we're going to pressurize it through the outlet so this is usually where the flamethrower come out but right now we're putting air in there because it's most convenient and we're going to get it up to about 120 140 psi which should be more than enough for propane and then we're going to make sure that there's no leaks if there's no leaks nothing explodes and everything's working well we can go on to testing the propane oh we have leaks everywhere yeah look at all the bubbles uh we can go over the welds again and see if that'll help i redid some of the teflon tape and changed out the ball valve at the top everything seems to be airtight now but we still need to do a pressure test should be good for a pressure check let's start pressurizing seems pretty good no booms yet we're good no leaks holding 120 psi no problem all right here's what we need next got this we need a proper nozzle on this so let's upgrade that now it's going to add this nozzle basically right there all right let's hook up the propane i think i'm gonna peel these stickers off first before we attach anything else to it now this should be able to go on there we go there's our propane feed line wrap that around now just like this i think we should uh try to strap this on first i think we're basically ready to go really yeah ready for a test no it don't waste let's go test it all right we got our test dummy here let's see if we can make some fried cantaloupe so this should not catch fire and ignite for water hopefully if we get cornstarch on it it won't burn very long because as soon as the cornstarch sticks to it it'll stop burning because there's not enough dispersion it's a safe flamethrower for now sweet we're pressurizing you guys ready let's fill it up with corn starch watch look how much easier this is to fill in the old one we're going to need a lot more cornstarch okay and let's close this full tank 80 psi so this is no flame just uh cornstarch [Music] okay should we try that game's ready ready something ready i'm ready [Music] one [Music] more time [Music] let's do a few more few more fires barbecue in the chicken [Applause] oh perfect no don't use a nice one this one's not nice the skin fell off oh okay i guess okay this is the terrible idea all right we got our chicken on a stick [Music] that was my lunch [Music] oh man those were my favorite tongs what are you doing what's this well see the cornstarch is not flammable on our uh cantaloupe so i'm gonna make it more flammable do not try this at home perfect ready all right a little closer there there we go all right so safe it works as a fire extinguisher well i don't know about you but i would call that a success okay i'm really happy with how this thing works but it's not too comfortable to hold it at the moment and it doesn't have enough stickers and we still need to attach the mini saber to it so you can operate it with one person would you remember that vinyl cut off some stickers all right tyler um i'd like you to make us something like this i guess what's wrong danger flamethrower yeah yeah let's do that let's do a proper nice nice sticker white background black um oh sorry then do the the red then the yellow then the black cool let's go ahead and hang with this while tyler does that okay so we know we want to have our mini saber sitting somewhere about there to light the torch hacksmith mini savers are back in stock now so make sure to get yours at hacksmith.store so what i'm thinking is we're going to add some kind of plate between here and here that'll allow us to basically have this there and then we can basically use that as our main handle so we can hold it like this right and then we can use the other hand to open and close the flamethrower so let's see let's see what we can find something like this would probably work cut these guys this can mount right there okay so what i'm going to do to make this removable is i'm going to use these nuts i'm going to cut them in half so that they fit right around this pipe and then we'll use a hose clamp to tighten on the handle and that will make sure that if we need to remove our mini saber or if we take this back apart we can do so easily [Music] so everything's tacked together right now we're going to go attach to the flamethrower make sure it's all straight so then all we have to do is put this through the middle that should sit nicely right there and then we can use these hose clamps [Music] okay that is way easier to hold now kind of i need we might need some modifications here but [Music] it should be nicely in the way doesn't have to work let's do that okay so if we put it like right there that should not only allow you to hold it pretty nicely but also fairly easily access the switch to turn on the igniter let's do that let's put this thing together three two one there we go it's done oh my god look at it check it out i can actually pick it up with one hand now oh that looks awesome now oh i made a really good suggestion to use this valve and make it into a little turn handle so instead of pulling it back like this it was kind of like a bike throttle so theoretically if i can replace this and i weld the tube onto it that's all i should take all right i've chopped off the end of that lever and welded it onto a steel tube to make a nice grip so now this will be like a throttle to control your flame thrower it's gonna add some uh grip tape to it you should just be able to put it on there and then bolt it in place on off hell yeah it's ready to get some flame throwing done all right tyler ooh perfect check that out time to add the finishing touches clear and simple sticker danger flamethrower and there we go after our full day of building we have the most powerful and the most practical flamethrower in the history of the hacksmith channel so this calls for a final test [Music] [Applause] i cannot wait to test out this final flamethrower got the flamethrower got some cornstarch let's fill it up let's open up our ball valve that's a lot of porn stars a lot of cornstarch sealed all right pressure tag the main ball valve is closed the throttle valve is closed now we just need to open this valve here pressurize the system all right ready yep all right 90 psi where pressure okay time for fire [Music] that is awesome [Music] yes sweet ready this thing is amazing this is definitely the best flamethrower we've ever built thank you for watching and make sure to check out engineering that built the world on the history channel i'll see you in the next one i think i found the downside of this flamethrower it makes a mess
