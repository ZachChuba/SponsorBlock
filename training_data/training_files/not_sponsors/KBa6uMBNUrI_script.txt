hello everybody and welcome back to another collection video item collecting in runescape is something i find truly fascinating honestly later in life i'm probably going to become a hoarder or a collector at this rate i just kind of like collecting things whether it be pokemon cards or video games i've always had a fascination with collecting so i'm sure you could imagine that collecting in runescape interests me a lot now throughout the last two or three years i have released a couple of videos on item collecting but today's video is going to be a little bit different because for today i worked directly with the two major item collecting discords and i received submissions from some of the biggest item collectors in the game which means i have images for some of the biggest item collections which may never have been revealed ever before anyway guys i really hope you enjoyed the video as always if you do i really appreciate it if you leave the video like always helps out with youtube algorithm thank you so much and let's get started okay so why do people collect large quantities of junk items in runescape i think a lot of players think they're crazy maybe they are crazy i don't know but sure is interesting and impressive to me now the value of any item collection is pretty subjective it really comes down to just what a random player is willing to pay it could vary a lot depending on the day depending on the player and of course depending on other factors such as the collection size the rarity of the items and more in general what makes a collection rare comes down to often the buying limit of the item if there is a very low buying limit on an item for example the green party hat is a buying limit of five that means collecting a large volume of them is going to be incredibly challenging because one of the easiest and quickest ways to gain items in runescape is the grand exchange so for example a 100 000 stack of pure essence not very impressive but a 100 000 stack of christmas crackers is incredibly rare the other main factors are just the straight up volume of the item some items in the game have a very high buying limit but just truly nobody sells them because they're just obscure or hard to get in the game and finally here in general the higher quantity amount of the collection you have generally seems to bump up the price a bit because it becomes more valuable for collectors now with that all out of the way i want to give a massive shout out to a runescape player and collector by the name of bodhi they were incredibly helpful with connecting me with both of the main collecting discords as well as just giving me a load of information and pictures of his own personal collection as well so thank you very much okay we're starting off strong here with probably one of the biggest collections i've ever seen in the entire game not only by volume which is huge but also possibly by the value as well now this player wanted to remain anonymous which i totally understand but thank you so much for submitting your collection it is truly titanic now this player has a total item count currently of around 2 billion 750 million individual items getting 2.7 bill coins is very challenging for most players but this player somehow managed to do it with items that have huge buying limit restrictions and are way harder to obtain in bulk than caches honestly finding a single 100ml stack of any item is already incredibly impressive but this player somehow has managed to nearly do 28 of them now now let's just start at the top here and work our way down first up here we have runes which granted the buying limit recently was changed to be much higher but most likely most of these were obtained at the buying limit of 20 000 which means just to obtain the runes it would take around 53 000 times the buying limit to get them on a singular account now it's pretty clear by the size of this collection this player purchased large bulk quantities from other collectors and probably use multiple accounts what's even more impressive is just the pure value gpys of the collection just to buy these runes for the base price on the ge would be around three to four billion gp just in cash and that's not even including the premium this collection would probably draw just for being so massive okay next up here we have the tar collection and the arrows most of these are sporting a buying limit of only 7 000 now i'm particularly impressed with the arrow collection because not only do they have a very low buying limit relatively of 7000 they're also not all dirt cheap for example it looks like on the end is mithril arrows which uh currently are valued at around 20 gp each which means that is around two bill of mithral arrows which is crazy and then at the bottom here we have the miscellaneous items pretty much all rocking a 100 mil stack also in total we have a rough calculation for a couple different things now to obtain this collection on one account for example it would take roughly 250 000 times the buying limit or more which is around 45 000 days of purchasing items on the ground exchange or around 123 years it would take an entire lifetime or two to obtain this collection if you're just doing it on your own with one account obviously that's not the case but just for comparison and the total monetary value i've ballparked at around 13 to 15 bill just on paper obviously the collection would draw a lot more attention and a lot more value just because of the sheer size of it the time it would take to collect and the fact that it's nearly complete so a truly awesome collection and a great way to start us off now coming up next here is probably the kingpin of burnt item collecting now this collection is from a player named burnt tame and this is by far the biggest burnt collection i've ever seen and as far as burnt tame is aware the largest burnt item collection by volume in the game now just a quick recap on burnt items yes they are tradable so you can trade them between different players however they are not sellable on the grand exchange which means no buying limits involved however they are extremely rare and uncommon to come by as for the majority of players they are worthless either just dropping them on the ground or just taking up space in their bank forever but within the collecting community there is a bit of a fascination with items that can only be traded back and forth this is somewhat because the collections are viewed as a bit more prestigious and becomes more of a social community project because really the only way to get a big collection is by trading other players now in general the more common burnt items are the mid to high level food items for example lobsters and sharks are incredibly common now that comes down to the fact that usually at a certain level you will stop burning items so in burnt thames collection the most common ones are at the top left and the more rare ones are at the bottom in general the burned items that are the most rare are those that have the shortest period of time where you can burn them for example burnt shrimp are way more rare than burnt lobsters just because you can only burn them for the first 30 levels of your account or so after that it's physically impossible to make more now the burnt food collecting community is very tight-knit and one of the rarest things in that community is to have a green stack of any burnt food item now as far as they are aware there's only a total of six green stacks of burnt items burnt tame has three of them being the lobster the shark and the tuna and the other three are owned by other members of the community now burnt tamed collection in this image contains over 50 million burnt items and like i said as far as they're aware is the biggest collection by volume in the game now the value of a collection like this is incredibly subjective there's not exactly a street price of any of these collections or any of these individual burnt items it can vary a lot but suffice it to say to the right person this collection would be incredibly valuable now burnt thames collection goals are to get the very top row of this collection all a green snack the one he's going for next is burnt salmon which as far as they're aware again no other person in the game has a green stack of burnt salmon burnt tame would be the very first person to get that i guess it's kind of like the space race of burnt food collecting in a 2001 point-and-click video game pretty cool though and thanks a lot to burnt tame for the quick interview as well as showing off his extremely impressive collection okay so coming up next year we have another anonymous player and this is their collection while the entire thing is very impressive i want to focus on the bottom two items you know the comparison i made at the beginning that a hundred thousand christmas crackers a lot more rare than a hundred thousand pure essence well now let's go have a look at it this player does happen to in fact have a collection of a hundred thousand or maybe even more christmas crackers i'm pretty sure if this was rs3 this player could buy like 10 yachts but unfortunately it's old school but even though it's old school this collection is still incredibly expensive a hundred thousand christmas crackers would run you probably around a bill more or less and not only that they'd also be extremely slow to obtain they have a buying limit of 50 which granted is a bit higher than the party hat but still going to be very slow to get to get a hundred thousand party ads it would take around 2 000 times the buying limit or around roughly a year of buying time now the kebab is kind of interesting the buying limit is fairly high it's 6 000 yet the actual volume of kebabs that are traded every day kind of low theoretically you could buy up to around 36 000 of these every 24 hours that is not going to be the case most days because often times there are way less than thirty thousand traded on the grand exchange uh so technically on paper this is only around fourteen hundred times my limit but most likely it took way longer than that okay well speaking of party hats we have another discord user by name of sugar dad btw with one of the biggest party hat collections i've seen now party hats are notoriously slow to collect on the grand exchange because their buying limit is just so low for all of the individual party hats they have a bind limit of five which is one of the lowest in the entire game so having a collection of even a hundred thousand party ads is incredibly impressive slow to obtain and even expensive now this player has a hundred and fifty thousand more or less of white party hats red party hats yellow party hats and green party hats only one missing is the purple and around 82 000 of the blue party hat which is often twice as expensive in total this collection contains 690 000 party hats which together is around 138 000 times the buying limit which is around 23 000 days of buying time or 63 years if i put offers in for nearly 700 000 party ads on my main account i might not even be alive by the time those offers are completed not only is this a very time consuming collection the ge value of this collection is around two to three bill the price of party hats do vary a lot so it could be easily way more than that or even maybe less but still an absolutely crazy collection and finally here i'm gonna highlight a collection by a runescape user by the name of joachim who has a pretty insane collection now obviously multiple green stacks have a bunch of different items but specifically i want to highlight the top left two items that being the beer and the cup of tea now assuming that they bought these for a reasonable price of around 40 gp each that means just the beer in the cup of tea is worth around the bill between the two of them now the buying limits are not bad for these items but again these just really aren't that popular of an item and not many are traded every day so getting a collection of over 10 million of these two particular items is incredibly impressive anyway guys that is gonna be it for today's video i received a ton of submissions so i apologize if you submitted and i didn't get your image that's why i'm hoping to do another video in the future if if anyone out there has a really impressive collection they want to submit anonymously or named i'll be really interested in looking at it either submit it on my twitter account via email or just hop in my discord and pop it in the video submissions channel thanks again guys and i'll see you next time
