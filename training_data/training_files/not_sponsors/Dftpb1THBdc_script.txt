(intro music) [Ethan]: Welcome back, guys, to another episode of the H3 Podcast. This week, we got access to- ya boy, Felix AKA Pewdiepie. The biggest Youtuber in the world. He was in LA for a brief time, shooting the second season of "Scare Pewdiepie." And we were able to sit down with him for a couple hours before he left. So we weren't able to shoot it in this studio, because it wasn't done then- So please forgive the goofy quality. And before we jump in, make sure to hit up iTunes and Google Play Store. Smash that like, subscribe. Give us a review. That really helps us out. With that being said, Let's launch in... to the second episode of the H3 Podcast. [Ethan]: Here with- ya boy. [Felix]: Pewdiepie! [F]: That's all I was paid for. [E]: That's it. That's it. [F]: Alright. [F]: Well, it's been a pleasure. [E]: Thanks, man. Thanks for joining us. Appreciate it- Um- Felix, if you don't know... *mutters* you all know, but- let's just do a little fuckin'- [F]: C'mon, let's get real. You all know about me- [E]: Felix has- what? Closing in on fifty-million subscribers- By far the biggest Youtuber- [F]: Oh, that's right- It's comin'. It's probably happened already when this shit's up. [E]: Well, they- yeah. How close are you now? [F]: I don't know *laughs* [E]: I mean, you're close. I think you're, well- [F]: It's getting- it's getting, well-   [E]: The thing is, close for *you* is like- uh- [E]: Is like, relevant to another channel- is a lot. So, I think you're like 800,000 away. [F]: I think I'm-   [E]:  And to another channel, that's like, "Yeah, that'll take me a year." [E]: With Felix it's like- "Meh- I'll be there in three days." [F]: *laughs* [F]: I think a month. [E]: A month? [F]: Yeah [E]: That's pretty- uh- So, Felix is, by far, the biggest Youtuber. [E]: And- and possibly one of the most famous people in the world. I- I- I really-- [F]: I'm definitely-- [E]: I don't know if you're saying that-- [E]: No, I'm serious, like-   [F]: No! [E]: Like- "Pewdiepie" is a household name at this point. And- I'd put you up there on the fame level as, like, Bruce Willis. Almost. [F]: No. [E]: You don't put yourself up with Bruce Willis? Like, where would you put your fame level? In terms of, like-- A movie star? [F]: No fame level at all. [E]: You more of a Seth Rogen? Or maybe, like, a- [F]: Maybe more of like a- [E]: Peewee Herman?  [F]: *laughs* Now we're talking. [E]: Seth Rogen's pretty famous. [F]: Yeah, no. [F]: I think the, the difference is that-- You can go out on the street and people know- "Oh, I know Will Smith! Of course!" Everyone knows, but- Maybe in the Youtube community- or the online community-- Yeah, people know about me. But- not everyone is on the internet. [E]: You're so- Look how good and trained you are- You're looking at the lens, dude, the whole time. [F]: Oh, thank you-- Where? Am I supposed to look at you? Sorry, I just realised. [E]: No, look wherever you want! Look wherever you want, but- [F]: Anyway- [E]: For those of you guys that can't see, we have live mics under our shirts. And we're trying to avoid scratching. Usually we'll set this up with booms and stuff, but because it's on such short notice-- Felix is leaving in a couple days- [F]: No, I'm impressed by the professionalism. [F]: It's fine, I got this shirt for free. It's perfect.  [E]: Okay, good. [E]: Do you get everything for free? [F]: Oh yeah, big time. [E]: 'Cause last time I was over here-- You had a Pixel phone, and you're like, "Google just sent me a Pixel phone. I don't need this." [F]: Yeah. [E]: Does that happen a lot? [F]: I get way too much shit- Michael, you would know. We get so much fuckin' shit sent to us. [E]: What kind of st- Like, what kind of free shit do you get? [F]: Don't you guys get free shit? [E]: Like- we just- [F]: You got to get on that free shit, boy. [E]: We *just* started getting free shit. We're not Pewdiepie level. I'm not Seth Rogen, Bruce Willis level. [E]: Do you know what I'm sayin'? [F]: Okay. [E]: I got- We got from an advertiser- They sent us a phone-- And we were like- That was the first time we got something cool for free. [F]: I have so many fuckin' phones. [E]: And we're like-- [E]: "We need- to get more famous." [F]: Yeah.  [E]: "We need more free shit." [F]: Is that why I'm here? [E]: I- This all helps. This is all helps, dude. [F]: Well, we, uh- I love to throw shit away- Which is what I've learned through this Youtube experience. It makes me feel so good. To just take all these precious items- That I know- Michael- just- It gets destroyed- From me even going near a basket- and just shoving it down the- [E]: Like valuable shit- or we talkin' like- Oh, Michael's not a "yes, valuable shit-" [F]: It's not valuable shit. [E]: Are you afraid that he'll- [F]: To me because I don't fuckin' want it- [F]: And people keep sending-- Unsolicited packages is the- Worst. Fucking. Thing. [F]: It annoys the hell out of me. I have to go to the post office, thinking- "Oh, here's a package I ordered-" No, it's some shit. I got this fucking- I swear to God, I stood in line for, like, an hour- And I got a Youtube gaming patch. [E]: From who? Sounds like- [F]: From Youtube gaming!   [E]: It sounds like some Nazi shit! [E]: Like- like what? Are they going to send you a fucking Star of David? [F]: I don't know why they sent it to me without saying anything- like- Oh, great, no, I'm so glad. I literally waited- No offense, Youtube. I'm sorry, but seriously- [E]: Nah, fuck them, dude. You know what? [E]: I'm tired of their shit-- I'm tired of apologising to them.  [F]: Yeah, me too. [F]: I just went straight to the trash. Like, I went out- One- put it in the trash, and then I went- [E]: Oh... Is there anything that other Youtubers do that annoy you? [F]: Oh... That's, fuck- I wish you'd asked me that first, so I could think about it a little bit. Uh- Because there's so much- obviously. [E]: Yeah, I want the whole, uh, yeah. Let's start from the top, baby. [F]: Well, I don't know- What the fuck... Umm... I think the... What came to mind right ahead was, like, the double-sided-- two-faced-ness, I guess. A lot of people act one way online- and then offline- They're the worst fuckin' person you've ever had to interact with. [E]: You've had bad interactions with Youtubers who- like- [F]: Well, like- well, not bad, but it's kind of like-- They're so bad that they don't realise they're bad, so you kind of just laugh at them while they're bad. Does that make any sense? [E]: In a way. Is there- Can you be more specific? [F]: Um... Well, just like a Youtuber you used to look up to- And then-- 'Cause you watched them. I watch a lot of Youtubers myself. And then- you get in this position. "Hey, you're 'Pewdiepie.' You can meet all these other Youtubers." And then you meet them and you're like, "Jesus Christ-" [E]: Ray William Johnson. It's Ray William Johnson. [F]: Hah, damn it. I've actually never met Ray. [E]: I've never met Ray either. [F]: But- there are quite a few people that I've met and I'm like, "Holy shit, this person is a fucking asshole." [E]: You know what's interesting? Of all the Youtubers we've come and meet, everyone's been pretty nice. [F]: Yeah- No- Well, to be fair, like, I even met- Uh, what's his name- Yousef, or whatever and I'm, like, into it- [E]: Oh! Fouseytube! [F]: Fousey- yeah- I met him for like five minutes. I'm like, well, I have got nothing to say, really. But he's fuckin' cancer online. [E]: *laughing* Yeah, yeah. [F]: So, I guess it goes both ways, I dunno. [E]: I found out something juicy, speaking of Youtube beef. [F]: Ooh. [E]: KSI. Claimed- I learned- from you. [F]: We can talk about that. Yeah. [E]: Oh yeah, we're talking about that. [F]: The thing is I haven't talked to *him* about that. [E]: Okay, that's fine- He won't watch this. People aren't going to watch this. Nobody's going to watch this. [F]: Okay, so we're talking about the video where I... uh, it was "My Car" video-- It was making fun of, basically people that show off their car on Youtube. I think it was mainly focused on KSI, because we used one of his songs in the video. But- We were like- "Let's distort the fuck out of this song-" [E]: It wasn't like- Background music. It was a commentary parody. He distorted the fuck out of it, so it was just like- "Whum Whum Whum Whum." [F]: Exactly like that. [E]: So, and *then-* [E]: KSI Claimed your fucking video- Twenty-seven million views! [F]: That's a lot of money. [E]: Damn! [F]: That's like- [E]: That's a lot of money! [F]: Like 50 grand? At least? [E]: Yeah, at least 50- 60 grand. [F]: I need to get a new lambo for that. [E]: Yeah, he's buying a new car right now- on your fuckin' new car video. [F]: It's pretty, uh- I remember- So, basically-- The video did so well. We thought it was the worst-- Michael helped me film it. Brad as well. We thought it was the shittiest video when we filmed it. So, like- when it got claimed, I was like, "Well-" [E]: How fast did it take before it got claimed? [F]: Um, not even a day. [E]: So he got it all.  [F]: Yeah. [E]: Damn! Was it claim- Damn. *coughing* [F]: I didn't- Michael told you this, right? I didn't know that you knew about this. Fuckin' Michael, giving the inside- And the thing was that- Uh, I was on holiday during that time. And I saw it, and I'm like, "This fucking sucks." I think if I was home, I probably would've done something about it. But it was like- "Finally, we're on holiday-" [E]: Were you in Japan? [F]: No, we were just in Lisbon But- it was, like, not the time to focus about it, I think. It was kind of like, "Well, what the fuck do we do?" And then I come back, and it already has 10 million views-- And then it's like- "Well, I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna take it down." "It's still a funny video." I think that matters more than-- It sucks that- The other thing- I would like to give the benefit of the doubt, that it's not actually KSI, And that it's his network or whatever- [E]: He's with- (?) Maker (?) [F]: No, actually, not his network- His probably... his, um, music, um... [E]: Oh, his music label. [F]: Yeah. [E]: It's different. [F]: It's probably his music label that claimed it. [E]: But they manually came to claim it. [F]: Yeah, one hundred percent. There's no way the system would've discovered it, 'cause it was so distorted. [F]: You taught me how to- I can actually- 'cause I disputed the claim! [E]: Yeah, I was surprised that you didn't know that you could do that. [F]: No, wait- I disputed once, and then it got shut down- And then apparently, if you dispute it twice, which I didn't know about- [E]: Is there any update on that? [F]: No. [F]: But what will happen- that you told me- Is that either... They'll strike the video, which means that it'll get taken down. [E]: Juicy. [F]: Or it gets dropped. [E]: Yes, that's exactly. [F]: Let's see what's gonna happen- [E]: No, it's really exciting- So-- [E]: KSI, now has- [F]: Is this the kind of thing that's worth going to court to? [E]: Absolutely! But it's not, no. Only a- you need a special kind of psychopath to fucking get sued. [F]: You would know- You would know. [E]: KSI is not suing you over this, I promise. But essentially, but ball is in his court to either strike it- or release the claim. If he strikes it, first of all, you get to dispute it anyway- You'll get it back. But it's gonna be so juicy. That's some real Youtube beef- that I can't wait- I- I hope he strikes your video. [E]: I want him to. [F]: I kinda want him to. [F]: There's some people that- Is like you really wanna call out- On all their bullshit- But you haven't gotten far- You've only gotten tiny, little niblets, you know? 'Cause KSI's been acting like such a fuckin' bitch. Ever since I- I tweeted a joke to him- or something like that. [E]: Yeah, I remember something happened, uh, somewhat recently. Was it around the "My Car" video time? [F]: I think it was before. Yeah, it was before. There was some joke about Toby Turner, I don't remember what it was. But I think he took it really personally, 'cause I think he takes every little jab- [E]: Why would he take something about Toby personally? [F]: I dunno. [E]: Is it too close to home? [F]: I think it was a too funny of a tweet- That people really was like, "Well- Goteem." And he... just couldn't take it. [E]: What? He couldn't stand that you were so good at Twitter? [F]: I think so. Too good at Twitter.  [E]: And he took it personally. [E]: You drop some bomb tweets.  [F]: That was a bomb tweet, yeah. [E]: That was a fuckin' bomb ass tweet. So, he was butthurt that you were bomb tweeting? [F]: That's just my theory. 'Cause all I've gotten back is like- "Well, Pewdiepie's gay." There's, like, small jabs everywhere. [F]: I like how we're sitting in the same position- [E]: Um, yeah it seems like- [F]: And it's a couple people like that- that- Like also, Ricegum was gonna make this fuckin'... roast. [F]: "I'm gonna roast Pewdiepie."  [E]: Oh, he never made that--  [F]: Oh, because of our video, right? [F]: Did you know that? [E]: Wait, okay, so what happened was- Ricegum said he was gonna roast Felix for- liking a tweet? [E]: Was that it?  [F]: Yeah.  [E]: You liked a tweet- [F]: And because I made a- Do you remember when we- [E]: Oh, you just said his name. [F]: I think basically I just said his name. [E]: Yeah, you literally just said "Ricegum" and then he's like, "I have the opportunity to make a video about Pewdiepie now!" And now he's gonna be like, "I'm gonna roast H3 because he mentioned that- Felix made it-" Like, Ricegum's the kind of guy who would just fuckin'- He'll take onto anything. [F]: He's the- almost the epitome of Youtube drama. 'Cause it's like, now drama is the new way of collabing with people. [E]: Yeah, that's a funny, little... That's a really interesting way to look at it. [F]: So, he forces these collabs upon people that they don't want. Clearly, I don't want nothing to do with the guy. [E]: So, he promised to make a video about you, and it never came to fruition. What happened? [F]: I guess... He said he was gonna drop a diss track. [E]: With KSI. [F]: With KSI. [F]: *mumbles* And I guess it never happened. [E]: But you said because of your video? What video? [F]: Well, I think he used- Well, mainly, I liked a tweet. That was it, I liked a tweet. [E]: That's not much to go off. [F]: And to me, that was like the funniest shit ever- 'cause if, like, he drops a video about a liked tweet- Which he kind of already did-- You can't win from that. [E]: Well, I love the fact that- just his video *teasing* that he was going to make a video about you- got like 4 million views. He's like, "Oh, fuck, I don't even need to make the video anymore." [F]: No, exactly. What's the point? [E]: I just need to *talk* about making the video. [F]: It's crazy. [E]: What kind of drugs have you taken? [F]: All kinds of drugs. [E]: Have you tried- have you done acid? [F]: No. [E]: Have you done mushrooms? [F]: The only drug I have ever taken-- I can say 'cause it was like these New Zealand party pills. It's like- a- [E]: Molly, MDMA, Ecstacy?  [F]: It's like a vitamin-- [F]: No, stop. [E]: That's what you just said- Wait. You said "party pills-" What else could that be? [F]: Well, they're legal pills. [F]: They're like- [E]: "Party pills." [E]: Felix has never taken drugs- only "party pills" from New Zealand. [F]: Fuckin' hell, what is this podcast about? [E]: I dunno, you fuckin' said it! [F]: I was just honest, like- [E]: I want some party pills- Dude- I've tried everything. [F]: They were pretty good- I recommend the party pills. [E]: How did you feel? [F]: Just- great. [E]: Molly- You took MDNA- You took Ecstacy. I want some fuckin' party pills, dude. Where the party pills at? [F]: I- I'm like- "Drugs, don't..." but- [E]: So you don't smoke weed- You do drink. I've seen you- [F]: I like to drink-- Yeah, but I don't smoke or anything. [E]: I don't smoke weed at all. I *wish* I enjoyed weed as much as I see other people- [F]: Yeah- right? People love it so much- I'm like- What am I missing out on? [E]: Yeah, it's frustrating, because I see- It seems like-   [F]: The passion. [E]: The passion- the culture. [F]: It's like for you with vaping. [E]: Dude, vaping- is a real passion. But, sadly, it doesn't get me high. I guess it depends what you squirt on there. Maybe we could get some New Zealand party vape-juice. [F]: Yeah. [E]: That'd be dope. [F]: That'd be cool. [F]: Some- some party pill- [E]: Um- When I smoke, I just get r- I just feel really stupid and shitty and paranoid and I regret it, every single time. [F]: Don't talk. Just become, like- a- um... inside yourself. And I see that in a lot of people, too- [E]: It's bad. [F]: What's the good part about it? [E]: Yeah! and I don't- [E]: People, they say they like it, but I almost feel like people don't even like it. [F]: It's such a cultural thing now. To be like, "Yo, smoke weed." [E]: "I blaze." "You- aye you- Do you blaze, dawg?" "Y'all blaze or nah?" [E]: Is what people say- [F]: I mean, it's cool to do it, apparently, so- [E]: Yeah, it's- in California, it's- [F]: And it's legal now! [E]: Yeah, it's legal. [F]: That's weird. [E]: That is strange. You were here in California during some interesting times. [F]: Yes. [E]: Weed became legal. *Weed.* [F]: Yeah. [E]: And Trump became president. [F]: Yeah. [E]: How's that been for you? [F]: Devastating. [E]: Ha. [F]: Everyday. [E]: Everyday? [E]: You carry the hurt--   [F]: I mean, it's a struggle. [E]: It must be weird, though, for you. [F]: It was just funny-- [F]: --to see other people's reaction to it, 'cause I really don't care. [E]: That's fair enough, I mean. [F]: And pain, I got a preview of what that taste feels like with Brexit, when that happened-- 'Cause that really shocked me, when I heard the news that UK was going to leave the European Union. I was like, "This is fucked up." I feel like, "Who voted for this?"-- Older people. Um- So- For America to get that same taste-- To me it was just kind of funny. [E]: You were just- it was like- Schadenfreude- [F]: People took it so personally- like, oh- "My life is destroyed." "I feel so down." "This is a personal thing that affect me." "My life is bad now." It's like something bad happened to them. [E]: You must get recognised a lot. I mean, we get recognised fairly frequently. [F]: Yeah. [E]: Like, can- If you go walking down Venice Beach, [E]: Like, how mad is it for you?   [F]: It's not that bad, like, Venice Beach is a bunch of people- [E]: Or well, okay- Like- Disneyland- if you go to Disneyland. [F]: Disneyland, yeah, a hundred percent. [E]: Like, I saw you did a vlog there with Anthony from Smosh- [E]: Like a year ago? [F]: Yeah, well that year, we had actually, like- professional security there. [F]: So, they would clear out the area-   [E]: Oh, shit! [E]: You were Bruce Willis!   [F]: Oh yeah, I was. [E]: I'm trying to tell you!  [F]: Oh yeah, we got the Kim Kardashian treatment. [E]: When- okay- When Pewdiepie goes to Disneyland, they give him his own fuckin' security squad. And he's trying to tell me he's not Bruce Willis level? Seth Rogen doesn't get his own security guard. [E]: I guarantee you that.  [F]: Well, we were gonna go on Friday-- [F]: And I was going to invite you guys, and we could all go- but I'm working on Friday, so- [E]: Oh, that would've been fun.  [F]: You would've gotten a taste- [E]: I would've gotten that treatment, boy. Yeah. We- we are ways out. [F]: They cleared out the ride-- The best part of that is you get to see the little kids' faces when they're like- "No." [E]: *coughs* W-Wait. Wait. [E]: Wait, you're telling me- When you get your own security clearance, you go to the front of the rides and shit?    [F]: Yeah. [E]: Damn! That's some fuckin' celebrity treatment! And how many- What free shit did they give you? [F]: I mean, we can get whatever, I guess. I don't know what you mean. [E]: Did you even pay? They're just like-   [F]: No. [F]: Why would I use my own money? What the fuck?    [E]: Wait, are you serious? Did you not pay? [F]: No.  [E]: How did you set that up? [F]: Um, I mean- I got connections. [E]: "I'm Pewdiepie, motherfucker--" No- [E]: I'm serious--  [F]: Me and Bob-  [E]: Don't, don't- [E]: Don't walk around this. I wanna know how do you set up that. And what's their number? [F]: *laughs* I'm not gonna give that to you. [E]: But essentially you have- So you call someone at- You have, like, an agent or something. [F]: They have, like, a VIP thing for Disney. [E]: Damn-- And you don't even have to pay? They're just like... I mean- I find that funny, it's like- It's a weird thing that when you make- become wealthy, [E]: And you start making more money-- [F]: You don't have to pay anymore! [E]: You stop paying for shit! [F]: It's so weird! [F]: Like my phone I don't have to pay-   [E]: It's fucked up! [F]: Yeah, it's fucked up, literally- [E]: Like even at the bank-- Like here, they have, like, all these fees and shit, but they're like- "Once you have a certain amount in the bank--" [F]: You don't have to pay--  [E]: Yeah- "Hey! We don't charge you a thing." [E]: But I remember, I was poor- and the bank was, like, fucking me in the ass every week.  [F]: Yeah. [E]: And now- [E]: *And now?*  [F]: And now- * forced exhale*  [E]: Let me tell ya- [E]: They don't-  [F]: Well-  [E]: They just don't charge us. [F]: Yeah.  [E]: That's it.  [F]: That's good. [F]: It is kind of fucked up, though. I've thought about that. Once- once you hit a certain status, or whatever-- you get stuff for free. [E]: And then people just-   [F]: When you clearly could just pay, like plane-- [E]: Yeah! [F]: It's so easy for Casey, for example, to just- [F]: Get plane tickets for free or whatever. [E]: *sighs*  [F]: There are so many agencies that would just love to pay for that sort of stuff- [E]: What's- How many subs do I need? [F]: I think you're getting there, just- just a little- [E]: I just got my one free phone- *muffled* Fuck! I want to- Guys, please subscribe. I don't know- I need that fuckin' Disney all-access pass. [F]: You want to be there to have fun with your friends, not to- And it's also-- If you don't have security- It's the kind of thing where, like, I get really worried when me and Marzia travel-- We were in Malaysia recently. It's just us. And as soon as one person goes- and be like, "Hey, can I take a picture?" And you're like, "Yeah, that's fine." Another one comes in, and then another-- And all of the sudden, you have, like, this huge crowd, like, in front of you. And you're like, "How the fuck do I get out of here?" [E]: So even in Malaysia- [F]: Malaysia's fuckin' crazy! [E]: Damn!   [F]: That was insane! [F]: We were terrified. Literally, like, people were walking around, like, looking everywhere. [E]: It was almost like-- People don't even know you at that point. It's just a scene, and everyone just starts running over there. [F]: Yeah, pretty much. [E]: Damn. [E]: Who's more famous than Bruce Willis? I think we need to step it up- [F]: Right, like- No, I'm not- [E]: Tom Cruise? [E]: Who's the most famous actor in the world, Hila? [Hila]: Brad Pitt? Or- [F]: That's the thing where like- [E]: Okay, tone it down, you're not Leo. [F]: No, I'm definitely not-   [E]: But you're like Bruce Willis.  [F]: No, I'm not. [F]: The thing is like- [E]: I think the Bruce Willis is apt. [E]: You might be more famous than Bruce Willis! Because that guy hasn't been in a couple of movies in a while. [F]: That's true. Thank you for that. But people still know his name- That's the thing. [E]: Do you know who Bruce Willis is?  [Michael]: Mhm. [E]: Okay. [F]: Well, if Michael knows, then *everyone* will know. [E]: Do you know who David Hasselhoff is? [Michael]: *clicks mouth* Yeah. [E]: The Germans love David Hasselhoff, right? [F]: Of course he knows Hasselhoff. [All]: *laugh* [F]: I-It's very regional, I think. Like where I-- The city where I live, no one bothers me. But if I go to another part of the city, I can't fuckin' move. [E]: Interesting. [F]: So. [E]: We found that to be true. It really depends where you are. [F]: Mhm. [E]: Um- When I watched you there, I was really curious-- Because I was like, "How the fuck could he possibly be at Disneyland and live a normal life?" And that's like- Bill Murray. I'm like, "How does Bill Murray go to Disneyland?" I've always wondered that. [F]: He can't.  [E]: And because, like- I'm like, "Does he just stand in line with all these fuckin' people for an hour?" [E]: But, so, now I know. [F]: No, clearly they don't. [E]: Now I know- Yeah, clearly they don't. [F]: They told me they have a lot of, like, Arab princes that goes to Disneyland. [E]: Oh, like they have a big problem getting recognised- [F]: Yeah, it's weird right?  [E]: They- B- I wonder if they pay. [F]: What? [E]: I wonder if the Arab Princes pay. [F]: Well, I was told that they just like to point at stuff and be like, "I wanna buy that one." [F]: But they're like, "That's our ride- you can't-"   [E]: Like people? Like a person?   [F]: Yeah, exactly. [E]: Oh my God. *laughs* [F]: That's the level I'm going for. [F]: That's what I want- Just to point at shit-  [E]: You're getting there- You're getting there.  [F]: No, I'm- *laughs* [E]: You're so close to being able to point to people and just own them. [E]: I mean, you already did it to two editors.  [F]: Yeah I did, yeah. [E]: Next time you're in, dude, take me to Disneyland. I want that VIP treatment. [F]: I don't know if you guys like Disneyland or not. [E]: I like Disneyland- Who doesn't like Disneyland? What kind of monster do you think am? [E]: You think I'm some kind of fuckin' monster?  [Hila]: *incoherent* [F]: Oh really? [Hila]: *laughs*  [E]: Yeah, who doesn't like Disneyland? [F]: I know some people I guess. [E]: Hila hates it. [E]: Hila hates it. Hila hates the parks. [F]: You hate it? [F]: I would've guessed the opposite.  [Hila]: I know. [E]: Well, growing up- My- I had, like-- Like, a fun thing me and my family always did, 'cause we're from the LA area, was go to theme parks. [F]: Uh-huh. [E]: But, Hila, from Israel- They don't have shit like that. [E]: For- and in Israel, crowds like that- [H]: ... Service mall (?) [Hila]: So it's not--  [E]: It- It's shit. [F]: So, shouldn't you like these then(?)-- [E]: Well, in Israel, you go to a crowded place like that and you're like, "I'm gonna die." [Hila]: Yeah, you don't really-  [E]: Like- you avoid crowds in Israel because you're like-- "I'm gonna die." [F]: Why?  [E]: Just because- Terrorism. [Hila]: It's a potential for like a-  [F]: Really? [Hila]: ... Terror attack.   [E]: Because there's stabbings- There's bombings. [E]: Huge gatherings are a huge security risk there. [F]: You guys are real thugs. [E]: Yeah, yeah-- Well, Hila is a real street thug. I mean, I grew up in LA. I lived in Israel for five years- but Hila is from the streets. [F]: I would've guessed from the neck tattoo. [E]: She has a swastika on her neck. Which- Doesn't make any sense, but- it's hard. [E]: My other question is- You're almost to 50 million subscribers. Are you sub-botting? [F]: Probably someone must've tested it out on my channel. [E]: You think someone's sub-botting in your name? [F]: It wouldn't surprise me, no. [E]: How many subs- Um- Interesting. Pewdiepie's sub-botting. You heard it here. [E]: Get it out.  [F]: God damn it.   [E]: Get it out. [F]: Obviously, not personally-- but it wouldn't surprise me. [E]: Well, fans are weird.   [F]: If someone just- like, yeah- [F]: Yeah, exactly.  [E]: Like, one really weird fan is like, "I need Felix to hit 50 million." [F]: Yeah.  [E]: "And I'm going to spend a thousand dollars-" [F]: I'm sure that happens to plenty of huge channels, where, like, they just- [E]: Just one obsessive fan?  [F]: Yeah. [E]: Um. I also wonder- because you're like the face of Youtube in a way. [F]: No.  [E]: Like, you are like-  [F]: Not really. [E]: No, I feel like you are almost, like, con- tied to the identity that's Youtube. So, in a way, I wonder if Youtube is like-- They want you to hit that milestone, too. [F]: Oh yeah, big time. I thought about this, like, two years ago. It was so clear-- That- that they were really focusing on the top guys. I think it was very... It was a point where I was kind of like, "That's fucked up." [F]: But hey-   [E]: God bless. [E]: Seeya at Disneyland, suckers. [F]: *laughs* [E]: Well, how long ago was that? Because I remember-   [F]: I remember- [F]: Um... Like, um- I think when I had like, six million. I thought about, like, how far can you push this? It's clearly keep growing. [E]: At that point, were you the biggest channel? Or- [F]: Not yet.  [E]: Smosh was bigger.  [F]: Yeah, I think so. [F]: But it was clear that I was gonna pass them in like-- I think I was head-to-head with, like, HolaSoyGerman for a while. [E]: Who?  [F]: It's a Mexican- sorry, Spanish Youtuber.   [E]: Oh, okay. [F]: Mexican or Spanish? *tense breathing* [E]: They, uh- It's fine. It's interchangeable. Don't worry about it. [F]: We were head-to-head. And I realised, I only get one chance. If we're gonna go head-to-head. And uh- [E]: It was like an Eminem-8 Mile thing--   [F]: It was like- They want-  [E]: One chance, one spaghetti. [F]: They wanted my- spaghetti involved- 'Cause it was two spaghetti strings going right on top- But then- I somehow managed to-- Out- out do him. I don't know. [E]: 'Cause you went- I mean, you're at fifty million. That's, like, staggering. Like you're so far in first. I think the second person is still Smosh. With like twenty-two million or something? [F]: But the thing is what I really don't like about that is- 'cause clearly I dont get fifty million views per video. [F]: And it's- it's--  [E]: That would be nice.  [F]: That would be nice. [F]: I mean, I have twenty-seven on one- that's like- almost. Um- I mean, it's like that for everyone, I guess. They have, like, a percentage of views-- per video. [F]: But I used to always pride myself in having a good-  [E]: A good ratio [F]: That pretty good ratio-- But then everything just took off and it's like- [F]: I don't know.  [E]: But you still get the most views of, like, anyone. [E]: Except for, of course, Spiderman and Elsa.  [F]: I don't! That's the thing though. Like- [F]: Now it's like- What were you saying? The Elsa channel-- [E]: The weird kids st--  [F]: Like, yeah, exactly. [E]: But like of normal- like- "Hey, I'm a normal guy and not some weird pedophile ring-" And I think you get the most views. Of the non-pedophile-- [F]: That's a huge honour for me.  [E]: No, I mean- [E]: No, I mean- Yeah, yeah, it should be. It should be an honour. [F]: I mean, to be fair though, like- Collectively, I have, like, thirteen billion views or whatever-- [F]: That's what I like to think for myself at least. [E]: That's nice. *smacks lips hungrily* [F]: People are like, "Well, he only gets- blah blah blah." [E]: Them some views, boy- *clicks mouth* Ah! Nice! [F]: Yeah. One day, Ethan. [E]: I don't even have- We have like three-hundred fifty million. [F]: That's it?  [E]: Yeah- You get that in, like, one Pewdiepie compilation video. [E]: The best of Pewdiepie-   [F]: What the fuck am I doin' with you guys? [E]: I know- You're wasting your f-  [F]: That's it? That's fucking pathetic.  [E]: I was hoping you wouldn't realise. [F]: You don't even have a billion views?   [E]: No!   [F]: What the fuck? You're not Billion-views Club? [E]: No, man- What a fuckin'--  [F]: Michael, you told me these guys were legit. [Michael]: I thought-  [F]: Fuckin' signing up for this shitty podcast. [E]: So, you think like- I mean, obviously, people like your content. Um, I don't know who they are, but they're out there. [F]: Yeah, no idea either. [E]: But I think you- Do you think that Youtube's made, like, an effort to, like- just, promote you as the fa- 'Cause you are, in a way, the face of Youtube. [F]: You know what?  [E]: They wanna push that too- that limit. [F]: I don't think they have. I honestly don't think they have.  [E]: Interesting. [F]: I think their, um, fuckin' algorithm- Is based on- obviously- people with bigger numbers. They get to jump on top. That's just how it is. I never think they soloed in(?) like- "We need to make Pewdiepie the biggest channel." Absolutely not. I would not give them a single fucking shred of credit for that. [E]: That's giving them too much credit-- [F]: I really think so, 'cause, like-- [F]: Uh... If you look how... If you look on Youtube, and you look at, like, the top charts or like whatever- I'm never fuckin' on them. [E]: What- Wait- Wait- Wait- You mean like top gamers?   [F]: Yeah. [E]: Yeah, you are.  [F]: No, top gamers, but- like, if you go to the gaming- "Top Videos- Gaming." [E]: Oh.  [F]: Never, I'm never featured there. [E]: Oh, I see what you mean. [E]: Do you ever feel like your channel's going to fall off? [F]: No. [E]: Because I feel like- No, that's fair. [E]: Because I feel like-  [F]: As long as I'm dedicated like I am, and working on it-- [F]: I- I feel like I have my audience and they watch it. [E]: Yeah. [F]: I think-- It would've happened already, if it did. I think what Youtubers struggle with, and the channels that do fall off-- Is the ones that don't really change up their content enough. [F]: I think when--  [E]: Completely agree. [F]: Like, people that got popular because they're playing a certain game- Like, Call of Duty or whatever-- And then all of the sudden, Call of Duty is not popular anymore. [F]: And it's like- Well--  [E]: "I'm gonna keep playing Call of Duty."  [F]: Yeah. [E]: It's really interesting to hear you say that, because every Youtuber I've met- I think- And I speak for ourselves too when I say... It always feels like the end is right around the corner. [F]: Oh yeah, everyone thinks that. [E]: So, I was- It's interesting to hear you say that-- But you would know better than anyone. But I'm always thinking about- Why do certain channels die off? 'Cause it's so fascinating. But I think you pretty much got it right. [E]: You just can't become boring.  [F]: I used to feel like- "Aw, man- I have to-" [F]: Well, just like things that happen like this- All of a sudden your views are cut in half. And you're like- "What the fuck? This is my livelihood-" All of the sudden, like, it's halved. [E]: It feels horrible! [F]: It- yeah.  [E]: Not the money, just like- "Where did fans go?" [F]: Yeah, exactly- the viewers, everything you've worked for to build up together with your audience is, like- [F]: Is fucked up. And clearly, they're not watching the videos that you're working on getting out there as well, right?  [E]: Right. [F]: So it's frustrating as hell, yeah. But, I- So- I've always been worried like- Yeah, Youtube's just gonna cut the cord, all of a sudden. [E]: Right. [F]: They're not gonna- 'Cause they're always changing shit. Always. Can someone just stop Youtube from itself? [F]: That would be great. [E]: That's the dream. [E]: Um, Happy Wheels. Can we talk about Happy Wheels? [F]: Sure.  [E]: Nah, I don't know. [F]: Happy Wheels--  [E]: How many Happy Wheels-  [F]: Let me tell you. [F]: Happy Wheels is what got me fuckin' up there. [E]: Was it? [F]: That's, like, the time where I didn't even have to fucking try. I think that's why my content was so shit back in the day- 'cause people just flooded in. [E]: It was like a rush. [F]: Even though I kept making, yeah, the same fuckin' thing. I'm like- [F]: "Alright, let's play Happy Wheels for ten minutes." [E]: Well, you're smart in a way, because you found something that works, and you fuckin' slammed it out. [F]: Yeah.  [E]: Sometimes I feel like we need to do that more, Hila. [E]: Like, um- How many Happy Wheels videos did you make? [F]: Seventy-six.  [E]: Whoo! [F]: To be fair though--  [E]: Two a day? Was that two a day?  [F]: No, it wasn't. [F]: To be fair- [E]: That's like- that's like- two and a half months of straight Happy Wheels, dude. [E]: You're a Happy Wheels fuckin' master. [F]: Well, most people have, like, a hundred- or two hundred. Like- I think Jack and Markiplier have more than that. [F]: I'm not calling them out--  [E]: So, you're not as much of a Happy Wheels whore. [F]: I'm not- I'm just saying-- I'm definitely not that m- [E]: You fucked that p- You fucked the shit out of that... Happy Wheels, uh- [F]: I got a lot of shit for, like- "Oh, he shit out so many Happy Wheels episodes." Which, I- Yes, a hundred percent did. But not as many as everyone else- Thanks. [E]: Well, I don't criticise you for giving your fans what they want- They're watching it. [F]: Well, I think that was, like, why I made so many shitty videos back then And now- It reminded me a little bit about, uh, your favourite boy, Leafy. [E]: Who?-- That was like that weird- Anyway, yeah, Leafy, yeah. [F]: 'Cause I think he made some really shitty videos- But a lot of people watch them. And he just kinda- keeps it out. And eventually he gets called out for it. And I think it happens kind of similar to me, like- [F]: Couple years ago. And then you kind of have to-     [E]: But yours weren't toxic. [E]: That was the problem-- [F]: That's the thing though-  [E]: It's completely different. [F]: I will have to say that, I guess. [E]: Well, there's difference between, like- [F]: Calling other people out, yeah.  [E]: Yeah. [E]: But speaking of dying channels- Like, Leafy, after all this shit- He's still making the same content. And I think that's what- I mean, that's the decline of Leafy, I'm feeling. These commentary channels are so stale in a way. But they keep making it. [F]: I think there's always gonna be trends coming up. 'Cause it's fresh for a while. But if they don't change up what they're doing, then people will be like, "I get it." "I don't have to watch another one." I think Smosh is a good example. Because they kind of stayed the same throughout. They upped their quality- clearly, but it's like I- I... uh- I really like those guys. And I respect what they do, but I think why not many people watch anymore is 'cause they do the same thing- It's like- If I'm not watching a Smosh video, I don't think, like, I'm missing out on anything. [E]: That's a really- That's a really good point, I think. I think-  to be successful on Youtube and, like, stay relevant for, like, the long run-- You need to always be adapting. [F]: Uh-huh.  [E]: You have to be really fluid.  [F]: Yeah. [F]: Which has been hard for me as well, because, it's like-- People clearly see differences from what I do and they like comparisons and be like- "Well, you've changed and that's bad." [E]: Yeah. It's like, "Well, I'm a fuckin' person and I've been doing this for seven-" How many years? [F]: Six years.  [E]: Six years. It's like- [E]: And you're tw- You're thirty-five? How old are you? [F]: Thirty-six. [E]: Thirty-six. [E]: No, you're what? Twenty-seven?  [F]: Twenty-seven. [E]: So, when you're a twenty-two year old, twenty-one year old- [F]: Yeah. [F]: I think it was twenty one when I started, actually. [E]: I saw pictures of you, when you first started. And you look like such a fuckin' goofy-ass Swedish fuck. Like, you're so tanned and you got, like, the crazy hair and shit. [F]: *laughing*  [E]: You look like such a Swedish bro. [F]: Oh yeah. [F]: Big time.  [E]: It's hilarious, because it's like a completely different person. [F]: Yeah- Not really. [F]: Is it?  [E]: I mean- Visually.  [F]: Yeah. [F]: That's true.  [E]: Visually. [E]: What was with the- Was the tan real? [F]: Oh yeah, we used to have, like, tanning competitions. [E]: No- what does that mean? [F]: *laughing* [E]: No, what does that mean?  [F]: We took tanning very seriously during the summers in Sweden. [E]: I could tell- You were like a fucking-- You were in, like- blackface. [E]: Do you use sunscreen?  [F]: No, no- oil, you fucking- [E]: Oil! That ant- You were like, "I want more of this- I wanna glisten, boi!" [Hila]: We do that in Israel, too. [E]: Just put oil on?  [F]: Yeah? [E]: That's like- If you ask a dermotologist- "Should I put oil on my face?--" [E]: "Or sun screen?"   [F]: I don't know why that was so important to fuckin' tan back in the-- [Hila]: Yeah. [E]: Well, no, I remember when I was a kid too, I was always trying to get a tan. You just think- You have this perception of when you look at yourself-- And the way you see yourself- You're like, "I look great." [E]: But objectively you look ridiculous-  [F]: You look- yeah. [F]: You're right.  [E]: But it's just that-- Everyone has this little perception of when they look at themselves in the mirror- [E]: How they have to look a certain way. And how they might think they look great- just looks objectively ridiculous to the rest of the world. [F]: Are you saying my tan looked ridiculous?  [E]: Yeah. [F]: How fucking dare you talk about my tan like that? [E]: I wish I could show you guys-  [F]: You fucking asshole. [E]: Aw, man.  [F]: It was a great-- [E]: It was like a Jersey Shore shit.  [F]: You're more tan than I am! What the hell, man? [E]: What's the weirdest interaction you've ever had with a fan? [F]: There's, like, a lot of different ones, but nothing, like- [E]: Nothing stands out.  [F]: Nothing, like, too crazy- There's been, like- [F]: People who got tattoos on their hands and shit. [E]: Ooh- like a bro-fist on their--  [F]: Yeah. [F]: And--  [E]: You're like, "I'd love to meet you." [E]: "You're sane." [F]: Well, I was just like--  [E]: Oh, you met them? [F]: Yeah, I met them. And they had it here on there on their, like- there. And, I- She put up her hand. And I was like, "Oh, she wants a bro-fist." 'Cause I didn't think it was real- And then I bro-fist- and she was like, "Ow. Why the fuck did you do that?" And I was like, "What? What's the problem?" And she's like, "It's a real tattoo." And I'm like, "That's crazy." And she's like, "Yeah, I am." [E]: And you're like, "Seeya."  [F]: *laughs* [E]: That's pretty spooky. [E]: I mean it's--  [F]: I'm so indifferent about tattoos. It's just the most awkward fucking thing. [F]: I don't even want to talk about it.  [E]: You are a tattoo guy. You've got a lot of tattoos. [F]: Yeah- and people get *my* tattoos. [F]: And that's just so cringey to me.  [E]: Oh, it's very personal. [F]: Yeah. [E]: Wha- Do you design your own tattoos? [F]: No.  [E]: You just find-  [F]: I just like to find the artist, yeah. [E]: What do you like about tattoos? [F]: I like... Art. [F]: And to me- I'm not very good at it myself, so- To me, it's a way of tributing art that I really like. And it's overall, a really cool experience-- Finding artists, meeting up with them, getting the tattoo. The fact that it hurts really makes it, like, a- Different thing. When you're done with it, it feels really good. [E]: Interesting.  [F]: So- It's just a nice experience. [E]: I've always wondered if there's some thrill about like-- For people who do tattoos- because I'm like- I don't-- Like my mind, I don't understand it. Something about like- changing your body forever, in some way? [F]: Yeah, exactly, that's why I like it. A lot of people are like, "That's on your body forever." I'm like, "That's the fucking point." [E]: That's the point. You somehow get a kick from transforming your body in a way. [F]: I suppose, I dunno. I- to me- it's more about the artwork that I like. It's also, um-- I got this tattoo. I have a butt on my shoulder. Which, um, probably was a mistake- but- [E]: Can s- I mean- you got-  [F]: Right, I'll show you sometime-  [E]: Kinda hard to see it. [F]: Yeah. [E]: It's just a butt? [F]: Um, when I got that, I really admired the artist. I think he's a really cool guy. [E]: It's a really detailed butt.  [F]: Yeah. [F]: And, uh, it was very- It took a long time. Took six hours. [F]: It was very sweaty.  [E]: Very painful? [F]: It was very painful. I was trying to impress this guy, with, like - you know, like, "Oh, I'm not feeling the pain." He's asking me like, "How you feeling there?" And I'm like, "Alright." [Both]: *laughs*  [E]: You're like, "Fine." [F]: And then my arm got numb. [E]: Oh, shit.  [F]: And I kept touching his crotch. [E]: *laughs* You didn't know? [F]: *laughing too* Yeah, I didn't know. [E]: Oh my god. [F]: It was- I swear to God-- Getting this tattoo was the gayest experience of my life. [E]: Did he say anything to you? [F]: No, he just kept laughing--  [E]: He just invited you over afterwards? [F]: I think he would like that as well. [E]: Oh my God- You're just fondling a dude's balls for six hours-- [F]: The pain was like-- He was kind of similar to me. He kind of looked like me and all that. He had a girlfriend as well- [E]: So if you fucked him, it would be like masturbating? [F]: We basically just fucked each other, I think- was what happened. [E]: That sounds nice. [F]: That was definitely the gayest experience of my life.  [E]: And he drew a butt. [F]: And he did- drew-  [E]: Was it your- Yeah, interesting. [E]: That's a great story. You know, the one you told about the fan with the tattoo reminds me of my friend, Jontron. [F]: Your good friend, Jontron? The Youtuber? [F]: The big--  [E]: He, uh- [F]: Is he gonna be part of the podcast? [F]: Oh, I betcha. [E]: Well, I don't know- I'll have to check his view count. [E]: How many views does he have? We'll have to look- Hila, look into how many views Jon has. And we'll see if we can bring him on or not. [F]: I don't think he's good enough. [E]: Yeah, it's like--  [F]: Psh, does he have thirteen billion views? [E]: I don't think he has thirteen billion--  [F]: No, fuckin'- [E]: Um--  [F]: Delete your channel. [E]: There's a fan who tattooed his face on his arm. 
[F]: Well that's funny though. [E]: And he- It wasn't- It wasn't a funny thing.  [F]: Oh. *laughs* [E]: It was like a real tribute. And he- It freaked him the fuck out. [F]: It freaks me out too. [E]: And this guy kept, like- somehow, like, coming back into his life, through, like, people he knew. Trying to, like, meet up with him and shit. And it was like- Well, basically, I'm just looking forward to someone tattooing my face, is what I'm saying. [F]: I can see someone doing that for a good meme though. [E]: In my case it would be a bit of a meme.  [F]: Mhm. [E]: I'd like that- Anyone out there-- No, don't do that. [F]: I'll do that- Next one. [E]: Just my face?  [F]: Yeah. [E]: That'd be great, dude.  That'd be a good promotion. Maybe I'll be getting into Disneyland. "But, look, you don't know who I am-- but you definitely Pewdiepie-" "He's got a picture of my face on his arm. Can I get the security detail?" [F]: Yeah.  [E]: And be like, "No."  [F]: Mhm. [E]: One thing I wanted to ask you specifically-- 'Cause it's something that I've been aware of- Is that as our channel grew, Um, I always became, like- I have these mental barriers. Where I get, like- I become really aware of, like... What we're doing. And the fact that our channel is growing. And then you get- And then you psych yourself out. You're like, "Don't-- You have to keep being funny. You have to keep doing your thing." Like, I have these mental barriers. Like I get performance anxiety. [F]: No, I think I really struggled with that back- before, like a couple years ago. When I was literally just-- fuckin' yelling and I thought- Humour to me was just yelling offensive shit. I'm not a comedian. I'm not, like, necessarily a funny guy. But I think I kind of grew into it a little bit- Through making videos and practicing how to do it. The- Well actually, my earlier videos-- There's actually one video where I literally say- "Aw fuck, I'm not funny." [E]: And you get--  [F]: To myself. [E]: Did you keep it in?  [F]: I forgot to edit it out. [E]: Oh! That's funny.  [F]: But no one fuckin' noticed it. [E]: No way--  [F]: But I swear- It was like in 2011 or some shit. [E]: That's awesome. [F]: And then- People always reference my old videos, like-- "He's so natural. He-" I'm literally, like, trying my f- Like my eyes are about to explode, 'cause I'm like, "Think of something funny." [E]: Right. [E]: There's so many moments we edit out where I'm like- "I'm so- I, fuck- I hate myself." "I'm not funny." Like- just getting really frustrated. Of course we cut that out. [F]: Yeah. [E]: Um, that's great that you- [F]: It would be funny if you don't forget-- *laughs* [E]: Uh, we should do a Happy Wheels collab. [F]: I'm down. Yeah, let's do it. [E]: We've-- Well, I did a collab on your channel. It would be fun to have you on something of ours. [F]: And just play Happy Wheels? [E]: Yeah, just do a Happy Wheels collab.
 [F]: That's fuckin'- [E]: Just straight up. [E]: Just- you know? [F]: Yeah. [E]: You have more subs than Canada... Has people. [F]: Yeah. I think I passed then recently, right? 
[E]: Yeah. [E]: So suck it, Canada. [F]: You big, fat fuckin'-- what-  [E]: Get the fuck--  
[F]: Canada [E]: So do you think, like, if you made a video called, like- um- Like- "Assassinate your- Your-" "Your Governors." [F]: Yeah. Which I would definitely do. [E]: Yeah, if you made a video like, "Pewdiepie Revolution--" And you're like, "Everyone-- Plea-" "Go out and murder your government representatives-" There's a Pewdiepie army. [F]: If there was a- [E]: Do you think- How many deaths would result from that video? [F]: If it was a good meme out of it- I think definitely- many people would- [E]: It would be a spicy meme if a couple people did die. [F]: I think if it was straight up like, "Just kill-" [E]: No, not ironic. [F]: No, it'd have to be ironic, but then hoping that people would do it. You know what I mean? [E]: I see- No, you're thinking realistically about it. [F]: Oh yeah-- [E]: I'm saying if you actually made a video and said- [E]: "I want you to kill your-- Go down to the town hall and kill people there." That's it. No- no irony. Like, how many people- What's the death toll? [F]: Surely there must be some couple crazy fucking people-- [E]: Yeah, yeah.  [F]: You're right. I see what you're getting at now. [E]: That's the interesting thing. That's interesting. You actually have a Bro Army. Like- you can maybe overthrow a government. [F]: That's the idea. That's the plan, yeah. [E]: "At fifty million, I'm not deleting my channel, I-" [E]: "I'm deleting Poland."   [F]: Guys, Trump needs to die. [E]: And, Bro Army, everybody- invade Poland. [E]: So the last night I was over, we did a bit of a meme-- Where you took my phone and tweeted, "I shit naked." [F]: Oh yeah. [E]: That actually did very well for me. [F]: Yeah, you're welcome. [E]: That was a--  [F]: That's the hand of Pewdiepie right there. [E]: That actually ended up being a good tweet for me. Let me check. Okay, here it is. So it did sixteen thousand likes. Pretty good. [F]: Well done.   [E]: And then I tweeted from yours- [E]: Uh, that you fart on your hand and smell it. How did that one do for you? [F]: Not that great. [E]: Really? [F]: Mhm. [E]: That's strange to me, because I thought that was pretty- [F]: I almost deleted it for while.  [E]: Ooh. [F]: 'Cause it's so shit. I'm so glad didn't now- I- [E]: Why? It has thirty-two thousand likes. [E]: How is that shit?  [F]: Oh. [F]: Well--  [E]: Thirty-two thousand likes. How many likes do you need? [E]: How needy are you? [F]: I dunno, man. I dunno what to say. [E]: So I thought- [E]: Do you do that when you make a bad tweet? And then you erase it and regret? [E]: I do that sometimes.  [F]: Well, I do that all the time. [F]: I do it way too much.  [E]: I hate it. It's, like, embarra- I feel like, "What is wrong with you?" [F]: No, I--  [E]: That's what I think about myself. [F]: I just see it as trying jokes out and some of them don't work, I guess. [E]: It's like, "Don't be so vain." I'm like, "Ugh." Get sick of myself. [E]: Do you feel--  [F]: Well, we don't sub-bot. We're tweet-bot. [E]: I guess. That would be pretty cool if every tweet was just like- [F]: Yeah.  [E]: So I was thinking, like- [E]: Just in the spirit of wrapping this up and- 
[F]: We should tweet something. [E]: We should tweet from- Yeah. One more time.  
[F]: Yeah, that's cool. [E]: Nothing anti-s-- Like nothing racist or-- I mean, we know the limit. Don't write, like, "I hate black people." [E]: *laughs* I don't know- This is- [F]: Mine is not funny. I just realised it. [E]: I don't think- I don't think it's funny either, but it's like- [E]: *laughing more* [F]: Clearly it's the funniest thing. [E]: No, it's not!  [F]: You're giggling like a fuckin' school girl. [E]: It's so stupid. [E]: "I wish I would be more secure and delete less-" Oh, that's fucking- Oh my God. That's real. [F]: *laughs* [Hila]: Should read it out loud- [E]: "I wish I would be more secure and delete less of my tweets. Please retweet to raise my self-esteem." [E]: Wow.  [F]: Love you, Bro. [E]: That's, like, real. People are gonna be like--  
[F]: Papa bless. I got you. [E]: Damn. [E]: That's real. [F]: Oh- This tweet is so cringey. I would delete this one, dude. [E]: Did you see which one I wrote for you? [F]: Oh, you tweeted?  [E]: Yeah. [E]: It's really dumb-- But I think it's just- [F]: "Baby made a doo-dee." [E]: *laughing* Like what are people gonna think, right? [E]: Pretty- Pretty strange? [F]: I like how we're both trying to get some kind of psychological- fuckin' thing here. [E]: Ugh- this is embarrassing. Like yours is embarrassing. For me. [E]: *sighs* [E]: So, if I erase this, that'll be pretty ironic. [F]: *laughs* Yeah. [F]: You can't escape, Ethan. [E]: *groans*  [F]: The mind game just begun. [E]: And all that's left on yours is "Baby made a doo-dee." [F]: I think I won that one- Well- [E]: Yeah, you won that one. [F]: Thank you for letting me be on the show! [E]: You definitely- I would say you won that Twitter war. But hopefully, it will make sense when we post this video. Yeah. [E]: It's been a real joy, spending time with you and getting to know you out here. [F]: It's fun hanging out. It was a pleasure. [E]: I'm looking forward to the "Scare Pewdiepie," um- episode. [F]: I look forward to it too. [F]: That was a really fun shoot. 
 [E]: It's gonna be really interesting- [F]: You guys were definitely the weirdest guests that we ever had, out of all ten of them. [E]: You guys should definitely, when "Scare Pewdiepie" comes out, check it out. I'll probably tweet it out when it's- [F]: Finally get the Youtube Red? [E]: Yeah, I'll finally get Youtube Red for that. [E]: Cool.  [F]: Alright. Yes. [E]: God bless.  [F]: I don't-- [E]: Whoa! [E]: What was that? That was like the whitest we've- [E]: Why is that?  [F]: Not another one! [E]: Do you grab?  [F]: No, I don't. [F]: Because you grabbed-  [F]: What is this-- [F]: No, I didn't grab.  [E]: My hand was opening and you grabbed- [F]: This is Conan all over again. I'm getting PTSD. [E]: Oh! Is there a Conan thing? [F]: Conan went for a handshake- And then I was like- High five, 'cause who the fuck goes for a handshake during a gaming session? [F]: And it just goes like--  [E]: Ooh. I need to catch that! [F]: Yeah.  [Michael?]: *incoherent* ... Hug? [E]: Let's hug. [F]: You can't mess up a hug. That's why I like hugs. [F]: *laughs* [E]: Sorry, what was that? [E]: That's great. Great having you. Thank you for doing this. [E]: Appreciate ya.  [F]: Thanks for coming to my house. [E]: Yeah, yeah. Of course. Pewdiepie doesn't travel. [F]: Oh, no. They come to me.  [E]: Yeah.
