hey guys how you doing Joe here this is give me a pretty cool trap man I'm out in the middle of the wilderness right now I've been piling for two hours and I'm gonna meet up with a subscriber meet up with this guy avid outdoorsy guy Ethan who I ran into one time at canoecopia in Wisconsin we met each other there when I was giving a talk and he mentioned he wanted to get together for a trip so this is it he drove up they were supposed to have drove driven up we're supposed to meet each other here at 10:00 that's 9:57 right now like I said Ben paddled for a couple hours so we're really cool to meet him out here the middle of this wilderness and we're going to spend two nights camping together you give you his story how he found out about bushcraft and started it yeah it should be a great time we got some steaks for us to cook we're gonna try our hand at some fishing we just missed each other in woodland caribou earlier this year and he got skunked on the fishing so hoping I could pass whatever little knowledge I have onto him so we're just gonna hang out here on this little island the middle of a big lake and wait for this dude to show up hopefully does fancy seeing you here look at that fancy boat you want to pull up here for a minute all right you think you've gone camping before right you see you buddy fat man have you made it in it you've had a [ __ ] yeah you have a hard time finding it that's you bad thank you got it all Thanks so it looks like the weather is gonna be good pumped for that yeah we got a good food good fishing get some steaks yeah down what kind of boat you got here this is a swift prospector 14 setup in a pack boat it's it's really good for stability you could pack a ton of weight in it it's ideal for big fat guys like myself and long distance stripping you could you could probably do a month out of this thing it's it's a workhorse well you tell the people are you from there's not anything in any other like this so I'm stuck coming up to Canada for Lake we're on lake or lake Lake and we just did our first portage and it was not a joke at all there was a hill in the beginning where I just one little four times coming up through this Creek and we're gonna take a little break a little snack break after that not too much port housing and no campsites really until the end of the day gone [Music] we're on our lake we're gonna camp on tonight we've been paddling all day and there seems to be a campsite just to the left on your screen of that big rock you just saw right around right around er rod that flat rock there so we're gonna go check that out cuz we got steaks for dinner but we've got to find a lot of decent firewood beforehand and it is probably five o'clock 4:30 check check it's like you've done this before I don't know man and she's not looking promising from here Laura I'll take your word for it wow this is small very small man well not so far there has to be something so far nothing like hammock style no man no this is just to the pooper garbage on to the next one that's right man yeah I don't even know I guess there's one 10th spot there boy that ain't happening cain't it's pretty very pretty yeah little bonsai windswept red pine very group of seven ask ask even all right well on to the next one what what did you think I said everything Zen man no it's very group of seven esque looks to me like that little peninsula is where the next camp is all right well what what now we can't eat check check this bad boy out campsite you gotta love the glow from the Sun already look at that we'll have a pretty decent uh pretty decent sunset from here oh there's a bench dude I have a chair but still it's always nice but that bench - how about that back to some flat spots this is nice here nice a little narrow yeah the last days yeah stay away I do need a I still a sillily I ridiculously I stupidly brought a tarp for a shelter at this time I also did bring a bivy though and it's not really supposed to rain so I'm not too concerned about where I set up I could probably put my baby wherever if it rains drape my tarp over me like a blanket call it good well this is pretty nice though I color everywhere beautiful beautiful over here man yeah this is really really pretty alright well we're pretty settled on this spot then eh okay yeah so good spot I don't have much to do in the way of setting up for camp for myself so I think I want to get on firewood duty right off the hop I got a decent sized axe and a full sized book so as you can see where we are right now there's not going to be any firewood in this immediate area so that means you have to hike back up into the hills a little bit where the hardwood hardwood trees are it's some good firewood to get build up some coals so maybe a little snack you poo and then run up there pretty quick glue the picture is so awesome because this this son pinecones falling tripping me out it's slim pickins in here I mean I bought a couple pieces what it's not promising there's something here write down a little bit might be okay I'll grab that too yeah okay Jesus please get on the camera could get pretty decent on the wood front I'll leave my accent saw here my camera anyway but it's got a handful cold hand pulls soon why [Applause] that's the one man what's different Mountain whoa no it's a button it's got like three different brightness settings on it oh yeah really cool it's just enough light to see what you're doing yeah you use it yeah I never have to use a headlamp in my town yeah that is handy setup without the bug now just the footprint nice very nice oh yeah I'm about to gear bomb it up real quick here all right so this is uh yeah a substantial amount of wood a lot of that all of that it's hardwood actually so very cool food yet please [Laughter] well you're gonna look around for yeah cool beans bro cool beach beach I love that owl just say who Oh that owl who first all right before your time claim before mice huh you just hear the moisture coming over there it's probably hot from the listen here boy so this is my shelter set up I got my sleeping pad my Biffy and my sleeping bag which is actually a top coat which I've never used before just a top coat take it on back here where I'm gonna camp far away from this guy and yeah we'll see look at the top coat soul boat never used one before just got 'told was supposed to be put positive one somebody boated by it's a positive one tonight and this is good for negative six so I'm sure we fine boys is talking to see house over there this looks like a good spot right underneath this big pine tree looks perfect there's a nice flat ground soft bedding pine needles on the ground boat perfect thank guys you see me use this baby before just basic minimalist from REI my therm-a-rest NeoAir my trusty old pad worst part about camping - blowing that up [Laughter] it's real bad I go with my family out to blow up three of them you are in Killarney Park right now but the way we came in is a very northern Western access so there's a lot of cottage there was a lot of cottages and there's a boat traffic coming through by tomorrow we'll be out of that anyways that's what you hear in the background check this out feel how heavy that is freely right anything so I've got and and I took the compression straps off of that it was down probably to there and this is an topical from underground quilts the name I think they're older oh the state's smaller company over the Steve think Midwest pull in there we'll check this bad boy they asked me what colors I wanted everything I don't even know what this is cryptic or something what is that looks like my grandma's couch and then blaze orange on the inside then it's got a foot box right so your feet are are still somewhat in something they've got a snap here our two snaps one two two snaps there so you need to do them farther I think you can slide your suit pad right in here yeah I think it's right yeah so the idea for those who don't know the top cult is when you're laying in a sleeping bag you're compressing all that down anyway right underneath you so it doesn't really have any value as long as you have a decent zooming pad which I do there's an R value of five something that'll keep you warm on the bottom and this just just drapes over top of you and the plus side is you don't carry that extra weight and bulk up the bottom so that can't be so that soon so coal can be warmer if it more down / down I don't know if you ever slept in a mummy bag before but that is terrible it's it's warm super warm trying to roll on my sleeve and I'm like twisting the bag with me so - underground quilts in here and see how it goes you say that let's say your grandma's couch the old floral pattern all right go check on that fire make yourself useful that's good funny good funny time so I'll slip it into the swimming pad or sittin pad into it first before I put it in the bivvy normally I guess it wouldn't matter but it's gonna be kind of difficult once it's in the bivvy so you can see it's so I'm pretty good I don't have bungee Z but you can connect these pieces underneath your iPad too I imagine yeah so it doesn't slide around too much anyway we'll get this in the get this in the old baby little bit back baby Shaq be quiet over there good job with the fire yeah you're doing a job it's funny I'm glad that we can have banter alright that's that I hope that's warm enough hope it's warm enough I'll be sleeping in my down quote if not we shall see it's 800 fill down she's pretty good God drawstring around the neck to see you cinch it up that's one thing I'm used to is having on the mummy bags is having the hood getting right down into there but I do have a toque oh I'll show you my to actually show you my two foot I got it from the same guys so this can go anywhere I want now looks good to me home is made so here's my hat my hat that matches my matching hat it's a match what is it called some places in in the States call these toboggans a toboggan that's no set to sled well we got your toboggan on there I see anyway that's that's my well just gonna get behind you do the colors crazy it was like incredible you lost me at white sauce like the shrimp oh that sauce was like everybody like you have to have with the sauce I'm telling you it's life-changing and they were right I've wanted to go back ever since no I'm probably gonna fly down there this winter just to go there I wasn't a dum-dum tonight well that's to be determined but I brought a chair anyway regardless man this guy is just lighting up tomorrow we'll fish won't paddle so far tomorrow I have a chin look at me this the road to Mordor oh no y'all have to watch that Oh Oh buddy lookin juicy get your plate whiter than pleat Oh objects on grill are wider than they appear smells good show me your steak steak show me your steak it's not even the challenge just do it let's do it Thanks Oh buddy [Music] every time Martin on that one video do you see that Oh things like moving like completely raw [Music] [Music] they got beef in Indiana huh they do for sure but this is good stuff it's a Canadian beef yeah he don't got that mad cow action going on so Evan so so Erica better little what you what got you into canoe trip Lee in the first place ah so long time ago a respondent I subscribed to the student YouTube name Joe Radha I heard he's like the coolest he's okay he's averaging fish he used to be a lot better average at bass so oh gee I'm an OG subscribers are you know long time ago it's like 50,000 subscribers that probably seriously yeah harp set and I regret every minute of it subscribe this dude and I watched his trip of him in this guy named cow Burley kuda hula shutout burly outdoors there were no gunk when I wash this trip and there on this canoe trip and I never even knew what a canoe trip was really it I thought I had no idea I didn't know you could do like a multiple thing I knew right so yeah they're doing this multiple multi-day thing out of a canoe and I walk away and I'm like I need to do that that looks awesome and here we are what made you get onto that in the first place what made you get onto that video the first place I was looking I [Laughter] see originally found okay so I was looking up wilderness like survival stuff and I was like I'm gonna go out into the rocky mountains or do like seven days well their survival may try to see if I can do it make friends of Sam's class yeah hundred percent and I typed in wilderness survival tips and stuff a bush or I type in wilderness survival on YouTube and this thing called bushcraft popped up and I just cried I've never heard of bushcraft before I didn't know what the heck that was turns out I've been doing this thing my whole life and I've been doing this thing called bushcraft and I've been like making shelters and playing out in the woods I'm doing this of a whole life I you one of these the videos I'm the suggested was this guy named Joe Robert at bushcraft underneath it and I was like I don't know this is but I'll watch his video and I don't remember which one it was probably some stupid one they're all really bad and I watched it and I I subscribed why it was bad though I'm excited for bad for you hardest all right subscribe poor little Joe yeah and I've been here ever since well yeah and you know what in all honesty I get I'm not even joking so many comments or messages or DMS every day saying like we should go out and type stuff but it's like it's really hard for me because I don't know that the skill level or whatever the case may be the motive the motive I don't want to be out there with someone who doesn't know the deal so when we were I you know copia and I had watched Eric's videos okay sorry I watched a chiens video in the past and and I could I could understand the more he was doing and seeing how my influence I could see it right away but when I saw him out canoecopia and he said who he was and I recognized him right as soon as he said it I was like hell yeah man I'll go on a trip with you and I'm glad we did is a good spot and we're talking about future camps and stuff like that is a like-minded dude it's it's cool to me yeah all the same stuff yeah it's cool meet a guy like that who's into it who can do this stuff too so same sense and yeah a YAG we bust on each other and just know these things matter within a day old Eric over here but yeah I'm sure he'll be able to keep up one day with me but until then I'll take it slow I'll just take it slow can't be with him is the world laugh at love what are we doing now well the feeling's mutual and everything's very wet so it's a good really good time to die in two so it's true it's a little blinky but um so Joe made it super mistake he thought he was super awesome and would bring no tent I was the smart one and brought you one too one is the ones brain brain brain brought its intent is dry and Joe is far from that yeah I'm really really really really I have a damp sleep I do have a chair of this time you do have a chair that is one thing better get one thing going for him but you're right I totally agree I'm gonna fall over if we don't stop this film all right is it the time to sleep this time good night good night you two bees oh man all right well I'm in bed now I'm gonna put this camera away on my backpack because I have nowhere else to put it good night I'll see you guys in the morning wish me good luck stay warm and dry and have a good night's sleep see in the word I don't know if you can see them you can't this guy's just lit up with stars Elena my my baby it's 6:00 in the morning I had a really good sleep drenched from the do absolutely drenched but like it's just late you're in the Billy Stars pretty awesome this guy's literally lit up right now here papa bear snore over there this is the view from my bed Suns just about to come out nice sky there's tons of mist on the water bags absolutely traps time to do lots of moisture in the air anyways this is top coat worked out perfectly I stay completely warm even though everything's soaked the quilts soak too but a sink totally fine as I expected it was prior around 1 or 0 and this is a negative 6 so sheís so yeah I like it I don't know if it's like having a little bit more room because I'm not constrained in that mummy pig or if it was just the fact that I'm laying very flat I have a very flat oh I moved from my bivy sack mojo from under that tree just so I could get a glimpse of the star as well as laying here last night but anyway he's very flat lay so maybe that was part of the good sleep but I slept very well very very well it sees a little bit of a breeze starting to kick up the leaves are moving but other than that it's been a very very still night no no animals rolling by no no wind oh I saw a couple shooting stars which is crazy and then one thing that moved across the whole sky very like pretty quickly but not half as quick as a shooting star and didn't burn out or anything just went under my vision which is very strange it was high up there anyway I'm probably just gonna lay here why I'm just gonna lay here watch the sunrise it's one nice thing about just laying in a baby sack you put it wherever and yeah you have a good view complete view of the sky I'm fun this is a good trip already today we have two options I'll show you on the map what our options are today I don't think we're moving far well it's about that time
