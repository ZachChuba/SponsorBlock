Hey so the idea that the universe may be controlled or ruled by something other than matter so detectable luminous matter was first proposed by a guy called Fritz Zwicky he was an astronomer but also just a guy and in the early 1920s so really not that long ago at all Edwin Hubble had discovered that nebulae were actually distant galaxies and then a decade after that our old pal Fritz made it his mission to measure the overall mass of the Coma Cluster of galaxies he used a mathematical model called the virial theorem which you know I wouldn't have put each to their own but that allowed him to calculate the overall mass of the relative velocities of individual cluster galaxies and to riches amazement his calculation suggested that the cluster contains roughly 400 times more mass than what he expected based on the combined light of its stars Fritz called this ridiculous amount of unseen matter dark matter and you know new science being new science and not generally well understood by the masses no one really cared like they were just like yeah so but but by the 1950s new technology created new ways of detecting non luminous material so dark matter it was so God darn obvious that huge amounts of matter were too cool to glow in visible light but still radiates in infrared and radio wavelengths and a scientist began to learn about the visible and invisible structure of our galaxy and others the amount of missing mass fell substantially so finally finally finally the president the presence of dark matter was recognized in the 1970s after our girl Vera Rubin mapped the velocity of stars orbiting our galaxy the Milky Way and she measured the distribution of its mass she showed us a dense focus of that huge amounts of mass are distributed beyond the galaxies visible confines in an area now known as the Galactic halo but now of course maybe unless you're a flat earther it is widely accepted that dark matter constitutes around eighty four point five percent of the mass in the universe any ideas or hopes even that it might actually be normal matter in hard tech forms like rogue planets or black holes obviously hasn't been proven but it is now considered the dark matter is made up from weakly interacting massive particles or wimps science is cruel but the properties of these hypothetical subatomic particles or whims are still very much unknown they are not only dark and transparent but they also don't interact with normal matter or radiation except through gravity but but since the late 1990s it has become known that even dark matter is dwarfed by dark energy so this phenomenon is the force accelerating the expansion of the universe and of course like almost everything else in the world its nature is still unknown it has been spit bold that it may be a super important part of space-time itself or a fifth fundamental force known as quintessence so dark energy is thought to account for as 68.3% of all the energy in the universe while the energy of dark matter is taught to account for 26.8% so 95.1% in total and our normal matter only accounts for a baby amount at four point nine percent but going back quick to her old mate fritz he was a super cool guy he puts everyone in the world to shame and makes me feel like I should probably have like an extension crisis at any moment but he was born in Bulgaria and he moved out to the US in his 20s to work at Caltech and besides his work on Dark Matter he is also well known for his work on massive exploding stars himself and his friend Walter bade were the first to demonstrate the existence of neutron stars that are in between in size two white dwarfs and black holes and they coined the term supernova for the ginormous stellar explosions from which neutron stars are born and and and by showing that one class of supernovae always reached the same max brightness when they explode they also created a way of measuring the distance to far off galaxies independently of Hubble's law paving the way for the later discovery of dark energy so to recap everything quick the outer regions of galaxies rotate more quickly than their visible mass suggests that they should so this means that they must have additional hidden mass that would explain the rotation this additional mass is known as dark matter and accounts for 26.8% of all energy on the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate expansion is caused by dark energy which accounts for night me know which accounts for sixty eight point three percent of all energy and overall that means such as four point nine percent of the universe's energy is accounted for by visible matter and and and if this is subscription and that's it if you like this video give it a thumbs up if you'd like to see more hit subscribe a big thank you to my patrons on patreon and thank you for watching bye you
