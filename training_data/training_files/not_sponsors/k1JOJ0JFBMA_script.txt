can be no I would be I'm still gentle when it's off I like that was there before I started trying to get a close-up or scratches this was immaculate before you yeah right brand-new right let's take a look at your pride and joy joy over here Shh tip tip tip tip tip tip dang it I tried to push him in ready oh here oh it's kind of like voyeurism he said no one's supposed to see this that's really hard this fly is doing laps around me right now literally circles like a hula hoop around my body who loop by there's my first sign the lake we're headed to some nice cliffs and blue water it's clouding up like crazy right now cool the moss I'm getting nailed by mosquitoes in here more so than the rest of the trip there we go I stop and have some lunch here I think yeah okay I'm gonna head back for my canoe then it's lunch time before we get on to Mexican hat well with thanks for that back here with the canoe pals here if you didn't notice oh so remember what I was walking on this trail and I was like it's a hot sunny day it has really changed like complete cloud cover I see a little bit of blue in sky so we'll see what that brings we do have to go through that damn and that maybe they haven't get all the wet stuff it'll kind of be nice to do that on like a warmer day but yeah that's alright I'll blow off some of the snake yes beaver tank cool weird ankle cleanups at the wood yeah so this is a very buggy poor Tosh mosquito wise I'm gonna get on a little bit of bug spray so I can sit here and eat my lunch in peace other than Kyle I smell so bad to have really bothered me very much like to take my watch off of my sunglasses off when we using this bug spray cuz does kind of mess with plastic the second was a stinger I think this is the second time I've used bug spit on this trip so all in all not too shabby I did have snacks in a pouch higher up but those snacks have been consuming I'm sorry what are you doing for lunch you know you gotta nut butter I got nut butter which I'm getting smarter I squeeze it all into the end and work it and like yeah otherwise 90% of it gets lost in the package do it finally getting smarter I got tortilla I got nut butter and I've got some cranberry granola you just make a little Sammie I just like a granola peanut butter sandwich you can she go to mustard packets today boys and grow up yeah three raisins for dinner dessert dessert stored all right I got a little flat bread with some suspect meat just straights meat but well we're gonna eat it so tomorrow I'm gonna have to stop for a real lunch because I can't eat this again and it's like third day in a row I'll have some extra chili and oh I have that chicken stew that I wanted to eat for lunch that's what I'll do well we've reached the impassable Beaver Dam it doesn't look that bad I'm for saying this now at the beginning but it looks like man that weather has changed it looks like we just got a line our canoes in here and walk along the side I'm like just pretty pretty easygoing actually pretty really easygoing yeah okay no that's what we'll do all the way yonder yonder I say man that's changed it's breezy it's not even hot at all Suns gone okay it's getting soupy it's getting soupy we say Oh poopy soupy doopy yeah that's going this way just soup you straight up in the water or what nothing I'm just barely standing above the water what I'm like walking on the water just barely staying above it I'm gonna try and paddle alright second yeah [Music] [Music] okay what just keeps going oh wow I can't see the end cool love it so bog yet road alright gonna walk across that so we're gonna go Oh bogged down in semantics yep this is making the trailer [Music] who won't breathing the heavy one breathing heavy this is fine we've done much worse than this pulling up to it all full of piss and vinegar all high and mighty on ourselves nothing that's clean okay I think we're out of the worst part of it there's a lot of pulling and pulling and sweating and smelling that's the culprit in this whole mess mr. beaver beaver enough for the beaver club nibble nibble who is the real canoe trip now boys and girls I'm extremely excited about it I'm very glad we had to do this a little bit of strenuous work a lifetime of memory honestly I don't know if it continues to go that way or up to the left here I'm gonna follow this I don't see any boot prints or anything up until the left it might just be a simple pullover though instead of going around this I'm gonna actually go check it out over this Bank this little berm here cuz if I can just go up and over oh it opens up over there too actually let's see let's see there might be a boot print here what's that all about huh pass the point of caring now mud scooping it Oh Kyle there's the lake yeah I think I will then I'll pull it over in Portage excuse me myself right into the lake and if I can getting a bit soupy again oh man okay just get into there maybe I can paddle through that that's a big hole that's a big hole okay on the beaver trail beaver beaver yeah regardless it's it's all messed up it's all screwy this is the channel though that gets into the big lake oh and it's not burned it's not burned it's not burned yeah it's gonna we've come to the conclusion we believe it's going to storm some dirty old gnarly dark clouds rolling in and the sky is sorry the winds picking up big time so yeah we're a little stanky look at the boats through the mud and the boats everything I own is covered in blood all right gotta go gotta make some time okay this is the way oh that's so nice it's so nice to see priceless absolutely priceless from something that sucked it's so reminiscent of Ferncliff Creek algonquin trip the real OGIS will know that took six hours though the burst clip thing this only took half hour whoa and it's not a burn there's a beautiful lake beautifully so real talk I need this I've been feeling like I'm gonna slump lately a little bit depressed cuz the whole stuff that's been going on losing scope living up there not being able to take advantage of it after after moving my whole family up there and expecting that to be the life now and then I just I just couldn't take it anymore I had to take a chance and get out here and I am so so so so very happy I did I need this in my life big time I need it I told you guys that before I need this just for me to stay sane to appreciate what I have like honestly like I love being out here I absolutely love being out here I was actually bummed out at first I thought this trip was gonna be super easy and just paddle around from Lake to Lake slammin walleye it is that but it's also that is that that is a memory that is a lifelong memory I will never forget birch cliff Creek I'll never forget that trip with Kyle and this one it's starting to become that to the hardships that you go through matter the hardships are the best don't get me wrong I love slamming wall I'm taking Kyle's blood and fish I love it but that's needed a little bit of adversity is needed lessons life lessons 35 years old starting to learn some things you know stick with me I'm sorry if my videos have not been great lately I keep seeing comments saying that like I'm Joe moves north and then his videos suck or hits a million subscribers doesn't go camping anymore it's like runs his mouth doesn't know the full deal believe me I'd be camping this whole time I would have already been on multi and I have I keep tripping on three canoes or three camping trips already right it's just summer now a couple days ago just got him anyways if you feel that way I do apologize it's not been my intent since I'm doing what I can when I can and this is quite rejuvenating I have a procedure in Toronto next month and I don't know now whether or not I want to go do it we'll see see after this trip how I feel is the way I feel right now I want to go on another canoe trip when I get back I want to take tripper on his first real canoe trip right when I get back that's how I feel right now and that's what I keep saying to Kyle this past 38 four days hope you guys understand hope you guys are still with me I really do appreciate all my subscribers from from way back when - now Isaac's IPE guys excitement on us your last name of always watching always commenting super appreciative a Batman you guys make this possible all right campsite kimse time yeah you catch fish and you don't try to like canoe all day long Joe and Kyle are big happy look at this site look at this is like an Algonquin ask site like just flat space four days four days lots of tree cover look at this dank you got dank so Kyle caught a large walleye for real a nice really big one and I got a small one and he got a second one so we're gonna have three walleye to eat it's only two twenty to thirty we've got lots of time it has a storm run us yeah four o'clock dinner at nine o'clock dinner exactly nobody we can fish after there's some falls down there I'm pumped I come I'm very happy about this no there's good sized wall in this yeah yeah back on the walleye lakes an out of the burn which is bueno I literally just said that and now it's the rain is starting we can hear the pitter-patter of the raindrops we're gonna set this tarp up real quick we can have a fire hook up our food and stay dry best of all three worlds [Applause] good job big guy yeah yeah we're at Kyle boom what is that ten minutes yeah if that man I'm relaxed okay shoot some mud caked on it Kyle don't walk it in the water right now but I'm a little chilly so I'm gonna take mine off and wash them in the water by hand is mud cake oh wow do this alright and so I think it's a caddis fly larva or maybe a dragonfly larva it's a big one but yeah it's just the exoskeleton again whoo sighs that thing he's already come out no is he yeah he told he's hollow empty inside just like me all right well she's slippery one I don't really care about my pants too much they'll dry but I do want to wash my socks and my boots off oh yeah that's a little muddy that's a little brown brown brown brown oh so that's a little well before and after shot there for you folks at home what are you doing it's still stuck the beater stuck in it they were my dry shoes and I am content right now yes there's the temperature perfect yeah it's not hot bug situation is zero except for two million ants on if you look at the the ground it's moving with hands it's like it's trippy nice gentle breeze we have three walleye sitting we have three walleye we have flat ground flat we there's a bunch of spots for tents I mean there's super cherry honestly man this is going this trip is like I'm so glad we had to do that that muck slog like that just was a blast it was a blast it was fun it like solidified that this is a real canoe trip yes like like we're in the middle of nowhere we got flown in and we're still both like new we even had a really terrible portes yeah hard could it be right this is awesome honestly I feel like yeah I couldn't ask for anything else no you got really excited down by the water and I was really hoping there's like a six-pack there that was like the only thing any better of you know it's just uh exoskeleton yeah it's just a nexus guy another bug yeah it was good I got a fish hook stuck in my leg I did the biggest wall I have caught so far this trip great poor Tosh I got to rip a hook out of your leg yeah that's it that's a new one for us we've done other weird stuff together but that was a new one yeah we got the pike or what was it like it was a pike yet they slammed slammed his leg with the with the lure and it got stuck and he screams and I'm like I think it's in his pants I'm like calm it stop screaming and he's it's like he's like trying to like get the hook out and it's like in his leg I saw it I'm like grab the pliers and do it I think tries he's shaking like it it shook me up I know I tried to pull it instead of because you just pull up as I'm gonna do anything so I tried to pull like that's flat as I head first it was hard with the pant there you know well you couldn't do it so I was like so I think yanked out of harder and then as I gave out of you you can watch it on my GoPro got it GoPro yeah well go we can rewatch it right now I think I'm gonna ask you to send me some of that so that I could put that clip might get delino sent it to me anyways so yeah then you grabbed it and just went oh and you yanked on a poor lad - I knew I had to I didn't know I didn't want to go halfway and then be like yeah I should have just anyway so you ripped it and I let out a really loud scream visit in her I know I could feel that the barbed inside the laughs for sure yeah I mean there's a whole there's a whole and you can tell it's like a little red but it doesn't hurt really to touch anything anyway good day great day probably my favorite day to be honest yes we got up and we moved without talk I already said this but we don't even mention it to each other right like just get up go we were synced finally it was like just boo boo boo we synced up and we synched up there's like there's like a point where like you feel like there's too much gear and you're disorganized you don't know how it goes together but like three four days in you finally figure out like you I take the tent down put it back together we know all of this stuff you know what I mean and I think this is the last time Kyle went on a canoe trip was the Temagami trip where I almost got taken over by black flies yeah I had to actually carry my stuff on one put one or two poor Taj's saved my life I was like passed out on the poor Tosh couldn't even breathe I had such a bad infection from black fly anyway that was in what are we 27 16 15 16 to 3 years wow it's been a while but I've been going on them obviously but I haven't been on one a real one since maybe well the one Doug and I went on maybe last last fall was only three days so again we didn't get into the groove of things you get in and out in three days we're four days deep here I think it's exceed like Dave like three or four one of the two everything that clicks together and starts working Kevin Callan huh it says that he's like you have to go for longer though the average canoe trip used to be used to be like two weeks and now it's like overnight or two days yeah I mean you don't really fall into your sink getting that getting the swing of things getting harmony with nature until a day to day three day four you're saying very nice I'm excited to see what days five six seven and eight will bring this has gone by very quickly and at the same time it's gone dragged on like if you think about it as a whole it's like that but if you think about I don't know when we did the flying in seems like a million years ago right but even like or something earlier today seems like a long yes like when the barber was in my life yeah that seems like forever ago does the rain is picking up again we're getting lucky it sprinkled for a little bit Rowan I just like that we're camping and there's no like ten dead trees over topically yeah no doubt yeah so this lake where we are right now this island and this I don't know if that's a big Island but it promised there's no burn but for the rest of the lake we can see burn as far as we can look yeah so we'll see but I'm glad to be here very glad to be here I concur I give you a clothesline Joe thank you they're oppressive yeah all right no Alpine butterfly Jolin Jolin dude your face is so oh my sunscreen and beard slash dirt mix gone yeah let me see if I can dig it off oh yeah oh there comes out really good yeah Batman I get cake in there let's try to make this a little bit more safe you have it up here instead of on the ground and just notice that it doesn't really have barrier on this side we've decided and discovered that we prefer that the fish a little crispy yeah I think a little bit of brown borderline black on some of the edges little brown goes a long way well oh it's so good so good got my hands are a little battery oh man so there's falls on this lake water fall down sorry it's just down the lake so I think after I'm done eating I'm gonna clean up I'm gonna go down there what do you say let's do it all right there's obviously walleye in here and there would be a good chance of catching them at the bottom of the falls maybe maybe I'll drag we'll see well yeah I'm gonna eat this stuff up first for sure this won't want this super crispy kyle has caught the biggest walleye of the trip today lucky that's actually Red Devil yeah surprising hey huh Little Red Devil spoon that big is not one of the big honkers yep my rippling red fin let me down today only one little walleye guy it's almost 6:00 I don't think it matters if we come out a little bit early for for fishing tonight because there's no Sun Royal Oak fog cover anyway we'll see I guess I just caught a little walleye on my Deep Diver again right after I left the campsite that's pretty cool a second one that guy just little little wallet I'm Carlton trolling across to another Island or point to right now see and then I'm gonna zigzag back my way across the lake to these Falls we don't know if the Falls are on our side or the other side of the portage but it's only 3:25 and there's no gear so I'm doing it regardless Kyle said he doesn't want to but he's in his boat somewhere he's in his boat behind me near the camp I'm sure he'll come over if I do well my rain stuff with me just in case it starts to sprinkle again it's only been sprinkling and then the bag that the rain stuff is in I can use to cover my camera get another fish who knows what it'll be every single time I think I know what it'll be it'll be it's a different fish I keep saying walleye and pike and then Pike in the law boy we shall see what are you mr. fish this third fish in like ten minutes it's got to be a wall it's got to be a pike honey it's hard and of course it's a walleye because I say it's a pike every Dern time that's the biggest of all I've caught this trip hole okay bud and he's gone big ol walleye yeah yeah but I didn't land him and it's raining yeah that's the third fish since we left camp on the Deep Diver yes well deep dive it's raining [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] pretty shell and here they know that there'll be any good fishing on this side of one but I'm gonna go do the 325 meter poritosh just with my fishing pole my my lucky lure here I'm going to wet the lot more hay regardless if I don't get any fish I'm sure it will still be pretty and I can show you guys oh yeah its beauty it's already worth it sorry [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] she's so pretty [Applause] so this obviously all burned as well pretty recently it looks like Mexican hat all right I've come up to the other side here I'll rock Karen oh wow this is pretty this is pretty clear this all burned on that side you can tell yeah balls stirred over there I don't know the fifties at all either way no big deal I'm glad I came out it's like a long fall instead of a big waterfall so it's all real shallow in there no big deal very very pretty glad I came up a little sweaty Kyle went back he said he was tired so he didn't want to do the poor Tosh which is fine I'm happy to do it anyway I'm gonna head back now and control a long way the way back to the camp I'm tired myself and very warm does I have two pairs of pants on and two shirts okay go back smells so nice [Applause] we're change I can really smell my stitch this is it guys this is the night trying to get a fish on camera so I'm trying for this epic shot of me catching a fish with that cool sunset sky in the background and you saw the first one he got off and then the second one I just got on it took my time we set the camera up and push record I thought I didn't get it I got him in the boat and everything and then I didn't have any footage of it and when I turned the camera around to look at it it was all bloody so that's that's story of tonight for Joe but that's okay I'm going back to the camp I see tells me to fire excuse me it's a really nice night I'm super happy to have had one of these nights most nights here on this trip have been really nice with the exception of last night it was just whatever but tonight was amazing this is the exact kind of night of love so happy to have it a bunch of clouds now who knows what's gonna happen I got the oh the old rain fly on the tent tonight I've gone three nights without it with the second night morning I had to put it on there in a hurry but yeah I'm not chancing it tonight three straight stroke Joe straight stroke okay I hope the cameras on I hope the cameras on this time what do I have another walleye it's got to be a walleye oh just a little baby guy there's a little baby guys maybe it's been two minutes since I left shut the camera off there's still some pink sky come on oh my god they're all like a touch bigger can you guys hear that what do you think that is Carl we've not heard we've not heard anything like that the whole trip sounds like mosquitos but kind of you really go under like a power line mm-hmm yeah that kind of like buzz humming yeah yeah it's echoing in the entire Lake I just said this and his first time he was here in his video you said this place is so full of life and I feel like it's very correct to fish the bugs the bugs are just next-level but not bad next level and I know there's tons of big game here we haven't seen any because we're we're not very quiet boisterous we're a little boisterous right yeah between the singing and the kidding back-and-forth and all that I don't think we're gonna sneak up on anything but this place is pretty incredible the lake right now is it looks like a sheet of glass man this sound is deafening we've never seen never experienced this before not this sound no not this I have like had like spring peepers going to town but this is this is a different home the Windsor home all right folks in bed started raining again we were just just just done for the day day four was a great day probably my favorite day in two of my things now day five on the map seems like we don't have to do much so we might push it to the next lake we'll see what happens when we get there I'll see you guys in the morning
