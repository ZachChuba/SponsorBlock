hey guys welcome to episode 4 of the Soul Survival Series this episode starts with me trying to get enough scrap to research a few things as well as finding a new spot to build my new base just out at the moment over at the launch site I heard some shooting over here so I wanted to go check it out specifically from the Bradley though I didn't hear any guns or anything yeah we still need to build that bigger base I haven't actually looked up a base design yet so I need to do that I'm just procrastinating I'm gonna be honest I don't want to build this bigger base I don't feel like it turn off wait is someone really doing the puzzle over here the electrical fuse went out but uh oh ok someone flew on top or something there's a mini over here I kind of want to steal it you know oh shoot whoa I did not expect someone oh he just killed himself oh he might live nearby he might live up there actually let's see here oh you don't even have much but yeah I wanted to take this mini I don't really know where I would go with it to be honest I don't think it's really necessary to take oh I see a guy over there actually that guy seems like he's got a big boy gun no but he does oh he's got an ache oh my god oh my god he saw me he totally saw me [Music] oh now I thought he killed him I thought I killed him so many times there so I kept like edges I literally swept uh okay that just literally made me so happy I got to loot this guy where was he where was he I hope I don't get sniped from behind that's not him Oh buying this barrel I got him okay I'm about to get shot at actually [Music] I'm running I'm running so we have the 8x research we're about to research to this which is gonna be huge I'll be literally you need to do is get that to your 3 set up with a bigger base and then we're good oh my god that is so clutch Gigi's dude there we go 500 scrap to research no problem we'll do that soon I'm gonna take that and put it in there and we're gonna go back out the star wait a big video now let's get back into the video [Music] what's oh oh god you just said you watch our dude I am horrified that was a fully coffee canned up guy and I'm pretty sure he got sprayed by an aka and I don't know where that a key guy is now I'm so sketched out please don't be from up there there is a mini right there which makes me think someone might have gone now to kill him I literally don't know what to say there's no way that there's a downed guy there with no one around I need to look at him maybe they downed each other unless a gay guy killed him and dipped I don't see any of oh god oh god oh god I don't know where I don't know where it's suppressed dude it's suppressed now what okay this guy definitely has fun doing this like he wants to mess with people because he has not bothered to push or to shoot again oh my god dude where what he is literally shooting a suppressed okay you know what he's probably on a roof actually that makes a lot more sense because he would have moved positions to get a better angle on me a long time ago but it's pretty clear that he's most likely just on a roof shooting people with a suppressed a kay couldn't imagine doing that for a long period of time if this is the guy then I know exactly who I want to raid in the future we're gonna find out if he starts shooting a suppressed weapon or if he gets out and we kill him alright well you have fun roof camping for the next 12 hours I'm gonna go and actually do stuff I definitely know who I'm gonna raid later on if I ever get to that point alright it's the next day I actually just got out and grabbed a ton of wood with a salvaged axe well not a ton I only brought back like this much yeah I got some bad news there is somebody right outside that built exactly where I wanted to build that which is not very good for me he does seem like he could be a decent raid although there is only one person I really want to get rid of and it's the person that lives on that side of the hill over there oh yeah where I would build my bigger base instead of that area I don't know probably right here if it's even possible I do see a bag right there so it actually might be if I have like all of this over here I don't know where it cuts off here let's find out real quick alright so looks like this this is just perfect actually you can go pretty far in here anyway so I'm gonna wait out the nighttime while I do that I'm gonna look up a base design to go with and I'm gonna farm up everything we need to build it in the morning all right so I've got a base design up and it's from a guy named 2x raw we've used his base designs before if you guys want to go check out his tutorial on the base I'll leave a link in the description but it looks very easy to build and it also holds like the most amount of boxes I've ever seen so this should just work perfectly with me so for this we would actually need a ten thousand metal frags 12,000 wood and 20,000 stone and we only need like five thousand more stone but we definitely need to cook up some more metal and we definitely need some more wood wood will not be an issue we can get that easily later but as for the metal and stone we need to get to work we got to get some [Music] right we made it all right let's get out and get some more metal whoa no way this was there a day ago and the guy was active did he really get raided I was literally seeing in the last episode how crazy it is that someone builds a massive base like this I was literally saying you would never get raided and here he is rated I I am shocked dude who raided this guy yeah this TC was definitely not meant to be there I don't think he could even access that what you even had one what you even had this I've never what I could literally see everything there this was so cool I've literally never seen one of these in game he had everything for oil D this is crazy oh there's a guy on here there's literally a guy on here on oil rig that is so cool dude [Music] okay there's a guy right there I just son [Music] and he is dead all right I actually need that extra has he oh you only had a pezzi and a crossbow okay well so I think it's time we cook up the meat that we got in here because I am dying from hunger soon all right so everything we're gonna be using for this base design is gonna be right here so let's get all of our stone and metal in there [Music] I should have not won that yeah I'm gonna prep up everything we're gonna need and I'm gonna build a speaker base ASAP and let's get rid of this bag right here as we do this goodbye bag this is gonna be my territory now hopefully I don't get killed doing this also just like that the video again and it looks like there's a lot of stuff that need to be upgraded to you haiku also instead it'll just be upgraded to metal this feels really similar and pretty sure I've built this base design in the past or at least an outdated version of this this is definitely like an updated version of the space design remember I put a research table right here and some boxes there [Music] okay it looks like we're gonna be able to place down this two three right now I'm gonna place it right here excellence now everything should craft a lot quicker so if I remember correctly this is how you you add another bot wow that is so clean really really really okay so I'm pretty much done the interior hue this is kind of the way I wanted to be he actually did it a lot differently in his video the reason why I don't have boxes up here some stairs here with more boxes is due to the fact that I don't think we need any more loot room like look at all this loot room we have so much room for a while and worst case scenario if I need more room in the future I could just add boxes up here but for now it's just gonna be empty cuz I kind of want to add shotgun traps here I feel like that would be something and knowing to deal with if you were to rate this base oh hell he's almost down oh I'm not gonna be able to do anything about that anyway oh I I messed up I messed up I messed up big time I I messed up I can't build here we are too close to the launch site well it looks like our base is gonna be a little easier to raid after all I don't like that the exterior is metal either if I get raided I get ready to dude I think it would look a little ridiculous if we honeycomb the exterior only on one side specifically so I'm gonna upgrade the rest of this roof stuff to stone that went down over there and we'll call it that for the bases time unfortunately it's it's literally gonna be a pretty easy raid that's just how it's gonna be oh well anyways I'm gonna go back to the 2x2 I'll do some transfer runs later I just want to quickly recycle all the stuff that we don't need in the base to see if I have enough to quickly research that a K before moving on to the face mask which is an additional 500 scrapped I don't know if we'll be able to research it this app but if not we'll do it in the next one for sure all right so this is what we're bringing out to recycle that'll definitely be enough for the a K and then we'll be able to craft it actually will be able to craft two of them with an 8x and we'll be able to roam with that next episode so I'm pretty excited about that that's gonna be a lot of good PvP okay we made it right 341 scrap let's go [Music] there we go the a K has been researched we only need 300 more for the face massage really that is not that much I might actually end up crafting in a K and roaming with one real quick before I end up this episode it would be with the hazmat suit which isn't the safest thing ever but I don't know dude it would be some fun so yeah let's start transferring some stuff over right we're bringing the m249 d we better not die doing this we better not have to shoot it either because if somebody sees me or cues me around the space with this thing it'll be flattened by the time I get back on so I can make two of them but instead I'm gonna make one with an 8x since it's my only Aki we'll roll out with it with a suppressor I don't really want to die with my only a K and like almost my only weapon I only have a Tsar and well the m249 I'm definitely not going out with and a couple readies and like pythons for example so let's be sort of careful with it I'm gonna go ahead and do one or two Rome's real quick to get some scrap just so I can get enough to research the space mass before I get off I would love to get that research plus we do need some more components like suing Kitts road sign at a Kei bodies for sure since we only have one more so hopefully we'll get some of those in this next run it is about to be nighttime so we're gonna have to make this quick I'm just gonna go look for the green crate spots the free ones at least and that'll be it maybe some people as well someone's definitely here instead there's someone else though without a doubt there's a horse right there which means that there's somebody that's gonna mean man oh man oh wait he had an LR dude okay I did I thought that was a cross but like literally the entire time I thought that was a crossbow well I'm gonna put that in here where it belongs yeah it is about to be nighttime so I'm gonna continue these scrap runs in the morning I don't really want to go out with my only gear sets during the nights I may also do a little whoopty whoop I don't know why I said I might also do a circle around over to the water treatment to do the puzzle so in that case I'll have to bring over the cards for it but I think it would be a good idea for some easy scrap [Music] okay that guy that guy was just unlucky when is the naked I only took 1000 would because I actually do need would always guy right there oh okay sprays a little off I don't usually do this with a suppressor I'm gonna go ahead and remove it for now because it's just not that good for me oh he just died so that means he's coming right back out is he alright alright we're good I took all the good stuff oh yeah that area might just be my favorite area now dude I can't believe we got all of these pipes that is what we're gonna need in the future for rocket raiding or for the Bradley for the HV rockets that is so good kind of feel bad for that guy I wonder what he was doing with all that though probably a recycle run maybe I have no idea geez dude we made it I honestly cannot believe it well let's go ahead and put all this stuff away and go out to satellite dish for a recycle run but yeah I wonder if Bradley actually does drop any like raiding supplies I heard that it only drops like HV rockets but that's about it if you guys know let me know in the comments section I'll probably look it up anyways so oh okay he is dead see what that guy has [Music] yeah it's because it's the first it was my first a case I did what a loser you know debated also I don't have any more gear so I was desperate that's why I took it off because I got your gear set you know I need at least there's that right okay I don't know what else I should do for my voice we got a hurry because he's probably gonna come back all angry oh wow there was already some stuff in there and we got a bowl T yeah like totally didn't even see that that is another 8 X right there hell yeah man dude we are doing so good right now it's insane I love this oh wow this is gonna take a while ok well we got a hundred scrap dude what is happening ok I got to go with this yeah I understand his frustration against people who use suppressors with aks because I also dislike that but I do like using it when it's the only weapon that I have and like only gear set so I think that's a fair thing since from now on I'm basically gonna use the a K without a suppressor so yeah man I don't know why this guy likes a shotgun so much he had two of them ok let's put this here and let's research this and that is where this episode ends off I ended up taking a few minutes to research a couple of items and that was the end of that day I hope you guys are going to enjoy the episode thank you guys for watching and yeah peace [Music]
