hey guys it's Kaler welcome to the YouTube channel in today's video I'm gonna give you guys some quick tips for improving the UI and UX in your designs I have five tips for you guys today so let's go ahead and just dive right into it the first tip I have for you guys is make sure you're planning the hierarchy of your project having a hierarchy plan before you start designing is going to give you a good foundation to start your design it's going to give you that clarity to know exactly where you need to start and what screens and pages you need to create so it's going to promote a better user interface because you're gonna know what screen needs to take you where and so you can work on designing how that's going to happen it's also going to promote a better user experience because your app or product is gonna flow a lot better for so for my first tip if you're not already planning out the hierarchy of your product I would recommend you spend some time doing that either sketching it on paper mocking it up in Adobe XD or using a program like mill note just to get that visual hierarchy laid out before you start wire framing and developing screens speaking of milla note they are sponsoring today's video mill note is a link at the top of the description so now you might have planned a great hierarchy which promotes good user flow but if you have a terrible navigation and you don't let your users access it it's not going to matter so for tip number two make sure you have a good navigation it needs to be simple easy to use and you need to have access to it we've all been in the scenario where we select something on an app or a website and then we feel like we're stuck there and we're not really sure how to get back so something as small as including a back or a close icon on a screen can drastically improve a user experience so just making sure that your well-designed navigation has good functionality behind it and accessibility is a great thing to focus on users who are getting lost and confused and can't find what they want in the app or the product are probably not going to use it for very long so that is tip number 2 make sure you have a good accessible navigation tip number three is making sure that your text and dialogue in your products design is not confusing or unreadable as designers often we may not have complete control over what a client wants in a body of text but it is our job to at least advise them on what good practices they should do such as not jamming the same key word 15 times in a paragraph or displaying a book that's unreadable on a website for example it's just important to remember that text doesn't just need to look great it also needs to read great because that dialogue is part of the design as a whole so we want to make sure that the visual side of the text looks good yes but also the dialogue in the text is good as well so that's tip number three make sure you have clear dialogue in your design for tip number four make sure you're providing your users with feedback so adding little things into your design like a loading on a button or a hover effect on the desktop version can really make the user experience a positive one because you're giving them information based on their actions so there's nothing worse when you're on a website and you click Buy Now and you're sitting there and nothing is happening the page is just sitting there you don't see anything loading or changing and you're wondering do I click it again did it go through that I was internet that can cause confusion and panic and lead to a negative user experience so yet here's another one again by adding those little things like loading on buttons and hover effects can just really change the way that your design is perceived either positively or negatively so for tip number four make sure you're providing those users with that crucial feedback so for the fifth and final tip of this video to improve your UI and UX in your designs make sure you're doing user testing currently if you're doing no user testing try not to worry about getting it in the hands of the most optimal user test group right away some testing is better than no testing so you want to make sure that you tested it yourself by prototyping it in Adobe XD maybe and getting some of the kinks worked out and then sharing it with family members or friends to see what they think or you can go to some online communities like some design related discord servers I have my own down in the description there's a link for that and in places like that you can share your prototype and people will walk through them and give you their feedback but overall one of the best ways to improve the UI and UX of a design is get it in the hands of people see what they think and see how they respond to it and that way you can adjust from there to make the UI and UX a little bit better so with that said that is all five of the tips I have for you
