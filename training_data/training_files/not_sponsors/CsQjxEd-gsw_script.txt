[Music] hello human friends i am and welcome to my channel where i report on everything i've learned about your species today my research has led me spiraling down one particular rabbit hole driven by a single burning question okay who is code miko code miko is a just chatting streamer on twitch when in human form she refers to herself as the technician i am the technician for codemigo i know capcom miko i voice called migo i make komigo i do everything kumiko related miko on the other hand is the name of her 3d virtual avatar which she controls using a motion capture suit and face tracking technology hold up let me back up for a minute before streaming on twitch the technician had four years of experience doing research and development in live animation after which she started working on the miko character in january of 2020. she even crafted a backstory where miko is an npc who wants to be in a aaa game but can't due to a glitch in her system so she is left to wander through different game worlds she started streaming around april under the name miko glitch before switching over to code miko which was probably a good idea since searching for miko glitch today would have returned mixed results with this character um what miko is modeled in maya and textured in substance she then uses unreal engine to create all of the environments animations and interactions basically the whole thing is programmed to run like a game she purchased an xsense mvn motion capture suit for around five hundred dollars and that's with a 50 independent developer discount she uses the app live link face on her iphone to capture the facial tracking data and it feeds directly into unreal engine and she does this all by herself for the most part and yes she is a real female i am a girl now let's take a look at how all of this fits within the context of the whole v tuber and virtual influencer landscape early creators like ami yamato and kazuna ai kizuna i helped to popularize the idea of a virtual avatar this paved the way for more developers which brought in more content creators which inspired even more development and so on now with free v tuber software readily available coupled with minimal hardware and some design skills anyone can dive right into becoming a v tuber this past year alone we've seen an explosive growth in popularity within the western v tuber space from independent artists and creators bringing all different types and flavors of personalities to vr enthusiasts to massive v tuber talent agencies they've all helped to prove and legitimize the interest in both 2d and 3d virtual avatar content so much so in fact that it even enticed non-v tuber creators to give it a try why all of a sudden is it a problem about my looks we have done hundreds of streams virtual influencers on the other hand are created with such high quality cgi work that it blurs the line between reality and fiction their interactions with their audience is not as direct as that of v tubers since their purpose is more about selling a lifestyle and working directly with other influencers and brands so where does mikko fit into all of this well considering everything that she's developed i would say she's probably in a category of creators that doesn't even have a name yet and i'm not just talking about the 3d technology ai angel is another example of a creator who uses motion capture technology for her content but beyond the tech what really makes miko and the technician unique is her ability to tell a bigger story and i think this is where you really get to see code miko's strengths unlike v tubers who use anonymity to help their character and personality shine code miko's personality as a blend of two worlds literally [Music] in the virtual world mikko invites guests on for interviews from a bunch of credit cards that you're getting screwed on right there like a little baby bird in its nest that's so cute she can change into different outfits and skins and can summon props guys that sword prop was seven thousand dollars i don't know why they would that's what i'm saying okay see they're holding bodies all over the floor no that's your imagination she creates ways for her chat to interact directly with the stream like polls donation-related animations and even allows chat to modify miko herself she can create any type of world she wants using unreal engine so i have game functions like this and i can move around the world and one day she wants to build an rpg world complete with bosses and game animations samiko's virtual world is filled with unlimited possibilities which will creatively inspire in the real world the technician's content can be more down to earth personal and informative and he was super supportive of my flamigo stuff she might talk about her goals and ambitions i am a game dub at the end of the day and i would i'd rather people talk about like her interactivity and the actual stream then she's got balance or share development progress and ideas the amount of propulsion fart okay so the amount of propulsion that the fart will project will determine amount like the amount of bits basically if i i can call anyone in my real phone and her vr phone will actually call as well sometimes she might even call her real boyfriend during the stream tell chat that you're real i am a real boyfriend [Music] brandon what is this troll brandon these are all the different ways her content gives you an insight into who she is and more interestingly how she thinks like that whole dynamic is going to be an inverse kinematic thing like your mocap is an fk it's a four kinematic but that whole thing is an inverse kinematic and this is anyway it is this combination of both worlds the character the person the expertise the passion the humor that really defines code miko and seeing her rise in evolution gives us a glimpse into what the future of virtual content and live production can become where the streamer and the audience are brought closer than ever before much like the ami yamatos and kazuna eyes the code mikos of today will undoubtedly reshape the standard of the virtual entertainment space and inspire the next generation of creators [Music] you
