hey groupies welcome back to form of therapy this is the culture study i'm the channels video producer and your host you can call me pd sorry i'm like all over the place with my hands right now but I'm really excited because on today's culture study we are checking out the debut of weekly and the song called tag me parentheses at me Oh tag me Oh as in like at me oh okay i i i didn't know about the parentheses title before so i thought it meant like tag you're it but they're saying like tag me in the post okay interesting alright so the reason why i'm excited for this is because thanks to one of our patrons we have been following the weeklies pre-debut some of their stuff on our patreon formerly known as the play em girls we've checked out a lot of their collaborations with one the k we checked out this sick weekly dance video that you guys should definitely check out video this is tak me bi-weekly and this is your former therapy [Music] [Music] I'm here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh my god this course is unbelievable [Music] yo yo you hear that you hear that strumming you're that guitar oh I'm ready I'm ready [Music] crowd [Music] holy crap okay listen I have not been that I have not been that caught off guard by a debut like that in a long time because they in this in this debut they hit on so many different notes and concepts from different groups and put it into one I'm not going to say that this is my new favorite girl group because it's only a debut because at the end of the day I'm not saying it's a fluke but it could be a fluke you know why I'm saying that because this song is too good this song is too good and this is totally gonna depend on the company's management okay if the company can manage to curate their music to be like to continually be this good that is up to them okay that is up to them but right now I see like different elements like okay the parts that like I was like this reminds me of something it remind me of the shouting portions in rocket punches bouncing and so what this kind of like why I love this so much and if you guys have stuck around for a while you guys know that I wrote I like really much more feminine cutesy girl group music but I like it to be intense and I like the rhythm to be fast and I like to be very emotionally charged and singing from the heart and that has all of that here and I kind of see elements of different girl groups kind of all poured into one I see parts of from its 9 especially that chorus from its nine one of the key things about them was that their courses they had very very only driven courses that was one of their key things they have some of the energy and the synergy that I really really loved in Preston they again have that more modern shouting nature that you see in like itse or rocket punch they have that there and then they have while they don't touch on girl-crush concepts at least not in the sound or in the visuals you see it in the intensity of their dancing too that is incredibly well done this everything about this girl group right now is so full rounded I'm suspicious I'm scared I'm not saying that they're gonna do badly but like can they keep it up if they can keep it up this girl group could quite possibly become one of my favorite girl groups quite easily the girl who did the rapping in the I would say mid end portion that threw me off because watching the pre-debut stuff she was my favorite vocalist I thought she has a very interesting vocal prowess to her and I think someone said that she's the rookie which kind of doesn't make sense to me I'm like how are you the rookie I mean the youngest not not rookie I'm among that but wow this was incredible and I think I think I don't know how best to describe this but they have a snappiness there's a snappiness a synergy energy that only in my in my that I have personally felt I have only seen that in seventeen and in Preston this kind of snappy energy now weekly and let me let me just see let me just see how this video did so far this came out June 29th so it came out two days ago this it is 5.9 million views okay I genuinely III think those views are warranted very very well but I'm gonna call it if they are managed right and more specifically if they can keep this musical style like I said because this style right now has everything if they can keep this up I genuinely think this group will become a name I'm not saying like a household name or an s-class group we don't know a lot of that has to do with timing and whatnot and sometimes a viral nature but this group will not be this group will definitely not be like a under-appreciated or a new glue type of group this will be a group that will be popular if they can keep this up because right now I think they're incredible I think this is one of the best things one of the best debuts I've ever seen from a girl group probably possibly even boy groups of all time I think the song is incredible I'm blown away I'm so shocked right now I want to listen to it again we're gonna listen to it again there's really I'm not really even gonna dive deeper into this because there's nothing really crazy about the music video honestly it's just a standard box standard kpop music video so it's like it's well-made but like nothing about it like wow me what wow me was then this group so let's check it out not from here that's so catchy [Music] [Music] second tour [Music] [Music] this chorus oh my god [Music] [Music] [Music] this rap break should sound incredibly unnatural because it's such a huge break what I love is [Music] [Music] the girl with the backwards hat her eyes are crazy she's got like super piercing eyes I will say one thing that definitely makes groups popular is if a lot of your members look vastly different from each other and they have a lot of members that stand out I'm not talking visuals I'm not talking about being pretty or any of that I'm talking about sometimes a reason people - now for boy groups or girl groups is when everybody looks so similar so many of these girls look so vastly different they have very strong primary features it's very good for group like it has nothing to do with whether you think they're pretty whether you think they're cute it doesn't matter doesn't your your opinion unlike your personal feeling about them doesn't matter whether you like them or not they all look different that's the keeping [Music] and these girls can dance Oh  oh sorry I'm cursing so much oh my god this is amazing is amazing okay tag me bi-weekly gets my seal of approval ten out of ten ten out of ten song incredible incredible incredible I think honestly the only thing that's missing for me is like a really really well-made interesting music video you know it's a well shot music video like I said but like doesn't stand out to me it doesn't punch me in the face you know if they can have a little bit more of like an innovative a little bit more of an interesting music video I think that would seal the deal all right ten out of ten and tag me by weekly but guys what did you think let me know in the comments down
