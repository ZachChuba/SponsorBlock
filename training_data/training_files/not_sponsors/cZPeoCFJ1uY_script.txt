[Music] I don't know how loud this crickets are but it's gonna make things all could be fair really loud welcome to my grandma's garden I'm currently in Singapore I wasn't gonna vlog because I wanted to spend time with family but irresponsibly I took on way too much work this trip would not recommend but the jobs that were coming through for us were so fun and also things that I really wanted to do so I have to say yes this is gonna be a little bit of a personal journey for both of us because I feel like I need to figure out how to work while I'm on family holidays I'm let's see if I can work at my grandma's house I just want squarespace.com slash for a little peach anyway let's get into the vlog we have so much [Music] if these are the concepts that I'm sending up to the client I still have to do one more concept sketch for the main lockup but these are for the three wrapping papers the campaign is gift happy and I wanted to focus on the holidays and what we do for leisure so I've got just some fun happy eats shapes I'll show you an Adobe sketch actually so we've got a coral design because that the beach is a big part of Australian culture for a lot of people especially in the holidays when it's summertime and then we've got like an expanded version of what that could look like I wanted to do something with the sky because the three colors a yellow blue and red but I decided the blue look didn't look very nice so I made it like a nice yellow which is kind of strange but I actually quite liked it so it'll just be like a number of flying things mostly air balloons planes talking about travel just the freedom of flight as well as quite as quite a nice few and then we've got the pox this is like a leisurely place and I obviously really love drawing trees and stuff and I love that palette - now I can present the main lock of ideas because I had to work the other way around where instead of rolling doing the main acid and then rolling out the the wrapping paper designs I do the wrapping paper first I figure out the concept and then do the other designs because these elements will be turned into a decal is it cuz they sorta Barangaroo stuff so cool but how will I do it in time 28 yeah I really want to do it though so if I have to fly back earlier I will could we get an estimate of the square meters maybe if it's one of those jobs where I'm just like the painting slave I don't want to do it but we just have to remember that the baby mat job is the 5th of December good just finishing up like so all events over is the wrapping paper concepts but that is gonna inform like the lockup anyway so yeah I'll get it to you in 20 minutes yeah see ya Lola all the family copies of zoom my entire suitcase was just my books it was embarrassing these ladies saw Mira packing my bag and they were like can we see that it was so cute hey do my other like the finest massage in the way yes don't you know we signed up for no and they've gotten pregnant with me do you regret it I don't you Tommy stop telling me that don't be that so often Nana wants aren't you juice and Nana will get orange juice I got it I got it now let me come by your arches [Music] close together so pretty [Music] mama bear thing you like it son good job team good job takes three people to order and already from a vending machine I'll give you the background as well as you can get understanding okay so here's what it's kind of gonna look like on the front of a catalogue this is the hero image that will be on the catalog and on windows at Barangaroo I sent this off last night and then look what the client has come back with a few changes and I need to get those done because it's already 107 [Music] so let's see what the feedback is so I need to create another version one with a circle in the background so that it can be used and seen easily in the window decals and one without and they also want me to add a green color into the design this now needs to go onto Photoshop I can change the color of the circle and adjust those coral color [Music] Wow [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] now I'm gonna go see my friend Ming who someone that I met a few years ago Ming ex on Instagram I'll leave his link below he's an awesome illustrator we get along really well so we're gonna go on a little bike ride through the Chinese gardens that I'm heading back to my grandma's house and preparation for like a birthday celebration thing that's happening tomorrow it's like coinciding around my birthday but really it's just a bunch of family friends and family coming I'm gonna eat food so that's gonna be a lot of fun but for today and I love our friend I'm gonna spend all my money at our friend so we'll see how it goes see you soon [Music] [Music] [Music] I guess I see you somewhere welcome I mean thank you so much I hope you like that studio blog I just want to say Squarespace you're the best move let's see I asked you guys on Twitter if you had any questions me for the end of the vlog if you want to ask a question in the future for another vlog please use this hashtag did you have any doubts or challenges on the way of being an artist I think I've been pretty fortunate I don't know if that's just like having a positive outlook or being naive or whatever but I feel like I'm in general had a really really positive and fortunate experience when it comes to pursuing what I love to do like a lot of support for my family if you believe in yourself and if other people believe in you I think it's a lot easier to be able to risk going into a career that may not be as stable I recently wrote an article for word form about regret it's not often that I open up about the more turbulent parts of being a freelancer and also just being myself I don't think what I spoke about really applies to everyone but it's just the struggles that I go through on like a daily basis in terms of like my mind I'll leave a link in the description to that article you don't have to read it I mean it's not it's more would like an opinion piece rather than like and this is how do you not regret things so the answer is I definitely have but I can't recognize them because even if something goes wrong it always leads to something better that's what you have to hold out for when something does go wrong you have to know that all of your mistakes linked to the best parts of your career what do you feel about fairness is it a good way to learn or is it better to create more original works fair nah I'm a bit iffy ominous in general I don't think that you should be copying anyone's work I mean it's copyrighted material so selling it is a big big big no-no on the other hand it depends what you're bringing to the table so are you putting a different spin on things if you're just copying it then I feel like that's the big no-no I've seen a lot of citizens Instagram accounts that release much I'm just like what are you doing that's totally against the law hello like big companies often don't sue small artists for it but it's just not good it's not it's ethically not good as a creative to do that having said that like someone like Scott C lava I think the way he does fan on and they're really really stylish it takes you a second to be like oh my god I know that I think that's okay but it's really really subjective I just think you need to be really careful when you're dealing with copyrighted material do you feel that your troubles influence or inform your artwork how so I definitely think so I'm very inspired by the world around me Australian landscape while beautiful the plants up close and the animals up close to kind of awkward looking so early on in my career I do more like Pacific Northwest and animals are Canadian animals bears deer blah blah blah who are all still really like prominent in my work another thing that really is by anyone the stationery I know that's really strange but for example in Japan when I go into a station should I get so many ideas and things that I can make while I'm not copying exactly what I see it's more the format of the medium like letter sets journals sketchbooks being able to see what what's possible I think really helps you be more creative with how you can apply your work to things what's an organization you'd love to work with / a social issue you'd like to tackle with your art I think in terms of the work that I can create for a WWF would be a obvious choice I love the campaign's that they come up with and I love painting animals so that would be really really fun in terms of more Lots in line with my values made me some someone like Amnesty International because they deal with human rights globally and I think that's a big issue and on a smaller scale I used to volunteer at this place called Sydney's story Factory as I can illustrate up initially I was a tutor but then they realize I didn't know anything so they so they let me do all the kids book covers and find the books and stuff like that so that was really fun basically they teach kids how to read how to write literacy is like the doorway into self-initiated learning so if you're not great at school you can still learn you can still be really really clever because you can teach yourself about the things you're interested in how do you deal with difficult clients clients who do not pay in time and do not follow the one revision rule you have to be really strict with that kind of stuff because otherwise you're not going to make a living you're going to be spending tens more hours working on something that you are not you are not obligated to do so by doing that not only you're helping yourself but your health in the entire industry I would suggest writing it all out first if it's an email that's that's great but I would suggest making a little contract I think if you google creative conscience you'll be able to find something that you can use as a template Ronnie's going to want to get as much they possibly can for the money that they're paying in any situation but you just need to be strong and be like this is what it is if you want another change this is how much it's gonna cost and you can even go as far as being like because I'll spend this amount of hours on it it's this much you know what I mean how did you feel about stranger things - I really appreciate stranger thing for aesthetic elements like calibrating I really left the costing I think it is very hard up although I'm having said that I haven't seen the second season instead let's talk about spider-man homecoming because I thought that was freaking awesome I've only seen on the plaintiff only seen on a tiny screen but I just really liked the structure of the film and I really really liked the comedy and it's very my kind of comedy like stuff that I really find funny yeah I just think let's talk about that I don't know what else I want to say just I just want to say that I really like this is your nationality of Juji girl for in Australia nationality I'm Australian so yes I grew up in Australia was born and raised here if you're asking what ethnicity and my mom Singaporean and my dad's Americans so they met here and had me here have you have been discriminated on in the media because of your race being a non-white person I find it hard for people to think of me as a person not that Asian PS I love you I love you too that sucks um I haven't I've had very little racist experiences in my life of course a Western culture is racist for most Western cultures are but I keep I don't know if people just don't see me as that Asian because I'm half why I think when you're more culturally ambiguous people have a hard time being racist towards you because they don't know what they want to say oh they don't know why they don't like you but having said that I've never had any bad experiences any clients any media I've not been in the media that much anyway like no one's I've been no one's ever said anything about my my race I'm sorry to get that that's your experience that really sucks like that's not fair and it's not right your culture does give you value doesn't take it away I think now especially that there are more non-white people in the media and on TV and all that stuff I think it makes it's making people realize that everyone is a human and your culture doesn't affect you negatively like if anything it makes you a richer person and more to person so yeah but just sucks that's your experience I hate that and I'm sorry I don't have any better advice for you because I haven't experienced it I think you just need to surround yourself with people that don't see that and that don't see you as that stereotype do you not I mean they see you because you're valuable and you're skilled and you're talented and you create awesome work so yeah I'm really sorry that that's your experience have you ever seen snow yesterday was the first real snowfall here in Montreal Oh jealous it's so hot here and I prefer cold weather I have seen snow I've been a few times I've actually been to Canada in December that was cold it was like minus 25 I've never been so cold it was like painful we could only be out at the car for like five minutes and then we were like up in the car I'd kill for some snow I rather maybe go Susan my fringe after this do you feel sad just hardened a little angry when your sketches paintings don't work out and you've wasted paper so for me here's my work right it's like an iceberg so at the top is the actual finished piece and then behind it is all this process and all these sketches I think you need to go through the stages of problem-solving when it comes to failed sketches because then you know in the final piece how to perfectly convey what's in your head onto paper of course it's frustrating if you just can't get it and if you're unhappy with the final piece but I think I've never really disappointed I feel like I've spent a lot of time practicing drawing and my skills in conveying like form and line that find it quite easy to just start a new drawing if I'm not happy with it wasting paper is not does not really cross my mind when it comes to sketchy because to me it like it means to an end make your final product a lot better if you're worried about wedding paper and have a spare whatever to blow you could always go feel like the digital route I found that well the walk up tablet for me is really really good for final artwork I find that the eye Pro is really really good in terms of replacing sketching it's really quick it's really light it's really portable so it's like paper in that sense but you're not wasting it you are using electricity though so I mean it's you're always gonna be like ruining the plant in some way si todos live longer than us humans how how can we have shorter life span I don't know why we have a showed a life span probably because they just eat grass and they're really bigger than they're protected by that show and they're really cute and yeah I don't know the reason you'll have to go on a David Arbor binge which to me is like not a punishment at all it's like how I will rot I'd rather spend my time doing that okay I think that's enough I really hope you like the studio I was a little bit different because I wasn't in the studio there was very little physical artwork it was more digital just because of the fact that I needed to create final artwork while I was away hope you enjoyed it anyway let me know how boy you want to and I'll see you soon
