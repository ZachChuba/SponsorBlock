hey guys it's phoenix yeah you saw the title i ended up making every single block in minecraft act like water for a couple days i thought this was impossible then something clicked and it worked please subscribe for dangerous and reckless minecraft concepts like this one [Music] now you'll notice that in this world that i just spawned in the water is invisible and actually causes a really nice effect although i don't need to make water invisible it does enhance the visual element of this concept i'm going to grab this grass block and i'm going to place it down right here and i have modeled it to be water so now you can see the water flows right down and this is water i can swim inside it and then if i want to get rid of it i'll just do that so it looks so weird but so oddly satisfying now i'm going to put it on the corner here and you can see it's going to model the the path of the water through here and right down this hill and stop right there now you can see the water's actually turned the grass into dirt because that's what it does uh this is not re-textured water you would have seen at the start that water is actually invisible right now but i haven't retextured anything lava is still here that's going to be lava lava will be lava if i wanted to place uh water here with a stone block i'll just do that and the water flows down because it's attracted to weirs and it's gonna fall down that way and it stops right at the end now it's really hard to see here because it's stone on stone let's change the block whoops no no no don't oh no also i've made sponge act like water though if you don't want it to act like water just stand far back and just do that just don't go near the block when you place it that will work but if you do that you'll make sponge act like water too and now you can see the sponge blow down like water which is completely ironic uh it doesn't make any sense at all whoa okay so this what's happened here is the two blocks have merged into one it's kind of become really random so now we have sponge stone water right here oh what have i done oh no let's do this okay here we go so now the diamonds have merged with the sponge which has merged with the stone over here and now we've got stones diamond sponge water i don't know oh let's do um coal ore let's put it over here oh my god it is taking a bit of time but um still managing okay so let's um let's delete all of this you can see the leveling here and the like articulation of the blocks it does mimic water as well as i could make it and i think we still have some water here hang on there we go okay that's much better it's all gone now some of the more notable ones that i featured in this concept include birch logs so if i place virtual like here you can see the birch log follows the laws of water leaves they are transparent we clean that up you can see that slowly disappears like that what else got oak logs let's place that here okay fantastic this just looks so odd um like that and the oak logs slowly disappear like that let's go underground you know how they always say don't mind diamonds near lava or make sure it's safe well now you can place diamonds on lava to neutralize it and it becomes obsidian so um let's do that now i've got obsidian on that and uh you can also place obsidian near lava to make the lava obsidian that's another thing that it's really dark now got a village here let's just um let's place some bedrock water in their village it goes into like two separate places because you've got a ledge here a ledge here but the good thing is this bedrock is something that you can swim in look at that i'm swimming in the current of bedrock water and if we break that up that slowly disappears like so and over here too as with oh hey so here's something you can make an infinite water source of emeralds oh come on let's go here there we go this is it he's so excited now it may as well be emeralds so i can uh do that and um obviously grab continuously yeah now it's updated now it looks like it's just emerald blocks but it's actually water you can suicide it the villagers are going to be super excited to see this i'm going to leave that there for them and let's go away there's one more thing that i can do but i can't because i just can't do it you can do the uh the mlg water bucket thingy can i do it no i can't i just can't but you can totally do that just go plop and then jump inside uh with survival mode it's water so why not all right goodbye this is actually a very complicated concept that i didn't think was ever gonna work but it does so i'm gonna place stone here and you can see it's actually modeling the path or the physics of water so it's got seven blocks out and now if i look from here you can see the seam lines where it disconnects and that's because these are block models that i had to make for every single block yeah i had to do all of that and also model water so if i wanted to place a block over here you can see it's actually kind of weird because as water falls down it does disconnect a lot but i had to consider every angle possible and sometimes i'm going to miss it with inconsistencies like this and as you can see it does have that weird side effect of mixing like that so if you have two different blocks like that you now have a half diamond half stone water block place that over here and it does the same thing if you mix two sources of water they will mix in real life and i don't even know if that's something in minecraft but that is what happens real life right here and now i've got sand grass diamond stone and it continues to grow this is unbelievable let's add one more some dark block contrast we've got obsidian and now we have obsidian grass diamond sandstone sandstone that's from up top but i can swim in this so i will create a pool of water hang on so as i said the water is still invisible but i'm going to fill it with diamond ore like this and immediately it fills up and um this is going to be a source water block so i can actually delete this one here and now i've got diamond or water i will begin to swim in diamonds as they say there we go i'm swimming in diamonds you can't see you can't see me i'm just bobbing up and down the diamonds so i can swim inside i am currently not breathing and this is what it looks like from underneath and this is diamond water and let's fill it in with stone now i've got stone diamond so this is exactly what i'm trying to demonstrate this is still random wow this is completely unintentional this this behavior here but i can cause it to go in different directions i forgot to do this one just placing lava over it that becomes stone i think yeah that's stone now so this is an actual stone block but if i delete it it fills back in so as you would have seen from what i've been typing in this is understands hooray i'm using arma stands to model the physics of water but why is the water invisible if i turn the water back on you will see the water again like so there we go but if i do something like this now with the water there the water appears underneath the block and that is only because the model there are some limitations where i can't perfectly angle it to cover up all the water so that's why i turn it off you can see over here we've got four corners of a water block that's trying to peek through but it's only been blocked by the model covering it but i can't cover the whole thing and the reason why i'm avoiding water is because this is gonna get really laggy and i think i need to pause this yeah that begins to lag like crazy so now we've gone up to 2000 nearly 2000 iron stands we'll make the water disappear again i can show you that it just continues to follow all the water so if you really want to download this i will give it to you but uh just be aware that there are some crazy problems associated with this so mod makers be my guest you can work this all out thank you all for watching this has been a uh a deep dive into my brain i didn't think this was possible but it is worth all the effort i hope to generate this concept and effect to make all blocks act like water you can swim in diamonds whatever you want thank you all for watching leave a like subscribe for more creative content take care [Music] you
