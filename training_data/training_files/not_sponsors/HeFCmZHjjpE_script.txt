what's up Greg I hope you're all having a great day welcome back to my channel this of course is another episode of Denny gorebyss all's you guys know I love shitty low-budget movies and especially animated ones because I feel like animation is so ridiculously hard to do well it requires so many people to do well and so many talented people to do it well that when you tried a half acid it will always come out just awful such was the case when we reviewed that b-movie ripoff Plan B which was terrifying but it turns out that the world of animated movie ripoffs is bigger than I thought and a lot of people have requested that I cover more of them which brings us to today's movie ratatouille if you couldn't tell by the title rat tattooing is a ripoff of the movie ratatouille ratatouille is a very good critically acclaimed movie made by Disney in 2007 rat-tat toing is a very bad movie probably made by one dude in his basement also in 2007 the marvelous city land of Sun and heat with one of the most beautiful urban skylines in the world this is a prosperous City that's where our story takes place in the heart of this city in a very famous and sophisticated restaurant the beginning narration is kind of weird it might be I think that this might have been translated from Spanish so maybe something was lost in translation but I feel like they're trying to hide something with this narration like they don't say what city it is and they're not saying the name of the restaurant everything's very vague ah the marvelous city land of he a hot heat it's how it's hot in the city and Sun cuz they see the Sun they can see the Sun from this city I don't know why they don't just say the name of the city it's clearly Rio as you can tell by the giant Jesus statue unless this is a different city with a giant Jesus statue on a mountain it seems that everyone even from distant places wants to come to this restaurant just to taste the famous recipes served there at rocket towing so the restaurant is called rat a towing so the movies called ratatouille but why is the restaurant called ratatouille you may be wondering chef Marcel towing prepares the most delicious and exotic dishes always using special secret ingredients yes sir the main characters name is Marcel toing and he's a rat so he named his restaurant rat a towing that would be like a Papa John's instead of being called Papa John's was called like human John's come on down to human John's pizza we serve human food for humans we swear it's for you it's meant for humans so in this introductory scene it spends like a really long time establishing how much everyone likes the restaurant it shows all these different couples and families at their tables talking about how much they like the food there's this old couple talking to the waitress about how good the food is [Music] did you have any doubts sir there's no doubt about that here their food is always guaranteed to be delicious it's so nice of you to say so I'll tell Marcel he loves complement hope you will tell him by the way I would consider it an honor to meet the great chef Marcel won't you please ask him to stop by of course I certainly will now relax and just enjoy your dinner I love how she tells them to relax like they're getting way too worked up about the food look dude it's great that you're enjoying the food but seriously you need to calm the [ __ ] down all right it's just food don't you agree Oscar yes Maria leach a just divine indeed this restaurant is very good Maria lije you were absolutely right okay we can't get too far into this movie without talking about how the characters look because it's horrifying all of the male rats are the same model just like different colors with different facial hair or like a hat to differentiate them and all of the female rats are exactly the same but with just different hair and and okay why are the female rats like so curvy like were they trying to make them sexy like some of them have boobs this one has boobs and she's got real human curves she's thick the rats thick I guess some Disney movies also do that like the rabbit in Zootopia is Loki kind of thick but at least when they give the animals boobs and Disney movies they put clothes on them at least they make them modest sexy bunnies this rats got boobs and a big butt and she and naked is all hey also I know that this is a little bit nitpicky but female rats have 12 nipples six on each side they just kind of go down like that so what the [ __ ] happened to the rest of her boobs and I do understand that all of the rats are walking on two feet in this movie so the fact that she has two boobs instead of 12 is kind of small in comparison to the fact that all of these rats are walking on two feet but it's just anatomically incorrect like if you're gonna give her boobs give her the right amount of boobs you know hello well oh god that walk oh no what is that rid of such a sexy walk it's a rat you don't need to give the rat a sexy saunter when she walks into the room she does not need to walk into the room with that sexual energy it's also this combination between like they shouldn't have animated the rat to look so sexy but also they did a really bad job of it like look at how her hands move hello it's a sexy okay anyways back to the plot business is going great at ratatouille it's the most popular restaurant in town they always have the best ingredients everyone in the restaurant is constantly raving about the food and tonight is no exception in fact it's one of the busiest nights they've had in a long time it's going so great in fact that little Marcel the chef looks a little bit overworked it's turning out to be some night tonight huh Marcel yeah you're right so far tonight I've been asked to make 12 olive creams and soda so is it ready well almost tell me has the party at Table four decided their order yes he ordered tonight's special the larvae pie Carol why didn't you tell me sooner you know perfectly well that dish requires a lot more time to prepare than other dishes you've got to take it easy calm down Marcel what the hell she walks into the room and he's like hey is Table four decided what they want to order yet and she's like yeah they want the larva pie and he's just like Carol what the [ __ ] why didn't you tell me sooner what the [ __ ] Carol Carol like dude what are you talking about she told you the order as soon as she got it that's why she came into the room what did you want her to tell you the order before he ordered it needless to say it seems like the stress of single-handedly cooking for this entire restaurant is really getting to Marcel maybe they should hire some other chefs I mean it is kind of impressive that seemingly the restaurant in this entire marvelous city only has one cook and throughout the movie you start to realize that every time it shows him cooking all he's doing is just stirring this big cauldron of brown liquid it's pretty amazing that he's able to make this variety of dishes that are revered throughout the city just by stirring this this pot of brown liquid oh you want ice cream you want some ice cream yeah I'll just throw some ice and some cream into the liquid stir it up there you go it's a sundae you know that the party at Table four has changed his order again now he wants me guess he wants the spicy fatty and crisp spaghetti precisely that guy always ends up ordering the same thing I'm glad you know the ordering habits of your clientele stop trying to make rats sexy rats are not supposed to be sexy please I hope you all enjoy your wonderful dinner [Music] oh that was creepy dude now she's giving off like robot vibes she's just like I hope you all enjoy your wonderful dinner and then just glides off to the next table I don't know what's worse a robot rat or a sexy rat vote now eventually everyone starts asking if they can meet the chef I must say I agree that this food and the service are both wonderful thank you sir and may I say we're very glad you feel that way I hope it's not inconvenient but I would really love to speak to the chef everyone starts asking the waiter like can we talk to the chef we want to ask him about the food how does he make the food which is I feel like a weird thing to do in itself I've never been to a restaurant and had food so good that's like I have to meet the chef I need to talk to him and let him know how much he means to me but I guess the rats are used to eating trash like they've eaten trash all their life and then then this is good food so maybe I would be a little bit skeptical to like would you get this good food I'm a rat I'm used to eating trash but then they all end up getting like super worked up about it in a really creepy way like there they all really want to talk to the chef and they're being super insistent on it I'll go into the kitchen and see if he might be available to come out and meet you sir we don't my lady look [ __ ] I don't think you get it right that's chef back there changed my life and I'll wait here as long as it takes until I get to talk to that beautiful man you got back there I just want to talk anyway finally Marcel comes out to answer all their questions and they're all asking him like what does he do to make such great food what's the secret ingredient and this is what he says tell me young man what is the secret of the great flavors you prepare no right I'll tell you quick grab your notebook and write down every single word the actual secret ingredient that can be found in all of the food prepared here is lots of come on out with it lots and lots and lots of with lots of with lots and lots and lots of this guy is just driving me crazy the dishes are prepared with the secret angry of a lot of dedication and care what the dog no one answers questions like that I'm not mad at him for saying the dedication and care thing I met at him for the build up why did he keep pausing in the middle why did he build it up for so long they'll be like if your son was in the hospital and you're waiting in the waiting room and the doctor finally comes out and you're like finally uh how's he doing is he alright well actually it turns out he's got lots of oh no lots and lots and lots of god no okay just tell me I can take it just tell me a whole bunch a whole lot of just oodles and oodles women you've just gotta tell me alright there's so much it just oh so much oh my goodness I can't even believe how my does just would what are you doing at understand well I just always just sew my leash it just tell me yes so much life left to live and so many supportive family members he's gonna be fine what the [ __ ] okay so finally after that long-ass introductory scene the restaurant closes everybody goes home except for Marcel Carol and Greg because tonight is Thursday night and they do something special on Thursday nights Greg have you forgotten that it's Thursday night oh I forgot we do something special on Thursday nights also we find out that the reason some of these rats want to know the secret ingredients so bad is because they actually own a rival restaurant and apparently their restaurant has been failing miserably so they've been eating at rent a towing every day for weeks to try to figure out what a secret ingredient is you know I thought he was gonna reveal the secret mean our little secret was almost revealed listen guys I think we should just forget about trying to uncover the secret of rata joins food I just feel like they're wasting a lot of time eating it Marcel's restaurant when they could be I don't know running their own restaurant so like maybe that's why it's failing guys because instead of serving food during dinner time to your patrons you're at a different restaurant spending money there are only hope of returning to our success is to get rid of chef Marcel TOI meanwhile back at the restaurant it's time for Marcel Carol and Greg to get suited up for their special Thursday night activities come on Greg it's time [Music] so we cut to this really awkward suiting up sequence that includes way too much grunting and moaning like how much do y'all grunt and moan when you're just putting on clothes there's no you don't need to grunt and moan when you're doing that yeah yeah yeah I just don't get is is it like that strenuous or pleasurable to put on your clothes like that I don't understand so they put on their little outfits they run around and pose and run around some more and pose some more and run around I don't know what the running around is all about like what what are they scrambling to do they're already dressed what are they doing are they on crack but then finally they're ready to go ready to go do what you ask well it turns out that the way that they get their fresh food is actually by stealing it from a human restaurant instead of finding food in the trash like apparently every other rat restaurant in that town does what is it strawberries big beautiful red ones that smell incredibly fresh and delicious wow that's fantastic get down there Marcel hurry come down grass so you're telling me that rats can't grow food they can't figure that out they just have to go dumpster diving for food but they do produce spy equipment for rats rats can manufacture all of this secret agent ship but they can't grow a zucchini [Music] so apparently they do this every Thursday when they go to the human restaurant to try to get some fresh food but this time there's a bit of a fiasco because while Marcel is hanging from the fan Greg who was a colossal dumbass for the entire movie accidentally turns on the fan so Marcel is like swinging around at a hundred miles per hour in rat speed just screaming and hanging on for dear life and Greg is just kind of standing there like damn I wish there was some way I could help but unfortunately I am just a rat [Music] [Applause] [Music] switch a bunch of the most frustrating dialogue I've ever heard they managed to get him down but because of the whole fiasco they didn't really have time to grab anything except for one strawberry that's the only ingredient that they have for the entire week to make food with this one strawberry well guys what really matters is that we were able to bring back an excellent strawberry precisely and then we had some trouble getting it we'll be able to make a week's worth of excellent dishes with this little beauty but then when they get back to the restaurant Marcel is like well that should be enough for the entire week we can just use this strawberry for the week and make everything with this and then and then next week we'll get something else but like how though like sure they're mice and the strawberry is big compared to them but like not that big not big enough to feed every customer in their restaurant for an entire week and you certainly won't be able to make a variety of dishes I don't know how many different ways you can prepare one strawberry especially when we all know you're just gonna throw it in that big cauldron and stir it okay here's where things get hairy because while they were dealing with that whole fan thing what if the rats from the rival restaurant came into their restaurant sneaking around because she left her notebook there but then she finds their secret entrance to the human restaurant and she goes through and she sees I'm stealing food from the human restaurant so what I thought was gonna happen next as she would go back to her rat friends and she'd be like hey I found a place we can get fresh food because Marcel gets it from there so we can also get it from there and then we can also have a successful restaurant and rats will be able to eat fresh food from our place too but instead she goes back and tells them and they're all like alright so we have to sabotage Marcel and make sure he can't get fresh food anymore what if Marcel suddenly found he wasn't able to get his fresh ingredients anymore what would happen that way nobody can have fresh food and we all have to eat garbage so in order to sabotage this for Marcel they decide that they're going to try to make the restaurant think they have a rat problem so that they put traps everywhere so Marcel can't get fresh food there anymore so the group of bad guy rats go to the humid restaurant during the day when people are eating there and they put on this little rat show one two three now [Music] and this scene is just just a [ __ ] I don't know how else to describe it the rats are putting on this weird show where they're dancing and jumping around but they're also moaning and groaning really weirdly just like in that other scene [Music] and also some of them they're making spooky ghost noises like their little ghost rats like they're not just trying to convince people that there's a rat problem but there's also a ghost problem a ghost rat problem [Music] the scene is so weird they keep reusing the same shots over and over like especially this one which I really don't like this shot looks like I awoke in the middle of the night and found that I was being haunted by Ford demon rats for low-poly poorly animated moaning demon rats this has truly got to be one of the worst scenes ever conceived in cinematic history so they must have realized while they were making this scene like holy [ __ ] wait we can just reuse the same shots over and over and make the movie so much longer and avoid all that extra work of having to animate more [ __ ] because then the very next scene Marcel and his friends are getting suited up again and it's like the exact same sequence as before they're running around and posing and running around and posing we'll need to take quick and effective measures I want this taken care of immediately after this whole rat show that they put on the restaurant decides oh [ __ ] we have a rat problem we need to put up traps which is what they do so when Marcel and Greg and Carol go back there's traps everywhere don't trust anything Marcel they might be trapped wait what do you mean there might be traps you were just looking directly at the traps everyone saw them do you mean to tell me that the rats know that there are traps that humans use they exist and they put fresh food on the traps to catch the rats but these they don't know what traps look like like they have no idea what they could possibly be how would they know all of these things about traps and not know what traps are she can see the traps clear as day but she's just like be careful guys there's a slim chance that those things with food on him that we've never seen before are traps but probably not be careful Marcel I have a bad feeling about tonight what do you mean Carol don't say things like that yeah shut the [ __ ] up Carol what's that supposed to mean this is gonna be the best night of Our Lives there's cheese everywhere idiot Oh guys he's fine damn I was kind of worried for a second the movie was just gonna end there like Marcel was just gonna get you know this this is gonna get his neck snapped and that was gonna be the end of the movie trap I know there'd be trouble we never saw traps here before wait I don't get it did did she know they were traps cuz now she's pretending like she did she's like I knew there would be trouble we've never seen traps here before and now today when we did see the traps which we did right we all saw the trap today when we saw the traps something bad happened with the trap why didn't you tell him Carol why did you just make it seem like there might be traps if you knew oh yeah there's a lot different here I'm gonna go check things out carefully yeah good idea we should check things out a little more carefully yep those look like traps to me yep those two I think I get the picture now there's lots of traps oh my god we get it there's traps that's great we've never had any chocolate before well we certainly do now what do you mean can't talk now ah ah no what the cat walks on two legs two shits gonna give me nightmares are you doing Marcel why are you calling the carrots you're not calm down my friend I have everything under control hey Carol Greg check out the middle of the table I'll get all that delicious cheese just waiting to be taken hurry up make your way out where and get as much as you can oh really but what about the cat there's no sign of him I checked everywhere so it's a wizard cab anyway this is we're getting close to the ending basically the gist of what happens I don't really understand it fully but the bad guys show up and they're like Holden Greg and Carol hostage and suddenly Marcel comes back on top of the cat like they're best friends now cuz he fed the cat one treat that he cooked and the cat gets rid of the rats takes him to his owner and then the rest of the rats get away scot-free and soon the ratchet owing was full again almost everything seemed to be back to normal that's a pretty brutal punishment for those rats all they ever wanted was to have a successful restaurant and that punishment is they're getting sent away to be experimented on in a lab for the rest of time Jesus that's kind of dark anyways that's pretty much the end of the movie everything goes back to normal after that the cat is now their friend he comes to the restaurant sometimes to eat and he helps them get food from the human restaurant so they can keep getting fresh food so in the end nothing really changed there's been no character development the only thing that's happened is the bad guys are now being tortured in a lab somewhere well I hope you guys enjoyed watching this movie with me I know I did but now it's time
