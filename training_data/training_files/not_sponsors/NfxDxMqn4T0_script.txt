I should probably fix the echo hey guy welcome back to this spookiest channel on YouTube hope you're all having a very happy Halloween I'm currently dressed as a peanut funny story about this costume I actually bought this back in 2012 in November you see I was fresh into my adulthood and I thought I know what a smart financially responsible adult would do why would I buy a costume for full price before Halloween when I could get that same costume for 50% off the week after Halloween and then save it for the next Halloween right genius so smart that was six years ago and today is the first time I've ever put this on I want to try some of the day that I don't normally do on this channel so instead of reacting to some silly Internet videos I thought why don't I Pitt two of the most beloved holidays against each other and use science to determine which one is actually the best sounds like fun right so what I've done is come up with about 20 or so different categories and for each one I will award a point to the holiday that I think is more deserving of that point very straightforward I think of it like an internet game show that's very biased and relies on the input of one person so let's just jump into it Halloween is hella fun as a kid you get a bunch of free candy you get to dress up as someone whose life is way more interesting than yours and you get to leave your house at night sometimes Halloween would fall on a weekday and your school would let you wear your costume to school the rest of the year you're just some dumb little idiot loser dweeb but today you're spider-man talk about it glow up but I gotta say the only thing better than wearing a spider-man costume to school is not having to go to school for two weeks and look I love free candy as much as the next guy but as far as holiday centered around free stuff go Christmas is king as a kid waking up on Christmas morning was like well like waking up on Christmas morning it was the best you get up at 4:45 a.m. you'll run downstairs you little Shrek PJs you shake some boxes next year until your parents finally wake up three hours later and then you make a mess and get like 12 new toys can't be bad first point goes to Christmas I feel like as you get older Christmas starts to lose a little bit of its charm as you slowly find yourself on the other side of what made it so special as a kid wait wait you're telling me I have to spin how much money on presents and what do I get out of this a couple like gift cards I don't even like TGI Fridays and now I have a 20 dollar bill that only works there thanks I guess grandma when did this exchange become so one-sided I'd much rather just get drunk put on an ill-fitting costume and either go to a costume party or stay home and give candy to minors at least this only costs like 12 bucks and I get to eat whatever's left Halloween gets a point to me this one isn't even close yeah elf great movie and the first Santa Clause is a classic but every Christmas movie ever made has this same exact plot at first someone doesn't believe in the magic of Christmas until of course a sequence of events happen that by the end of the movie causes them to now believe in the magic of Christmas actually what am I even telling you about this I mean a vine about Christmas movies I'll just show it to you Santa Santa guys I'm a lotta magic we have to save Christmas Halloween movies so are basically an entire genre of film that exists year-round that aren't necessarily specific to this one day some of my favorite movies ever made I associate with Halloween not because they're about trick-or-treating or costumes but because they're spooky and Halloween a spooky and spooky makes for a pretty fun movie watching experience hell even most bad horror movies are good because they end up being hilarious bad Christmas movies are just bad sorry to break it to you Red Claws stupid move Halloween gets a point just like the last category this one also isn't even close yeah Christmas music definitely gets a little overplayed because people start listening to it and like [ __ ] July only five months till Christmas but still it's great there's also a bunch of good Christmas songs I can only name like two Halloween songs Monster Mash and this is Halloween you're welcome to disagree with me on this but Christmas gets a pretty emphatic point I like the last one this turned out to be a very decisive victory honestly Christmas should be a little embarrassed at how uncompetitive they were it's like they weren't even trying Halloween wins in a landslide this category turned out to be a lot closer than you might have thought but Christmas wins one to zero so at least we got season 2 episode 5 and season 2 episode 10 and Halloween episode Michael was supposed to let one of the employees go in October but he kept putting it off until he couldn't anymore and now he has to fire someone on Halloween whew my favorite moments in this room when Michael asked what happened to the decorations and Angela was like I don't know we put him up last night and then they show b-roll of a maintenance guy just vacuuming it all up I also love Dwight's rant about how loyal he is I'm going wherever they value loyalty to most and I also love the cameraman coaxing Michael into sharing this accidentally perfect analogy for how he's handling the firing situation yeah I went hunting once shot the deer in the leg had to kill it with a shovel took about an hour why do you ask and the Christmas party episode everyone bought gifts specifically for someone else but Michael was unhappy when he got Ryan an iPod and only got an oven mitt in return so he turns the Secret Santa into a white elephant and forces everybody to swap gifts with each other which ruins the entire party he also confesses that the only reason he had the money for the iPod in the first place was because they got a huge bonus for firing Devon both great episodes but I think I'm gonna give the point to Christmas here because I just feel like this one is a classic it's hilarious everything happens feel so true to the characters and it's got some really solid Jim and Pam moments way to go Christmas another close call here Halloween hats can be just about anything very open-ended but Christmas hats usually have little toys on it like bells or little pom poms Christmas gets a point Christmas is on the 25th of December but Halloween is on the 31st of October 31 is quite frankly a bigger number than 25 so Halloween gets a point sometimes Christmas is on a Friday but sometimes Halloween is on a Monday I hate mondays Christmas gets a point one of the most important categories to consider height well if Christmas was a person I've always imagined him to be like 6-3 Wow Halloween would only be about 6 - so obviously you got to give the edge to Christmas here Christmas is true what the hell are these categories oh you mean like the music one no like this one feet whose feet you know like Christmas feet that's not a thing you didn't even put anything there that part's just blank ok fine I'll admit it I was running out of ideas for categories so I started bullshitting a little bit is that a crime is that so bad I was on a time crunch ok so sue me maybe I will oh no that's just a figure of speech hi mr. Gooden I'm an attorney can I just need to sign these forms what's going on sir I understand lawsuits can be very stressful but I'm gonna need to ask you to calm down now can you please sign these documents I already signed mine when this is for your own good sir no one gets sued for their own good get out of here you know I expected this kind of thing from dad but not from you dad I'm sorry no it's too late for that alright to quote the OneRepublic song it is too bad that you didn't sorry too late for apology is it for apology or to apology I think it's with apology whatever it doesn't matter none of this matters now if you'll excuse me I have a conclusion to film I was just trying to help son I don't need your help dad I've got everything under control sorry guys I don't know what that was all about anyway we've come to the end of this video so I'm excited to finally announce the winner after tallying up all the points and double-checking the math of course I'm ready to announce you guys the best holiday of all time is spring break what that's not even a holiday well guy Halloween is officially coming to an end and you know what that means it is the beginning of the holiday season and you know what that means it's time to buy [ __ ] I get it the holidays can be stressful you gotta buy gifts for every single person you've ever met for whatever reason it's just the societal norm I don't know why but if you want to and helping me save so much money this year you guys are the best well it's now officially November so I guess I should go ahead and start planning for Thanksgiving or I could just do it the day before yeah that sounds better you sure to tune in for next week's video where I will be learning how to do a kickflip good night everybody
