oh garden the jewels dude your Gardens jewels now everyone knows that I love huge swords though our swords are huge but they're still not quite big enough let's see if Jerry can make a sword big enough to impress me I fully grown duck his name was Moliere you would never in your life want to have a horse sized duck unless you have a serious 50 caliber machine gun and could kill this thing so you would take horses 100 horses a hundred horses I would rather those are medium-sized dogs makes me so happy cuz that's the argument I've been making you don't want to fight this duck and everyone else hears like I could take the duck you couldn't no you couldn't I'm Tania I've had ducks I've owned ducked and they can be mean mother and this duck has begun its it has a little pointy thing yeah it will hurt your ass it will hurt you bad they do this and by the way their beak is at crotch level so yeah you're gardening the jewels dude your Gardens jewels you get a full male groan going for them dude he's at that level and you see what he can do to chicken bones he crushed it looks like he's crushing him but what he's probably doing is swallowing them whole I mean pork rinds ribs even chewed up ribs you throw the rib on the gun knowing how badass a duck can be when it's it Honore or something like that a hundred hundred hundred horses I mean what the worst the horse could do is take they bite you nicking mule kick you right I'm still I can at least get to higher ground the duck ducks can semi fly yeah I had to put a top on my knight and put a chicken wire top because this dude was like I had a like a three foot fence that I got at Home Depot that wire fence and sweat right over what he really wanted given the difference of what I know the duck I'm Moliere was a full sized male grown duck and the only thing he the way he died I was about 20 feet from him when he died it was like dusk and a giant opossum they can be big this one was a big one and he was hungry and he got in and got in a fight with Moliere he he jumped up on its back and and bit more years now and yeah hello don't go for the doc welcome to round 2 I swallowed a chip oh don't you hate when the triangle goes down straight ah the triangle almost past ah okay we're here to talk about a new video dim souls Clint spawns in through the grounds like hi Nico because just like hey you have to help me fight this boss also cool sword by the way Nico has got a huge sword but it cuts the clintons got even bigger swords the Dark Souls huge weapon let's see we're making what are we making him we need to figure out how Jarrett's going to make a giant prop I think if you use really wide angle lenses and use the sword we have you could get the same effect super heavy front of you dangerous will be careful this sword that Sam's about to bring over is that gonna work for the prop or we're gonna have to build another way I mean it's kind of huge now everyone knows that I love huge swords though our swords are huge but they're still not quite big enough let's see if Jared can make a sword big enough to impress me how big it is yeah I mean it'll be funny no green the words is it's not like fighting a hundred duck-sized horses is gonna be like an easy thing either cuz horses when they bite they latch on they don't let go they'll actually just mash on stuff they just chew chew on everything so I imagine like them biting onto your calf and just like never letting go oh oh no I've been bit by a horse did I worked in a freaking horse stable for a week I was done after that he worked in I didn't know you worked in a horse stable just one week I was a horseman people rough man like I was just like moving hey I was just picking up hay and scoop and poop and like moving stuff around you ever deal with the horses yes dude see the horse and then like like scoop out the poop and the hay they would take the horse out to scoop the poop and the hay out of their place and like refill the water and like whatever the heck and throw some carrots in there all that good stuff I remember one day I was just there for a week and like the trainer was bringing the horse back and as I just pet it yeah you can they can smell your fear and I was like oh god that was terrifying and then like I go to like touch things I was done dude I was out no more stable I ain't moving hey for 20 bucks so did you quit yes I was on the spot quit it was supposed to be two-week thing I was like out after the week I was like I'm done that was the last day dude I was out in under 24 hours seriously yeah it took him one hour under 24 hours Jared felt this snores Wow with the constraints he had I'm so impressed of the result look at this craftsmanship I cannot believe he managed to get this done Wow dangerous yes what is that it's dangerous okay the problem is that you said we needed a sword that was like 15 feet long but we failed to like go into more detail did you know that it's supposed to be like a big sword and this is pretty big sorry let me rephrase that did you know that it's supposed to be a greater scale on sword as it like this is a normal sword you know and the sword that we were intending to build it was supposed to be built at a ratio of like 400% oh well I mean scales overrated this is this is still big Sam are you okay with this dude this whole studio the links into the description of the video you didn't see any of this named uncle leaders we're filming our Dark Souls video I just woke up my passion airs like this because I didn't shave for a month and a half straight until you're like hey guys let's shave our facial hair in two ridiculous styles that we've never done before and it lined up perfectly with this video it's perfect it's fantastic I can't even see dude I don't know what to say I'm like dude I woke up like 45 minutes ago man cuz then you could have it up no such thing is a non J key battle helmet even under brand new that's still falling apart this isn't last minute this is like all right on schedule you could be all dark and cool-looking so the most important thing to protect is your crotch you don't want to get these guys chopped off so and you know I got you know just the leather the cheap leather my uggs to keep me warm and cozy we got inverse go to you see this if you put them together they'll make a hole go team and perfect I think that's around yay
