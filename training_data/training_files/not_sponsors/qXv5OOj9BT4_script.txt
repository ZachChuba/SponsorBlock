hello this is chef john from food wishes
calm with shelter-in-place salmon low that's right remember that
time bought all that canned salmon because saw that article about how
good it was for and how it was always wild-caught and sustainable and a
great inexpensive source of protein and omegas and then put them in your
pantry next to your tuna and haven't touched him since well I figured since
we're all working through our drying canned goods these days I would show you
how to make this very easy and delicious salmon loaf and to get started what
we'll do is melt a little bit of butter in a saute pan over medium heat and I
don't know about but one of my favorite kitchen meditations is watching
butter slowly slide across a pan Walla melts I find it extremely relaxing until
it reminds me I need to level my stove but anyway once that melts we'll go
ahead and toss in some finely diced onion and we'll give that a quick shake
and then eventually stir with a freakishly small wooden spoon and we're
only gonna cook this for one minute okay we're just taking that riot off so after
just one minute we'll turn off the heat and just let it sit there cooling down
while we move on to the rest of the ingredients the first of which would be
two cans of almost fully drained red salmon which is by far one of the
ugliest ingredients ever I mean look at that it's a total horror show I mean
we've got skin we got bones we even have vertebrae and if wanted
could pick the more horrific parts out but I don't because while they do
look terrible they're actually just about as soft as the meat and once mixed
and mashed in won't even notice them plus they are the most nutritious parts
but what we will do is quickly cover those with crushed cracker crumbs okay
that is a lot better and yes if don't have saltines can use some
bread crumbs and then to this we will add a little bit of salt plus a little
shake of cayenne as well as a few drips of Worcestershire sauce I also like to
add a little touch of rice vinegar although lemon juice would also work and
that's it we can go ahead and dump in our butter and onions and then we'll
take a spatula or spoon and we'll mix and match this until it's as smooth as
possible and I'm not exactly sure how or why but the way the salmon is cooked and
processed in the can everything including all those bones invar
brain get really really really soft so as long as mix them and mash them in
really well they will not be a problem other than knowing they're in there
so we will go ahead and thoroughly combine all that together with extreme
prejudice before separating three eggs and adding the yolks to the salmon and
the whites to a separate clean bowl and yes I almost did that first one wrong
okay so to recap the white is going in a separate bowl and our yolks are going
into our salmon mixture and as with every recipe where we separate egg
whites it's totally fine to get a little bit of the egg white with the yolk but
we never want to get any of the yolk in the egg white otherwise it just won't
whip up into nice Peaks as easily which is the next step and yes in case you're
keeping score at home this step is optional and could if want just
mix in three whole eggs but as you'll see later it really does help lighten
the texture so we'll mix those yolks into our salmon then we'll go ahead and
whisk up our whites into some relatively firm but still soft edge peaks which I
like to call the shaving cream stage which I don't actually think is the
thing anymore and I should probably update that
reference among others but anyway once those whites have been whipped we'll go
ahead and fold it into our salmon mixture in two additions all right and
the first one is just mostly to lighten the mixture so don't really have to
be too too gentle but at the same time using as light a touch as possible and
then once our first additions been folded in we'll go ahead and fold in the
rest trying to be as gentle as possible and like I said this is optional but it
only takes a few minutes and when you're cooped up inside getting the heart rate
up is never a bad idea but anyway decide I mean are after all the gang
leader of whether to be a meringue beater but like I said I really do think
it significantly improves the loaf and then what we'll do once that last
additions just been barely incorporated is transfer this into a very well
buttered loaf pan and as do this want to kind of work it over with the
spatula to make sure there's no big air bubbles in the corners and we'll also do
our best to kind of smooth and even out the top and that's it we will give it
the OL shakey sheikha and old tappet abba before placing it into the center
of a 325 degree oven for about 45 minutes or so hey look there's my tripod
or until a toothpick comes clean so I gave mine a quick test and it
was done and then what we'll want to do is let this rest for just five minutes
before carefully turning this out onto a cutting board at which point we can
slice it up and eat it and by the way if want a taller loaf have two
options use a smaller loaf pan or double the
recipe but know what I was just cooking for two and I don't have a
smaller loaf pan but this is just fine for me and one sliced you're gonna get a
great look at why I take the time to do those egg whites all right well it
really doesn't create a lot of rise as can hopefully see we do have a very
nice light airy texture oh and the other good news is this stuff is very pale
once slice it but in just a few minutes it takes to plate up those
surfaces are actually gonna darken and I think the color and appearance really
improve and it actually kind of looks like salmon and as far as the sauce goes
my favorite would be just a simple Remillard also known as tartar sauce but
a simple milk base white sauce would also be very traditional and work very
well and it's kind of hard to believe that something that looks so unappealing
earlier produce something so delicious and almost attractive okay I'm not sure
this would ever be called beautiful alright if this was a blind date it
would be described as having a great personality but it is certainly not ugly
and when consider how good it is for not to mention extremely tasty I
think we can forgive any of its visual shortcomings including those highly
visible pieces of vertebra I see on the edges but have to believe me as
you're eating these you're not even going to feel those and it's as if those
vertebrae don't even exist and now I should probably stop saying vertebrae
and start saying I really do hope give this a try soon so please follow
