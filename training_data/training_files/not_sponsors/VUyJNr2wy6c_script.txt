hey everyone what's up my name is Jessica Whitaker and Savior now leaves today I'm going to teach you guys how to shoot through windows and dealing with reflections is this kind of something that I see a lot done in photography it's really pretty but it can also go wrong really fast so I'm in teaching with my number one trick for shooting through windows dealing with reflections this video is also sponsored by Skillshare and I'll talk about them in a minute before we get into that I'm shooting with my Canon 5d Mark port and then my 35 41.4 sigma art lens be sure to check out the full set of images over on my blog and subscribe to the YouTube channel for more photography videos you can also find me on instagram at Jessica sure to go check out filter and let's hop into the video okay so the first thing about shooting third windows is you don't want anything super light or white going through the person's head so as you can see in the reflection there is a kind of white car and it's going to you don't want that going through her at all so I'm gonna have to take this from a higher angle where I'm not even going to get the car in the shot if that makes sense you want darker colors around the subject it's going to contrast more and you're not going to have any objects rusting the face that's I think the biggest key for me when shooting through windows you're going to have things reflecting in it so when it's darker colors better because they're going to blend in whereas white is obviously going to pop and show up in a reflection I'll show you have what not to do obviously in this photo there is that white car in the way and in this case we can't move the car but we can move the subject if need be so first I'm going to try without moving the subject and then if I find that there's really no way around it I'll have her baby suit down but this car is all the way in the whole shot unfortunately so I am going to do a higher angle and I might actually even you know what stepping away actually helps that a lot so instead I'm going to move over and my shirt is actually white that was a super smart to wear maybe you are like a black shirt and then be firm or prepared to expect but I'll just step away more kind of shoot over this guy maybe like turn and hop your hats your hand yeah I bring both hands another thing too it's a lot of communicating kind of like I don't know if you can hear me but it's a lot of kind of more movement okay perfect okay great and I'm time in US because my shirt is white again I'm kind of having to like move around so that it's not going to be in the reflection fully so as you can see in this photo there's nothing obstructing her face another helpful thing is having the door open obviously Nellie's really close to the door and so she can hear me talking in steps with either two directions but sometimes if you're at a coffee shop in your own these clear outside of downtown Seattle there's much cars going by you have these or hand movements but it's pretty easy honestly and you can communicate to your models before the shoot before you separate and just like do lot of movements kind of stay in the same area alright so now we are going to do some that are more straight on I'm not going to come over and angle myself so this is in the case in a lot of areas - it's just pull me straight you don't really have the option to go around there's not like this curved window or angled window situation and this is also great because I'm able to get more of the reflections but kind of more incorporate it into the shop purposely I also really like this in particular because we have the cute coca-cola machine we have some lights that are going on inside the shop as well as obviously outside so this is just very cute okay so I'm in live news right now because this is a little bit easier for me to more control over the image so see how nelly is kind of framed within the starks patch this is a lot better and I still don't love how this blue is running through her head but this is a lot better than having it somewhere see how there's this white that is going through her head and obstructing it this is the case of wanting to have something darker and more contrasted this is a lot better than something like this as you can tell it's honestly just science you just want to frame them against something dark a lot of times you can even use a dark car or a building across the street so we're going to get some shots of her and I do want to keep these lights in the frame so using the live view beautiful it's really pretty and in this case you might even need to use manual it's really depending on my mark score it makes it a little bit easier to do those but really cute I'm going to get now a little bit closer because as you can see in the last shots there are those few lines running through her face that are a result of the car in front of us and so I'm just going to get a tiny bit closer to her beautiful stay like that for me Kurtzman stay right there please okay so this is a really great because I love how she is being framed and I can get those cool lights from the coca-cola machine and until your head up this way again yeah how do you look at me so keep your head up though yeah so now I'm just going to get a few more shots of Nellie for the rest of the photos but but that is my biggest tip that I use in all of my window shots it's a really focus on having something dark and contrasted that's what I applied to the rest of these images that you'll see in a second you you all right everyone that was it that was the tutorial I hope that you found it helpful thank you so much Nellie for coming along showing that teaching them your wisdom in your ways be sure to go see the full set of images over on my website they'll be linked down below as well as my sponsoring this video be sure to subscribe to my youtube channel for more photography videos find me over at Instagram at Jessica Whitaker and I'll see you guys later bye [Music]
