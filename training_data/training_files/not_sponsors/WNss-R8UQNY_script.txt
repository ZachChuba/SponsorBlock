this video is sponsored by audible the second screen on the new Asus Zenbook Pro duo was just a gimmick but the more I used it the more I liked it and now I wish Apple would do something like this too [Music] hello my name is Brad I review tech for creative professionals we're talking about illustrators designers people who can carve Mount Rushmore out of cheese and today we're taking a look at the Asus Zenbook probe duo a 15 inch laptop with two screens aimed at creatives the thing about gimmicks is that if you're someone who wants to do a slide show from across the room with your tablet or phone this is not a gimmick this is a killer feature if you're someone who really wants to turn on your house lights using your watch that's not a gimmick that's a killer feature if you want a refrigerator that's able to cut potatoes roast them to just the perfect amount of crispness while adding a little bit of salt and a touch of rosemary to them then the Prince Harry and Meagan Marco commemorative wedding smart fridge isn't a gimmick it's a killer feature but joking aside it's really a great fridge you should check out my review down in the description below and as I was using the pro duo I quickly realized that for me that second screen it wasn't a gimmick it was a killer feature this would have been the perfect laptop for Brad from like five years ago hi I'm Brad from the past back then I was working on-site with clients it just wasn't practical for me to drag ahead Cintiq with a big power brick and a bunch of cables around just so I could use it a little bit here and a little bit there I was a UX designer I would have loved to sketch digitally or taken notes or added a small illustration elements to my designs I just want to add little Illustrated elements to my designs even though this comes with a pen that will work on either screen I don't think this is a great laptop for people who draw full-time eight hours a day [Music] this laptop comes in two configurations this is the lower-end config but it is no slouch there's an i7 processor 16 gigs of ram a full terabyte SSD hard drive and an nvidia geforce r-tx 2060 is it a gaming laptop it could be the styling is inspired by gaming laptops but I don't I don't feel like the design itself is over the top I tend to prefer minimalist design in my hardware like what Microsoft is doing with their surface line this laptop is definitely not that there are a lot of angles and things going on here but they also feel pretty tasteful I could have taken this into a client meeting and still looked professional I look so professional something I don't think I really could have pulled off with a lot of gaming laptops and this is a really well performing laptop you're not gonna run into the same performance issues you might see on say it's ultra portable competitors but that comes with some trade-offs for example this is a pretty heavy machine at 5.4 pounds and the battery life is just okay I would say I got about three hours on average out of it and that's just a trade-off you're making more power means less battery life one thing that it does pull from the gaming world is it seems to understand how air works something that Apple seems to have forgotten over the years first there are huge vents along the side that helped pull hot air out of the laptop and one of the key design features is the way that it opens up and the bottom of the hinge actually pulls the back or the bottom of that laptop up off your desk giving it even more airflow underneath and helping to keep it cool along the sides we've got a good number of ports here we've got two standard USB ports a USB C Thunderbolt port an HDMI port and a headphone jack of course it has a headphone jack everything has a headphone jack Oh bless your heart younger Brad I did miss having an SD card slot somewhere on the computer for my camera cards but it wasn't the end of the world the keyboard is pulled forward to accommodate that second screen that decision has a couple repercussions first it doesn't give you much room for the trackpad so they ended up moving that off to the right hand side next to the keyboard it's a lot narrower than most track pads and it's functional but if you want to get the most out of your computer you're probably gonna want to attach a mouse to it as an added bonus you can toggle that trackpad into a number keypad by long-pressing on the upper right hand corner another change that comes with the keyboard being pulled up closer is there's no work for your palms to rest when you're typing so in the box they included a little organ ama cramp to make it far more comfortable to use when you're on a desk it's been a good chunk of my week designing or illustrating and when I do that I love to listen to audiobooks so I was really excited when audible reached out to me to sponsor this video today I've been a customer for years and I've accumulated a pretty large

the u.s. text Brad Colbert 500 500 again that's audible.com slash Brad Kobo or text Brad Kolbo - 500 500 both screens are touchscreens both screens also work with the pen the top screen is a full 4k 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels and they look amazing it's an OLED display and at least a great first impression it's crazy bright that's crazy bright I determine the brightness down it's also a glossy screen if you're getting close you can see a pixel pattern probably not something you're really gonna notice if you're sitting you know a foot or two away from it like the normal laptop distance there's also a little sticker along the back that says it's Pantone certified I think that's a fancy way of saying that it's pre calibrated to have accurate colors already I was pretty curious so I plugged in my own calibrator trying it out and yeah looks pretty similar the bottom screen is what they call 4k wide so that's 3840 pixels by only 1100 pixels because it's shorter and it's also a matte screen that's something that doesn't come across on a lot of the promotional photos online because it is a matte finish it's not as crisp and as bright as the top display in front of it and becomes really noticeable when you put those two things together but there are some really good reasons why that's a matte display the first is that it lays almost flat so ceiling lights would render really glossy display almost unusable with all a glare you're gonna get the second reason is that is just a better feeling surface to draw on it's not as slick and it gives you more drawing control there wasn't one thing that made me say wow I love this I can't put my finger on instead it was just a bunch of little things that added up over time Apple has their touch bar but this is like the touch bar on steroids instead of just having AB trolls in a long bar you have the entire apps you can put your music there I can scroll through Twitter or just have some file folders that I'm accessing while I'm working on a project I've used touchscreen windows computers before and one thing that's pretty common with me is that after I get over the novelty of actually having a touchscreen and from me I pretty much never use it I use it like a traditional laptop pretty much using the mouse and keyboard to get around unless I'm actually drawing and I fold it into some format just to do that what this does by bringing that second screen lower right where your hands are on the keyboard anyway is it makes it so much more usable everything is within hands reach not just for touch but using the pen - Asus has added some software here to make the second screen more useful you can drag anything you want down there at any time and just like having a second monitor attached to your computer but they've added some bells and whistles here with their screen plus pro software you can snap apps to full screen or half screen or a third of the screen when you get things set up just the right way you can save that as a configuration I had one configuration with Twitter my email and my music setup in it I had another configuration where I just had sketch a bowl take up the entire space what was really cool about the configurations is it's easy to just switch between them really quickly so if I had some thoughts and I wanted to jot down Sonos boom flip between grab the pen just write it down it does a bunch of other stuff too but another feature I found really useful was being able to swap screens with the push of a button if I'm working in Photoshop and I just want to draw something for a minute or two I just press on the button it flips screens it does take a second to like rearrange and resize all the windows but then I can draw with the stylus and flip it back if you're looking for a pure art laptop this is not it for sketching photo retouching some light drawing this is a great product but if you're looking for something where you're gonna be doing arc full-time eight hours a day there's some better options out there the biggest drawback here is the pen itself it uses entry technology like the Microsoft Surface lines now there are pros and there are cons to entry the biggest Pro is palm rejection it's great the downside here is line quality it's pretty shaky and the stylus there's a lot more jitter in the pen especially when you're drawing slower and more precise lines on angles you have to draw up pretty fast before you can start to get rid of those imperfections since this channel tends to cater towards illustrators more than designers I think this is going to be by far the most disappointing aspect of this laptop and if you're wondering if the top screen performs any better unfortunately I don't have good news for you there either I'm finding the same performance no matter which screen I use this isn't the only Windows product that is held back by the use of intrigue technology but it is one of the more disappointing ones because every other aspect of this laptop is so good [Music] I think most of this video has been about me outlining the things I like the pros of this product overall the second screen is just so darn useful the other side of that is you are making some compromises if you love to use a trackpad this one is kind of narrow you know you got to pick up your finger just to get across the entirety of the screen it's also really heavy it also sucks up a lot of power so you don't get the battery life that you get in like an ultra portable but I don't think all of these are necessarily bad things they're more nitpicks I would say the bad thing if you're looking at it from a purely illustration standpoint is that pen there are some other nitpicks out there that I think are worth mentioning here the build quality is hit or miss there are a lot of seams and the main thing that worries me is that some of the plastic parts don't seem sturdy enough to hold everything that's inside this computer in it's bulging in spots I'm worried that if I or anybody else ever grabbed a screwdriver and tried to loosen some of those panels they come flying off at me and never go back on and if they're bulging on a brand-new out-of-the-box computer does that mean at some point those are gonna break jumping between screens isn't fluid when I grab a window and I drag it down to the bottom screen when I get about halfway the entire thing freezes for about a half a second same thing when I flip my apps from that bottom screen to the top screen there is some blinking that goes on while things are resizing and moving around and I guess some of that is just to be expected when you're moving from one monitor to the other monitor having it blink and glitch in like that however we're living in a world with smartphones and tablets that are just buttery smooth and really great UI experiences I would love to see that continue on in the Windows laptops at some point in the future too now these nitpicks are not game breakers by any stretch of the imagination but there are things I at least wanted to point out as things that could definitely be improved in the future overall I love this laptop and not just for our I spent a good amount of my time making videos I'm producing a good portion of this video on this laptop - it is phenomenal for video editing being able to take all those tools put them down on the second screen there's so many uses that I haven't even scratched the surface for but pretty much everything and I do in my workflow can be improved by having a small screen like this on my laptop I hope this is something that more companies adopt in the we saw the surface neo that was introduced it looks like it's doing some of that stuff I would love to see more of this form factor what do you think let me know down below in the comment section thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in a couple of days [Music]
