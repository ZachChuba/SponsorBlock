hey so if you're anything like me you're competitive and you want to know who's better right boys or girls cats or dogs Ben and Jerry's or haagen-dazs well luckily for us some research has gone into the first one and since that both boys and girls brains have been examined under microscope so the New York Times posted an article a couple of months ago about this and they mentioned where this notion of male female brains came from apparently in 17th and 18th century Europe the rise of egalitarian ideas created the need for a scientific account of women's and furious status so people wanted the science to prove that girls weren't as good at anything as boys so it was said that they wanted women to not only be viewed merely as inferior to men but as fundamentally different from and therefore completely incomparable to men but it makes sense to think that male female brains are different right because men are considered to be more aggressive in nature and women are considered to be more emotionally vulnerable and as pointed out on the early show men have a natural talent for math and women are much more able to multitask but more importantly on that show it was declared by a medical expert that men have six and a half times more gray matter than women whereas women have ten times as much white matter as men but as an article in nature pointed out these differences would demand that women's heads were about 50 percent larger so is there any difference to the structure of girls and boys brains apparently not newer scientists have identified no decisive category defining differences between the brains of men and women in women's brains language processing is not spread any more evenly across the hemispheres and it is immense as a small 90-95 nature study proclaimed but a larger 2008 meta-analysis disproved so if there's no difference in the structure of men and women's brains then how do we explain the a very obvious differences in behavior on interests between men and women Geena Ripon the author of the gender brain thinks that the brain is no more gender than the liver or the kidneys or the heart but she explains that a gendered world has had an impact on the human brain she shows how children's brains probably differentiate due to the starkly pink vs. blue cultures and they're shown from the moment they're born and how differently adults act towards children when they think that they're either a girl or boy I mean have you seen that social experiment that they did with the babies I'll link it down below for you to check out how ridiculous it is that even as babies that boys and girls are treated differently and I'd really love to know your opinions on this do you think girls and boys brains are innately different and I'd like to thank you Asset extreme with Katie so go check it out and tell me what you think and a big thank you to my patrons on patreon and thank you for watching bye
