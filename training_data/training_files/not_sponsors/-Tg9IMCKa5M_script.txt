nebula a streaming video service that city beautiful is a part of back in 2009 New York City closed off-broadway two vehicles at Times Square on a temporary basis the change made senses Time Square was often packed with pedestrians tourists mainly who wanted to check out the famous New York landmark the experiment was a success and they made it permanent in 2014 the Time Square pedestrian redesign is one of the most visible examples of a trend in the United States that is taking Street space originally for cars and giving it back to pedestrians I know I need a second to acknowledge our friends from non-us countries we know your cities are much better for pedestrians but we're doing our best over here with our unique history and land use pattern anyway lots of cities have recently begun building new pedestrian spaces and some have even shut down streets to traffic but there's a shadow cast over all of these projects the shadow of doubt cast from the failed pedestrian malls of the 1960's and 1970's in fact the New York Times wrote the pedestrian mall the urban planners failed attempt to revitalize Main streets during the 1960s 1970s is back about the time square plan if you look at these new pedestrian projects cities are careful not to call them pest tree in malls instead they call them plazas or squares to avoid the comparison to the black sheep of pedestrian spaces everyone is this vaguely negative connotation associated with pedestrian malls in the 1960s and 1970s but were they really failures should we be worried about building new pedestrian spaces and what can we learn from these old pedestrian malls okay it's time for a story let's learn the legend of the pedestrian mall once upon a post-war young families moved to the suburbs thanks to the affordability and convenience of the car once there they didn't want to go back downtown to shop instead shopping came to them in the form of strip malls and shopping centers designed with the car in mind shoppers loved to drive to the mall park and walk past the shops in a clean climate-controlled setting downtown shop owners faced with declining sales and empty downtown's needed a way to lure shoppers back to the Center City Victor Gruen the architect responsible for designing the first suburban shopping mall had an idea to close shopping streets to cars and create a kind of out or mall downtown Kalamazoo Michigan was the first city to take grown up on his idea and the first pedestrian mall opened on Burdick Street in 1959 initially deemed a success other communities began installing malls on their Main streets the idea particularly appealed to smaller cities as pedestrian malls were relatively quick and inexpensive to install cities all over the u.s. installed malls in the 1960s and 1970s but they quickly realize that the malls were ruthlessly killing downtown businesses and nearly all cities removed them today pedestrian malls are a cautionary tale don't remove cars from a street unless you want businesses to fail okay so this is a bit of a simplification and dramatization but I think it's a pretty fair short summary of the narrative around pedestrian malls at least this was the narrative I found when I started doing my research two years ago this video is really special to me because it's about my research that I got published in a journal I wanted to write an article about pedestrian spaces and I started to do my research on pedestrian malls I know something that kind of shocked me nobody really knew how many pedestrian malls there were how many had failed and how many are still remaining that seems like important information to know if you want to declare something a failure but nobody had really any idea at all part of the reason nobody had a number is because there are so many different definitions of what a pedestrian mall is our transit malls pedestrian malls they get rid of cars but allow buses and trains to use the central space what about a boardwalk along the shore no cars there if I was going to count all the pedestrian malls built in that era I had to have a clear definition here's what I came up with a pedestrian mall is a street where private motorized traffic has been permanently eliminated and pedestrians have priority this specifies that the street has to have allowed cars in the past eliminating boardwalks and plazas from our definition the pedestrians have priority part eliminates transit malls while not in the definition I limited my count to streets close to cars in downtown areas not on random suburban streets this study is about pedestrian malls designed and built in the urban renewal era in response to suburbanization armed with a workable definition I set to work cataloging all of the pedestrian malls I quickly realized why we don't have an exact number already it's really hard to find all of them there are some existing catalogues but most are from the 1970s so they don't get all of the malls there were some other lists too but they didn't all use my definition and some had inaccuracies for example many lists regards Sacramento's pedestrian mall as removed because in 1987 it was converted into a transit mall and later opened to traffic but not all of it was removed here's some proof a perfectly fine existing pedestrian mall lined with restaurants and an IMAX theater so I set to work cross-referencing all of the existing lists trying to verify details on local news websites designed in 1997 and finding some malls nobody had listed as well when all was said and done I found 140 pedestrian malls that were built between 1959 and 1985 and met my definition here's a map of where they are lots cluster around Kalamazoo actually and a fair number out west too and here's a graph of when they were installed you can see that 1972-1974 is peak pedestrian mall and it kind of trails off after that by the late 70s City began removing their pedestrian malls we're still removing malls actually Victor grew and designed another mall in Fresno California that was rude a couple years back I have an old video on that go check it out before I forget I published a list of all of the pedestrian malls I found on a Google Doc I posted a link to it in the description if you have any information to add to my list please email me the article may be published but I wanted to keep adding malls and mall information as I can find it I think it'll be a useful resource to anyone doing research on this topic okay so 140 malls were built and a lot of them were removed how many of them still remain 45 it turns out I don't know what your reaction to that number is but I was surprised that so many were left that's nearly a third I mean how many pro sports stadiums built in the 60s and 70s are we still using today how many shopping malls built during that era are we still using today I am absolutely willing to concede that pedestrian malls are not the right urban design tool to shore up declining downtown retail sales but I'd argue that was an impossible task demographics and migration made it impossible to compete at the time what could a small study have built that could have competed against the local shopping mall probably nothing and despite this 45 malls still survived and are alive and kicking well not all of them are kicking a few are pretty dead like this one in Reading Cal but others a majority actually are really vibrant spaces like the ped mall in Iowa City Iowa pearl Street in Boulder Colorado or the Main Street Mall in Charlottesville Virginia if you are really perceptive you might have noticed that each of these are college towns and you might be thinking that's why they're still around there are plenty of college students to keep them feeling lively and keep the shops restaurants and bars in business I noticed this too and did some more research about why some pedestrian malls are still around and why others were removed I found some interesting things first of all pedestrian malls within one mile of a college campus were more likely to survive than those not near a college campus so college students probably do help malls built in warm climates like those found in Florida Hawaii and California are more likely to be around than the overall average nearly 60% of these malls are still around and pedestrian malls built in larger cities did better than those in small towns particularly in cities that gain population during the malls existence cities that lost population also lost their mall most of the time so it turns out that pedestrian malls and downtown shops both rely on the same thing foot traffic if a pedestrian mall is near a big source of pedestrians like college campuses beaches or tourist attractions they feel vibrant and lively nice weather gets people outside and keeps them walking longer into the winter months pedestrian malls can't generate foot traffic on their own though which is why they can't be used to save downtown retail they are best used in places where there already is a lot of foot traffic so that should really be the big takeaway here unless your city is installing a pedestrian mall or square or Plaza or whatever to save it declining retail Street you don't have to worry about the legacy of old pedestrian malls their public spaces just like these new ones being built and are reliant on sources of pedestrians to keep them Lively it's time to stop thinking about pedestrian malls is a cautionary tale but instead think of them as elder state spaces of the public realm so I recently did a viewer survey thanks to all who participated and when I asked about who else you all watch on YouTube I saw a lot of people mentioning creators like Wendover productions CGP grey real engineering and lindsay including City Beautiful so thanks for considering it you
