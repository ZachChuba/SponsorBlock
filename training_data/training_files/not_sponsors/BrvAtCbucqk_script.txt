Squarespace and you squarespace.com slash cow to get 10% off hi there and welcome to an all new segment called I don't know that's just the way it is stop asking questions in this show we pick a cultural norm that everyone takes for granted in society and pose the question why do we do this and instead of just being okay with the response I don't know that's just the way it is stop asking questions we actually examine the issue at hand and decide if we should keep it or kick it today's topic dyes opening doors for girls insulting or at or okay okay so this actually happened to a friend of ours the other day he was walking into a building and noticed a woman behind him so he decided to hold the door open and let her walk in first well this woman was not happy about that and proceeded to inform him that she did not need a man to open the door for her and this isn't the first time I've heard a story like this some women get upset when men do this sort of thing I guess they find it degrading or insulting more sexist because at its root holding the door open for anyone is really just an act of service it's sort of a way of saying hey I'm putting your need to get inside this building ahead of my need to do the same it's putting someone else's needs in front of your own it's supposed to just be an act of kindness and there's nothing wrong with that but that's not always the way it's received oh hey you're weak woman arms are probably gonna struggle to open up this massive door so you might as well let a hot man do it I'm so strong if that's how it comes across we've got a PR problem because at the end of the day the girl who chewed out my friend is right about the fact that she doesn't need a man to open the door fer and if some women are gonna take an act of kindness the wrong way well maybe it's just not worth it in fact maybe the act of kindness would be to not open the door for them so that they see that we recognize them as equals Oh after you no no after you please no no after you no seriously like I cannot go through this door into the building first before you do just go I mean girls opening doors for guys isn't a culturally accepted idea the way that guy's opening doors for girls is actually that's a really interesting idea what if this whole situation was reversed what if girls wanted to hold doors open for guys Oh after you oh come on I don't need you to hold the door open for me I'm perfectly capable I see okay well it feels a little weird that the girl is holding the door open for a guy and not the other way around doesn't that just feel a little bit off I mean forget the door this is like opening up Pandora's box I'll be honest guys this whole opening the door for girls thing is tough okay okay let's make a pros and cons list so that we can decide once and for all bro it's popularly understood as a gentlemanly thing to do but con it could look like a double standard Pro it's a nice gesture but cons some women might misunderstand your intentions bro it's an act of service but con it could act as a metaphor for perceived sexism all right all right it's time to make a ruling here let's get to it do we keep it or kick it hmm hey Pitt what on two very important conditions one you should open doors for everyone not just women if you're only opening doors for women that probably is some form of deep-seated chauvinism and two you can only open doors for girls if you're cool with girls opening doors for you too it just yon that would be a double standard all right so there you go solving the world one mystery at a time what are some other everyday things worth reexamining let us know in the comments below now if you'll excuse me I want to go open the door for my pooch because he's scratching at the door I think yes to go potty hey if you're looking to build a you go to Squarespace calm slash Cal thanks guys
