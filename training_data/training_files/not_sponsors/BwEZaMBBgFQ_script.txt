so uh it's been a couple of months i'm currently on my cnd blood solo only server uh it is max pop it just wiped about two hours ago uh so yeah i haven't actually played survival rust in literally like four months i mean i played a little bit recently uh on stream actually but for the most part not so much i've just been focusing on different things trying to take a little bit of a break from the solo series but i've had the itch to play for a little bit now so here we go [Music] 30 days only [Music] first things first let's just get a little bit of wood around this area and a couple of stone nodes that way we don't need to farm it later in an area we want to build but another thing i need right now is uh cloth so i can make a bow so let's go around and look for some real quick now since i last played there's a lot of new things in the game for one there's vehicles which is uh a pretty big change in rust honestly like you can literally set up a brewing stand and rust now and uh make some potions which is pretty sick and uh no it's not actually called a brewing stand but you get what i'm saying it's the same thing as minecraft [Music] i'm gonna grab this node right over here and this will be the last stone note i go for because uh if we die it'll be all a waste of time uh and then we'll figure out where we're gonna build here honestly looking at the map i think i would want to build somewhere around oh yeah definitely over here actually we have a mining outpost right here a gas station right here super branch airfield launch site it's probably going to be a hot spot but we're still going to go down there and check out the area well i'm gonna look around for some cloth so i can get enough rad protection and then we're gonna go for those crates [Music] i always like getting rope because now we can get some armor on let's go ahead and get that crafted actually some gears it's actually pretty nice a bunch of crates over here i actually really like this area uh i wouldn't mind building maybe like right here or something car parts which i don't care for more gears all right let's get some wood and then we'll build i think right around here to be honest i really like being around here all right okay let's go ahead and place this guy right in there perfect cool all right well we got our two by two secured so uh that's progress now let's make some boxes and in the morning we're gonna have to look around for some animals so that we can get some furnaces set up oh i literally hear a bore outside i don't really think i'm gonna be able to see him but we can oh there's a guy outside actually let's turn this off [Music] all right got all my boxes set up as well as my door and uh yeah i kind of wanted to make a tier one workbench though we're gonna need some more resources to do that first but we definitely need to make one soon so that we can get a crossbow crafted which will help me out quite a bit now hopefully i'm not getting door camped now i wanted to go around airfield to get a bunch of components and whatnot so let's go ahead and do that and then we'll come back and hopefully have enough resources for a tier woo hello yeah enough for a tier one workbench and a crossbow it also means we need metal actually and we don't have any at all so yeah we definitely need some more stuff first we should stop by the oil refinery actually with a little bit of wood just to get that cooking um well i lost my hatchet this is this oh [Music] oh that was so good looks like he was trying to build two let's see what he has oh nothing but we'll grab it anyways we actually need that wood and a bag let's go back to base i uh sort of forgot to put a bag down my base but now we have a melee which is really really nice and we have enough wood for the oil refinery so we'll go ahead and do that real quick right we'll put this guy right over here nice all right got everything i need uh hopefully we don't die cuz i'm also gonna recycle let's go in there back straight eye contact on point and we'll be fine let's go ahead and grab these barrels real quick as well wait what was that low quality pistons someone's been around here oh someone's raiding nearby that should be a decent distraction um that is really close actually that's near sewer branch as well well i'm gonna ignore that it's not like we're gonna do anything um let's see crates i'll take the pipes right that'll work we're getting loads of low grade feel right now which is really nice we'll be able to make two furnaces and then i'll keep the rest for other stuff okay so let's get a tier one down as well as a metal door if we have enough metal for it after that and we'll also get two furnaces set up a lot of barrels and stuff around here which is really good actually that's a great sign means oh shoot okay that was a scuffed fight in every way possible but this guy's actually kind of loaded that's another metal door for me well let's go ahead and quickly get this crate down here and then we'll book it back to base [Music] okay we made it let's go ahead and dump all of this good stuff in here and we'll change the door later i'm too lazy to do it now actually let's go to lighthouse i wanted to go through airfield real quick see if there's anybody over there okay i don't see anybody recycling over there so let's go see the other side and then we'll go straight up north i just heard another raid wait foot crate oh what the hell advanced basic uh okay how slow does it kill you though now i kind of want to take damage so i can try this out oh there's a guy right there maybe we can i'm gonna go around here first though [Music] oh here there he is he's got a ready actually okay okay now he's panicking [Music] there we go now we have a crossbow and a review which is nice all right oh gg let's go ahead and bring that back real quick hit him [Music] nice dude even a crossbow why does this guy run away oh 134 dude really okay well we have loads of stuff now all of a sudden this is awesome let's go ahead and research all of those things right now but in case we uh in case we get raided all right let's research that and then this bullet and we'll go ahead and craft up a review we'll make a bunch of them actually we'll make six i think they're all done crafting though it is about to be night time so yeah maybe we don't want to head out right now we should have a little bit of time actually before it's pitch black out oh uh okay so it's the morning i was just chilling here until it was the morning but i do see an air drop shirt ahead i think i might go to it and risk my review i just like when air drops fall during the night because it just makes it so that less people are likely to go to it hit him i shot him he might be dead no he's not yoka okay see if he actually did more damage to me that's when one of those healing pots would come in really really handy it's like a cheaper and easier to get med kit ooh that air drop is totally gonna get yanked it's okay though i'd rather be safe and bring back some good gear here i hear someone farming another healing pot hit him what the i can't even jump uh well that guy's definitely gonna escape by the time i get there that's kind of annoying [Music] let's depot this quickly okay is this dude still over there oh i see someone coming in from uh over there uh i think he was stalking me as well he's about to go through those walls though oh [Music] okay the back door is open i'm gonna try to sneak in this is sketchy dude this guy's really good at hiding uh scared there's no way he escaped that's impossible i would have seen or heard something unless he was underground could have been okay yeah he is totally underground he would have been right there i think oh my god that scared me well gg i did not expect that dude who does that dude first death of the wife and it's a guy that's sitting in a corner inside outside of airfield oh god i think it's this guy what did he say i didn't even know what he said oh oh god oh someone's outside [Music] where are you oh god i did not see that dude show up okay good thing i only brought out my bow oh i see a guy up there i think he might be coming towards me oh i see another guy going into airfield actually he's gonna be right there yeah i see him hopefully he's coming in here he's researching cool uh what the hell did he just research i have no idea but he has this metal pickaxe in here which uh i can't research so i assume no he didn't even research a hatchet since he has one on him okay then uh i'm gonna go let's go depot this inside the base a lot of bullets holy crap for one revolver i think i just heard someone on my right right let's put all this stuff in here all right oops oh that's researched and let's go ahead and research this perfect all right well we've actually got quite a few things to research so far in the first episode i like it [Music] oh god damn it was on the phone oh that is so annoying dude i was literally on the phone dude that is so frustrating what a bad timing i couldn't have just not answered though i had to answer that was like literally the worst timing the second i pick up i get head oh god there's a guy coming out i don't even have this reloaded oh god is that a gun did i down him i did oh it's a crossbow i got a jackhammer though i'll take that two of them basic healing tea okay oh this guy right here hit him all right let's go back out quickly before it's night time [Music] oh he was one hit uh 44 i don't care about any of this we'll keep going actually i want to put an outside back right around here there we go [Music] oh god uh i got off for a little bit and now we have a new neighbor who happened to build exactly where i wanted to build oh star shots i kind of want to go to that actually i was going to go look for this guy unless we find him here but oh yeah he's right there i missed damn it [Music] kept shooting the tree okay what do you have decent amount of stuff now this would be a good time to use one of those uh tees but yeah let's go bring that back and i'm gonna stay away from this guy over here oh yeah we're gonna have to stay away from this guy [Music] [Applause] got that researched i still want to go to that star fight 100 so we're going to go do that someone's coming up there actually i'm gonna stay away [Music] okay uh oh is the guy nearby i need that bear actually let's get a bone knife oh hello come on dude pick me up no okay let's go get a bone knife someone's outside what is happening to this guy he's just lagging all right let's head back out someone shooting at me from where [Music] what what uh oh i think we got a case of a cheater cheater on my own server yeah this guy's cheating okay let's let him kill me this guy's cheating 100 i had to let that guy kill me so he can ban him [Music] uh i guess i'll be doing this while recording the soul series that is hilarious i've had to catch a cheater while recording my first episode of the solo series that is awesome alrighty well let's teleport to him and uh yeah let's see what the heck he's doing well who did he j i think he just tried to shoot this uh nomad guy up here i'm i'm literally almost positive he just tried aimbot shooting him up there oh actually just got reported cheating esp that's literally the person we're looking at that is hilarious he's already knows he's up there he literally knows he's up there here let's let's unvanish right here and uh see him coming up just like this look he's gonna come he's already coming straight for me i'm right here and look we already know he's gonna come up here and shoot me watch he's sneaking up he's sneaking up and yep yep okay he just knew immediately that i was there and headshot me uh well anyways uh we already know that he's cheating just by the fact that he was uh oops spamming his uh weapon there [Music] yep yep yep yep all right i'm gonna ban him right now man that's a shame i was the first person to die to this guy uh who would have you know technically reported him if it wasn't my own server but since it is my own server i was able to jump on and actually ban him but it just sucks that there are people like this that go around and cheat anyways let's get back on the server right well now that we got that guy out of the way let's get kitted up again unfortunately when i lose my loot to a cheater i lose my loot to a cheater i'm not gonna give myself any extra items or anything like that that's not fair oh hello i'm gonna i'm gonna let him waste all of his shells and then i'm gonna kill him obviously i could kill him but it's literally like barely any sulfur worth of of shells so it really doesn't matter i'd rather just let him do this while i heal up to a hundred right as i go to ban a cheater this is what i get in return i get an offline raid that isn't going to work but i mean you know it's still funny he's distracted [Music] don't worry about him keep doing it i respect the hustle you gotta raid what's around you you know i respect it here let's quickly see what it's at okay 104. actually i want to stay right here as soon as he breaks it i'm gonna be right here this is so good okay i can't wait for him to break through though oh and here he is he's he's gonna have a little bit of difficulties doing this with a hazy guy around um just the one but i keep running out of ammo that's so funny dude little does he know i'm gonna get rid of these pesky neighbors don't worry hey dude you're not getting rid of anybody all right here we go it was at this moment that he knew he [ __ ] up oh my god that is so satisfying yeah oh [ __ ] you got online no damn no i've been waiting [Music] all right well uh i'm gonna get my revvy back and i think we're gonna go out and look for some more people i guess he still wasted his time though um i really wanted a water pipe i'm a happy guy now i still need to grab my uh review wherever the hell it is but this is a golden item for me that guy is not having a great day i'm gonna go ahead and assume that he's gonna leave here in a moment what is he doing it's him again i i just i don't get it oh he's has he oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so dude what is happening everyone's a potato right now including me we're all potatoes like we're literally all big sacks of potatoes just hanging out in the same bag like i'm so confused that was the weirdest thing i've ever said anyways like dude i'm just i don't understand whatever man i'm not even gonna think about it now let's go sniff out what that dude had i can't believe that guy like i don't know i i kept thinking he was gonna run out of bullets oh i hear him [Music] oh and he's dead might have been the same guy that i killed earlier another water pipe i think he did loot himself yeah this was definitely the same guy was it yeah yeah okay unlucky and that is where this first episode is going to end i hope
