welcome back to new rockstars I'm Eric vos and the Marvel Cinematic Universe just extended forward even further into the future with a third ant-man film confirmed for release in 2022 Paul Rudd returning the Scott Lang Michael Douglas returning this Hank Pym Peyton Reed returning to direct and hopefully Lewis returning to narrate the whole movie because that would be awesome as we saw in Avengers in games Scott Lang's experiences in the quantum realm proved to be crucial to the Avengers victory and there's still so much about the quantum realm that week to go from hidden cities in the background to Clues pointing to human mutation and evolution and yes the continued existence of vortexes that enable time travel how will ant-man 3 explore these mysteries along with the loose threat of an older Cassandra Lang to set up the next generation of Avengers I will discuss these questions in this episode of inside Marvel [Music] okay let us first explain this new Marvel film timeline 2021 will be a packed here for the MCU with shang-chi and the legends of the ten rings coming February 2021 followed by Wanda Bishan coming on Disney Plus and spring 2021 then Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness in May 2021 the Loki Disney Plus series in that spring spider-man 3 coming that July the Marvel animated what-if series on Disney Plus in that summer the Hawkeye Disney Plus series in fall and then Thor 11 Thunder finishing 2021 in November as I said packed that brings us to 2022 which we previously have heard will release Black Panther 2 in May 20-22 and this ant-man 3 film according to Michael Douglas is scheduled to begin production in January 2021 which could put it on track for Marvel's release date of February 18 20 22 but more realistically with all of its visual effects more likely release date would be July 29 2022 meanwhile that February date could be the idea release date for the marshal Ollie Blade reboot but why is this timeline so important well note that this third ant-man film will come after the Wanda vision and multiverse of madness events after the third spider-man film after the Hawkeye series which is cast Hailee Steinfeld is Kate Bishop and after the five year blip period of Avengers in game Cassie Lang is now an older teenager played by Emma Furman essentially the MCU is Lane much of the groundwork to establish the next generation of the Avengers do carry the torch the Young Avengers so quick summary on The Young Avengers from the Marvel Comics first introduced following the Avengers disassembled storyline in 2005 The Young Avengers featured iron lad Nathaniel Richards a descendant of Reed Richards Hulk lean son of a Kree and a scroll Patriot grandson of the one-time cap Isiah Bradley Wiccan reincarnated son of Scarlet Witch and vision Hawkeye Kate Bishop and Cassandra Lang carrying her father's legacy now as this size changing hero stature Nathaniel Richards has an Iron Man like suit in which he uploads the remnants of visions operating system where he discovers a failsafe plan to rebuild the Avengers should the adult Avengers ever be defeated Nathaniel forms this group to take on Kang the Conqueror a time-traveling villain who is for its a future version of Nathaniel Richards yeah it's pretty great huh and you can definitely the dots of the upcoming MCU titles and see how they could absolutely be in the process of assembly and something similar to this Young Avengers team and ant-man the wasp Cassie Lange when she was younger hinted at her desire to follow in her father's footsteps so maybe you just need some watching back like a partner do I do didn't you think me you I'd be a great partner peanut hmm it would be awesome and now that Cassandra is a bit older and presumably a bit more coordinated yeah cuz angeling really could be awesome as stature and by this time we will also have Hailee Steinfeld as a young Hawk I keep Bishop checked check now Wiccan comes about after the Scarlet Witch house of M event something I have a feeling the Wanda vision series could adapt since house of M is the best-known Scarlet Witch story and if they're making a Wanda Maximoff series they'd be crazy not to bring it in in some form Wanda vision could end with the reveal of mutants in the MCU which could include her son Wiccan someone Wanda manifested from her mind along with Wiccans sister speed before having another mental breakdown and declaring mutants in this case wanted could wish for mutants in order to better arm and protect earth against future threats but what about iron lad could this character already exist in the MCU I think it's possible you've been looking closely but before I doesn't have to worry so much about body scaping yet iron lad who is this guy in the MCU well some of specula that iron lad could have been established in characters like Harley keiner who did randomly appear at Tony Stark's funeral and endgame or perhaps Tony Stark's daughter Morgan Stark both these characters seem like potential future engineers with very bright futures but a reminder that spider-man far from home included a few potentially big nods to the Fantastic Four joining the MCU both in its final scene Peter glided through the newly constructed atrium of Avengers tower implying new occupants perhaps Reed Richards transforming the tower into the Baxter building and on the street level behind Peter and MJ was that sign we can't wait to show you what comes next one two three question mark usually for is what comes next in that sequence but good before more Bradley to just these four but even so the Fantastic Four arriving in phase four just to perfect so I think the third spider-man film could be the ideal opportunity to introduce characters from Marvel's first family could be Reed Richards or his descendants Nathaniel Richards and if the MCU does plan to go full Young Avengers the groundwork is also completed to bring in Kang the Conqueror again the quantum realm remains quite the land of mystery Janet Van Dyne explained her survival to Hank Pym and most cryptic words the adaptation is part of it but some of it is evolution is out of that subatomic layer they passed an Easter Egg that Peyton Reed hid in the background imagery a quantum realm city suggesting some form of civilization on that level now we have discussed before how the city could be the kind of subatomic civilization introduced in the early Fantastic Four comics microworld also described a subatomic ax a place where Doctor Doom while trying to shrink the Fantastic Four that himself shrinking into oblivion but actually we found out later he became ruler of this micro world and used it to mountains come back against the Fantastic Four the MCU could use this quantum realm city to similarly establish a new villain as its ruler but since the quantum realm of the cinematic universe contains time vortexes it would be the perfect place to establish a time-traveling villain Kang the Conqueror future version of the young Nathaniel Richards Peter Parker perhaps meets in his next film perhaps the way Scott Lang without Tony Stark's time-traveling navigation device chaotically grew older and younger when trying to explore the quantum realms time vortexes that could be how Kang the Conqueror ends up the way he does look I know it almost sounds crazy but it's got to make a lot more sense coming out of Janet Van Dyne mouth as she explains the weird subatomic city and it's weird mayor that she lived thirty years with - Cassandra Lang and ant-man 3 aka ant-man and stature maybe there's a better name there anyway how do you think the third ant-man film will set up the MCS future comment down below with your thoughts follow me on Twitter
