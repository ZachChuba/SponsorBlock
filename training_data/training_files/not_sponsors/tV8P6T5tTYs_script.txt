I'll do the trick get him drinking that a couple of months back nvidia published the data from a study showing that gamers running on high refresh rate monitors with faster pcs were fragging more noobs than their pleb counterparts who were running low refresh rate monitors and slower computers of course their conclusion was everyone should buy better gear to make them a better gamer the problem with their study is that while they did find a correlation between people with better equipment and people with more skills a correlation does not mean causation so a lot of arguments get made about the subject of high fps and high refresh rate gaming and how many FPS is enough before the I can't see a difference but one of the key components of a faster refresh rate display is not in fact the smoothness of the animation and it is smoother please don't be ignorant but rather the frequency with which your eye receives updated information about the whereabouts and activities of your enemies so today's video is all about determining quantitatively how much faster a gamer with a 240 Hertz display will react versus a gamer with a more traditional 60 Hertz display and we invited a special guest gavin free of slo-mo guys and roosterteeth fame is gonna help us operate this thing to do it I don't know how to operate this thing thank goodness he's here I can you today at the link in the video description first we want to know if our 240 Hertz gamer sees the enemy sooner that is to say we want to know if the up to 12 milliseconds of extra information actually helps him or her react faster we also want to know on average if the smoother animations and the more frequent updates allow our gamer test subject here to kill the enemy sooner or more reliably so here's our test rig on the right hand side we've got our enemy or our target which is running a cs go server on our high-speed local area network every test needs to be run exactly the same way so what we'll do is position this computer's character in this corner right here so it's in exactly the same spot then we'll use this readout in the top left to make sure that our weapon is pointed at the exact same pixel then what we do is we take these two contacts and touch them together which lights up an LED on our makeymakey right here that is going to synchronize with our high-speed camera when exactly our target begins moving without making any noise that will alert our test subject so we're going to be using the same monitor from Acer for both our 60 Hertz and our 240 Hertz tests since the only variable that we're trying to isolate is the refresh rate each of our test subjects gets to practice runs at 60 Hertz to ensure that they're familiar with the test then we'll follow with three runs at 60 three runs at 240 and then four runs two at 60 and two at 240 where the test subject isn't told the monitor refresh rate each time so the way that this works is once again I'm pointing at exactly the same spot exact pixel and then Ed without me being able to see what he's doing starts running at some point now let's talk about our timing mechanism so it's probably a little overkill but this here is a what is this walk us through this is the fencin flex 4k it's what I've used for a long time on my channels about a five-year old camera this point there's not really any storage media that can write so fast when you're taking in that many images so it requests when internal Ram buffer so it's always recording five second buffer and then all I do is just stop it and it keeps the previous five seconds then we record that onto this very fast flash storage these are expensive sadly so the way the camera works speed wise it has a certain amount of throughput it can put in and then you just find the combination of resolution and speed that you want so if you lower the resolution the frame rate goes higher sure so what are we going to be using well that's up to you early I shoot everything at 4k which will give us a max of a thousand which would probably do pretty well in these lighting conditions it's kind of dark at 2000 and also we are relying on the light coming from the monitors which I was slightly concerned about but it looks like it's not too dark okay that's so much like we have right and then what should or disappear is the frame because huh this is like how a fly sees us like that's what I always think of yeah it's like we just look like that to fly it just like casually fly off and flip us off and we come nowhere close which I do like a self slap or someone else gets loved yet how do you want it you want to slap me you know it has to be pretty hard right you set up all this test just so you could screw around with a high-speed camera right now this is irrelevant you just wanted the high-speed camera to get slapped around that's the whole reason you're here that's why okay alright slap it [Music] my ears ringing oh you know I missed the trick we do that again you did not you let you it dragged some skin with that one look at you know we can't we get two new staff headshot it's like everyone's face is tough what you messed up okay practice run time you need to have like both hands over there so I have no movement indication as to when you're when you're so you want me to trigger it even if you miss I mean when you miss I mean if you miss that moment when you invite someone out and they like insult you but bonding so it takes me a good long while to actually even start tracking the target that's what's gonna be interesting about this test with the additional frames that you'll get what was I doing what was I aiming at the car I think this video is really about exposing flaws in counter strikes hit detection what did you hit there because I didn't see any impacts and it looked like it was right on him in your defense thank you so what we learned from our first run is that the experiment looks good but we're gonna do a remedial test here with the walking speed of our target slowed down from 322 to 20 but we also want to try a remedial run here with the walking speed of our target at 220 to see if that increases our subject chances of killing the target so let's try it one more time here okay that's definitely easier one of the measurements I'm really looking for here is time to kill because you're still gonna clearly be faster to kill the target it's just a matter of like wow I really left this to the last moment here Oh what did I hit did you have a metal skull what was that I probably a helmet not a metal school I think a thousand is doing it for you I think so we're cuz that's one millisecond there's nothing like anyone even advertises as lower than one millisecond and I think that's considered well beyond the ability of a human to perceive anyway it also makes the math really easy yeah that's actually the biggest factor thank you so much again by the way for like being here this is oh I loved it okay good cuz your your insight here has actually been instrumental already to us just kind of understanding what we're doing yeah this is this is super fun for me Rock Paper Scissors for who has to go first do you the kind of person you'd like to say it as you do it when you just rock paper and then you go right you go on paper no no on scissors okay ah [Music] trusty wrong alright okay so I'm first one thing that's really important is that Edie is gonna mix up his timing for when he starts the test so I can't predict when the target is gonna start moving okay I am officially ready me to [Music] shoot but not hit a oh my god how did I miss that if it makes you feel any better this is 84 seconds of unison do you find that when you're in deep concentration and you're waiting for it to happen I'm do you find that you should start overthinking when it's gonna happen and then you might miss it cause you're thinking too much absolutely oh [ __ ] did you just fall out of the zone right there at the end I don't know what happened to the eye that seemed to be the longest it took you to catch up with them interesting we are now up to four hundred and sixty-six gigs Wow okay that's certainly like less than twenty seconds [Music] gotcha okay Oh headshot shoot hit him [Music] hey are you ready wait for it now I'm ready you got a piece of them [Music] not bad feel like I'm improving see I'm happy with my reaction time my aim is anus it was very tight anus not bad wait a minute what just happened I pressed play and oh my god I am so sorry my best attempt and he deleted it can I feel like we should go until he gets a really good one yeah the 60 just don't do it for me [Music] Wow good that's it more last minute no I don't think so I even see the body oh that was clean that might be my fastest one yet yeah mate make sure you save that one yeah yeah I got you fam we like that one I am ready as penis that count [Music] I'm just got wet I went way ahead of him that time so your reaction was fast but not accurate I was trying to go for like a wicked snap shot that I don't have that ability I'm literally the most experienced I could possibly be and that was my worst attempt this is so interesting oh oh wait do you want to do some practice runs or have you already tried it a lot of times Wow mr. confident over here I think that was actually back and forth like I see at least five tears when I play yeah I think we can call out of wait so you want me to not to save that one yeah I don't bother [Music] [Music] all right everyone go home guys that was it already moving before he's even fully come out that's by far the fastest reaction we've seen boom headshot as the kids say I suppose the kids 15 years Oh boohoo whatever not bad did you hit me yeah felt like it okay last chance [Music] wow I wasn't good what are you doing that was a headlight so it has been quite a few hours the time is now 1141 and we're all still at it especially edy who has been painstakingly compiling the data and is now sharing it with us so your average for 60 Hertz is 257 yeah is that in frames yes but that's 257 milliseconds effectively okay and then 194 for 240 Hertz so that doesn't even make sense how you could be that much faster because theoretically you should only have that best a 12 millisecond advantage interesting so I am the slowest by a long shot oh you're up in the 300 sometimes yeah that's an eternity now could be that you waited to see the person quite a bit more and then I guess so now you were the most consistent consistently average I feel like whenever I saw anything I would just kind of spasm my hand away and try and just catch up with it later but I think that's just down to me is just not being very good maybe it was more of a focus thing yeah audience this was actually previously passed 854 milliseconds and when you consider that I had a 360 millisecond reaction time it actually only took me half a second to kill the target once I started moving that's really good actually not as good a second and a half overall and kill wise you're the same [Music] look it is fake humility hey I feel like there's so many more variables that aren't measured here like how in the zone we were like what the the other person is psyching us out as I must this is the pressure building up I feel like on my last attempt I was always freaking out way more than my previous ones yeah actually that's another thing too like if I missed one I was like tense on my next one I gotta make up for for a bad one if I only concentrated on being ready for the guys to come around the corner and I was all I was thinking about I could only do that for like four seconds until I was thinking about doing that and it would just wreck my concentration I mean obviously we're watching this in slow motion so it's very exaggerated but this makes me wonder how I ever played anything at 30 frames a second and I regularly do like if I'm playing GTA 5 on xbox that's running 30 this may have ruined me even more for refresh rates and frame rates alright so GAD flew home last night but for giggles we spent some more time analyzing the data and found some really cool things one everyone's reaction times were better at 240 Hertz and strangely by more than just 12 milliseconds if I had to guess I'd say part of this is because it's easier to track where the target is headed and then decide where to move the cursor before you begin to move to every single test subject was more likely to kill the opponent at 240 Hertz in the limited amount of time that they had and three the way that high refresh rate affects your gaming could end up being heavily dependent on the way that you aim so take a look at this map of all of my shots my accuracy and my precision were both actually very similar at 60 versus 240 Hertz so regardless of refresh rate I'm taking my time tracking the target and only pulling the trigger when I think I've got a clean shot and it's funny it's not something I've ever thought about would it make sense now that I'm looking at it because I'm totally one of those jackasses that grabs the sniper class so everyone else has to play medic or whatever so for me revealing my position is always a factor in the back of my mind don't pull the trigger unless I think I'm gonna hit something all right now let's look at Ed's 'el Ed's more of like a flick shot kind of player so he tends to react and shoot first and figure out the other details later now as the most skilled of our test subjects she clearly benefited the most from high refresh rate and said that it helped him time the release of his shot much better as he panned across his target finally there's gap in fairness to gap no one really aims only with their mouse like it's much easier to strength while you're trying to line up a shot like this but his results were still far and away the worst at both refresh rates if that said at 240 Hertz his precision was much higher so if he was a little closer to the target the improvement in his consistency would have definitely resulted in more kills so in conclusion yes high refresh rate gaming makes a difference it's the kind of thing we've always felt but it was never something that we've quantified now I think there's still a lot more work to do investigating this may be part two could involve different mouse sensitivity settings some professional players I don't know hit us up in the comments if you've got some ideas but for now we feel like this is a pretty good place to leave it and we've definitely something speaking of learning something I want to teach you about our sponsor ring wants you to know who is at your front door without ever getting off the couch their welcome kit includes the video doorbell to their spotlight cam battery and there's solar security sign and their video doorbell too has tons of great features it's got a motion sensor camera 1080p HD resolution with 160 degrees of vision two-way audio and it's powered by a battery or eight to 24 volt AC doorbell wiring their spotlight camera has 1080p HD video two-way talk LED lights battery or solar power sources and a siren the audio is great as well and you can turn away unwelcome guests or tell them to come right in just because someone's an unwelcome guest doesn't mean that they can't come into your house like say for example your mother-in-law hey I've used that joke before but that's okay it's still funny my personal favorite is telling the Amazon driver not to run away after the
