with roasted roman style romanesco
that's right i was going to start with a joke about this being a vegetable
brought to earth by aliens but these days if i did 30 to 40 percent
of the country would believe me so instead i will just say it looks like
a vegetable brought to earth by aliens and because of its bizarre and unusual
appearance this is the kind of thing people pass over in the market
mostly because they're confused by it and not sure quite what to do with it
well stay tuned because i'm going to show you exactly what to do with it
and if you do what i do you're going to be enjoying one of the most delicious
vegetables you've ever had so with that let's go ahead and get
started with how to prep romanesco and the first thing i do is usually
remove any of these tough stems and leaves from the outside
which you can do by pulling off although it's probably easier if we just cut
those off when we portion this and to do that what we'll attempt to do
is cut this directly through the center into two pieces and then like i said we
can use our knife to trim off any of those tough stems on the outside
and then if we wanted we could roast these just like this but because that
core in the center is so large and thick i think this cooks a lot more evenly if
we actually cut these again into quarters but make sure you know exactly
where that core is so you're cutting right through the center of it
and that's it once we have our romanesco heads broken down into quarters
we will simply set those aside while we mix up a very simple dressing with which
we're going to coat these with before we roast them
and that's going to start with a few olive oil packed anchovy fillets
to which we will add some olive oil and then what we'll do is take the back of a
fork and give these a little bit of a mashing
which if you want you can leave kind of coarse like i'm going to
or if you're afraid of people seeing you put anchovies in something they're about
to eat you could smash this down all the way to
a paste so you decide i mean you are after all the johnny cash
of how fine the mash and speaking of rings of fire once
that's been accomplished we'll go ahead and add some red pepper flakes
as well as some freshly squeezed lemon juice
and then what we'll do once we have everything in the bowl is give that a
quick mix with our fork to create a temporary emulsification at
which point we'll stop and add our cut up romanesco
and then we'll take a couple clean hands and we'll get in there and we'll get in
there deep and we will toss these until they are
completely and utterly coated with that dressing
and then what we'll do once we're 110 sure those pieces have been 100
coated as it will stop and sprinkle over some plain breadcrumbs
as well as a very generous grating of real parmesan cheese
right out of all the recipes you could get away with using fake parmesan
this is not one of them so go get yourself a nice chunk of
parmigiano-reggiano and do this right oh and by the way
because our anchovies are salty and we're going to use a good amount of
parmesan here i did not add any salt at this point
but if you want to add a little bit go ahead although we can always add a
little more when we're eating and it's impossible to take some out but
anyway once that's been crumbed in cheese we'll go ahead and give that a
toss at which point it's ready to transfer
into some kind of roasting pan into which we've drizzled a generous
amount of olive oil and we'll go ahead and place those in
fun side up and then once those have been placed in we'll make sure to scrape
out any of those cheesy crumbs in the bowl
and sort of scatter those evenly over the top since all that stuff's going to
brown up and crisp up beautifully as this roasts
speaking of which to hedge our bets once that's done we'll go ahead and grate
some more parmesan over the top and please don't be shy and then for one
last touch we'll go ahead and drizzle these with olive oil
at which point is ready to transfer into the center of a 475 degree oven
for about 20 minutes or so or until everything is beautifully browned and
looking incredibly gorgeous and more importantly our romanesco is
tender but you can't see tender you can only feel tender so we'll go
ahead and give that the old polka poke with a knife
and i confirmed the mine was in fact perfectly tender
which means it's ready to serve which i decided to do garnish with some little
lemon wedges plus one last drizzle with olive oil
except if you place the lemon down first and then drizzle the oil over the top
you're gonna end up with what we call in the business
slippery lemon so it's probably a much better idea to do your olive oil first
and then garnish with your lemon wedges alright i make these mistakes so you
don't have to but anyway once incorrectly garnished i
went ahead and grabbed a fork and knife and dug in
and that my friends bizarre appearances aside is one of the most delicious
vegetables you will ever taste and i know it does look like it's going
to taste like a cross between cauliflower and broccoli
which it sort of does but at the same time it really does have a unique flavor
all its own okay it's kind of sweet and nutty and
definitely milder and not quite as bitter as broccoli
but to summarize what it really tastes like is romanesco
and while it is quite delicious just roasted like this it's also very very
nice with a little squeeze of slippery lemon
so this really is a beautiful way to serve it but my favorite way
and why i didn't put any garlic in the dressing would be served next to a
beautiful garlic aioli and yes that is redundant and while it
would be perfectly acceptable to serve this as a side dish
i really do think serve like this is more than special enough to serve on its
own so i just went ahead and turned it into
an entree and why something like this works so well with aioli
and also why we use so much olive oil is because the fatal flaw with vegetables
is they don't have any fat content so by simply enjoying them with some
flavorful fatty ingredients we make up for that and it really does
help bring out and enhance all their natural goodness
especially something like this romanesco which is surprisingly savory
and certainly more than worthy to be eaten with a fork and steak knife
and if you're thinking he sounds kind of overly excited for eating a roasted
vegetable well then i'm guessing you never had
roasted roman style romanesco because this stuff really is fantastic
so the next time you're at the market sometime between late summer and early
fall and you see this gorgeous but bizarre looking vegetable
that may or may not have been brought to this planet by aliens
i really do hope you pick some up and give this a try soon
