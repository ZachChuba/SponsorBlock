but did you make it so that it goes everywhere uh yeah I think so okay all right it's gonna like hey we're just gonna Yolo this what's up yeah we have no idea if YouTube is getting a stream or not not a clue we're using the you the new YouTube streaming thing so that's that's pretty sweet we've got a great show for you guys today we're gonna be checking out the new smart toilets that analyze your your urine and add so I have no idea wait what is okay when show there we go why is it called bet that is not what I entered in there yeah it says market it sure does this is what I love so much about YouTube okay oh no oh no there's my where's my capture card where's my connection okay this is so stupid so okay wait that's my no no I want to that's not what I was sure I want to show I want to show this one that's a computer screen here we go so that's what this computer looks like right now smart toilets will diagnose your whatever this this dream is a thing III entered all the things in here bears they're saved but no you know what okay fine screw it that's what we're doing today yeah um what happened no one watch the vaad is gonna understand this because it's probably gonna be properly titled oh right because we scheduled the stream to start at 5:15 I don't even care anymore other great topics today Facebook buys beat games I am so upset why does Facebook have to own everything I love beat Sabre and there's some there's some bad news in here what are you what are your favorite topics of the day the the deep fake thing is probably good so China and the US are both enabling deep fake laws that are gonna make it like punishable to post deep fakes without saying that there's a deep fake in it at least somewhere so that's probably good just due to the like legitimate fake news possibilities that could come with that yeah what is this why is there a giant all caps word Oh Kai no they're the guys that have actually helped us out a lot with their software for like basically red footage is really difficult to deal with because you don't have thumbnails and windows so it's like hard to tell what files you're looking at and red has their own media browser but it like sucks so Kai no software allows us to more easily go through red footage in order to figure out like which footage we should use for we're over there in voiceovers and editing and stuff like that whenever the writers need to look through it they're having a Black Friday sale and I told them I would give them a shout out well yeah so there you go there you go I forget what their site is oh yeah and the smart toilet which was a college humor skit from like a long time ago less paint software that's uh kind of there you go cool no I already talked about the smart toilet one oh but okay no that's fine looking both like that one you know you can make the Yule Log your news if you'd like hey you look plain yeah eight K not yet but it's coming right now it's up to 4k but honestly I am terrified because okay what we'll talk we'll talk about it later okay Rachel [Music] [Music] so long logged in on that one because then we can use your screen for that all right why don't we jump right into our headline topic today which is supposed to be smart toilets but instead is okay when show ok Rachel whatever freaking reason so this was this was originally posted by William CLL on the Linus tech tips forum and basically the man this is this is hilarious the original article is actually hospital health.com dot au and the news is that smart toilets could end up being one of the most powerful health tracking tools that you own you know forget about forget about Apple watch Apple needs to get into the Apple toilet business so this is according to researchers at the University of wisconsin-madison and the morgridge Institute for research urine contains a liquid history of an individual's nutritional habits their exercise their medication use their sleep patterns and other lifestyle choices also metabolic links to more than six hundred human conditions including kidney disease diabetes and cancer diabetes so the team is designing a smart toilet that will incorporate a portable mass spectrometer that will recognize you and process samples across a variety of subjects testing could show how an individual metabolizes their medicines or sorry metabolize a certain types of prescription drugs in ways that could be healthy or dangerous i could indicate whether people are taking their medications properly and if those medications are having their intended effects and has like major health implications for large populations of people like if you had tens of thousands of users and you could correlate that data with health and lifestyle you could start to have real diagnostic capabilities and make like real recommendations for people to to better their health and better their lives it might even provide early a viral or bacterial outbreaks but here's the issue how long is it gonna take before your insurance company taps into your smart toilet data data is just sold to anyone at the lowest bid possible just whatever who knows like you what was it ring recently came out that they're like gonna be working with the police to randomly that's not recent that's like door below surveillance cameras yeah with facial recognition on it so like if someone walks by your door they're just like me yeah sweet I don't know everything's crazy so in 2014 Adult Swim uploaded a video to YouTube called smart pipe and starts with this frame which is one of my favorite things ever are you gonna - yeah I'm gonna go screen which I just think is absolutely great but basically I'm not you should watch it cuz it's hilarious if you're above a certain age I guess because I don't know it's Adult Swim okay yeah it's not children swim yeah that's not kiddie pool yeah we don't want pee in the pool yeah but I don't know at least not kid pee lots of adults pee in the pool too we I think we need laws around personal data to be way more sophisticated than they are now for stuff like this to be realistic because like if there was very strong powerful laws around personal data I think I'd be down with something like this I don't think the YouTube stream is set to public really it's just everyone's here so bad oh people are here okay oh it must just be that this chat is broken there's 4,000 people watching yeah this chats broken it's just like there's like nobody nobody commented nice yeah brilliant what our YouTube say okay when okay Rancho all right carry on men yeah but yeah I think I'd be okay with it if there was very sophisticated laws around personal data yeah but there isn't no so I'm not but tell me this yeah okay why don't we talk why don't we talk about a hypothetical better society that we live in okay okay so in this hypothetical better society where there's universal health care so you don't have to worry about your insurance provider hiking up your rates okay I mean how valuable of a tool is this you know like do you do you run out and spend let's say it's not cheap what is this a portable mass spectrometer I don't know how much those cost targeted advertising is gonna be a big thing sure yeah like I don't entirely know because I'm not very good with biology I don't know how you could manipulate this data what if it could save your life what have you got what if you got okay you know what forget it let's not talk about a different society let's let's talk about exactly the same society we're in right now so you run the risk of your personal health information getting out there you run the risk of targeted ads based on based on like this guy loves weed we need to send him all the weed ads or whatever the case may be yeah loves chips this guy eats so many sighing those into the last oh yeah sure whatever point is bacon they can send you all the marketing data they can they can adjust your your insurance premiums based on this data what if your insurance premiums went up and you looked at nothing but Doritos ads for the rest of your life but you caught your cancer at an early enough stage that you live I don't that's so you think it's saying catching cancer for one is absolutely you could like there are there are hints for certain types of cancer in urine in urine and they are saying yes no this could actually save your life I think I'm generally going with liberty over just what we kind of sort of currently have so give me liberty or give me death yeah really yeah okay so what if it could change the way that we like what if this data okay here's another interesting angle on it so you're not gonna you're not gonna install one in your home no ok fine fair enough what if they're installed in public spaces do you want no no no actually that's a whole lot we can talk about that later what if other people install them and you get to benefit from the data then you you like heck yeah smart toilets everyone in your dog go out and buy smart toilet I'm not gonna promote them to install it but if they install it in a better society great I don't care that's totally up to okay all right that's still within the Liberty category they should be able to do whatever they want but you would choose to not know if you had a dangerous in fact in our current data environment yeah I think yes so tell me I don't think I don't necessarily think we're gonna stay in our current data environment and it depends on how I general help do we break out of it people are already talking about having like yeah personal I like blockchain based personal identification and stuff sure so you would be in more in control with that data and like this would have to not be sent out it'd have to be locally process but that's the thing unless it's it's not gonna happen it's not gonna happen you know it's not gonna happen I I didn't say I was sure it was going to happen right I mean the only the only purpose of having this data is if they can actually analyze it and have a big enough sample size in order to draw meaningful conclusions like that's the only and the only way that's a property properly anonymize it then and then that sure that comes to an issue with the current state of data laws and if they properly anonymize it a lot of the data is useless anyway because the only way that we can start to make use of some of these markers that we might start to get is if we then know okay that individual then developed this disorder you could you could give them a key okay so you just want like at like a cryptography cryptographically individualized but still anonymized till yeah the problem though is then that individual marker has to be shared somehow because otherwise when your family doctor is so you unless your replot relying on users to report like oh I was diagnosed with prostate cancer or you could give your doctor your which key yeah it's like if you trust your doctor which I think you should ethically be able to so hold on hold on okay let's back up first because there is okay there is technically yes strong data laws there already okay hold on so if you're relying on users to add their own data to the system we all know that's not gonna work well no I didn't know no no okay so that's not gonna work yeah but if you have to share it with a health care provider in order to have them update it the more places it goes yeah the easier it is to trace back to an individual and the less anonymized it becomes yeah so that's where that's where you make it so there should be data laws in place where if it is mishandled you get crushed the problem is that we have ow one second oh not very peace good one is like we have we have stuff where like like giant mega multi-billion dollar companies will leak tons of extremely important summation and lose like a 45 seconds worth of profit yes like like it needs to be actually impactful and modernize data loss so like it should be it should in my opinion it should be like like car crash style where like you get brought down for way more than the value of right was taken you know right so like if you get caught doing this you should get nailed for way more than you could have ever possibly profited all part of the problem with privacy though is that it's so hard to assign a dollar value to it yet so just massively inflated but but will massively inflate what like what is it what what is there there is marketable values for those sure things you actually can't figure that out is sort of unless it's it depends unless it's like some experimental data stream pun definitely intended there should be a brand called that for sure unless it's like a data stream that we don't have a well-established market value for how do you do that like what is what is the you know protein you know I would basically set it up like that person is now set set like I give them million and a half dollars two million dollars per individual screw it so just make it so no one's gonna do it here's the thing then if you are a company that wants to develop this kind of technology you know and you are you're a startup you aren't Facebook you aren't Google are you stifling innovation if through their best intentions they actually complete something you would be stifling you'd be stifling innovation is that what you want in certain rooms yes really okay yeah I don't want people to be I don't want a random factory in Ohio to be able to start strapping c4 on to drones because they think it might be good for mining like I want a stifle innovation in certain ways because it could be dangerous and let proper entities handle that that's true but what we're talking about here is not it's not like dangerous in the same sense that this is a really crappy discussion he has my name good job League there we go thank you very much I think this is something where like with the development of AI yeah where it's it's really hard to make laws leading up to it yeah when you don't know where it can go yet because like having that much biological information on a wide variety of people that can be attached to their name and their advertising profile and everything else who knows where that's gonna go that's terrifying yeah so I think you need to be heavy-handed at first so I guess back to back to the like the stifling innovation thing yeah here's the problem with that okay other people are just gonna do it anyways no not not not that necessarily I mean okay so there's a variety of problems because there's nothing you're gonna be able to do about you know other countries unless unless every country in the world is like yeah we're all going to handle this exactly the same way which they won't yeah it's probably not kind of do and then number two is that then you are basically guaranteeing that the only ones working on it are gonna be Amazon Google and Facebook do you really want been working on it why are why is that a thing because they're the only ones that could afford the fines if something does go wrong even by accident yeah I think the the data law kind of stuff that I would be talking about is if you are caught not in if you are caught cell like if you if you are caught benefiting from the misuse of the data I see but not if you are caught okay miss handling so let's circle it back around then because that comes to consumer trust if so if these laws do exist and they're not allowed to sell it do you install a smart toilet if it could save your life maybe then you consider it even knowing what you know about the odds of it being broken into at some point yeah mr. ill-considered depends who's doing it depends I would look I would be very interested in their technology stack how they're handling different things at cetera okay so you accept it as long as they don't have an incentive yeah to benefit yeah from in it and if they're being transparent about how they're interesting and I decide that I'm willing to accept that risk which in some ways of handling that data I think I would be then sure cool okay interesting all right that would be my stance on I'm gonna I'm gonna go for a very unpopular I mean to it I just do it yeah I would install it this could save my life or one of my kids lives I think I'm it's my opinion would probably change if I was a parent but then that's also I'm getting it I'm giving away my children's day I was just gonna say that some more advice that even my right I don't know dot some for have a whole other wine show just about that yeah you know when parents post a picture of their kid on Facebook is that their data to give away like who owns a child because it's not that simple its parent Guardian relationship from a legal standpoint parents really do make decisions for children in such a way as as they would for a dog like is that is that is that right if you make a Facebook account technically against EOS for your child who is underage and like put their name on it and their photos and make it public yeah it's interesting stuff I I'm happy I don't have to make these decisions heck yeah anyways we just talked about poop a bunch yeah well mostly urine actually is what they seem to be most pretty much focused on I think the old Adult Swim clip is mostly about poop and like rectal imaging and all this other so yeah here we go so it's analyzed locally well yeah but the in order for it to like in order for it to oh yeah this is an external server data sent oh there you go they sent out to user yeah I don't know that seems to be broadening as it comes out from the source too much rich source of cellular metabolize kidneys filter about half a cup of blood every minute blah blah blah so yeah liver disease infectious disease autoimmune disease heart disease GI disease diabetes Alzheimer's kidney disease cancer obesity there's like all kinds of things that you could potentially track with this that would be very useful for you know you to know we have the wrong freakin yeah we have the wrong title in the wrong thumbnail on the stream this is this is extraordinarily frustrating the way that YouTube just cannot seem to have this work like guys just just so you know we tried to have the right title for the land show and oh that's not the right one here we go where is it this compute yeah there it is this is this is everything set up correctly and theoretically set to public and streaming and just yeah it's it's hot garbage so that's cool YouTube actually reached out to me after our last stream where I showed all those problems with it and they were like hey so like what don't you like about the new live dashboard like wow I don't know absolutely everything did they tell you what no data is I know cuz it's still shows no data yeah we're definitely streaming live on the channel for that pretty cool guys this is terrible okay why do you have to click an edit button to change stuff like the description I don't know I haven't seen any other platforms that you have to do that no you should just change it and then click Save yeah I don't know why is there a 360 video button that you don't have to click a button to access but you can't access the title in the description without clicking a button I don't know this is extremely basic user experience stuff yeah it's very it's a very strange thing it's very strange thing I think I just don't you I think I just changed the thumbnails so I don't know you know what I told them I was like okay guys tell you what you guys arranged a conference call with me yeah while we go live nice yeah and they're going on that really yeah sometime after the Thanksgiving holiday they have said that they are gonna try and do that and so I'm gonna be like here's how broken your stuff is so I'm in the classic one now and everything is working well this is great I would expect this is fantastic yeah everything here is unfortunately called okay wine show yeah I don't know what that was probably Jake setting up the stream yeah but I changed it oh I know I know I know but like just slide it is so dumb alright so other topics for today because yeah we've talked about Peele well I don't know we didn't really talk about P we talked about personal medical data and devices that could help us be healthier as individuals but potentially harm our privacy I mean I think part of it for me is just that I feel like the ship has completely sailed on my private that's okay my argument for Leia Liberty over whatever would be a lot stronger if I didn't think it was just gone already right but like I want it back right so I'm trying to kind of lean towards those things you know our brand and David a Randy here could we turn off the lights for from shooting today thank you I don't know how to turn off some of the lights sir you know one of them has like this super complicated oh dude no in fact they had to close up once and was so lost for so long they're all over the place and I don't know what to do I wasn't gonna say yeah it's it's I've been making a lot of personal changes to try to wrestle back what I can and it's hard and there's enough that like yeah that's out there are you using the Onion Router no yeah it's like theoretically you're supposed to and then I forget yeah don't resize the window and this and that it's like oh my god and like there's there's stuff like like oh you should use a VPN and then it's like well I got personalized ads for something the other day that like it was not something I typed into a Google search like I don't remember what I had done had google autocorrect searches for me yeah that I've never typed before and I very recently said vocally on my computer which makes no sense as my mic switched off yeah so it would have had to go through my phone my phone should have must have updated Chrome which I am not signed into right now whoa yeah I don't know well maybe it was random sure maybe just people like you also like that there's still a light on in the back of the bedroom by the way maybe they like that that one time and then never liked it again but yeah it's it like even with eBay there's there's a lot of reason to believe that there's government investment into VPNs VPNs is just sending your data through some other dudes instead of your ISP which can be beneficial for some things but like we've seen all the like crop that's going down with them recently and like there's no really it's just let unless you like a really Fort Knox everything you're just kind of screwed yeah and any other thing too is like from my perspective my life isn't screwed because no I don't mean your life is okay I mean your your like personal information so yeah yeah yeah all right while we move on to the new China deep fake sloth so China has released a new government policy designed to prevent the spread of fake news and misleading videos created using AI otherwise known as deep fakes in before they use it to discredit real news the new rule bans the publishing of false information or deep fakes online without for disclosure that the posting question was created with AI or oh no machine learning technology failure to disclose this is now a criminal offense I didn't think about that at all it also asks content providers to use technology to detect audio and video news content that has been manufactured or potentially manipulated like for example tank man from the Tiananmen Square massacre great so we need to make sure we have proper disclosures that that was AI generated you know oh man give it this matte matter time then all right I was happy and now I'm not it appears that the Chinese government is reserving the right to prosecute both the users and hosting services for failing to abide by these laws so this could be very dangerous for sites that allow user-generated content to be posted like even something like Gylfie for example could be potentially under scrutiny and prosecuted criminally for having deep fade content on its site just in the form of like Jeff's and gifs are one of the most dangerous forms of deep fakes because the resolution and frame rate is so low that it's really difficult in a way very easily in the public eye with intentionally lowering those things yes most other content you can't but those people seem to not care yeah so there's a similar US law last month California became the first US state to criminalize the use of deface in political campaign promotion and advertising which like it's like things we shouldn't have to outlaw that's like right out there you know yeah a B 730 makes it a crime to publish audio imagery or video that gives a false damaging impression of a politician's words or actions this includes news media as well as parody and satire focusing instead on elections wait mom that sentence makes no sense but oh sorry excludes news video as well as protein satire focusing on elections that's good that's fine but I think it should probably include news media as well yeah frankly if you are prison if you are saying your news than be news don't be deep duck I think that's where it should be a disclosure thing so like political camp just shouldn't be allowed at all media as long as it's disclosed and parity like whatever the law applies to candidates within 30 days in an election or 60 days excuse me and it's designed to expire by 2023 why unless it's explicitly reenacted like why they should just keep going regardless anyway these rules go into effect in China on January the 1st 2020 we need a happier news I have happier news all right what do you got for happier news all right it's Luke's favorite topic talking about flow plane yeah gentlemen hey I just switched resolutions so hold on hey give it a hot minute here you're also on Wi-Fi a potato yeah it's pretty okay hold on there's 1440 as well now I want to see 4k okay all right I don't want to see no 1440 that's like I haven't tried 4km is loud I crapped here oh yeah might not be able to do it yeah works completely found on my computer at home right right click let's see task manager Oh like how hard is this gonna be working here [Laughter] okay so this is actually something we've been running into as a problem is we've had to like benchmark these videos yeah internally with the team to see like whose computers can even run them so this one yeah we really cannot do do 4k okay hold on um let's see if we can do 1440 so just to be clear guys this is not YouTube's 4k no um this is a bit of a heavier 4k stream and this particular laptop is a little bit on the older side and doesn't have any blue screen doesn't have any dedicated decode hardware that would enable it to handle this heavy of a 4k streams it's three 1440 just fine though 1440 is fine and it is a 1080p screen I believe so it's official the ltte you'll log is live now talk to me talk to me lewb talk to me about the 8k version right it's playable right now yeah I have watched it base anyone else in the team has watched it it is glorious it crippled quite a few people's computers on the team that are like solid my computer did just fine actually that guy's nice it seems to be interesting based on like how your computer decides to handle it if your GPU takes the entirety of it yeah seems to generally go OK like the video decoding percentage on your GPU is gonna fly up to like 40 50 percent Wow 1080 so it's gonna be pretty tough you're gonna be sucking back like 80 watts of power it's like to watch a video so this is great because the LTTE you log but yeah it's it's we also have the full over 10 hours we did the whole thing tell me how big that file is at 4k so okay guys just everyone needs to have 4k everyone needs to chillax for a second here because on floatplane we offer our users the option to download a drm-free copy of the content that our creators upload the problem with that in the case of a video like this you're gonna have to throttle people's downloads of this like a hardcore yeah cuz a 10-hour 4k file at what was the bitrate 36:36 do I have it here I think someone told me it was I think 900 gigs 900 gigs that's what someone told the original file was 500 gigs Oh 500 gigs the original file that you okay so less maybe it's 90 gigs then maybe I got it it's over a hundred over I have them some form of memory that it was like a hundred and sixty but I don't I'm trying to find it and I can't find it good news for YouTube users is that you guys will have to wait a little bit but probably not forever we are working with YouTube as well and we are asking them to temporarily lift their maximum file size limit in order to allow us to upload an 8k to YouTube as well but as you expect it's early access on floatplane so what you got there the is so dumb the cost for a complete a k8k stream would be a hundred and sixty five gigabytes okay so that's the 8k stream so 4k is probably a lot less than that then yeah I think I think we'll just hit me up so that's 80 that is so dumb these also aren't the most one percent reason messages so yeah and what's the ache a bit rate thirty-six 8k I thought you said that was 4k no I think that is a k 8k at 36 I think so that doesn't sound right I would be pretty surprised you sure yeah I'd be pretty surprised by that that's 1440 yeah I just want to see what what we're sucking back right now just curious so right now at 1440 it's kind of all over the place always gonna know it's always coming in chunks on both yeah yeah alright nevermind what can I do for you mister mister light oh I'm sure I know why you're here I know why you're here we have a special Black Friday promotion for you on the LTTE store - the screen Oh something went wrong during login please try again exit so we've got two promos running right now guys if you wanted the LTTE under air but you're like man 50 bucks is a lot for three pairs of underwear how about this buy two packs get one free if you add three packs of ltte underwear to your cart it will automatically apply a $50 discount so you will get two packs for the price of one another offer that we have for you guys is free SH and it's separate I'm sorry you can't do both offers our Shopify is hard and we can't maybe next year we'll do our best separate offer if you spend over $100 on the store you get free shipping on your order up to $30 again I am so sorry unfortunately if your cheapest shipping option is more than $30 there's just no discount it's not like if it's $33 you just pay $3 there was no way for us to do that with the current plugins that we have for our store and all that stuff I'm so sorry nothing we can do about it but for most people that should cover you so it's separate from the underwear promo so you can either buy two get one free for underwear just add three to your cart you'll automatically apply or free shipping on orders over $100 and the code was B F ship all caps B F ship all caps so guys go check it out we have we have pretty good stock of most things how low are we on swak it okay swag it's almost gone that's probably not coming back this season anyway we're pretty good for stealth right yeah we're pretty good for stealth pretty good for most of the hardware shirts constellations we're in good shape so there's a couple of water bottle colors I think that are out of stock so stealth is out of stock but golden blue white okay so classic is the one with the most star definitely lots of definitely lots of cable ties so there's that that's pretty cool we should totally do a stupid cable tie promo just for the memes just to get rid of them at some points and a thousand dollars get all of them yes just just please just just take them you get like you get like a palliative cable ties at your house spend $10,000 on LT t clothes get everything in the store yeah we just ship you our entire inventory the whole store yeah mr. beast would do it we put 10,000 LTT cable ties in a car and then we sat in that car for 24 hours we used LTT cable ties to velcro ourselves to the wall for 24 hours we used lgt cable ties to pull a cruise ship will Chandler fall off the wall first we got it we got to go through our today okay people don't like it when I eat on the show alright I'm so mad about this it's like it's like an irrational type of mad because I don't actually I don't have like a compelling reason to be super mad about it but here you go oh cool here's the post from the Occulus blog welcoming beat games to Facebook yes the developer of beat Sabre has been acquired by Facebook ah so they're gonna join oculus studios as an independently operated studio in Prague Facebook claims that the things the community has come to love about beat Sabre will remain intact how'd that work out for oculus oculus still intact are all the things we loved about oculus intact okay give me out of 10 out of 10 oculus being intact out of 10 is a 10 mm hmm what about the things we loved about oculus not very high think yeah okay cool some people might argue with me on that because I think oculus did some but head and stuff even before Facebook acquired a very clear yeah so I don't know maybe they deserved each other I don't know I don't know if it was necessarily oculus that we loved maybe we just loved it it wasn't owned by Facebook is that where we're going probably and that they were like making a big push in the right direction so Facebook says that with their resources and know-how beat games will be able to accelerate adding more music and more exciting features to beat Sabre as well as bringing the game to more people what more people it's already available on every VR platform one random thing that I have to interject all right I tried to do some math to look into your claim of the bitrate thing mm-hmm and the calculator on the computer was lagging because I was still watching the 1440p video in the background ouch that was awesome this laptop is a absolute ten-minute thing I think it's a dual-core so like yeah yeah the dual-core blade stealth-like first gen or second to anything um all right so yeah that sounds cool but like I don't need more music in the game quite frankly because due to the robust modding community that exists for beat Sabre you can add any music you want to the game just like you can with box VR as long as someone creates a level for it unlike box VR which just kind of dynamically creates one yeah so FAQ there is a long history of indie Studios joining large companies and being utterly ruined how are you going to avoid that so here's no quote I've been in the industry for a while and I've seen that first hand I've seen that firsthand however I've also seen and been a part of some incredible success stories the story we aim to prove over time is this an indie studio joins forces with some like-minded allies and together they find a way to push PR to new heights okay then are you guys gonna be slowing down updates for non oculus platforms and prioritizing development for oculus no B games will continue to ship content updates for beat Sabre at the same time across all currently supported platforms so here are some user fears and I believe there was a quote associated with this first one actually copyrighted custom songs may be removed as well as other mods including skins this is a huge concern for me because from my perspective like I I ran into this actually a little while ago I was talking about it on my beat Sabre stream that I did last week which was terrible it's dropping frames all over the place because I was trying to stream on a quad core while playing in the ER was bad anyway I was talking about how like obviously some custom songs are created with pirated music it's very clear especially because the the song from lego movie - catchy song the the one that I was playing the copy of the song was so bad like it sounded like a 64 kilobit per second mp3 that I downloaded off Napster when I was in high school like it was terrible it sounded like someone put their smartphone next to a radio and when I freaking uploaded it to think it was was terrible so I went I bought the song on I don't remember I picked whichever platform had DRM free downloads so that I could put it on my server and then never have to worry about it before I think it was play music pretty sure that's technically still not how that's supposed to work no it works yeah yeah yeah play music you're allowed to download it twice but then I don't think you're allowed to put it in that game so hold on as far as I'm concerned I'm sleeping easy sure yeah yeah because I have paid for a license to listen to that song as many times as I want and I have paid for a license to play that game as much as I want yeah I'm totally down if I do them together I'm totally down with the moral possession but I'm not sure if it's legal so I have no problem paying for songs yeah if it comes to that and one of my biggest problems with beat saver and one of the reasons that I was driven to go out and bought it so that I could play copyrighted songs was that there are so few songs in the library like it's easy to get bored yeah however what I am NOT gonna be down with is if beat Sabre ultimately forces you to buy songs only in the game yeah so I wouldn't be surprised if that because yeah because then you're also buying the level design and blah blah blah like if they go and they build a marketplace where as long as I own a legit version of the song or whatever or something or if I have a five a Spotify account and it's a song that's on Spotify than it then LinkedIn or whatever not LinkedIn like if they can be linked together nothing to do not LinkedIn if they can be linked together like if there's a way that they can do this that makes it so that the the community that has developed around creating custom songs isn't stifled or destroyed and maybe even they add a tape system so those people can make money like there's a lot of ways that they could do this really constructively I have about a 0% confidence that they're gonna do it any of those ways so that's that's my big problem right now and it's such a pain in the butt I have never dealt with this before because I don't mod a ton of games okay but playing modded games on Steam is a royal pain in the ass because there's no way to stop the game from updating I didn't know that I swear there used to be just a don't update this game button does not exist and cannot be done as far as I can tell top all your games from updating and then you could manually update other games no wait no you can't yeah how I can go into offline mode but like I'm not gonna pause your downloads pause your downloads I'm pretty sure they will turn on events you Lea I've had things talking down look you for a long time before I don't know yeah I'm not really not sure I'd have to check cuz there's so so I've actually dug pretty deep on this okay you can delay it so there's I forget what it's called it like ledger or something I forget there's there's a file that you can update on a per game basis you go in notepad plus plus or whatever you use you change it to minus four or something whatever there's a feel you can change and it'll stop it but the next time that game pushes an update it will reset that so if a game is still being actively updated by the developer as far as I can tell there is no way to prevent it from updating so someone said yeah you can pause it and it will stop downloads but it will force you to download it when you run the game there you go so offline mode not gonna run offline mode forever no I know I'm just saying so right now the only workaround is you have to go to this Steam something something readable from still updates in Steam so you have to go to like this repository that keeps like these these numerical values that correspond to all the different versions of the game that exist because they're all still on Steam servers then you have to manually use command line and steam to download like the correct version of the game copy it to a separate folder then change that value in the in the like text file then you have to copy the old version of the game over top of the latest version that just updated and then it won't touch it again until the next update it's horrible that's I'm still running beat saver 1.3 and new I have all my mods working and everything I just honestly the game is perfect as it is for me and I just don't want them to ever touch it ever again and I wish I could just freeze time so yeah you can new idea mm-hmm copy the folder only run the executable from the other folder don't point steam at that folder I doubt it'll work but I can try it I know there are some Steam games that will act perfectly within that realm but I don't know if that's one I'll give this a shot I did spend a fair bit of time googling this for beat Sabre specifically and nobody mentioned that solution but I'll give it a shot all right we I need to get home because I need to relieve my babysitter tonight so here's a quick one AMD cards can use do you think now so NVIDIA has basically given up on being proprietary so g-sync displays with the g-sync module now are being updated to allow variable refresh rate over HDMI and adaptive sync via hdmi and displayport firmware update is being made to the v1 and v2 decent hardware modules I don't know that if you can actually update your current g-sync I don't think so no I don't think so yeah so that for any new martyrs yeah so that's kind of lame oh one last quick one yes sorry lightest there's already a new fold in China what Samsung has revealed the WG 25 G's so Delhi 21 yeah that what he said I refined galaxy fold in terms of both design and internal components it supports China telecoms and China unicorns non-standard 5g deployments it has a thicker and stronger middle frame a new white finish the edges are a little sharper this time around and it has a smaller battery 4235 milliamp hours instead of 4380 why would anyone want a smaller battery price unknown I'm assuming it's for like more bulky durable components Oh interesting right without recompete Li redesigning the rest of the chassis yeah make sense all right snapdragon 855 plus blah blah blah cool that's not that much smaller is probably fine I got pretty good battery life out of the fold honest right I'm still I didn't upgrade still rocking it axle to excel all right and currently my plan is when the battery gets too bad which it isn't yet it's still actually fine I don't game on it and stuff so like whatever but when the battery is too bad I'll probably to swap it keep going all right I'm only gonna be able to do a handful of Super chats here guys this 236 says can you make shirts that aren't black yes we are working on it oh man I really want to show you guys a hoodie design that we're working on it's the CPU shirt but it's gonna be like white it uh it looks it looks so good I could be pretty cool all right mate all the height for scrapyard Wars thanks mate it's coming it's not a weekly release schedule we actually never promised that this time so some people are super mad that's crap you're going to see this I have very much it's not late it'll come when it comes we're editing it constellations is a blue shirt that's true it is pretty dark mass spectrometers for labs cost more than $100,000 so that's now we know I was gonna say it didn't sound cheap but I didn't know like how much they cost Jerrod says when will demand should be archived on float plane when flow plane builds a feature that doesn't require me to manually upload it what oh wait oh yeah thanks Darren Torgerson pickles says hey fellas love you guys keep being awesome and always remember Luke needs to grow a more glorious beard I recommend Miracle Grow or ShamWow what what are you even talking about is that a thing like people using shamwows to grow better beards like well I mean maybe I don't know anything about it clearly Andrew J Blomberg says bought a pair of ear pods pro after watching your video on it I have autism and when the active noise-cancelling turned the Mall of America into a room of whispers I almost cried thanks guys yeah it's like life-changing like I I would just flew out to New York for a couple of projects including beautifying Marquez's Tesla I and I sweep tin after the air pod pros got announced and bought normal air pots really yeah I don't know if you remember but the only headphones I've ever been able to comfortably in ears that I've ever been able to comfortably wear our ear pods and I got tired of needing the dongle to be able to plug it into my phone so I moved on gotcha only other acceptable option they gotcha when they went down on price cuz the pros came out they went down on price a little bit yeah and it's gotta sit for me it's all about fitting in this pocket yeah I will I it's even smaller than I thought because I had never held the case and so far I like them um let's see apparently wild wolf says you can copy beat saber into a separate folder and run it with everything working okay well that's good to know and Gabriel says the developer can make prior versions available via the beta tap yeah but they're not gonna do that so yeah I doubt it alright thanks Natalie thanks guys Thanks you know Olli you guys we'll see you again next week same time same bat-channel bye alright yeah I've been doing those things [Music] Rock You by Sennheiser new Thursdays [Music] oh yeah
