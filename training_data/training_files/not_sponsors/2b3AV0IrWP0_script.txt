what is going on everybody today in this video I wanted to talk to you about the current state of full self-driving my commute using full self-driving and if you buy a Tesla and you purchase the full self-driving package on top of autopilot can it drive you to work so autopilot what's supposed to be able to go coast-to-coast by the end of 2017 or so in that timeframe and didn't happen well the date has been moved up to the end of 2020 so we're getting close by the end of 2020 is our car going to be able to take us from point A to point B with no interventions so that kind of answers the question for you right off the bat autopilot today cannot take you all the way to work you can't sleep on the way there but you can do much much less than you can do in any other car especially when you get to the highway portion but I'm going to show you most of my commute today and what I do where I use autopilot how much and we're gonna actually get a percentage of miles how much autopilot I use so you can see here I've already about 3.8 miles the first 2.4 miles for me our dirt roads and so autopilot does not work there you can use traffic where cruise control where your steering and the car is keeping speed and using that it will then stop at stop signs on the dirt roads or snap at sea intersections but I don't generally use it I just drive myself for that portion for the rest of the drive pretty much the whole thing I can keep on a pilot on the main thing these days that you have to do you have to do turns auto pilot can keep your speed it can keep your lane it can interact with traffic lights and stop signs I can't hit roundabouts I don't have any of those on my commute luckily and it can't do turns so that's like kind of the main thing that's left that Tesla needs to add in to this full self-driving software is turning once the car can make turns on its own we're gonna be pretty close to point A to point B with no interventions now that doesn't mean the car is then full self-driving it just means you have a chance to make it without doing anything you still have to pay attention you most likely will still have to do some stuff if you knew the channel welcome please hit like and get subscribed I have a lot of videos of Tesla challenges where I go on ramp to off-ramp on the highway because the car can do pretty much everything on the way and I have many videos where I've done nothing at all I get on the highway I turn autopilot on full self-driving it's pretty much an interchangeable term and the car does everything I don't do any of it so let's check out today what I'm gonna do here I'm gonna try to do the minimum possible and like I said that's pretty much gonna be turns and that's probably it so my commute is about 35 miles one way and I will probably use my video footage to figure this out but at the end I'll put up a percentage of how much was on autopilot versus off I think it's probably going to be north of 90 percent somewhere on 90% of my usage is gonna be autopilot alright so coming up to our first stop sign here the car tells you it's gonna stop at this point I usually take over the steering to get over to the right here because I'm gonna turn right and throw my turn signal the car's not gonna do any of that we have a lead car here to stop us so the car would have stopped anyway even if you had just a normal autopilot package but my car just stopped at the stop sign here then I tap the brake and I completely take over so the car is not involved in this at all once I have room here then I get onto this road and as soon as I can right here I'll turn autopilot back on now the car can do my lane changes and everything for me here and so I'm not doing anything once again besides paying attention of course we'll count that as 0.1 miles I took over of course it was much less than that just a small turn but just to round up so that autopilot is not getting the benefit of the doubt so at this point I still haven't done anything since making that turn the car is done everything we're coming up to this green light if you have a lead car the Tesla full self-driving package will go through the green light but since I don't I have to either hit the stock to confirm that it's green and it's safe to go through or I have to tap the pedal now here I have to tap the pedal again which I really shouldn't but I guess that truck was maybe too far ahead so tapping the pedal or hitting the stock through those green lights allows the car to go through now at this one because I had a lead car you can see this line turned green I took in a minute to turn green because the car couldn't see the traffic lights ahead I guess because this truck was in the way I haven't really experienced that exact scenario too much but because I had a lead car it saw a green light it put a green line here and it went through I did not confirm that at all now coming up to this left turn here this is where I get on the highway I'm gonna put my turn signal on I'm taking over the steering but the car is still doing the speed control so this is an autopilot this is just traffic or cruise control but the car is doing this and then the car like I said can't do turns but sometimes it does turns so I usually like to turn on a pilot on here and see if it'll complete the turn it doesn't maybe fifty percent of the time or so so here we go I'm gonna hit the accelerator to make sure the car goes and it's still doing all of this as you can see and it almost hit the car but it didn't it's a great job again that's not really an advertised feature but it does work sometimes so I did not have to take over at all there the car did all of that and then getting onto the highway it'll do all of this for you as well it'll merge on it's pretty good at it every once in a while I'll need to take over but for the most part it handles it fine and getting on here it'll turn its turn signal on and I'll do all of this for us alright so now that we're on the highway this is where autopilot really can show it stuff it can do everything on the highway pretty much interchanges it'll pass slower cars this is if you've bought the full self-driving package if you have not then you have to do your lane changes and everything but it'll still do exactly what you're seeing here it'll keep the lane and keep speed so I'm really not doing anything traffic is going pretty fast today so I'll keep up with them and you can also see this is a newer feature really nice for making these videos for me this is my backup camera and then these are the two side repeater cameras you can see each side of my car so you can check blind spots here if you want of course you can use your mirrors or just look and these are the same cameras that autopilot is also using the C so you can see exactly what auto pilot is seeing as you're driving now when you get on the highway like I said it can do everything but you may not always be comfortable with the decisions it wants to make so I'm a normal commute for me I will usually take over maybe two or three times and about 25 miles of highway driving like I've said I've had to see like that guy swerving in my lane it was fine he didn't get close to me but I may have taken over even though the car can avoid stuff like that but like I've said I have made it to work I mean multiple times I mean it's got to be a couple dozen times I've gone to work gotten on the highway and done absolutely nothing the car is done everything until it exits the highway I then take over my videos of that and everything which is very cool but it doesn't always work exactly how you want it if you go into the settings here in autopilot while you're driving you can do this of course before you're driving but here's how I have it set up this is pretty much how I always use it so the first one is navigator autopilot which you should always have enabled because it'll tell you the directions of where you need to go as you go this next one speed based lane changes if you allow the car to make lane changes or it'll suggest them if you don't this is kind of how sensitive it is to changing lanes so if I put it on mild it's gonna let the guy in front of me go pretty slowly before it decides all right I'm gonna change lanes and pass him if I put on Mad Max the person in front of me doesn't have to be going very slow at all maybe 1 mile per hour less than me my car is gonna change lanes the aggressiveness of the lane change doesn't change but how often the car changes lens changes with these options here required confirmation so I have this off and with this now I have to have hand on the wheel my hand has to be here but if my hand is here in the car decides to change lanes it'll turn the turn signal on for a little longer than I like maybe four to six blinks and then it will change lanes all on its own without me doing anything if you have confirmation set to yes the car will say alright let's change lanes here and then you can hit the turn signal and say alright it's fine you go ahead and do that but the car is very good at checking its blind spot for you I've never had it where it would try to change lanes if somebody was there if like in this scenario this car would be red once it's passed me then the car would finish its lane change and then it'll notify you when it's going to do it I have it as a chime I can vibrate the steering wheel breaking it both but this one I find feels a lot like a road vibration so it can be confusing so you can see here the car is doing this on its own it's going to change lanes but I have people coming up in my blind spot and so they sped up and now they're not allowing me and so I'm just gonna have to wait and it's a little bit annoying but I'm gonna just for demonstration purposes I'm gonna wait it looks like yeah this guy in the red Jeep here man this view is awesome he's gonna let us over and there we go the car is getting over really nice pretty tight gap there but the car did a great job and this will allow us to go faster and pass that semi so another lane change it's going to the faster lane here and that van came up pretty quick the car waited for them to pass and then makes the move that's a really good job of that now like other pretty much any cruise control if you tap the brake you completely take over and that's the same here so the car is steering and keeping speed if I tap the brake everything turns off I'm back in control if you want to go a little faster so let's say I want to be a little closer this guy I can hit my accelerator just like I am now get a little closer let off everything is still happening but I was having the car accelerate I don't have to rely on or anything like that now at this point I want to move over so I'm gonna hit the turn signal but the car still doing that on its own I'm still not doing it and I did that because I know people are coming on the highway here and I want to be out of their way and the car can handle that situation fine it'll see them merging on and it'll slow down but I'd rather just move out of the way then then let them think I might be in their way well here's an example of a car merging on I'll let this play out just to show you out handles it really well so you can see I mean they got on at a pretty good speed but they were dark grey that means my car was tracking them and now we're gonna change lanes if you're ever getting kind of annoyed by the lane changes sometimes it's a little too much honestly because it's just so sensitive to the person forney going slower and I get a lot of comments like why are you the left lane all the time and that's part of the reason it's as simple as just clicking this button now you're still an autopilot you can still if you have the full self driving package you can still it the turn signal to make lane changes but now the car won't do it it also won't suggest anything for your you know which can be kind of annoying if you don't know where you're going but I'll often toggle this on and off when I'm in situations where I think the cars going to change lanes and I don't want it to that's a little trick you can use so I don't know how many people have this may be a HOV Lane or something if you have a solid line that you can pass autopilot will not do that so this is another place where you need to do the steering for it I really don't know how they're gonna do that one but the green arrow here means this Lane is drivable so I had some times have to do that myself so as we approach the end here autopilot will change lanes to follow route it knows our exit is coming up so we're approaching our exit here so at this point autopilot can't do 100% of your drive but it can do most of it so if I'm right it's about 92% I think about three miles it's actually a little less than three miles we're not using autopilot and my commute is about 35 or 36 miles to get there so above 90% of your drive can be done for you by your car now you're still paying attention you know you still have your hand on the steering wheel and that may not be every day but that is a typical day for me you know a couple lane changes maybe tell it to stop changing lanes and that's about it I do the turns I do that it's it's still doing all of this it'll take us all the way to the red light but usually I took them for steering at this point because of it opens up so wide so I hope you enjoyed this if you have any questions leave me down below one thing that I don't quickly right now have my commuters construction it does handle that pretty well but again that's somewhere even if you're driving a normal car you want to be a little extra alert just in case but it does a good job of construction to it can see the barrel that can move away from the barrels it can do all that kind of stuff so if you're new to Tesla new to autopilot I hope you learned some stuff here it's it's really awesome I really love the full package the full self-driving the autopilot and all of that if there's anything I didn't cover that you have questions about please leave them down below I love talking to you guys down in the comments hope you enjoyed this one and you will see my car in the happily driving along [Music]
