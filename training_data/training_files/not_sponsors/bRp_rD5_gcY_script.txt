your order with free worldwide shipping link in the description picture this you just bought a switch spent 300 of your hard-earned dollars on it but now you need a game so you pick up breath of the wild and it's 59.99 that is pretty steep for a tiny little plastic cartridge so let me ask you this why would you spend $60 on one game when you can get 60 games for the same price well you're about to find out the switching shop happens to have quite a sizable list of games that all come in at a dollar or less and I bought a bunch so let's take a look at them first up is a terrible platformer with an equally terrible art style now I have a feeling they were actually trying to go for something pleasing looking here but the execution is just an all-out assault on my retinas there's an obnoxious amount of colors here with about 67,000 gradients the character sprites don't stand out from the background and everything just kind of blends together into one gigantic mess so this game is called mecco tales and in concept the mechanics seem like something interesting see you move around just like any other platformer but to attack you fire a laser at enemies via this little robot thing behind you what's different though is that you simultaneously fire and aim by tilting the right thumbstick it's basically a platformer with the combat system of something like The Binding of Isaac would actually be a cool concept if the game itself wasn't a pile of crap the controls are really finicky enemies take way too many hits to defeat and the level design isn't exactly inspired but I was willing to look past that and actually play a few stages except for the fact that I couldn't beat first stage now it's not that I think I'm incapable but I kept getting pretty far in the stage right up until this super cheap platformer part where you need to hop from platform to platform while taking out this enemy that attacks you I'm sure I could beat it if I dedicated some time to it but this game apparently doesn't have checkpoints so every time I died around this area I had to restart the level all over again the point I would get to is actually pretty far in the level so after multiple tries I decided there were better things to do with my time then trudged through this slog of a stage again and by better things to do with my time I apparently mean play this this game is called bouncy Bob it's not good but let me elaborate so bouncy Bob is a game where you need to defeat a specific number of enemies in each stage to progress but basically all you can do is jump in a pretty much fixed arc you can flap your arms to gain extra height but jumping is all you can do you can't walk you can't dodge enemies just jump to kill enemies you need to balance on top of their heads or use one of these items that can be activated by bouncing into them using the items is fine but as far as bouncing on enemies despite it being the main mechanic to defeat them it's the most inefficient and dangerous way to do so see when you bounce on enemy's heads it gives you a chance to bounce off one and into another chaining multiple kills the problem is this only works some of the time more likely what tends to happen is you bounce off one land on the ground and get attacked by a bunch of other enemies before you had a chance to jump out of the way what basically ends up happening is you try to strategize as much as you can by waiting until enemy's grouped together so you can take out a bunch of them with the items and this does help but for the most part it's a crapshoot and a lot of your success in this game is based on luck and doesn't feel at all rewarding once you actually win this isn't the worst thing I've ever played and I'd say it might be okay for a time-waster but I can't there's just way better games even for your phone that have much better gameplay and don't even cost money like this one does and again it's only a dollar but a dollar is money this one's kind of fun it's sort of I get motion sickness though so watching the background scroll wasn't letting me enjoy it as much as I would have otherwise it's called sky peace and it's pretty Japanese you ride a surfboard in the sky while avoiding enemies and collecting coins and stuff unlike most games that do this though your movement is based on a grid system this is actually kind of cool and narrows down your options a bit more which kind of streamlines everything in my opinion this may seem like it would dumb the game down but it was actually kind of refreshing to play game like this and have the concept of hitboxes be all but irrelevant they still do apply to a degree because you can move back and forth it will but as long as you're pressing a direction that incoming enemies aren't heading towards your safe also I've got to say collecting the coins is pretty satisfying I think it's something about the sound effect that chimes or the glittery animation that flies across the screen and onto your score counter but they managed to make collecting their arbitrary crap feel rewarding the difficulty jumps up pretty quickly from stage to stage and unfortunately for me as so does the speed of the scrolling background actually kind of like this game but not enough to warrant vomiting over it and here's a nice contrast from that fast-paced action game this is called lines X and it's a nice relaxing puzzle game there's actually a sequel available on the eShop as well but for now we're gonna just look at this one so basically there's a square grid with a bunch of dots on it and circles of varying colors a line of each color can be drawn from one circle to its corresponding circle of the same color the object is to connect each circle of the same color to each other while simultaneously using up every spot on the grid you can't cross lines or go backwards though so this can get pretty tricky pretty fast you know I said this was relaxing but the further you get the more daunting it is I will say though it feels really good during the aha moments when your brain finally connects the dots after staring at the screen for 10 minutes but pun intended I guess the music is also super relaxing and pleasing to listen to as well and this is a game I will definitely be returning to if the sequel to this is anything like the original then I definitely recommend both if you're into the kind of puzzle games that take wit and problem solving while going at your own pace leaving you feeling accomplished as opposed to the ones with an anxiety inducing time limit where you feel like at any second all is lost it's the kind of game for someone who'd rather do a crossword puzzle than play a round of perfection here's a game I couldn't even get to work until I realized it's two-player only at which point I still couldn't actually play it but still tried to play a two-player game with a joint con in each hand for the sake of getting footage also I spent a whole dollar on it and I wasn't letting that go to waste so there's a soccer pinball and I cannot for the life of me figure out what the rules are here I guess dropping the ball means the other team scores but there's also two balls that can be in play on the field at any point in time and they're a different color for both teams so I really don't know how any of this tallies in to the score this is just messy the physics are bad the rules aren't properly explained and there's anything on the actual table for the balls to interact with and also it doesn't even look good this was a waste of a dollar are you a fan of limbo or inside then you'll hate this you know I wasn't even making this video with the intent to look at a bunch of bad games it's just luck of the draw I guess anyway this game that I will reluctantly call a puzzle platformer is the most blatant ripoff I've seen in a while and it does so in the most ungraceful way possible look if you're gonna rip off another game at the very least try to give your game some kind of quality there's plenty of other games that they're very on-the-nose with how inspired they are by other games but they still manage to make a good game it's not really an excuse for making a poor product anyway this is called dream alone and honestly during the intro it seems almost hopeful it seems like they tried this one really confuses me there's a well-spoken narrator telling at least some semblance of a story the art style looks a little cheap but it's kind of creepy and fits the aesthetic but then the actual game starts and any symptom of quality is thrown directly out the window what follows is a very poor platformer with floaty controls super simple puzzles frustratingly cheap enemy placement all with a screen that's constantly obscured by this ever-changing the artsy vignette effect that they for some reason thought added something to the game there's this mechanic where you can warp reality into this distorted hell-like version of itself to self puzzles which I guess is the only unique thing that this game has going for it but it really doesn't do much to make this game any more enjoyable also giana sisters twisted dreams already did that most of this games difficulty I've noticed comes not from the puzzles but from needing to avoid a constant barrage of fast-moving enemies you can't defend yourself against or jets from not being able to make jumps because this game's art style doesn't reflect the collision they programmed into its platforms because of the art style and overall tone at times it seemed like somebody actually cared when making the game but I really can't tell if the developers were being serious or not it's probably not good if someone can't tell whether or not your game was supposed to be a joke I actually kind of feel bad but this seems like it might be a case of a team maybe actually trying to make something but lacking the talent to do so now I kind of feel like a bully maybe maybe go back to the drawing board and your craft a little bit before the next release here's Henry the hamster handler the point in this game is to lead each hamster that walks across the screen to safety and what's essentially a glorified QTE unfortunately the timing of when you need to press each button is totally borked some inputs you can just do instantly and they work just fine and then others you need to time so that the hamsters line up correctly there seems to be no rhyme or reason to it and it's just overall frustrating and slow also if you fail and the hamsters die Nickelodeon slime comes out this is a bad geeky Yaba Runner is a weird auto-runner akin to anything you've ever played on a smartphone where you play as a gnome traversing various platforming challenges over dozens and dozens of stages with new mechanics to learn and a pretty commendable difficulty curve as weird and cheap looking as it is it's actually not half bad come to think of it it actually looks suspiciously like a browser flash game and I think they knew exactly what they were doing because you can tell by the cutscenes that this game doesn't take itself seriously at all and I honestly find that pretty charming blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so you go through each stage collecting a bunch of socks along the way as well as one or more special golden socks these are usually in harder to reach places kind of like the big coins and Mario games you need a certain amount of socks to actually complete each stage but for the most part as long as you play well you usually just collect enough without really having to go out of your way as the game progresses it gradually starts teaching you new mechanics to traverse new obstacles which then adds more variables and increases the difficulty I actually like this game so much that I didn't stop playing it until I was 37 stages in this one's pretty good so this game is weird it's also my favorite one that I played which is actually saying a lot considering I get motion sickness super easily and this was originally a VR game the game was then boarded to the switch but due to it originally being a VR game I can't exactly explain it but something is just slightly off about the viewing perspective it seems warped I can definitely tell this was adapted to work on switch rather than it being developed for it natively this doesn't ruin the experience or anything but as someone who is sensitive to motion this one did make me a little dizzy the one caveat though is I think normally this games a little more expensive but at the time of this video it is or was on sale for a dollar elevator to the moon is a sort of point-and-click escape room type of game where the object is to build and then subsequently fly an elevator to the moon now if you can please someone in the comments point me in the direction of some other games of quality like this because when I was younger I used to love these escape room types of games like if anyone remembers crimson room or any of the other games from that developer I was obsessed with those but I digress so a longer journey a lot of problems arise between the president who initially sent you on the mission who sounds exactly like Arnold Schwarzenegger and the AI that's aboard the elevator these situations lead you to need to repair things on the ship to keep the trip going the game is pretty short it's only around maybe four hours long and it only has four levels but honestly what's there is actually pretty entertaining there's even more than one ending if you can manage to find it the story actually gets pretty twisted and dark but oddly enough it still keeps this quirky tone to it like no matter how dark the story gets it's too silly and fourth wall breaking for that to even matter the gameplay and puzzles in this game are pretty entertaining on their own but the dialogue from Arne makes this game actually pretty hilarious at times if you're gonna play any game I talked about in this video play this one even if it goes back up to full price but try to get it right now when it's still a dollar if you take anything away from this video let it be this do your research because sometimes what looks to be a bargain is actually a ripoff I'm pretty sure the money I spent on most of these games would have been better used on a trip to Dollar Tree or honestly even a McDonald's drive-thru hey thanks for watching the video if you liked it and want to see more there's a couple other
