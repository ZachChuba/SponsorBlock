alright folks a welcome to another episode of RL crafts it's an exciting time to be alive completely naked with nothing in my inventory alone not alone in the world but with torches going out which is definitely good for us that was very startling to I was like Doug did you know like movement and stuff but that's some RL crafts with your friend O's and have yourself a great time and also realized I think I need to adjust my fov yep yeah so we just updated we're now on two point six point three which is the latest version of RL craft so some things have changed slightly like the next 10 minutes is there really a really there's nothing I good news this one was it was kind of a traumatic one because certain dungeons and stuff like that will break in from - from the previous version that we were on to this one however from there should be fine moving forward so it should be as big a deal so I see you teared out some stuff since last time I just have been kind of leveling and then I noticed that I can get XP from farming and so that's handy ok so far that's cool so far and so really I've been just gathering up wood gathering up stone mining a little bit of iron when I could find it and then just building out our farm and stuff just trying to kind of make it so that we can be a bit better established than we were have you noticed this lunar grew at the top of the screen no you don't have a boss bar at the top of your screen that says lunar grew no I do not oh that's cool because I do okay I don't mean where I didn't see where you wanted off to I just went back into our base because despite the fact that you made me a set of tools I would prefer them to be made of iron if at all possible would that be a bad idea well no I had stone and then why use those stone tools to find iron which probably okay and they were like you know I would never use stone even though that's how that stone is beneath me Zod's who beneath me now I had a couple people leave some recommendations saying I make a summoning staff and this has been recommended quite a bit and we do have the resources to do that yes so I feel like we should do it I'm just gonna show me like look I've got minions and have you go how oh okay cool but yeah you can't pull a fast one on me get rekt good show we may all right bonus necessary not a stick yes and now we'll each have ourselves a beautiful glorious summoning staff which so does this take mana or something oh you gotta have magic you got to be level eight magic I mean I whoa select a minion to summon whoa okay this is a very this is wild whoa hah like summoning focused cost oh my goodness okay this is actually pretty cool this is actually pretty cool if I can spawn one of these boyos also I made you an axe and apparently it's worthless I don't know how or why or if that's just random but yeah it is literally worthless I had a pokey accident and a worthless act so go me so how do I actually summon this is the question I don't know how to get out of this menu why are all my axe is so terrible wait oh oh here we go oh [Laughter] this is amazing I like it I like it a lot okay hold on wait so why are there frogs summon them hold on the question can I can I recall them what I can go into them and they have a settings menu or I can change what they do I do that yes if I make you aggressive okay as wondering if aggressive would cause it to come after you Wow I just I just wanted to test but how do I go into the menu on this thing is the question hmm bro I just made frogs amazing they like the water I just made another frog but what I want to do is not make a frog I want to make something else I know how to not make frogs Hey I've selected my Patronus and it's a frog permanently stuck on it so choose a good one cuz apparently I don't know how to switch off of this thing let's see what he made let's see what the man's has done what if we oh look you got the Geo net that's pretty cool dude and then how did you get back into the minnow that's what I don't know I I don't know the enemy you were saying you were saying you you were able to change their settings and stuff like it's oh oh if you just right-click on one with the wand you can change the setting of that particular one I'm not even getting that oh I don't know man that one I hope oh wait no Frick I thought right shift right click and they have an inventory what what no you can put a chest on it you can put a chest on the thing oh god stop cease oh okay maybe disappeared hey yeah they're not perpetual but perhaps you need to create another summoning staff in order to summon a different mob I don't know if that's how it works that's like very it seems very um open the beach area to get back in the menu that seems very from the bestiary I got it press press e go to the bestiary which is that yeah and then go to the something tab oh okay cool oh and you can queue up different ones to summon I see y'all is there I want oh I wonder if that's like get three of them or if that's the third one cuz I only want one I can only need one to swallow me around for ages and ages why are you like this No get out of this menu I can't summon it oh oh you're summoning focus summoning Faust okay I think I figured it out yeah there we go oh I got little miniature versions of the big thing that ruined me last episode so that's exciting yeah it's super exciting and I got a little face hugger so that's pretty cool too okay I like this cool alright so this is very exciting now that we've got this and also what I learned is if you hit the L key there's another way of leveling up so I've got mine set into mining Oh okay so is the L key is that the same as skills or it's a different thing different okay it is a different thing got it it's like a different tier I believe all right well I haven't done any of that one like that one i if you go into it and you can put some levels like I just got stone cutting which means a harvest stone faster that's sort of okay yeah I should have been working on that except I hadn't which is a bit of a bummer well let me make what was the thing called that I lost that I was a halberd of course can iron halogen I should make another halberd easy easy peasy lemon squeezy yeah they're they're good because they reach quite far wait what's wrong yes why now we are pretty low on iron because we lost most of our stack right we're low ish on iron that were I would agree with that assessment we're also gonna need to go and recollect leather which is exciting we have some yeah we do have a little bit but we're gonna know and I've made a canteen I've made a couple of poles so actually do you want me to make you an iron halberd yes please okay got you that would be that would be adlai got you mate here you go dude there you go drop it on the ground right there otherwise yes I suppose and we're going armoires to armoires we don't have furniture around here that's that's very unfortunate you never you hate to see it you hate to see it mm-hmm well I guess we should go mining and NGO that we don't get rekt yes like I mean I know we're supposed to explore but we we kind of need at least a little bit a year getting cursed Oh oh he's fast why is he fast Oh easy there Texas yeah Oh God okay well yeah I guess we'll do a little bit of mining and then come back we'll regroup and we'll have lots of gear it'll be great let me let me this level thing oh okay mining XP from or XP from crafting XP from mobs huh well mining would probably be a good wait do oh oh you want to pick a specialty yeah that's what it is a specialty hmm you chose mining I did okay I guess I'll do that and then let's see Oh stone cutting prospecting very interesting mining specific you experiencing right now how come I can't increase right now you need to have at least five levels I don't know how many you have in crow okay increase the stone harvesting speed 30% Wow prospect fairly well and especially considering I have a stone pickaxe and have not found any iron or anything of any note yeah I'm gonna go deeper but let's see how Oh things seemed to go a little faster I mean that's pretty cool I think there was a lot of stuff down here we just didn't harvest because we thought we were pretty decent sources no cuz we actually thought we were good on resources we were just looking for diamonds we didn't actually die that much bro I'm about I'm about to spawn this bro yeah I do he's gonna he's gonna defend me down here anything tries to get up in my face and D monetize me he's gonna get my back that's how we do it I got I got the I got the rats on my side oh no I got one of the the cinders dude one of the fancy fire boys okay all right except green I made him green because apparently yeah where you make a glue down the dduba die like whatever you want but anyway alright never again wait okay here we go I want to I want to put this in action there you go dude attack attackee bro nope yep attack be be aggressive be aggressive yes there we go yeah oh my god dude he's raining fire on the freakin zombie nice hold on I want to see you glow you what okay just got one-hit ko by a zombie that's pretty cool I'm fine I got myself getting a helmet right it's true I'm not wearing any armor but that's I want to get poked in the eye by a zombie that wasn't the goal I got it though I get my stuff it's fine don't worry about it oh boy all right iron armor back on we out here life's good yeah we're going yep full set of iron a little bit more smelting there should be enough for you to do a full set as well although I don't know if there will be many left if we're to D monetize and not be able to recover but whatever the case may be we got iron we got a summoning staff and things are you know they're looking up forests oh yeah yeah we're gonna up we're golden at this point nothing can hurt us now no dude I can see no problems with anything ever we're doing totally fine I've been trying to level things up a little bit more in areas that I hadn't focused on nearly as much yeah do you want me to make you a full set of armor I have the amount of iron for it I just don't know if you want to use all the iron sure do it okay I'll do it let's do it all right mate we back in action here we go we're ready to go exploring again I damn near turned around and killed you like it was like we are right we got a rat we got a written incoming rat on the horizon Oh buddy why am i trapped I'm instability there we go nice taking that thing down my crops man it's just instability all over those crops you hate to see it yeah hey well hey I mean Oh feel free to yes spawn your own rats dude that's how you can bat it so um do we want to reattempt exploration we certainly can I wear would you wear would you want to attempt do you think who boy well not not that direction apparently different one maybe that was one thing is with the server updates and everything like that I do think our humble our is gone and it might be the thing guys so and I'm not necessarily sad about it no no I'm not not at all it you know let's go okay we can go in that direction but I suppose before going I might want to stock up on a little bit of food and then we'll be able to you know hopefully go off on a successful exploration this time I'm ready to go I don't have any bandages which sucks but you know what maybe we'll get some from de monetizing some on I have one bandage and some plaster and I think you use plasters bandages I don't know what that is oh hey but I took some damn damn so hey how about that regenerate that regions always a region on my head alright you didn't expect that we were gonna be out exploring again this soon huh no you did oh well I mean you did some work you did some work there's no doubt about that there's also a fiery thing underwater that I'm kind of concerned about why is there a fire going through the water that's scary oh that's a small one of the things he dead blight abaya was demonetized by zine and now all of a sudden they have a lot of experience which is interesting does it actually that's what I'm wondering I'm like what wait why why do I have this much wait is it legit it is legit dang I just leveled my mining like crazy I'm gonna be able to use that diamond pickaxe soon boy so I think the deal is that whatever used 11 levels to give myself a prospecting level one of five on that el menú yeah I okay so it did actually decrease your exp yeah 100% it wasn't doing it for me interestingly enough all right so water oh wait oh oh oh I see so the canteen whoa whoa whoa whoa easy there bud so the the blights etag the blade is a tag I think when you monetize a mob that has blight on it I think that is what gives you a massive amount of experience because that's what happened after that zombie as well the blight zombie that's just that it's like it's a modifier you missed you pass up some iron sorry okay cool maybe it's just like a modifier and they just had more xp for those modifier like blight is like it can give you bad things oh we forgot sleeping bags though yeah I'm like an old grandma huh yeah we might want to have sleeping bags this could be good okay so we made it further now this time than we were previously which is very very exciting times I guess yeah let's say oh I don't have compass but let's just hope we can find our way back give a compass on you by the way yeah okay cool we'll be fine nothing nothing bad could ever happen at this point we're just we're just this direction yeah nothing bad could ever happen I don't think oh there's some kind of oh we got away stone boys well if we can find a way stone and then we can dodge a wrench you know what I mean where's where did you go for the way stone just down the hill from that ore deposit a little bit hey Carter Hills I don't know we want to rename it to something else I will go back to the ore deposit so that you can find me I appreciate that okay are you at the iron ore deposit oh yeah yeah okay so waste owner right over on the other side got it yep what is that thing what is what thing a little oasis thing is that were the way stone was all right over here with the farm yeah so it's not the best of farms given that it's icy that doesn't work too well but I guess there's at least one thing holed up here I'm so sorry pigs the pigs so nice right over there brah I see it don't worry I got it I'm sorry pigs but sometimes you just alright it's called carcass or hills and when we get back here we can use it just get back to where we've been before it so that's nice little quick TP gotta love it gotta love it alright let's continue along there should be tiles and tons of structures that no oh my leg oh god my leg that's that's a thing there that's a thing over there you might notice turkeys you may notice that's a thing yeah we could be monetize a turkey and get food thing has been noticed that's a that's a I notice significant pointy doing yeah the question is are we equipped to deal we are with the same thing can go wrong I don't think it's good mmm turkey litter is that what they are is a Turkey's turkeys dude it's Thanksgiving a month and a half early you get raw turkey legs from them mmm delish well what do you see in there so far it looks Hollow really I've seen nothing particularly liked about it okay well oh it's open down on this boat okay [Music] oh there's stairs down alright you know it seems what are these blocks by the way shadows shadows stone whilst associated with fear and despair the shadows are soft and somewhat comforting seem safe very very safe nothing could go wrong we are very underwater yeah that just elevated to a hope oh my god these slides the hell is this it absorbs light excuse me oh okay so it's a fire on obsidian you break it though do we want to break it and break the I mean you can break the fire I don't know oh my goodness now question do we think ants how poorly do we think this is gonna go with what shadow this just saw something in moving around in there it looks like others Enderman oh okay I mean could be worse right could be worse shadow crystal as the rune rapidly pulls in the light it becomes so dark that it is brights that's a rhyme great you broke what is this shadow crystal it's just one of the things with the emblem on them one of all the oh the lady bits got it um hey give me that water it's so dark that it's bright I see I'm just gonna do all three that's actually nice that we're canteen in a bucket you have basically a perpetual water source and like that okay well um yeah let's do it guys over here and oh it's skele man sir oh no no okay you want to back it you wanna back any water back it you want water yeah well I hope you're good okay that's a blight dude that's a blade dude so we take that out we get levels we get gear we get levels Wiggy oh there's a boy in the fire now to wait for him wait for him wait for him okay I got the one guy and Oh buddy he's got some bandages when I get that I'm gonna get that alright SiC okay so I got a bandage which will be helpful oh yeah check it out what'd you get Oh what is it what does it call an iron longsword it's two-handed so if I have something in my off hand then I be like fatigue its quality is rusted and but it has fire aspect on it so I can light things on fire okay well let me do let's do a aggressive normal yeah here we go you ready for this y'all ready for this I'll bring them in I'm gonna bring them in here we go boom bring them out bring him out oh you got it you got it dude god damn it he just one shot at me what I had armor yeah I noticed that you're a guy still here though you're Jane goose yeah good thing I'm at the waystone though so I'll be able to make it back in a jiff no problems I didn't pick up all your stuff and you is I can't help that sarcasm or not but whatever no I didn't pick up yourself okay I'm coming why are the summoned mobs so you I said them to aggressive and they're just like nah okay we're fine everything was good there are more monster boys in the next room though it was seen hold on let me put my gear on before we reaandtim did you get any leggings perchance I did okay I could take those yeah there there trumpet boyos oh that's an ende man so that's fine we don't need to engage god Enderman if terrifying in this texture pack though oh yeah like you see the cloud that comes up around it yeah dude that's crazy yes okay so far not much down any of these holes yeah we'll try the other side we have options here and I'm gonna freakin hey Jane goo you want to be dope this time and actually do something cuz that would be cool Oh whoa what is it it huh iron it nunchuck ax oh cool glowstone dust nice you can have the sperm a wool farmer iron nunchucks huh pretty cool attack damage oh they don't they don't do anything do they no I don't I mean I know like a weapon to me yeah but the requirement is attack level sixty nine thousand four twenty huh so also very interesting water over here and yeah that's just a bit unfortunate that we're not gonna be able to nunchuck ooh are we are we be careful cuz we might oh I did it I didn't realize there was gravel on top of that and I updated the water whoopsie daisies sorry about that folks Wow my bad my bad this is a this is a strange formation that's taking place here very strange indeed we had one job I know I was I was instructing you know don't do it again god there's gravel on top of everything huh it would appear that the world jen has interfered ever so slightly here I mean that happens sometimes when you have a lot of dungeons that's a spawner boy what I understand is supposed to be better to break spawners and also can drain them Oh break it I shall okay cool so down here we got a skel Abril hey janggu you want to do something useful make yourself useful and tank for the skelewu come here guys I don't want to get one shot it again he's standing very ominously still at the end of this hallway I choose aggressive that's what I did too freakin I'm worried Jang goos come on Jang goos there good there they go they're doing things they're shooting water at the skeleton they're distracting him he's trying to 360noscope them but he can't get shrekt skill a man dude he got absolutely handed and he got handed nothing yeah dead end so my assumption is that the the place we wanted to go to probably got messed up by whatever had been it could have been the update or any number of things well I don't know that we've generated these chunks before have we I don't I think we've been out like I don't think we're that far from where the the cockatrice is were no we're in a different direction from where the cockatrice is where we went west and then we headed north and here we just went north so they're a little bit to the west of us but I think we're kind of I think we went way way way way further west yeah we started off with having way further west let's I mean we could just check the exterior sleeping sleep sleep sleep yes yes I may not rest now they're monsters nearby oh god oh god it's an angry boy well we're fine oh no we're not fine we're not fine it's an angry boy you stupid nightmare what is it it grew oh it's a nightmare it's up there I see it and it's gone now what I don't like this I just want to sleep stop giving me nightmares are you asleep yet no I can't you may not rest there are monsters nearby I also have insomnia so I think what's happening is I need to let the insomnia count down to zero and then it will allow me what I might do let's see if the that go out here yeah it looks like the dungeon got fully dead ended sadly we're gonna have to find some more cool stuff all right two one and I could sleep down okay it was just a mild case of insomnia you know the drill oh there's a little shipwreck looking thing oh that's no bad bad bad manta ray don't like them those those I have trauma from those I've just continued heading north I've continued heading north and there appears to be a shipwreck and a sharknado there's a sharknado over here never mind the shipper is is going ham after someone Oh after another Reaper my Reaper I see him fighting on the cliffside dude got Reaper ception over here Oh what the hey oh oh oh no no no do the manta rays are the worst I don't like them dude go get him yeah I mean look like that okay yeah it is a sharknado that's what I was saying oh there's multiple sharknados oh there's no need many sharknado yeah they might pull us in they might pull tornadoes attractant oh yeah oh yeah no I recall that I recall that fact it's a significant fact yep okay we should do another place there is a big dinosaur over there I don't know if it's nice or not but these big dinosaur it's kind of cool where big dinosaur dig mossy dinosaur if I was heading west yeah you got it you got me I see okay if you just kill yeah just go head on down past the snowy hillside to the west I see you I see you up on the hillside everybody go this way yep yep you're heading down and they're not there's a there's a creeper that's on fire right in front of me just keep on heading down do you see I'm like dead ahead of you dead ahead hey go see on the Left where the creeper is I sort of oh it's an energized creeper or at least it kind of looks like it so I'll avoid that anything in this thing no this doesn't look to go to a lot of places oh oh there's a thing on top of this hillside though looks like a house let's check that out structure but I know that you can fine you can find some pretty wild stuff okay we got a we got a caucus right I don't think it's the cockatrice but it's the same family it's one of the one of the rappers feather rappers wasn't it something like that now there were comments from people saying do you not know the lure of the cockatrice you don't look at it but I don't think that's how but apparently you're not supposed to look directly at it but I don't think that's how it was working I'm pretty sure it was just going at us no matter what was that can turn you to stone I'm not sure if it was that but it's just apparently a do not look kind of deal give me give me Dad give me dad I'm trying to avoid looking at it no but I don't think that's actually cockatrice though yeah okay but I did still definitely attacked you when I acting like one hmm it's doing the wither laser yeah no I'm definitely getting with her later okay do you need oh god I'm on fire I'm incinerating right now okay okay just just cool me down I killed it I can't let me down dead okay still still on fire still definitely very much on fire and need to get out of the desert God the deserts like a freaking nether bro don't you have a bucket I do and I'm trying to get inside of it and it's terrible trying to get my bucket oh there we go inside the water yeah whatever bro okay I'm just saying it we're overheating a little you know ever so slightly whoo deep breaths I'm still on fire even inside the water if you go eh I see you do you see my name I'm in this watery puddle below you you just walked right by me there's a little water next to the Sheep dude who's walking around yeah okay I'm in water too okay it's a good place to be that's kind of where you want to be those cheaper those cheaper or those those create creepy things are supposed to be kind of basically the the like and I version of sheep - oh okay wait you're in water oh I see you just to it in this puddle it'd be greed though if like I don't know there was maybe a cool big structure that could spawn near us perhaps I mean I'm I'm still very hot but at least I'm no longer taking damage huh whoa deep breaths underwater with water is apparently the way to go wait did you find that what is this uh oh you might not this whole thing I thought maybe you like found your water and stone sides it's not it's not difficult with sandstone to dig Thanks I gotta I gotta okay all right I wonder if it nighttime it'll cool off at all I mean it's looking for I'm looking forward to running around at night I I am too but really it's like what are their options do we even have at this point man okay well I guess let's yeah you can let's see if we can get on out of here right oh boy it's gonna be nighttime soon though so maybe I did okay we're getting the water there is a thing over here and it looks like some kind of wither flat for this is kinda and weird yeah but it just looks like regular regular stuff it's a it's just a skeleton skull huh yeah you can get that um it's a cool place though it's very cool structures I don't know if this is a unique biome must be oh wait you're oh this is pretty cool yeah yeah yeah have we made it to Bryce in Utah and I maybe I wasn't expecting to go there quite so soon but here we are a lot of pigs over there dude lot of pigs we get plenty of food okay well you wanna do you want to sleep and risk the whole it's gonna be really hot situation or do we risk the mob situation I I think we're past the desert because we've got these canyons we can drop down to I think I could be wrong let's be woefully incorrect well we can sleep it off if you feel confident oh the confidence is through the roof okay well here we go through the roof here goes nothing I'm sure nothing could go wrong as we try to investigate this is never been area more confidence well I think technically we're still in the desert so we need to cross over this place no look we're so hot I'm hottest bro what do you find oh oh this is interested yeah this tummy's pretty cool dude oh oh oh oh oh ND man that oh I thought it was mad I thought he was mad there's definitely some boyos down creepy coming up creepy boy coming up nope nope nope nope now why is he mad oh god this problem problem problem okay whoa I need to bandage up after that one I should have summoned thanks for the summon though my bandage is almost yeah I got your back whoo all right you know we are kind of nearing probably an episode break here so do we want to I guess continue the exploration in the next one
