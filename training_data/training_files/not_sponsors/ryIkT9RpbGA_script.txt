hi I'm Tasha with one big happy life on behalf of the financial diet and this is the lifestyle fix brought to you by skill share when it comes to creating daily success routines for your life morning routines get a lot of airtime over the years my morning routine has varied from rolling out of bed brushing my teeth and being out of the door in ten minutes and I'm talking about me heading into the office just last week here two hour-long multi-part routines with journaling and meditation but the truth is no matter what style of morning routine I'm currently using the real hero when it comes to setting me up to have a great day is my evening routine in today's video I'll be sharing five essential parts of my everyday evening routine I'll also drop a link down in the description box and in a cart up above to a video of my family's so you can check that out and see the tips play out in real life number one I get home early so I have two kids a 17 year old and a three year old throughout their lives my kids have typically gotten home anywhere from 3 to 4 p.m. and I've always made it a priority to get home as close to that time as possible so that I'm available to spend time with them and help them with their homework I get to ask them annoying parent questions like how was your day and did anything fun happen at school today seriously though the first 30 minutes or so of my time home is typically spent hanging out in the kitchen with my family just catching up I'm incredibly lucky to have a close-knit family that loves spending time together part of that is the result of years of making quality interactions a priority the other great thing about getting home early saved by 4:30 p.m. at the latest is that it makes for a more leisurely evening with more time to relax at the end of the day squeeze in a workout if need be and get the family ready for the next day while still having time to watch a show on Netflix or read a book now that you know why I like getting home early let's talk about how I get home early when I'm job hunting I always look for positions that allow me to get home at a reasonable time so that I can spend time with my children it also comes into play when I'm deciding where I want to live because longer commutes mean later arrival times and less time at home so in other words I structured my life around getting home early to be with my children because it's a priority for me in the eight years I've been working since law school I've spent less than two in jobs that didn't allow me to be home by 4:30 p.m. most days so what am I willing to do to have a schedule that I want I'm willing to take pay cuts I passed on a hundred and sixty thousand dollar a year law firm salary to take a $60,000 Public Interest job with complete schedule flexibility I'm willing to completely disregard traditional employment rules and just leave a job after just six months because they wanted me to travel out of the state for weeks at a time when my son was an infant and I'm willing to walk away from my legal career to run my own business so that I can have complete control over my schedule by the way if you're watching this video on August 16th which is when this video is gonna be published then today is officially my last day working as an employee come on over to Instagram and celebrate with me at one big happy life number two I look at my schedule for the next day on Sundays I spend an hour or so planning out my entire week that way I make sure that I'm making time for what matters during my week and so that I can be prepared for any changes in my schedule then during the week in the evenings I take a look at my schedule for the next day and I make any last-minute tweaks if I need to I'll also take a look at the weather so I'll know whether I need to take a jacket or an umbrella the next day checking my calendar in the evening was less important a few years ago before we started our business one big happy life because we run our business in the evenings and weekends I'll often have some things that I want to do for the business during my commute the next day so I want to make sure that I prepare for that that night before starting next week when I switch over to working on the business full-time I'll start reviewing my calendar at the end of my workday like I do with my job right now number three I prep my food and coffee the night before we do most of the heavy lifting for our food on the weekends when we meal prep but during the week we might have to do a little midweek meal prep like boiling a few more eggs for breakfast or making some overnight oats our mornings are pretty busy especially in the mornings when we have to go in the office so by prepping our food the night before that's one last thing that we have to do in the morning we also set our coffee maker the night before that way when we get downstairs our coffee is already ready all we have to do is pour it into our thermoses and go now when I lived closer to work I used to take the time to make myself breakfast in the morning spinach and egg frittatas were my go-to because they take less than 10 minutes to make and on the days when I work from home I do tend to still make myself a hot breakfast in the mornings but on the days when I head into the office I spent 3 hours commuting a day and I have to be more selective about how I spend my time outside of work number 4 I have a set bedtime I get into the office by 6:30 a.m. which means that I wake up early every single weekday morning even on the days when I work from home I still start my workday at the same time the key to waking up early is to also go to bed early so I have an 8:30 p.m. bedtime most nights on the weekends I do tend to stay up a few hours later even though I know that technically I should keep a consistent bedtime on the days when I work from home I used that extra time where I'm no longer commuting to either do some work for one big happy life if I'm coming up on a deadline or I'll have a more extended relaxed morning routine complete with journaling and meditation it just depends on what's going on on any given day so here are some things that actually help me get to bed on time each evening number one I try not to pack too much into my weekday evening so I'll rarely run errands cook complicated meals or do anything that's too involved on the weekdays I save my errands for early mornings on the weekends number two my kids have bedtimes when I mentioned this in a previous video some people were shocked that my 17 year old has a bedtime here's the thing we all need a certain amount of sleep for optimal health teens need eight to 10 hours of sleep so my daughter's bedtime is set to give her approximately 9 hours of sleep it's a matter of creating lifelong healthy sleep habits and of course we as the adult also practice what we preach because Alexis wakes up after we do she's often up later than us but she understands that she needs to be in bed at a certain time and is mature enough to follow through which then allows us to go to bed before her while still knowing that we've done our parental duty number 5 I go to bed with my partner Joseph and I head to bed together at 95 percent of the time from the beginning of our relationship we fell into this routine of moving through our bedtime routine at the same time we floss brush our teeth shower and then climb into bed again you can see what I mean by this by checking out our family routine video that I linked in the description box as Joseph and I are getting ready for bed we're chatting with each other and having some much-needed adult time after a long day of managing work our home our business and our kids and when I say we do our routine together I really mean it Joseph and I also shower together almost every night we love it because it's a way for us to relax with each other and nurture our relationship at the same time plus it sets the stage for other things to progress from there it's sort of like having a date night every night now you might be thinking this is only possible because we have a huge bathroom we don't we have a standard bathroom with a standard tub and shower combo but what's really funny is that for the first half of our relationship we lived in homes and apartments that had a tiny single person three by three shower and yet we still will always shower together we're both lucky that we both enjoy koshering because it really is a great way to end the day on a happy note now don't miss out and
