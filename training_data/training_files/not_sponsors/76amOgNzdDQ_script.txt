okay today I'm going to show you the amazing floating table okay so I have here some regular thread now thread and rope are really interesting and useful things they can hold up really well under tension a tiny little thread can hold up a significant amount of weight so if instead I wanted to hold these scissors on top of the thread let's try that nope so of course this thread can't hold anyway on top of it that's because the compressive force that it can take is basically zero it immediately buckles under any compression whereas for tension it can hold a significant amount of weight but what if today we wanted to try and experiment where we actually put compressive loads on thread so I'm going to be trying to make a table that's supported by just thread let's see if I can do it so first let me just try to support these two triangles of cardboard using just thread as the legs and now as you'd expect it buckles immediately as soon as I put any pressure on it so as soon as I let go of the top triangle it collapses well maybe things aren't balanced just right let's try to put some Center weights on it and try to balance it a little better and it still doesn't work so you can see that I've secured these two pieces together with string and they hang here just fine but watch what happens when I set it down it doesn't collapse somehow the strings are able to support it still now normally when you let stuff go like that it should just collapse but watch what happens when I let it go look at this thing so cool okay let's see how much way it can actually support the can [Music] there's some scissors on it Oh [Music] so to figure out how this is working let's add a little bit more weight and see where we can see some of the deformation Oh so wired it up break the center string so without the center string we're out of luck but these three outer strings still played a role if you only have the center string it would just tip over these kept it balanced so basically whenever one side started to get pulled it pulled these intention to stop it from tipping so it's cool about a contraption like this is because it only relies on tensile forces and not compressive forces you could build it out of materials that have a very high tensile force like spider silk and if I did that I would only need a thread that's a hundred and forty-seven microns in diameter to support this entire five-pound weight if I made it out of carbon nanotubes then I could get it to support this five-pound weight with this thread in the center that is only 22 microns in diameter now this type of structure is called a tensegrities structure and relies on the tensile strength of the chords within it it also relies on the compressive strength of the beams but usually these compressed beams aren't touching each other for example in this one these were under compression you could notice that this one was slightly bending when we put weight on it so it was under compression in parts of it but they're not usually touching each other so it appears to be floating now tensegrities structures are really interesting because it gives the illusion of floating you can actually make real structures based on these principles here for example the largest tensegrities was opened on October 2009 in Brisbane Australia it's called the coral publique an see it here now what's cool about the tensegrities structures is if you viewed it from the outside as a black box you wouldn't actually know it was only under tension in the threads there it would seem like its own component where you could kind of push on and it was kind of squishy you could turn it and it was squishy but you wouldn't know that it was actually just supported by threads now I tried to look up when the original tensegrities system was created and there's a lot of controversy about it but then I realized the original tensegrities system is our own body basically our tendons are like the cords here and our bones are like these discontinuous members under compression so so our tendons are only strong under tensile strength so you can only pull on them to have them be strong but you can't push on them so when you actually have to lift away or pick something up it does it through tensile forces and the compressive forces are only in your bones and so it appears like your tendons are doing all the work here being pulled up by your muscles but your bones are actually under compression so in your musculoskeletal system your tendons act like the members under tension and your bones act like the discontinuous members under compression so it's really neat that our bodies have this tensegrities structure meaning that if I want to pick something up it doesn't require my bone to be shaped like this in order to take the compressive forces but basically all I need is these discontinuous members like bones that are held to bet held together by these tensile forces of my ligaments and so that makes me be able to move in different directions and be very pliable and bendable but still really structurally sound and thanks for latest videos out and thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
