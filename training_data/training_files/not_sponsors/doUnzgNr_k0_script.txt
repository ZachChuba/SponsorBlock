slice of ham i'm heading to dorgish khan the hidden goblin city we uncovered last time we helped them out looking for a guy named er tag your tag birthday here they are so it looks like they're building a train station it links keldagrim with dorgish khan kind of uniting the dwarves and the goblins they got a little quirky relationship going on that's nice they need some help digging up some [ __ ] and i'm like i did an archaeology exam one time it was like nine questions long and i just guessed until i got them right but i'm perfectly qualified for this let me dig give me dig tools train stations should be right through here see what we're working with this place sucks but i see digging people oh sanic so there's some ancient goblin artifacts buried in the ground around here and i'm gonna extract them and clean them because i'm a good guy and i do things like this all the time man i bet you guys love rock cleaning content this is what you're itching for every day you love this can't get enough wow look at how good i am look at xanax eyes bulged they're always bulging but like today especially they're huge the only interesting thing we found was a mace it's got some ancient writing on it so we're gonna take it to a scribe and be like what does this say and he's gonna be like i don't know how much money you got so let's go find that guy damn xanax you kind of creepy as [ __ ] sometimes yeah i forgot the dorkish and tribe they don't do the whole violence thing and they're like i don't know what the weapon is amazing she's like why don't you go talk to the surface goblins they're very resourceful and smart and intelligent and awesome this guy's gonna make us a moving over distance sphere as he calls it to get us to goblin village faster so that's funny what's funny the fact that this is the coolest teleport in the game and it's used once for a dumb goblin quest yet it's goddamn hilarious oh my god my ass who you don't bother with formalities they drink their own spit breed with their own siblings it's [ __ ] they should have been the lost tribe shut up grub foot yeah shut up grub foot grub foot had a dream about xanax last night she's the chosen commander pretty sure that's a runescape three quest i'll never do that quest by the way unless they put it in this game they're just making this big deal about xanax being the chosen commander suddenly she's giving a speech oh look at her go she's enthusiastic about it she's pumped what's happening here look at these animations uh-oh uh that guy just turned to stone ash something he's not alive anymore what is happening we under attack yeah maybe the [ __ ] was that there are two snipers up there they've got ops hundreds of hours and cs goes trained me for this fake flash i don't think they fell for it okay i'm just gonna go around this way it seems like the only logical thing to do flank successful honey i'm home who is this it's a joke about an affair yeah good guys win whoa xanax getting killed by sigmund the guy i've killed like 70 times he flashbanged me no make one move and i'll slit her throat yeah you don't get to bypass the whole rng thing there's a chance you hit a zero on that slit throat animation so suck a dick i'm taking her to the tunnel we built from lumbridge swamp caves to the new okay i'll see you there thanks for telling me exactly what you're doing i know every step of your plan now i will be five steps ahead of you congratulations your back's turned now i'm gonna snipe you in the face why am i not sniping him i have the high ground why am i on the low ground i just passed him with his back turned to me what did what just happened what was the continuity there what uh [ __ ] this i'm going to kill that guy i'm meeting some goblin generals over here holy [ __ ] these dudes are yolked they are built different all right time to infiltrate i'm gonna distract these guys and then uh what did i do all right well i guess that's not how we're gonna do this let's try that one six or eight more times okay one of you wait here goblin kill it yeah do a little bit of that perfect he's got two on him hiding behind the boxes he's gonna walk right past me you are you [ __ ] kidding me kind of special agent hand members are these oh i'm supposed to literally click hide behind i can just take the last guy probably wait what what what what he was excited about seeing the goblin and then he [ __ ] turned around i was like wait a second i think i saw something over there okay he's gonna walk past me i'm practically invisible good die goblin okay he is engaged in combat he's completely distracted now we're gonna stick this guy on the guy over here no no no don't stay over there come get this guy stop he [ __ ] he just stayed over there intruder no no no no not me couldn't be me come here i gotta show you who the real intruders are you'll be shocked and he's stuck behind the [ __ ] boxes i can't win please yes okay all right that was the most scuffed way this could have gone but we've done it oh my god we meet again by release how do you know it's coming down the ladder hey what's going on oh the classic western train stuck situation all right so he's gonna be praying like he did last time but i've got this ancient mace ancient mace special attack gets rid of prayer because it's an atheist mace and that's what they do see see how it all comes together yeah he's dead now you win but someday i'll what do you mean someday what the [ __ ] is that guy's issue dude i can't ever kill him he's always got some sort of like hologram fighting me or something he's invincible look out xanax train station celebration baby the goblins and the dwarves are like the same people now it's beautiful quest complete let's uh let's get out of here so i started this tradition where every sunday i stream barrows on twitch they have a prediction system so everyone watching can get their fix of irresponsible channel point gambling we throw some more rotten food in the chest now that it's open and then we're gonna jump for joy we're gonna jump for joy we're gonna jump we're gonna jump for joy and we're gonna open it up whatever dude i found myself in yet another situation where i had gone 58 chests dry on stream since my song rng is about the 59th chest i thought it'd only be fitting to prove chest 5 nine was the real deal [Music] 59 drive baby i told you this is going to be the one r [ __ ] g 59. i [ __ ] told you i [Music] i've never had the opportunity to do a quest with a friend on by release every quest up to this point has been done solo so when kevin told me he was about to do this next one for his series i couldn't pass it up we met up at sears village and i took him to may 15 2007 to start quest 126 dream mentor damn by release yeah looking ravenous like you want to murder some [ __ ] animals let's get addicted to cigarettes i'll make this quest go by a lot easier also i'm turning my roofs off can't have those on i need to be able to blow our cigarette smoke directly into the rooves in the houses do you have a chimney in your house no it's spirally sticking his mouth through my window and blowing and smoking how many times you've done this quest i'd be lying to you if i said that this was not like number 11. the 11th time you've done it i've done this quest a lot yes you have to do a lot of [ __ ] to get to this point that means you've done absolute horseshit 11 times i've done every quest in this game at least four times brace yourself all right here we go go down that ladder be quick about it okay okay stay on your feet we're actually not gonna be able to see each other for this one but we're technically in the same cave yeah oh i need 85 combat i can't do this are you [ __ ] kidding me what combat level are you i'm 83. how can you get two combat levels really quick i could get defense and ruin my account entirely that's it i'll be moral support for you man and just like that my dreams of doing a quest with a friend we're crushed looks like we're gonna have to figure this one out ourselves this dude is down bad he looks how i feel let's see what we can do for him we've gotta nurture him back to health this interface right here is gonna tell us how he's doing not only do we have to get his health up we have to raise his spirits and gear him up for battle i'm basically a nurse on the go and a therapist and a blacksmith all for free i make great choices i spend my time very wisely we're gonna shove fish into this dude's mouth until he suffocates that'll get his health right back up the man rejects the food it seems he would rather some variety oh really yeah when i'm one hp begging for revival i also refuse to eat a shark and then another shark because i mean i just had a shark why would i eat another one that's that's dumb take a trout take a tuna suck a dick look at that he's awake he's like stop man no more fish please i i didn't even chew any of it there's just huge fish in my stomach swimming around take this trout now we have to get his spirits up by giving assurance that he's going to get out of here don't worry god i always know exactly what to say do you hear that noise just [ __ ] with him so hard stomp in front of his face what was that noise whoa something's coming man i gotta go those are some deep cuts on your legs probably gonna have to amputate them in your arms too maybe just to be safe you seem like a nice guy right back at you oh this is turning into like a romantic novel is it getting hot down here or what whoa he's sitting up his name is cyresus he was attacked by suckas the crazy orc looking guys outside why didn't he just teleport away and solve all his problems who doesn't bring teleports when you're going to someplace like this also how did he get to this island in the first place i had to bribe a pirate and like break a whole curse off a ship to get here look out spider just kidding dumbass stay on your toes oh my god you look how i feel that's a real thing you can say can you smell gas i think someone's gassing us good thing i'm wearing a helmet yeah all this dialogue just keeps looping and repeating itself and he is up i guess he's a big adventurer with lots of 90 plus skills he's got high combat skills too but he's really shitty when it comes to fighting we've got to go get his armor from the bank so he won't be scared to leave he didn't tell me what he wants so we're just gonna have to guess what he wants to wear er die jack oh this is the navigator from lunar diplomacy the guy that sucks at doing the one thing he's supposed to yeah look at that he's getting mouthy with me oh behold the great adventurer by release how the world would crumble without him uh it [ __ ] would first of all second nice job you got here dude went from piracy to a shitty banker no one even talks to you they use a quick option to just skip dialogue and get right into their bank you're literally just a machine at this point you're like an atm machine a robot that's a battle pass moment bird eye good [ __ ] dawg i didn't want to do this but i'm going to call kevin again because i need to pick the right things out of the bank to give to ciricius whatever his dumb name is and i don't want to run all the way back here yeah i've just been [ __ ] talking this guy my favorite part is when you're giving this guy [ __ ] you're you're doing it from a comfort from a helmet so you're like oh what a hurt i think this guy's a [ __ ] so he wants um aaron's top and bottom i think he goes for infinity boost but i'm not sure i'll try it you've done this quest 11 times so my trust to you not what i wanted but close are you kidding me he said the boots it's the [ __ ] boots dude i don't know which one to do i mean honestly just try rangers this guy sucks why didn't i just say all right you got these three boots in the bank which one do you want it's a guessing game with him because he wasn't actually dead he's all about the theatrics oh he loves it you look like a complete dumbass no cape no shield no gloves i've healed this guy like a thousand hp he rejects the food it seems that he thinks you're a [ __ ] loser i forgot to record i'm very good at what i do basically the girl that runs this place told me i need to make another dream potion go into that guy's dreams face his fears and destroy anything in there that's scary so that's what we're gonna do i remember the boss fights being hard i've never used ancients on this account before i think now's our moment i think it's it's time i feel cool i feel real cool doing this look at those spells those icy bloody so [ __ ] expensive spells they're so expensive but it's fine we're gonna destroy anything that tries to kill us in there all right we're back we're ready for action light the fire baby yeah bring us in ceresis your name is so dumb i hate saying it here we go ugh why am i freaking out electrons rather pretty he's not paying attention to what he needs to pay attention to this is uh probably why i found him dead uh wowzer that's what you have to say wowza me when someone asks when the next spy release is are you good enough to fight yeah watch this so i'm just gonna continuously cast the same spell over and over again fight to give me courage why are you saying things she'll never get me they're not

yourself to hurt another yes i can watch this here i go oh there he goes uh you're in you just teleported into the monster you are literally in the crossfire right now stop looking at me what if you

hope you're okay i'm fine dude take like two steps back it's not even attacking me anymore this thing just gave up oh yeah you just went up like five levels on the battle pass ceriseus change your name man well we win i think we gotta go talk to the lady and then we're done i've conquered my fear of combat oh yeah that's what you did he's gonna teach me some lunar spells whoa man thank you so much i'm sure that'll help me a lot the way i don't have any astral runes i appreciate it man quest complete whoa what do you think about that blonde floating lady that i got 79 hp is that impressive and cute and handsome of me okay i gotta go but first let me do something like this now i can afford to do things again let's uh let's go i literally moved my house to taverly so i didn't have to walk farther than falador i'm a lazy [ __ ] uh june 4th 2007 quest 127 grim tales talking to silas over here he's yelling and shouting about beans or something oh they're magic beans that's so cool man sign me up no idea what the magic of these beans does but magic beans gotta do something so i want them perhaps he said he's willing to give me these beans but not for gold he needs some rare artifacts he wants a feather from a griffin an evil ass bird on top of white wolf mountain and he wants a helmet from a dwarf named rupert who's locked up in a tower to the east if i get him these rare artifacts he wants and i'll give me the beans so let's go get ourselves into some trouble for no reason dude i can't find this bird i thought he was over here he's always been up here where the f oh in the damn hell and bob and neat are here what are they doing are they always here is this a one in five million chance to stumble upon them on their little walk together i've never seen them here before hey what's going on bird he wants to eat my legs and i don't like that all the wolves over here are howling and [ __ ] listen he can't fall asleep because of that so he wants me to read him a bedtime story and he loves death and fire and destruction i'm gonna improvise alright grimnash one time there was a dude named thurial321 all right this dude was a psychopath he basically hacked the entire world and started killing everybody he was freezing him whipping him wiping everyone out in his path people were begging for their lives wanting to escape but he just kept whipping and slashing and freezing saying lol and then everybody died everybody grimnash literally everybody they were begging for their lives in falador and that ain't a fairy tale grimnash we left through it that was history hey it worked just gonna take one of these sleep tight little baby this is the tower that the dwarf is locked up in just gonna walk in just kidding it's locked excuse me you can't go in there oh sorry what if i just did a little breaking and entering just a little bit just not a lot just a little bit whoops slipped fell and broke into private property what's uh what's going on here the drain pipe is too rusty to climb okay what if we talked into it hello is that one of the gods yes you're going to hell just stopping by to let you know that's all the i'll see you i'll see you later all right yeah this is the dwarf up here hey what's that noise over there oh [ __ ] you uh anyway yeah so this dwarf's being held prisoner by the princess told him i'm gonna think about how to get him out i have just the plan actually uh i could kill the princess for you i could actually probably spec her out in one hit all pot up and everything who's gonna notice no one comes out here rupert's beard is like a mile long so he's gonna throw his beard down like rapunzel and i'm gonna climb up oh my god that is disgusting kinda just wanna kill the princess hey and he's naked and now his beard is just stuck out there there's zero chance of him moving now so from what i'm gathering this gnome was investigating the disappearance of one of his friends he suspected the witch down the street did it and this princess is related to that witch the princess noticed this gnome investigating the witch down the street so she kidnapped him for an unknown reason so now we're just gonna go talk to the princess and see what she's thinking because she's an idiot and i'm not so here we go she's holding the dwarf hostage so that her second cousin twice removed which relative [ __ ] face over there can come by and interrogate him and i'm like well what can we do to make you release him and she's like well i dropped the necklace over there the other day and a mouse stole it so you can go get it from the mouse and i'll be fine with him leaving so i'm gonna go try and recover her [ __ ] necklace hey we're back at the witch's house i remember mentioning this quest way back when saying that this house wouldn't be relevant again until this quest and here we are at this quest it's crazy how time works found some sheet music what if i did this crazy thing where i played that on the piano over there i'm gonna do it would you believe me if i told you that i had no [ __ ] idea how to read sheet music or anything to do with music honestly there's a banger it looks like i'm going to be shrinking down crawling into a mouse hole and finding this shitty pendant necklace thing here goes nothing thinly if you're watching no height jokes i don't want to hear it sorry i had to jesus christ what do i do here i don't see any door there's a grill i think this is the only place to go wait what's happening what no wait i should definitely still be small-sized i think i just [ __ ] up well time to release some anger by massacring at least three of these by three of these i mean one because i didn't bring any food and they're slapping me hard i just realized the stupid door symbol on the map i had to click the nails just gonna keep running around and climb and [ __ ] until i'd find it i guess how far did they drag this thing do they climb up the nails what is that i can't even tell if i've already been here i don't know where i am hey the pendant i bet you that sketchy dude that runs that black market right outside the waterfall quest he would pay a fortune for whatever this thing is i could just kill the princess save the dwarf and if he doesn't give me the helmet i need i'll just wipe him out and take it he has it on him it's been a long day here's your thing now you have to let him go and if you don't you're still gonna let him go i have multiple tricks and weapons up my sleeve sound of heavy footsteps amazing cinematics freedom what are you braveheart all right we got his helmet let's go claim our beans the beans are almost worthless perfect these beans can be planted in a patch just south of here it's gonna grow this big beanstalk thing and i can go up and get a golden goblin it's worthless to me but this guy's gonna give me an actual reward for getting that thing hopefully it's not free though i have to kill a big thing first let's just go do it let's just let's just go just planted the seed give it a little water all right what's happening whoa my emotions exactly let's climb it hey hey hey is that glod from the movies gods give glad strength what if we didn't do that so he turns my prayer off and destroys my prayer points he's uh he's actually pretty shitty he's doing a great job at being a [ __ ] bad guy oh my god i'm what if i went over here for a little bit oh my god it's the number this fight was meant to happen i don't really know if there's like a strategy here holy [ __ ] this guy does not mess around this golden goblin is everything to him i'm sorry we'll be fine maybe we'll be fine well did i figure it all out okay i might have just broken everything oh he just healed himself perfect okay he's like scared to come to the edge i think he's afraid of falling off or something he's just moving me around oh and now he's dragging me forward what if i went back here thoughts you wouldn't like glad when glad angry what emotions are you feeling now what is this please don't heal i'm begging you just take it there we go i'm glad that's over yeah [ __ ] you let's get out of here i'm giving him the goblin but he's also like hey do you got to cut that thing down by the way so i'm going to go cut it down i guess but first i'm going to kiss this frog girl yes what are you doing later timber all right let's finish this quest the longest quest of my entire life and there we go ladies and gentlemen quest complete got some fat xp from that good stuff and a farming level that is beautiful and a herb lore level oh [ __ ] yeah well ladies and gentlemen it's time to complete the final quest of the 2007 backup one last tour of nostalgia let's get after it for the final taste of our nostalgic journey i figured we'd go all out on 2007 aesthetics first things first we do this in the outfit for the ogs here if you know you know next we crank gpu off shitty graphics only this will be the first and only quest we do in fixed mode and last but not least the cherry on top [Music] that's right we're ready the final stretch of 2007 july 24th 2007 quest 128 kings ransom we're heading over to the sinclair mansion apparently there's more problems with this family we thought we figured it all out but i guess we suck and shit's been hitting the fan again we're gonna talk to gossip the guy who just sits out here gossiping about [ __ ] he lives a very exciting life anna the one we got all the evidence for is locked up i guess everyone in the mansion up and left but i guess king arthur the guy over at the big castle of camelot is missing now little suspicious we're gonna talk to the guard see what's going on so the sinclairs used to live in camelot castle but when the king moved in there they were forced to move over here so there's some speculation that the kids are acting up doing some murder [ __ ] to try and reclaim their old house the guard's trying to get some evidence but doesn't want to be caught snooping around me on the other hand i'm a loose cannon i do whatever the hell i want because i'm a lunatic who don't follow no law oh my freaking elbow it hurt found a scrap of paper over here address form oopsies accidentally docks the sinclairs even though i'm already broken into their house and know exactly where they live they found a piece of black knight armor no i'm like the highest tier of white knight now they've crossed a line meet at camel will storm sheldon sir did the servant silence came in form a real sentence i'm showing the guard all the evidence they planned on moving they have this address form didn't say where they were going next this notes ripped in half they weren't meeting with camels they were infiltrating camelot it links them right to king arthur they're also associated with the black knights there's something going on here and i don't like it looks like i'm gonna have to take things into my own hand gossip saying that anna is being kept in the jail down the street she's being so unreasonable that no lawyer wants to represent her i think we ought to talk to her pull some old interrogation tricks i'll make her talk look at her the way she's walking around hands behind back i would never do anything bad have fun spending the rest of your life in jail she's trying to prove her innocence she's asking me to go get testimonies so that i can be the lawyer i'll do it but i'm only doing it for me if i help her and prove her not guilty she's agreed to show me a secret entrance into the camelot castle and then we'll really figure out what's going on i'm gonna go get some info from the servants back at the mansion see what kind of kooky stories they can come up with oh the lock and weight i've got free [ __ ] with my name written all over it baby let's do this it's just so easy it comes natural to me oh my god 73k for doing that random event or that's why you do those it's why you do those okay so david also touched the dagger the cook suspects anna was tampering with the food mary's the one who found the dead body but saw a man at the murder scene not a woman so that helps see in court this guy saw anna looking at the dagger he will not be appearing with me this guy knows anna bought poison and did not use it for her chore so i'm not calling him up either this is not looking too good i gotta be honest the best thing to do is wing it that's how all court cases are won mostly let's lawyer up and get in there court's now in session that's right that's right prosecution is ready your honor what an [ __ ] look at this guy wearing this wig i guess i'm wearing a santa hat i'm not better all right he's presenting the evidence that i created perfect i love that for me he's presenting the thread that no one could identify doesn't mean anything and he's presenting the poison yeah well shut up i'm gonna call the mate up first she was the most convincing against the case yeah that's right she didn't see anna on the way to the murder scene could have been a man which man i don't know but it was a man and i don't look like a man i promise you that i've seen a man before yes that seems logical correct order order one guy said one thing and it wasn't like a shout or anything it was just like yeah that's that makes sense let's call the dog handler i didn't remember asking this guy about anything but he's a sketchy guy he's probably on my side so all the sinclair's bought poison any one of them could have done it that's a very good argument shut the [ __ ] up all right hobbs hobbs saw frank handle the dagger anna wasn't the only one messing around with sharp things yeah it does seem logical doesn't it the thread could be anna or david's i guess we've got a problem with that sort of evidence don't we i know i'm very good at arguing things not guilty that's what i'm talking about whoa they said balloons ready they keep balloons in the rafters just ready to go would they have also dropped the balloons if she was guilty is that just as celebratory or whoa just call me an incompetent fool all right i gotta walk around the edge of camelot towards the back and there's a secret entrance by the statue so let's head there all right here it is see what we got going on i told you the adventure would turn up he believed my every word well done sibling who the [ __ ] calls their sister's sibling well done sibling use [ __ ] alien robots all right yeah they used me do you think she would want to see him uh oh it's morgan la dum-dum the meddling adventure the only people who say meddling are scooby-doo villains you're pathetic i'm tired of this oh you're telling me ow [ __ ] hello whoa hey i found everybody look at this guy he's throwing a little ball it's a cool little animation good news king arthur's been turned into a statue i don't really know where the good news is in there but we know what happened to him at least morgan lafays behind all this clearly just learned that they stole the holy grail that i stole back i gotta get that back merlin's thinking uh if he gets out of here he can handle taking camelot back so we'll get him out of here i'll break these guys out have ourselves a good old time this is a classic check this out get up there merlin use your back or use your leg not your back alright he's out we did it yeah i've asked every single night in here if they have anything on them that can help uh and they don't so i'm going to do a little quirky trick called steal things from someone's pocket with magic whoa now we can get ourselves out of here what the hell is this here's another quirky magic trick called brute forcing [ __ ] all right brute forcing but this time better should be it yeah we're out oh the battle begins war am i right classic easy game uh hey whoa what was the stage they all just noticed i was here and they're like oh okay now go go go fight you dare invade my stronghold yeah i guess i didn't bring any arrows i'm gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way stand still for me thanks thanks for thanks for coming so one of these is the holy grail here's a riddle three boxes contain only air blah blah it's the purple one i remember this i got the holy grail and this guy just reincarnated himself yeah we're gonna go to the wizard and ardoin it's gonna make us a new animate rock scroll thing we used from one small favor and we're gonna use it for king arthur this time so as long as we have the holy grail in our inventory as well as some granite we'll be able to cast a spell on him i'll be good as new time to infiltrate the black knight fortress i decided to pull out my torah hammers since i'm probably never going to use them again and i just look cool i mean look at me here we are and here i am testing the hammers baby let's do this holy [ __ ] why haven't i used these before probably because they're not practical to use other than role-playing as a guard but if i killed this guy what's he gonna do about it [ __ ] you man i am so angry i'm just beating these people senseless at this point the skies what disguise don't need one got my hammers okay we should seriously uh get going here oh i have to put my black knight armor on okay now we can disguise ourselves all right let's find this guy there he is free king arthur didn't even show me casting the spell they're like we made so many animations for this quest we programmed a guy to bounce a ball off a wall and catch it what if we just skipped out on the whole spell thing they know what spells look like okay i gave king arthur my disguise he's gonna slip out after me and uh that's a mission successful oh man just another hard day at work just kidding eat [ __ ] all right let's get back there yeah one more time okay let's go maybe just one more okay let's
