and john's teammate david mitchell david describes himself as a warrior that means there are two warriors on john's team which i imagine they find a bit worrying uh so john this is david's first time uh playing countdown would you any tips uh yeah just you know just enjoy it you know you only get one life just season it's not about winning just as long as you enjoy the experience i think that's how can i make sure i enjoy the experience by winning and being good david are you as good at countdown as you look um i think you know that's it's hard to take that as a compliment jimmy i'm not very good at anagrams that would do anagrams help at all well i mean you're good with words but what specifically anagram's not great with words yeah yeah just not letters words i see a word is a thing i don't care what it's made of if you sort of think a letter is arbitrary a word okay it's a thing you know whatever you know floor can't think of any others and it's supposedly made up of letters but it's not made up of letters it's made up of lines some of them are curly some of them join up some of them cross each other it's just lines and then arbitrarily someone says oh no that's selection of lines that's a p and that selection of lines that's an r i don't accept that it's just it's all some lines that's why you make a word is that why your books haven't sold yeah i've had some worrying people on my team before i've never had someone come on and deconstruct the idea of a letter so are you better at the numbers or the letters i don't know can i tell you afterwards when it's become clear which i i think i'll be better at the numbers okay so maths you're good at maths yeah well i mean there's only really one number isn't there and that's one because in fact every other number is just made up of lots of ones [Applause] this is what it must be like being sat next to me clever charismatic and great fun to be around he's like a human being made from all the bits left over when they made sean lock quite a divisive thing to say about our team you know i'm trying to sort of divide and conquer here you want to conquer our team we're already hosting the show give us a chance we just want to do anagrams fair enough okay uh david is very particular about the correct use of the english language and he picks people up on the tiniest mistakes but surely david you're not that pedantics i don't pick people up on the tiniest mistakes i'm not incredibly rude so you're saying that was a tiny mistake are you no i haven't i've the very thing you wanted me to do i have not done it i've said you pick people up on tiny mistakes and you're now saying you don't pick people up on tiny mistakes which feels like you're picking me up on a tiny mistake no that's a different sort of tiny mistake isn't it the tiny mistake you were implying i picked people up on is an error in grammar or punctuation not just a factual error or a slur get out of that jimmy you win this time having a beard these days is very fashionable and a lot of credit can be given to david for doing his best to put an end to that david you've recently played shakespeare in a sitcom would you like to have lived in shakespearean times well i'm a big fan of septicemia so yes no it would be terrible because you know they had no medicine or pain relief or i mean they had lovely wooden beams that the whole place would have looked like just an absolute jewel of a b and b but with zero wi-fi no tv no antibiotics it was a hell hole frankly they were all mad they didn't just kill themselves they didn't have to kill themselves because the septicemia was waiting do you think that's why they had so many wars in that period because they just thought let's just get this over with and have a walk well yes he wants to lose yeah but she loses a place in france i've just done a crack pun on my own remark i like it okay big rugby playing city it's famous for its sausages yeah heavily spiced flavoured and bigger than any sausage you'd normally see on a plate so you wouldn't if you were someone said how many sausages you want you wouldn't have two easyjet fly there quite good it's the gateway to the pyrenees i've been there yeah if you thought you couldn't get any more boring yeah i hired a car from toulouse airport and when i got to the desk he said uh do you want to do this in french or english and i said well english and he went why not just try so you ended up on a pogo stick i thought one of the rudest things in france so it's quite often i try with my gcse french and then they answer in english and i want to go why would you let me try but i can't say that in french [Laughter] it says here you're not a fan of novelty language words like simples yeah i don't like people saying simples uh because it's from an advert and people who say simples in their real life are helping to advertise something they've not been it's paid taking literally food out of the mouths of actors actually since the referendum does that mean we have to get rid of the meerkats that's a very good point yeah i expect there'll be some sort of ritual slaughter of them let's see nigel farage will appear naked and erect and then david it says here your first crush was on madonna how are you feeling about her now it was a long time ago you know she's moved on i've moved on what do you want me to you want me to say on television that madonna is less attractive now you think that's a useful thing to do for society to say that actually the way men perceive women is that they become less attractive when they get into middle age and older i'm not proud of that but yes that's the society we're in jimmy thanks for bringing it up i'm not even i don't think that madonna's i mean she's 55 years of age she's got the body of a man half that age madonna's actually uh she's 57 i know that she's the same age as my mum and my mum's got a crush on you david how would you celebrate if you win tonight sorry david how would you celebrate when you win tonight i i don't think i will you won't say i don't think i'll see it as much of an achievement sarah is a vegan and loves animals i also love animals but they've made it illegal so i've got to keep quiet about it now i think that's been illegal your whole life i don't think there was a point in your life i don't think up to the age of 27 you were enjoying a consensual relationship with a hamster and then suddenly killjoys at westminster said david you're fairly well spoken um have you got any tips for widening our vocabulary i don't think i do no yes try there there are more than one words for some things in fact there's even a word for more than one words for some things although i can't remember what it is look it might be lot but as a teenager i was confused that there were lots of different words for sex and i thought that each of the words for sex meant something distinct you know i thought there were many more different kinds of sex things that i was going to have to get my head round before i became an adult but then i i realized that most of them refers to the same sort of basic penis penetration stuff and that's how i i came to understand the richness of the english language what do you do to break the ice with strangers david i i don't really i'm shy and difficult with strangers i leave it to them to break the ice with me and good luck then no i don't do anything i mean even this exchange i can see that yeah no you're not is this supposed to break the ice yeah i'd be more comfortable playing a word game here here you're in luck am i right you have to make the words out of the letters that appear there i know sick it's bloody sick i always assume people came up with the word and then they edited in the letters afterwards it would be a lot easier you'd think would just put giraffe whatever and then you put rfg up there afterwards it's not a spell giraffe dave you got a mascot yes i do what have you got i've got a uh a pointless mug what are you playing at well it's it's a great show isn't it pointless it's a really good show it's bigger than the countdown mug have you got mascot yes i do have a mask what have you got i've brought my mascot is a torch why have you brought a torch um it's good luck good luck in a power cut and it's good luck if you want to murder someone oh you're going to say something different there what did you think i was going to think good luck if you want to wank a torch off that's not how i work maybe for other people maybe this is the normal way to masturbate this is all about learning television no yeah that's my lucky talk david have you got a mascot i do yes um my mascot is a fondue set um brings you good luck no it's contractual i've taken frankly a frightening amount of money uh from the swiss government to be the the face of fondue they're trying to get fun you know fondue's in in terminal decline would you be eating fondue throughout the year i might give it a go i mean it's very i shouldn't probably shouldn't say this but it's very very very cheesy oppressively cheesy i mean it's like a lot of cheese in there anyway is there anything in the contract that would suggest that you maybe shouldn't say oh my god it's too cheesy i've got to speak out at some point go on get it down you ah oh so cheesy would anyone else like some yeah i'll have a bit of fun help me out there's a yeah you've got to use different forks otherwise there's germs don't worry john there's no germ on the planet that can survive that boiling machine i thought it would be sort of showbiz fondue but it's really hot real fondue look at that steam coming off that i'd love a gherkin alright help yourself it's a cornichon actually um i didn't know where they were from oh the cheese i should do his cholesterol test before david have you got a mascot i do have a mascot yes this is actually uh it cost me a lot of money on ebay um and this is some of the duchess of cambridge or um kate middleton as she then was some of her toenail clippings and there we go you see there's a little toenail clipping of a very very royal person there what do you mean uh how do you know they're genuine well i mean it cost me 25 000 pounds that's just not all that can't be ordinary ones can it that's that's definitely from her the great thing about these is as dna technology advances what i have in here is her dna code which means that in the years to come i will be able to make another one but then she will have no rights in law she'll just be my creature and now it's just the clippings in the tip david have you a mascot uh yes my mascot is this book um perry perry chicken a c.i.a conspiracy it's by keith check it's not the key it's not the keith checkman you'll be aware of it it's a labour pier um lord czechman and if you think about it perry perry chicken didn't exist at all for thousands and thousands of years and then suddenly it's everywhere why i don't know if anyone's ever had any if you have you'll know it's not because of what it tastes like no one's asking for i mean it's all right it's palatable but no one's asking for that nobody wants it can we let someone say that i'm going to say if you're going to contradict me you're part of the conspiracy right to the top you know why they're doing it but they've infiltrated our high streets with this completely unnecessary form of chicken with we don't know what is on it it's called perry perry but that is not a thing that we know the composition of it's changing our brains in various ways that we're not aware of and it could destroy civilization as we know it have you have you read a kfc i have had a kfc yes yeah that's not barry perry that's fine that's nothing to do with the cia actually colonel sanders is one of the people who funded this book have you ever had a a perry perry chicken i've had it once but i i'm reliably informed not enough for it to have had its effect so you've had it once did you have the hot perry perry or the medium the mild what do you what do you think lemon and herb all the way david have you got a mascot this evening uh yes what have you got i've got uh these wow because i thought if i brought these that it would allow other people to make sexual jokes i don't feel very comfortable making sexual jokes myself i'm a bit repressed it's finally very awkward um but i know people enjoy sexual jokes and i thought i could contribute in a way by bringing these and then it's an opportunity for other people to go oh i expect i don't know you were wearing them and being being jimmy i was i thought this would be a wonderful opportunity because you loved making sexual jokes i i do i do please say say a sexual thing don't worry jimmy i've brought my lucky anal beads david do you have a mascot uh yes i do actually i have a fascinating well a groundbreaking piece of archaeology which um you just look at this this is a very very recently unearthed bit of archaeology and as i think most people will realize it's it's a fidget spinner which is of course a very very recent item and i i think that it's important that archaeology really needs to move with the times because you know when in a field it's discovered there are you know loads and loads of sacks and coins or or roman helmets or whatever everyone's very very pleased with the archaeologists oh well done you've discovered all this ancient stuff but in fact it's shaming because they should have found it ages ago it's about time archaeology caught up and we need to be finding the things that have become buried in mud almost immediately that's the point that is when history is properly alive and moving with the times so this is i think a brilliant example of the way archaeology is going and should be going and there are other things i've got at home i've got a crack pipe discovered in a dig in soho square in 2015. well it was sort of a sweep up on a monday morning and so this is here to represent that exciting groundbreaking archaeology modern archaeology everyone wow what's your five steep steep okay this is for the points then uh david what's your say steep as in to steep bread in disgusting polyagenous cheese uh i don't think they're gonna pay you the money it feels like you've really let them down nuance as far as they're concerned i'm here the fondues next to me they pay the bill [Laughter] the word i have got is uh pantos which isn't rude just because it's got pant in it it's the plural of the shortening of the form of christmasy entertainment without i'm doing it without the i don't think you put the eu no you don't p-a-n-t-o-s [Applause] [Music] john how many six david twelve five five hundred five that's less than six what do you believe might be a correct word and john's might be made up nonsense so who knows i'm going with great as in the thing you um well either either form of great actually fine i was i was going for great expectations it's an amusing term if you're selling fire surrounds i'll tell you how many six well you sound very confident um i mean i'm confident the number of letters of the word i've written down the question is is it in the dictionary go for it i'm gonna go for it okay i'm gonna go for it because it doesn't matter at all leave no it doesn't i've just realized it doesn't matter at all i don't want a saxophone telling it's full of old crisp packets then you'll want it but what if it was buried just under the surface oh fascinating what is it bury the saxophone barry the saxophone actually means something very rude insects okay um sean what's your five diver uh david you're six um head as in possessing hair could you use that in a sentence the the redhead man walked into the room and said why the are you questioning my uh is it in there the angry redhead yeah it is it is redheaded well of course it's anything yeah it's a word okay david what's your five i'm not i'm not flirting i wouldn't have said it in that tone of voice i would have said it more sexy well give me an idea of what that would have been like okay i'll try oh is this going to be embarrassing new directed at susie oh thanks um okay i'm going to try i'm still slightly embarrassed but it will be easier um sorry jimmy i understand you
