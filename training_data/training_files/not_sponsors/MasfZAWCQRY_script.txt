grow in the last show you told me that as a boy you collect these dinosaurs attack cards yeah I explains a lot about why you've turned out the way you did what do you mean by that Brady their harrowing what a thing to expose a young boy - well I mean who's the thing I found a link for the episode last time and I put it in the show notes and I meant to have a good jolly romp down memory lane but I didn't quite get a chance to really look at them shall we go through let's go through a few and anyone who's this thing if they want to we're gonna go to this page that's put together by a helpful chap named Bob Hefner and he has scanned all the cards in an epic moment of freebooting but we'll forgive it this is a historical document I'm sure these dinosaurs attack cards are very historic look my memory of them is gruesome but awesome and that they would almost certainly never be produced today so I'm happy to take a look at some of them if you if on this one time on hello Internet do you want to take a stroll down memory lane with gray for some reason so the purpose of the story is some dude is doing some kind of time research and he wants to go back and look into why the dinosaurs became extinct but he presses some wrong button or does something wrong and my mistake brings all the dinosaurs into modern times right like sucked through time through some rip in time and suddenly I just among us and just absolute havoc for a while and then right at the end spoilers right at the end of the series of cards he figures out how to suck them back to where they came from isn't that the plot twist though isn't it that modern man and his meddling in science is the thing that caused the dinosaurs to go extinct at least in my memory the dinosaurs don't do very well when they come into the modern world and they're all torn to pieces when they get sent back so I feel like that was a great plot twist of childhood like oh we are the ones that made the dinosaurs go extinct maybe that was lost on me anyway the interesting stuff is what they get up to during their brief mm-hmm sabbatical in modern time okay like it starts off okay there's a total card and card to has this thing up in orbit this Space Station where the research is happening Wow add three sets up there's a problem card four things kick off and we get our first dinosaur in modern times ripping this bridge apart and being attacked by fighter jets these are drawings obviously by the way they're not historical photographs even though they're highly historical document or rings if their time so anyway at this point at card four I'm thinking oh this is cool fighter jets shooting missiles at a dinosaur the dinosaurs got trained in its mouth what boy would not love that yeah and look it's all quite bloodless so far that it does look like there's a person falling out of the train or something that the dinosaurs eating it's all quite bloodless and then you get to o5 homeroom horror i remember this this is like burned into my brain each card has this like really clickbait tea title as well as a card five is home ribbon around now we've got some purple dinosaur ripping into a classroom and just like it's got like some screaming woman in one hand who's at least still alive but in its mouth there were two people being completely chopped to pieces there are three people being chopped to pieces pretty you have to really look at the detail like these dinosaurs attack cars they're filled with detail and by suma bleah that woman is a teacher you'll also notice that the classroom lesson that was occurring is about dinosaurs right so this is a like a tremendous irony that the dinosaur attacks during a lesson on dinosaurs is clever very clever and of course is a child you imagine yourself as the boy who's getting away as opposed to you the teacher and your horrible classmates who suffer the fate that they obviously deserve projecting a lot into this curve if you manage to do this with every card I can see why you were so into this well do you think I am wrong greedy with my assessment that these would not be produced today it feels like a holdover from the I don't know I guess early 90s I don't know when they were made because there's a lot of blood like the whole mouth of the dinosaur is filled with blood the teacher is poking out the dinosaurs eye and my memory is a lot of the cards are really like this oh yeah that's time go to card six okay police precinct assaulted Oh God Jesus yeah I remember that one and we've got is that a stick that's a Stegosaurus and like in its mouth that's biting a policeman in half with blood coming out and at the same time with a spiky toe is literally with one of its spikes swiped out the eye of a policeman and the eye has come out of the socket fired by an explosion of blood yeah and also the detail that you can see the police officers skull underneath like I sort of wonder this must have been a dream job for the right kind of artists because look there's more detail than is really necessary if you're some company and you say we want to make a bunch of cards where dinosaurs attack this is the briefing for the artists gonna be dinosaurs they need to be attacking and run with it it feels like some guy said this is my dream job like this is the moment I've been waiting for my whole life because they're just so much more detail than needs to be and the detail is all gruesome and horrifying how big were the cards gray like were they like the normal size because there's so much detail in the pictures it must have been hard to see all the detail well I mean looking at this I remember these cards I remember the detail that you can see the dudes skull underneath his face and I mean I think they were just like baseball card size or Magic the Gathering card size like I don't know exactly but they weren't dinner plate sized so that you could really see all of the detail they they were regular trading card size I mean in card 7dc Holocaust well the White House burned right under attack from pterodactyls a woman is being absolutely savaged by this pterodactyl in the background and other guys had his head cut clean off by like the is that the leading edge of a pterodactyl wing yeah as we all know from paleontology pterodactyl wings were sharp as razor blades and could slice through anything I presume that dudes like a Secret Service dude he's got the sunglasses on he's got a machine gun in his hands and was was attempting to protect the presidential family and epically failed because of course who could go up against pterodactyls were there descriptions on the back because our friend Bob hasn't scanned the back of the cars like presumably the story of what's happening on that card was told on the back but really I can't believe this how did you not know the thing that you would like the most if you click on view card back on this webinar which shows you the reverse re stupid of course they were all out so they're listed as newspaper article Ave Dennis newspaper articles I think there were a couple of outliers like notes from people trapped in the basement or other things like that apology so this the back of the DC Holocaust card is done as the front page of the Washington Examiner and it says Washington DC and nation watched in horror as the president while boarding the helicopter and shouting to reporters on the White House lawn was savagely slain by a trio of hungry Terra Don's the first lady and two Secret Service men were also eaten alive as hundreds of concerned citizens watched on live TV what a dream story to write as a reporter will you really enjoy this writing that the first family literally been eaten on the front lawn of the White House in front of reporters I guess it's a moment that reporters can only dream of you thinking I've got page one for sure this done yeah gets eaten by a flying dinosaur even if you were say new to the Adelaide Observer you know you're gonna get page one with this story the thing though on this back is that they have a picture they show you like a teaser of what the next card is presumably to help kids who maybe can't count with numbers get the next one they have a preview of the next one you will not be surprised to know that this one as a child I thought was way over the line and I didn't like it at all socata is crushing a canine yeah and after like the epic grand scale of the first family being eaten on the White House lawn we have just a moment on a street corner where a giant dinosaur foot is literally stamping down on a cute dog while it's little gell owner looks on in horror through gaps in her fingers as she covers her and the poor dog I don't like to look at it I think this nah this is too gruesome yeah my memory is a child was I had a box of cards and things that I didn't keep this one in the stack with the other ones it's really interesting you know it's like an innocent dog oh right it's funny you can watch the first family being torn to pieces but yeah and this one is quite bloodless in the scheme of things like there's no blood it's the least physically gruesome it's the most emotionally hurtful that's why it's like I can't deal with it let's move on yeah we haven't move on to number nine nuptial nightmare where a triceratops has managed to impale both the bride and groom on two of its spikes right now that is just hilarious yeah he looks kind of confused doesn't he the Triceratops like he doesn't really know what's going on like however I ended up here what these people wearing here's the thing in these stories are not the dinosaurs the true victims they were just minding their own business when humans came along and ripped them out of their timeline and knocked them off in the middle of a wedding it's like a surprised Buffalo just appearing in the middle of a wedding like what do you think's gonna happen nothing good Brady do you really want to zoom through every one of these cards like I will do it with you though I'm not entirely sure the listeners will have the patience to go through every one of the dinosaurs attack cards let's skip through where they attack a baseball game a rock concert oh trapped in the basement that one's real drama what number is that that's number 11 oh I'm trying to skip forward and you're pulling me back to 11 yeah but look at the back of the card Brady this one I remember really striking also instead of a newspaper now we have just like some kind of flyer that's been hand written in red rays ominous it says help us we're trapped in the basement air running low monsters burrow out of the ground every night to eat us we dot dot dot and there's like a smearing as the sentence was not finished as his red magic marker trailed across the bottom of the page there I'm sure and the picture on the card itself is the moment that dinosaurs do get into the basement and just like go to town yeah notice that a heroic man in the corner is trying to save everybody by using a power saw to slice off the skin of the dinosaur so much details Brady just looking at these give you like huge deja vu to when you're a kid looking at this this is genuinely it like a bizarre deja vu moment I feel like a lot of these cards that just burned into my brain and I know you were sort of joking and they were like do you actually think this stuff is harmful for kids because I'm obviously on the side of no it's not harmful I think kids are much more resilient than adults give them credit for but I'm also kind of baffled that they ever got produced and parents were totally fine with kids buying and collecting these cards I think they're deeply affecting but I don't know that I would call them harmful like I think this affects the way you are in a lot of ways what do you mean by that I just it just forms lots of the mental pictures in your head of what things look like like obviously all these cards are dealing with forms of death aren't they quite gruesome death and I think as you grow up and you think about death and you have fears about safety and death a lot of what that kind of looks like in your head is colored by these depictions do you think you can draw a straight line from dinosaurs attack to CGP grey uploads 24 hours of death onto YouTube is that what you're saying there were no dinosaurs in that video by the way not a straight line no but a curvy lines no way this hasn't affected you and made you part of who you are I will grant that in terms of the butterfly effect of life that you know did but dinosaurs attack not exist my whole life would probably be different but that's true for anything you know that's true for Magic the Gathering cards that's true for any Sunday morning cartoons I watched that's true for every teacher in my like it's true and also meaningless I think I don't agree it's meaningless but obviously something else would have taken its place right but I mean let's jump to number 18 ok tourist trap because here we have a beautiful hello Internet moment because the Tara dogs their appetite not sated by the first family in Washington have made their way for more presidential dining and Mount Rushmore I never made that connection there's a thematic through line here they're gouging the eye out of George Washington that was a detail as a kid that bothered me because I thought like it looks cool on a card but it's nonsensical there's no reason for it to gouge out the eye that eye is just made of stone of George Washington it's not delicious to eat there's clearly a bunch of people at this tourist trap to eat instead I felt like that broke immersion a little bit in the reality of this story well I can assume that there's dinosaurs around but that they're eating stone or just vengeful against the presidents of the United States a little hard to swallow if we go to the back of the card we can see what the Rapid City Herald had to say about a headline a tourist trap mount Rushmore's nest of horror we have in South Dakota above the impassive stone faces of America's greatest presidents is a horror beyond belief early this morning a flock of taro Don's created an enormous nest made up of trees shrubs and shredded wood from nearby cabins as the giant eggs of their offspring hatched the taro Don swept out of the sky and hunted for suitable food innocent tourists from all over the world I love the idea that the whole world is under attack from dinosaurs but tourists are still going to Mount Rushmore yeah I never connected that I'm also thinking that the the lifecycle of these eggs is quite short what's the timeline here how long have dinosaurs been attacking I guess maybe they appeared out of time with the eggs already intact I don't know but I was so confusing the timeline and the urgency of everything is the final sentence of this story in the Rapid City Herald which was a plan to blow up the site was considered by Congress but ultimately rejected as an extreme response to what could be a temporary problem in the timeline of this one yeah the story's been written Congress has sat and considered what to do and made a decision and I mean it didn't quite notice these we can call them plot inconsistencies in the story I didn't notice them as a child but it also does raise the question of okay dinosaurs are attacking the world presumably there's a long list of problems and is a bunch of lizard birds on top of one of the most remote tourist attractions in the world something that Congress really has on its agenda as a thing that needs to discuss specifically considering that the presidential family has died it doesn't seem like it's gonna be top billing for what are we worried about should we destroy Mount Rushmore for this temporary problem like I'm pretty sure they're considering do we have to nuke our own cities at this point right but then this is also on the agenda 23 is an odd one for me okay 23 it's just called the perfect wave oh yeah I thought this one was dumb this is like a visual gag of a dinosaur coming out of the water and there's a dude on the surfboard on his head and he seems to be unaware that the dinosaur is there oh he's just willing to keep surfing and going with it and like there are women either side who are also surfing and they're continuing to surf one of them does look concerned hello one less so but yeah I felt like this is like in a drama where there's a misplaced joke or a joke that feels like it's from a different movie that's a little bit when this card feels like it's a bit out of place car 24 London in flames so obviously you weren't affected enough as a boy to be scared of moving to London despite the horror that is performing it here I'm still not entirely sure I go along with your thesis here that these cards had a big influence on me as a child and I feel like this is evidence exactly to the contrary surely I would not go to London having seen the horrors of this card it was worse than America you start to get this theme starting around card 30 where the humans fight back we've got a kid strikes back and a kid has like got a bazooka and seems to have be blasting a hole right through a dinosaur followed up by the amazing card 32 cat lady's revenge where yeah a cat lady uses a shotgun to blow off the eye of a dinosaur I'm coming near to eat her cats good for you cat lady defending your home territory yeah that's a very graphic although the card before 31 I think is the most graphic of all of them it's just a close-up shot of a man who has been stepped on by a dinosaur it is probably the most graphic there's also a rat suspiciously lingering in the background what's that right about to do I think we all know we know we know what you're doing there's a few in New York are under attack this must have been close to home for you as a boy yeah of course it was terrifying pretty card 35 the Statue of Liberty why would a dinosaur attack the Statue of Liberty because it makes a cool card I think that's why it's act the Statue of Liberty look 36 Comic Cons catastrophe they have the dinosaurs attack a comic-con mm-hmm like just in case you're a nerd and not worried enough like I don't know the history of this maybe some dinosaurs attack historians can dig up the details even as a child I always assumed that one of these three guys are all of these three guys in this card are the artists or the pattern worked on this good Co even as a kid this one feels like a little bit of an in-joke and it's self referential yeah and particularly the guy running towards the camera I feel like he's almost so detailed he's out of this the art style that has been established in this universe I think camera I assume that that's one of the artists again like with Magic the Gathering cards sometimes the artists like sneak themselves in as the subject of the thing that's what this always felt like as a kid like I bet that dude with the glasses drew a bunch of these pictures that's my guess what do you want next anymore 44 meltdown is pretty gruesome as well oh yeah that's like fire and someone's really cupping the hate there in the foreground and their face is coming off second best 45 must be terrifying for you Brady anchor men's peril yeah they're specifically attacking TV reporters now right and then in the last couple few the tide turns humans send the dinosaurs back in the past there's also like a devil dinosaur which seems a little bit strange but whatever let's just get past that yeah 47 supreme evil they're saying they've just lost the plot it's like what were we doing a game is a devil dinosaur doesn't seem necessary but let's keep going but card 49 is the first time we see something really graphic happening to a dinosaur besides the one that lost us our cuz you're right as they ripped back to the past they don't seem to be ripped to the past quite as cleanly as they were ripped into the prison and it seems to pull the dinosaurs apart this skin comes off their body and something about that that's not working for them yeah I think that's why I assumed as a kid that this is like the plot twist that we caused the extinction of the dinosaurs like it all comes full circle back in the end I guess the lesson here is don't meddle with science I think that's what you're supposed to come away with as the moral of dinosaurs attack so the synopsis card says the sudden yank of this time reversal literally shreds the reptilian invaders into bloodied pulp and bone despite unprecedented losses and mass destruction our civilization recovers so we end a moment of hope right humans are always resilient yeah I think the other lesson of the cards is be sure to be well-armed I imagine that part of the reason it takes place mostly in America is because Americans are the ones you have shotguns and pistols and hom bazookas with which to fight back against the dinosaurs which makes it look more awesome in the card yeah that's why in London they're just all dying on top of a spiky dinosaur they don't they have no way to defend themselves I don't know I'm still maintaining that this is a kind of innocent boyhood fun like it's not serious it doesn't matter oh great great I don't think it matters I think it like shapes who you are but not in a negative way mm-hmm maybe kind of like you say in a meaningless way everything shapes who you are but you know this is something that would stick in your head as a little boy though like this is not forgettable and you've shown that you remember these very well oh yeah I probably remember these dinosaurs attack cards in much greater detail than I remember most of my childhood and also that's not necessarily just because they're graphic because I remember all those Return of the Jedi cards hmm extremely well mm-hmm and maybe it's partly also because of the collecting and coveting nature of them oh yeah for sure I do think that that's part of it that's also why I like I've already referenced it a few times but Magic the Gathering cards are also the same thing like they're really burned into my brain some of the early ones and I think that is part of the collecting nature of it yeah and also a certain kind of repetitiveness of it that when you're collecting something you're going through the collection if you to be like ah I finally got number 37 right or you know I finally got that rare card I was looking for them you let me place it in the binder with the rest of the collection I enjoy I enjoy those codes thanks Brady and of course thanks to Bob Hefner for his very thorough freebooting of all of these cards although I don't see there's not any ads on here so perhaps this is just regular old copyright infringement but somehow I don't imagine whoever produced all these cards is really trying to track down their copyright and intellectual property ownership of them it was tops up at tops are still around nice so in all seriousness if any of the listeners out there do have any information of the story about how on earth these things came to be I would really love to know that because it just seems like such a strange thing to exist in the world can I just say I'm genuinely grateful to Bob for the website he's created archiving all the dinosaurs attack trading cards but I do feel like he's missed a trick with his URL if you're gonna create the world's number one destination for dinosaurs attack trading cards aficionados it feels like you should have an appropriate web domain so I went along to hover.com yes hover sponsor of today's episode and I had a look at what's available dinosaurs attack dot pictures dinosaurs attack gallery both good options fairly priced easy to buy in just a few clicks but then I saw it dinosaurs attack dot cards available too good to be true in fact so good that I snaffled the domain all for myself I kid you not within 10 seconds it was mine it was so easy and then in another couple of seconds I had it forwarding to Bob's great page you could do that with any domain you register as well if you haven't got a website ready yet you can just forward it off to something else so it's not completely dormant go along dinosaurs attack dot cards right now and hover will deliver you to Bob's fantastic and gruesome collection of cards now if you have a website now or maybe you're thinking of launching one in the future you should be going to hover and register the best possible names don't get scooped hovers a really great simple service it's a clean website that makes registering domains well it actually makes it a bit of a pleasure hello Internet listeners can get 10% of their first

friends you can get 10% off that first purchase hover.com /h I are thanks to them for supporting the episode I've been contacted by a lot of people who've been traveling to Adelaide I am at becoming a little bit concerned about the number of people who seem to be making Adelaide a destination now so they can go to the Marty black stop for a hot stopper why are you concerned as quite a few people who are adding it to their itinerary I mean it's a Hello Internet pilgrimage site Brady I don't understand what we would be concerning about that I mean I'm beginning to feel like a real player on the South Australian Tourism scene I enjoy that's where your mind goes whereas my mind feels like oh this is great we're at step one and a half of a cold religion here right so we're going at this from different angles but don't be surveying people at the airport why have you come to South Australia it'll be the wineries and whom hina pound the beaches hot stoppers at the body blacks Tamra anyway supplies have recently run out oh no so I was being contacted by people who in some cases had travelled thousands of miles and then found that either black stop espresso was either shut or had run out of hot Stoppers but I have sent them another restock so hopefully by now or very soon there will be more available make your way to the mighty black stamp pack well for that long pilgrimage but we make no guarantees as to availability or the trading hours of platinum espresso they are in no way officially affiliated with Hollywood today and the the randomness of if you can get them or not it's like a lesson in life that's part of the pilgrimage it's the whimsy it's the whimsy sometimes you travel literally around the world and you get nothing so speak your people who travel around the world my friend who is a airline pilot recently came to visit me we were driving around so I said to him huh I've got something for you to listen to and then I played him some sections of the podcast where we talked about your recent flying dramas you know the conspiracy the near crash all that sort of stuff he had a listen and he basically thinks the whole reason for the the plane pulling up was pretty much what we surmised it was just going a bit too fast and doing that fly around was very routine like any pilot he's just straight away well this is retained this is nothing that would never concede that something was extraordinary I'm sure he religious but he Sully land on the Hudson and says oh routine I could have done that this is the property of pilots I mean in some ways that's a very reassuring property to have that they feel like it's all routine and normal yeah that would never concede anything it's extraordinary or surprising to them but the other thing that I was interested to get his comment on was the talk about wide pilots come on and introduce themselves because he does this right he listened to us talk about this theory that it was about building rapport between the pilots and the passengers which he dismissed out of hand as we did right but he said the reason they do it is just the airlines do market research all the time and one of the things people like is when the pilot comes on and talks to them people just like it and I can see that it's part of the ritual of a flight isn't it there's you know like whoever drinks a Bloody Mary in real life no one and yet it's like one of the only drinks you can get on a plane because part of what you do on a plane but there are certain things that are part of the airline experience and I think the pilot coming on and talking to you just must be one of them oh that makes me sad that's just people ruining everything I love it when this happens yeah oh great thank you for filling that out on the feedback survey so that now I have to listen to this all the time yeah as always with Brady stories there are several things that I love about them first question your pilot friend does he have the pilot voice does he have the you know that calm hi this is flight whatever yep calm deep for a male pilot right yeah he's like very cliche pilot and like my friends and I have for years he doesn't like this but he's learned to accept it we always jokingly will call him Worf he's just like Worf in Star Trek really serious all the time like you know how wharfs like always so serious okay but he thinks he's bit of a joker and he is bit of a joker but he thinks he's mr. fun time he doesn't realize he is like the really sensible dude right okay she's good that's what you wanted a pilot he's the organised sensible dude but he doesn't think he is but that can make a person much more funny sometimes when they think they're the funny one and they're not yeah so the second thing here is I love the image of you Brady you're out with a friend you're driving and you say hey let's listen to the podcast at home and you're playing a section of your own podcast to someone else to listen to I'm wondering how often that happens it feels like I think Brady might do a lot very rare okay very very rare I'll take your word for that except maybe sometimes for my wife but even that's very rare now as well yes and my understanding is that often hasn't gone very well but he's like genuinely interested in my work and I'm really interested in his work like we'll spend hours talking about each other's work mm-hmm so he quite appreciated actually hearing an example of what the podcast sounded like because he knows it's part of my job and he's got you know he's very analytical guy so he was interested to hear what the podcast actually sounds like do you think you could be a pilot breeding yes but I think I would find it very boring hmm okay so it's not a job that would call you you can't imagine an alternate universe Brady who would be a an airplane pilot no it's too much time of hours and hours of boredom hmm you would be a good pilot because the sort of people who want to be a pilot are the sort of people who want to earn a good nice income but not work very much oh yeah that's why it was it was one of my top contenders for jobs as an adult I know I've mentioned that before on the podcast but for sure seeing my mom as a flight attendant and like the flexibility that she had with her schedule yeah and then being exposed to that world a lot has like sweet the pilot looks like the optimal solution to this like pretty decent money also don't have to work a bunch what more could a human want out of life in that whereas I'm not like that I need to work a bit more okay I should rephrase that what more could almost all humans want out of life nothing more than that that would be great then I found out it was a lot of work to become a pilot now look I'm not climbing that hill there's one more factor that I want which is not too difficult to acquire looking for in a job it's not very hard I also get paid a lot and I don't have to do it much who knew that she was coming for you oh man thank you YouTube you're the best speaking of YouTube we discussed last time YouTube's removal of annotations which I will hashtag never forget it really is it's one of the great tragedies in YouTube history but there's a little final a little final annoyance for me that was waiting with this because I mentioned I had to go back through all of my videos and try to fix everything that was going to be broken because of annotations and during that process I forgot that for a brief period of time earlier in my career I had the brilliant idea of uploading footnote videos to the main video as unlisted so every once in a while like there'd be some little thing that I felt was important to mention but I didn't want to put it in the main video so I'd make these little adjacent things I don't know why I thought this was a good idea for a little while but I did it for two videos and here we are four years later it came back to haunt me because when I was going through these annotations I realized oh no I have five footnote videos that are invisible on the channel and now that annotations are gone what do I do with them no one will ever find them you can't click on the buttons to see what they are and I didn't want the work of past me to have been for nothing alright like I want to build things the last Brady and so I didn't want those videos to go away I don't yet see the problem this seems like an easy fix to me well here's the thing I wanted to make them public but I I wanted to do it in a quiet way so I thought I had the correct solution to this which is I went into YouTube I went into all their little advanced settings and there's the box that you can uncheck which says hey hmm I'm gonna make this video public but please don't bother my subscribers with it yeah don't put it in the subscription feed don't send them an email don't do anything so I went through I unchecked all of these boxes and in the back of my mind I had a suspicion which was I don't think this is gonna work the way I think it's gonna work I think something's gonna go wrong why don't I wait until I have an actual real video to put up so that I can hopefully distract from this problem in case there is one and sure enough the day came I made those old videos public and I was trying to stage them out over time and YouTube was notifying and recommending this to all of my subscribers for like the first hour it was up it was incredibly frustrating it's like I felt like I'd been kicked twice like god damnit YouTube you took away the annotations so now I'm gonna make these old hidden videos public but please don't bother people with four year old little footnotes that aren't main things and now all of those videos have hundreds of thousands of views on them because YouTube was pushing them on my subscribers so it's like one final pain point from YouTube like god dammit this button didn't work the way I wanted it to work I thought it would be nice and silent and the other thing that kills me is those videos now show up in my timeline as though I uploaded them last week hmm I even went there's a setting in the backend of YouTube which allows you to like manually specify what they call a recording date and I thought oh maybe this is the thing I can go in here and say these videos are from four years ago they're not from now and now of course that doesn't fix it so it's like I feel like I have this scar on my channel left over from the deletion of annotations which is now five 30-second videos I don't see why you made them public what did you want me to do Brady well I would have gone to like the main video resource video the mothership the mothership and just where you used to have the annotation take people off to the footnote video put a card there so the card pops up in the top right and saying see annotation now great because you can card to an unlisted video and I would have gone high up in the description and said here are the annotations for the video and listed the links and I would have gone into the comments and said here are the annotations for this video 1 2 & 3 here are the links pinned there as the top comment that would have given three different ways for people to get to those annotations from the source video which are all prominent enough for what is already an old video right and for annotation videos that aren't that important and you would have solved the problem without the obvious other problems that were inevitably gonna happen okay you say inevitably I was trusting in YouTube's system that was my problem well what's wrong with my solution anyway you kept them hidden that way and they wouldn't have appeared on the channel and you know what part of the problem is part of the problem is I'd totally forgotten that these videos existed and the fact that they were different from all of the other footnote videos this inconsistency Brady it was a thorn in my brain as soon as I discovered them it would have bothered me until the end of time to not have made them part of the channel and I figured I only had one shot to do it where if something went wrong at least was understandable which was after the annotation delete so why didn't this bother you before it didn't bother you when you made them it didn't bother me before because I totally forgotten that past me had ever done this I didn't even remember these videos existed but why didn't it bother you when you made them like and when you made them they weren't visible on the channel this was the case when they were brand new to you and the week they came out this was the case that they couldn't be seen on the main channel that is 100% true but this was past me foolishly okay trying some idea that actually wasn't a really good idea because nobody ever clicked on those videos the click-through rates for them was very small and it felt like there's no point in doing the footnote videos at all if this few people see them which i think is why I stopped and for whatever reason past me didn't think to make them unlisted at a time when they would have fit much more in the timeline so I understand you have these alternate solutions which would have been totally reasonable but you know me Brady I cannot abide by pointless inconsistency so I wanted to have these videos be public on the channel like all the others were now I have to live with these five on my timeline out of order forever it's like YouTube is personally punishing me for hashtag never forgetting about annotation deletion I don't say why you are unwilling to have such unimportant videos being visible consistency Brady is consistency that's what I wanted and again my real problem here my real problem is that I trusted that by unchecking the button don't notify people about these videos YouTube wouldn't actually notify people about these videos and would not clog up their recommendation screen with them but so now I don't even know what the point of that button is like why is this button here presumably they didn't go to subscribers in a subscriber fate they just started turning up in recommendations because you can't turn that off that's where people started seeing it presumably they just went high into people's recommendation list because you're highly recommended I think that's true but I didn't see on some of the YouTube comments that people were saying they got notifications about it this is where you always wonder like what's going on with YouTube and there's the question of did people get notifications did they not get notifications are people confusing stuff showing up on the home screen with notifications yeah like this is one thing where I do have sympathy for YouTube because we all complain about subscription boxes and the way videos are recommended but they also have urban myths around what happens that are impossible to get rid of and one of those is when you have a channel where there's a lot of people you're always going to have people reporting some problem and then you you have to wonder about what the veracity of that is I don't know but I did see enough comments from people saying they got a notification about that new video and so I just I have some doubts about how well that system worked I think there are two things going on here what I think because just the nature of your channel you're being highly recommended prominently so you're getting a lot of clicks on recommended videos and I also think just because of the nature of the people who are super fans of you I bet a lot of them have got ways to be notified of new videos of yours existing that are like hacks and workarounds and our conventional ways of being notified and I think they're confusing that with just bog-standard dumb user subscription notifications possibly like I bet they're like RSS ways to find out when the channel you like has a new video or something that is bit of a hack and that would still let people know when anything new appeared in your list of videos that is possible I have one other really irks and complaints I'm gonna put in under here while I'm complaining about small things but under YouTube wants to be TV corner there was a thing I discovered and uploading the most recent video which I'm really annoyed at but it's another feature that YouTube has taken away and you no longer have the ability to link to a video at a specific time anywhere in the YouTube system so for example yeah let's say they're at an end card like this has come up with the podcast a couple times like when I made that video about thinking about attention like that walking vlog on my second channel I wanted as you put a card at the end of that which linked to the hello Internet episode at the particular time that that conversation took place it's like nope you can't link to a specific time in an end card and I thought okay well they made end cards they just haven't put that in but I discovered by playing around with the most recent upload there is nowhere on YouTube that will allow you to link to the video at a particular time that works for someone to click on it so you used to be able to in a playlist specify the time a video should start in the playlist nope that's been totally removed you can't do that anymore and I even found out that they've gone in and if you copy paste a URL which has the time code in it and you put that link in the description of your video when a user clicks on that link it strips out the time code and just starts you at the beginning it's in theory again it's like anything that's interesting that would allow creators to play with the internet e format of the videos has been removed and this this one is like I can't even put it in the description of a video that's infuriating so as far as I can tell the only timestamp thing that works now on YouTube is when people leave a comment on the video that says hahaha I really like the joke at 3:04 and someone can click on that and then it will jump to that section in the video but that seems to be it like if you want to link to someone's lecture on YouTube and say oh the interesting part is 20 minutes in and have a link that works that has been completely removed as far as I can tell which is extra dumb because you can send someone a link you know that they can click on an iMessage that will open the video at that time but you can't do it on YouTube anywhere as far as I can tell incredibly frustrating why do you think they've done that well here's the thing with any of these little decisions you can come up with a whole bunch of speculation about why but I just view it as this continual narrowing of possibility that everywhere creators used to have flexibility they're bringing in the gates and it feels very much to me like YouTube is optimizing for watching YouTube on an Apple TV that's like the idea like they don't want to have a TV experience be a thing where video starts at a particular time they just want to have the videos start at the beginning and play to the end and they're taking all of it in and the the thing that really kills me is by putting a link in the description with a timecode in it it means they had to go in and tell the YouTube system to manually strip out the starting timecode when you click that link like that's a positive thing they've done as opposed to everything else where they're simply removing features so you think it's optimizing for kind of a cross-platform compatibility on YouTube I think that's what it is that they basically want it to be like Netflix everywhere that you're just watching adios and the videos roll into next videos and anything that could potentially be clever or that could be nonlinear is slowly being removed which of course is extra funny because Netflix just did Bandersnatch but yeah Co interesting yet another place where our creativity is narrowed by YouTube thanks you too hey while we're whinging about media platforms oh yeah it suddenly occurs to me that I think it's outrageous that Twitter allows people to see the list of people who follow you okay wait can you clarify what what the complaint is here I'm a little confused so if you go to my Twitter profile it's like our other people who follow numberphile you click on it and there's the list of them all oh because I was reading about people who are like launching new YouTube channels and trying to promote things and they were saying oh yeah the best thing to do is go to someone on Twitter who's got lots of followers who are in your area get all of those names and tweak them old and message them all because you know they've got like a you know predilection for that area incredible invasion of privacy that's really interesting I never thought of that before if I was launching a channel about you know dinosaurs right I would go to the leading dinosaur expert on Twitter look at all the people who follow them and just try and contact all those people say you should check out my dinosaur Channel okay so I have to ask you can you when you're looking at the followers of someone else can you then filter that down to just see who the verified followers are of someone else hmm I'm kind of wondering can you not only see the list but also pick out like the high quality people who are following them I'm just kind of curious but I never really thought about that because I've never because you don't have any reason to click on who is following this person it's such an insidious thing to do you know it's such a naughty thing to do that it makes me a bit mad that people do it but I think you have a point I think you are correct that it's it's almost like a kind of free email subscriber list access for other people yeah that information should be private by default yeah I mean I've never particularly liked that Twitter does a lot of that Facebook e feeling stuff where if you look at someone's profile at least that I'm presuming they still do it it'll show you like oh the people you follow who followed this person yeah or being able to see the list of people that someone follows I think if I isn't private because Twitter is this public platform like I think it's the most interesting thing and the most useful thing about Twitter is its public nature between people and the semi connectedness of a mutual follow between people is is interesting and one of the most valuable parts of Twitter but I think it's a little uncomfortable that that you can see the social graph so clearly exposed but I never thought about it on the other end as well that just in terms of the pure follower numbers that's all visible I would love it if Twitter had some kind of semi-private mode where I don't have the count be private so it's totally locked down and basically a useless Twitter account but it would be good to be able to say like don't let people see who all my followers are and don't let people see who I'm following but if I'm following someone that person should still be able to see that I follow them if you see what I mean like still allowing that connection yeah the world is a scummy place when people are scraping and promoting to the followers of other people on Twitter that feels really gross yeah it's pull form the paper they do it now it's poor form tell you but you know it is poor form that's an excellent way to put it Brady poor form the desperate scummy world we live in hi at least there are dinosaurs attacking though this episode of Hello Internet is

from your world travels a little while ago now I can't with an awful cold that i've still got in case you hadn't noticed it see Brady I don't think you need to tell people when you have a cold on a podcast even though all podcasters seem to feel the need to do this because I bet until this moment because of very careful editing you have snuck past many of the listeners even recognizing that you have a little bit of brady cold voice why draw attention to it I think you can sneak under the radar sometimes I mean you can edit out coughs and sniffles but you can't edit out like the baseline effect that you're just very nasal I'm willing to bet a significant number of viewers did not pick up on it until now that's my bet yeah leave a comment in the reddit and Grady will let me know how that went blue it gray I was doing so well so I've been to Paris France men Moscow Russia mm-hmm recently what did you think of Paris I love Paris and I know you don't and this is a bone of contention between us okay right I just I couldn't remember if you're one of these people who are insane and love Paris and I just I just wanted to make that clear because yeah I think it's a total disgusting cesspool but anyway tell me about Paris I love it so this year has been declared the International Year of the periodic table by UNESCO is it an anniversary yes it's the hundred and fiftieth anniversary of hundred and findell Aves first publication of it huh okay I can't decide if that feels like it's a long time or it's a short time oh I'm even gonna claim a 1.7 percent ownership of this year being the International Year of the periodic table okay that's my arbitrary number okay I've credit that I'm going to take for it all right and why is that because as far as I can tell the main reason it happened was because Sir Martin Polyakov who I make my chemistry videos with all about the periodic table thought of it and suggested it to some influential people who then went on to recommend further to UNESCO and got it to happen so like the kernel of the idea came from him it seems and I have some email proof of that and I don't think he would have suggested it if he didn't make chemistry videos with me and became mr. periodic table I think that's fair I think that's fair obviously it's just an arbitrary number that you pick there but I think it is fair to say that you deserve a nonzero amount of credit for this happening yeah nonzero say I don't know maybe 1.7 is high maybe it's low you decide but anyway now that I've built myself up right allow me to tear myself down oh great because going to these events was incredibly humbling for me and I mean it in the true sense of the word humbled to hang I was properly humbled on these trips because I mean the last big trip I did that was like publicly facing hmm was think akan right right in Alabama and because it was a very self-selecting audience and everyone who'd come there had come there to see educational youtubers right like you feel like bit of a celebrity don't you gray like loads of people recognize you and want to say hello and take a picture you get this overinflated a sense of like importance like ah people Know Who I am people like what I make they associate it with me they know that numberphile is made by Brady they know that periodic videos is made by Brady they thank me for making it and you come away with this like glow right and this inflated ego is that what happens when one visits an event like that how interesting some of that of course ya know it's what things like VidCon were invented weren't they say that non-celebrities could feel like celebrities of course I agree 100% that's my experience too anyway whether you like the attention or not you certainly come away with a sense that people are familiar with Who I am and what I make yeah it's ground zero for the density of people who know and appreciate your work yes is going to be nowhere higher on Earth than at an event like thinker con exactly and don't get me wrong you know I walk the streets of London on a regular basis and not sink person knows who I am so I don't think I'm famous right but I feel like all if I go to somewhere like that people know who I am and what I do in the right circles you're an important notable person so I thought going to the launch of the International Year of the periodic table being the guy who like for the last 10 years has made the videos with Sir Martin Polyakov met the periodic table and chemistry and there was going to be full of chemistry teachers and students and people from the world of chemistry I thought oh I'm sure someone will come up to me and you know say good work maybe not maybe not maybe so so I went to this event with Martin you know there was lectures and talks there was also a big hole full of periodic displays and members of the public were coming hmm and Martin who if for people who don't know he's this chemistry professor I work with he's got this big frizzy head of hair and he's very distinctive looking and he's obviously been in hundreds of videos with me that have been watched you know a couple of hundred million times Martin was a superstar like he could not move like there crowds were forming queues were forming he must have been in a thousand photos and selfies which is funny because he's absolutely terrible at them and still doesn't know where to look so you get these weird pictures with him he was like a rock star absolute rock star right I was seriously like that guy that carries the nuclear football for the president I was nothing except the guy that had to take all the photos like oh you take because I was always standing with him can you take a picture of us I was taking all the photos and there and like Martin what an amazing thing you've created what a fantastic idea you had oh it must be so much work that you've done over the years making all these videos I'm literally standing there like I'm literally standing there haven't given my life to make these videos right spent God knows how many hours up until midnight not to take any credit away from Martin he works hard on it too he also has been responsible for a lot of the funding and his knowledge and just like charisma are the reason the videos are successful I don't forget that but gosh it was funny like the contrast to be so absolutely anonymous sometimes Martin would remember to say I'll see that guy standing there you know he made them all when people would say how did you have the idea if I'm standing next to him not to say it was his idea cuz I call him on it he'll say it was that guy there right and then they'll just look at me and go hmm I feel like I'm he's like a sister like his camera assistant that just carries his equipment and points the camera at what he tells me to point the camera it was such a contrast it brought me so back down to earth that's brutal in my head the mental picture you're painting is that you're a camera donkey like you're there to be holding the things I think they think I'm one of his chemistry story who can operate a camera the best thing was I had a whole day of it it's fine you know it's life it's a good life lesson for a and then at the end of the day I checked my email and I had this email which just like was like the cherry on top of the cake said dear Brady I have greatly enjoyed watching a number of your videos over the last couple of years they are highly entertaining this year I'll be running and it's this science festival those persons running I'll be running the Science Festival bearing in mind he's just called me highly entertaining right we are looking for entertaining and informative speakers to come and do some kind of show to hokum presentation in our local Town Hall and I'm thinking oh here we go this is where you know you even have experience with this kind of thing yeah so this year's dates are blank blank blank Saturday would probably be the main day for events embracing myself I've already approached professor Polyakov but alas it looks like he will not be available in September fair enough he's a busy man right now I'm feeling a bit like second-place child all right let's hear what you got to say next sentence I wondered if you might be able to suggest some other scientists who might fit the bill any help or advice you could provide would be greatly appreciated Oh best regards rule it's extra brutal because of the cycle setup that you feel like you're going to be number two like oh and then no you're not even number two even that I don't want to be immodest on your behalf Brady but this story is also extra funny to me knowing that whatever event this is if you were to but tweet that you were going through this thing they would have a packed house I have to say that like I am genuinely surprised that you were the camera mule at this event do you think it was just that the attendees were say out of the demographic of periodic table viewers or like I'm just curious if you have a theory as to why yeah maybe they were probably only light viewers forest and they weren't like super fans and I guess on periodic videos I'm a lot more anonymous I guess my face doesn't appear on screen but surely people know someone's filming this I think and here you ask questions do they think about that maybe they just think it's just you know like it's just this court of people around Sir Martin who does as the great night in struts and I just it was my day on the camera that day maybe like I said it was humbling and it's good to be humbled right especially after the high of Huntsville I did do a hot drop with Sam and while I was in Paris which is now we've dubbed a less shoulder plank or what I had a bit of a help from some french-speaking friend as that's the ideal name for a hot drop shell I think means hot and planked means stash the word drop was inappropriate I was told so I was taught to go with Loschiavo plank so we did a shout a blank at the Eiffel Tower and a hotel called the Tim Hotel the shelter plank it's kind of fun to say shout a plank I mean I dunno it's an infusion isn't perfect I tell you what I like about Paris though I want to put this on a list a nudist owner create and there is a list of things that are so much like the movies that they don't seem real and that is the sound of French ambulance sirens like they have this sort of comical sound about them French ambulances and like even at their agency services that aren't like any other you know the countries I'm used to being in like England and the US and Australia and it always reminds me of being in a movie when a French ambulance goes past I feel like I think I can hear it in my head but I'm not 100% sure like American police cars those big black and white ones so I write American money although I've gotten used to American money now but the first time that you ever have to do with American money you feel like you're in a movie yellow taxis right yeah I mean again I put the entirety of the city of New York in this category that's where I always have the feeling the strongest yeah lots of things in London - all the London stuff the magic has completely worn off for me I don't have that the movie feeling but New York always has that really strongly especially if say you're walking by the ghostbusters fire station it's like oh that always really froze me every like I happen to have anything to be around that area a bunch and every time I walk past the ghostbusters fire station it's like wait did I fall through a wormhole into movie land's like do I have a ticket to the last action hero here it's it's always very disorienting so after Paris came Moscow and I did go to Russia now a year or two ago but this time I got to spend more time in Moscow which was good but I did have some like Russia problems this time now okay and this was being like a media person a camera person in a country where this you know different attitudes to that do you mean like scary Russia problems well not scary just more unfriendly towards the idea of media hmm it first exposed itself as we were being driven to a place where we were just gonna go and have some meetings and we were thinking maybe we'll do some videoing there right and on the way one of the mind has said are they don't want Brady to film anything they've been googling and they found his name associated with a bunch of BBC stuff because obviously I worked for the BBC for seven years right they'd been googling me they thought I was like I don't know they did they think I was like an undercover BBC thing but suddenly I wasn't Martin's camera donkey anymore I was like a BBC journalist no not but not only a BBC journalist maybe a spy now or who knows so it was like ah this is gonna be a problem it turns out we were going I didn't want to film there anyway because it was dull as dishwater it was like mmm just gonna be a problem that felt very high school there Brady I didn't want to film your thing anyway it was funny because a lot of these things that we were going to kind of with things Martin wanted me to feel Ray and it's quite after Martin wants me to film things that he thinks are interesting and I have to tell him this isn't interesting we shouldn't be doing a video about this and this was like my get out of jail card we went to this place and Martin was like trying to explain to them I didn't work for the BBC that's fine no check my Camry and that's not create a scene that's great so you can play it like you're not disagreeing with him about the interestingness of this boring thing and it's just ah the Russians won't let me film here otherwise this would be great hello internet and go watch some interesting documentaries the next event we went to was the big launch event in Moscow for the periodic table year because they had the event in Paris and they had like a mirror event in Moscow because the Russians are very involved in the celebration and the event for obvious reasons because I meant a librarian stuff so it was being held in this big lovely building they had this great big auditorium and in a venue and we got there early so we were going through this side entrance that we were told to go through because the public entrance wasn't open yet there was a side entrance for people involved in organizing the event and stands and things like that and Martin was like the guest of honor he was one of the big big speakers so he was a big deal hmm and the problem was the Prime Minister of Russia was also doing a talk at this event mm-hmm which suddenly made it like a big deal security was jacked up to the max and things like that everything was high alert because the Prime Minister was coming all the car parks were closed and there was metal detectors and stuff like that and we went to this side entrance and an name wasn't on the list that they had at the side entrance because we weren't one of the exhibitors I don't know where our name was but Martin's name wasn't there yet alone mind mm-hmm so like they put us to one side which was really funny because we also had all these minders and important people with us who were like incredibly embarrassed because Sir Martin couldn't come in and he had to like sit in this chair and wait while the people with earpieces and that were I figure out who was what and where this list is and who this person was I was fine with that I was just like I thought it was funny but it got even funnier because the next person that tried to come in the door was URI or Ganesha who is the guy who just had an element on the periodic table named after him right he was the other soup of VIP guests you know element in 118 has been named after this man he's the only man alive with an element named after him oh wow and so he turns up at the door and says his name and there again they're like your name's not on the list at which point I leaned over and said to man his name's on the periodic table is that not enough he could just point a periodic table does he see that there that's made this is all about me because he's an old Russian guy he just said bugger this and just walked in that's also really good but I like the idea of carrying around a periodic table as ID yeah it's my business cat recognize this yeah that's me so anyway we got in but then the writing was on the wall now I was like okay this is an interesting environment a couple of times while I was in there people came up to me and said do you work for the media there's like no no I'm here with the professor I make these YouTube videos okay and then about 10 20 minutes before the big event started I went into like the main auditorium where Martin was going to do his speech and I was gonna film the event and stuff and I hovered close to this back door because I figured I'll shoot it from the back you know I want to be out of the way my cameras got a good zone mm-hmm and this burly security guy says who you do you work for the media and he didn't speak very good English and I said no no I don't work for the media I'm with the professor YouTube I'm an invited guest you know I was like a proper guest I I was sent invitations formal invitations to get my visa and everything I was like properly VIP he says come with me and makes me leave like the auditorium and then all of a sudden I find myself off to the side in this room that I didn't even know existed there is just full of journalists mm-hmm like there must have been 50 Russian journalists there and they were pinned in this room outside the main auditorium where they weren't allowed to go and they were watching everything that was going inside via screens and they were being like I don't know who that would be monitored and you know herded into this one place where they could watch when the Prime Minister came in and watch it on TV but not be in the room huh and there were all these minders and they all suddenly all came up to me trying to figure out who I was this guy with a camera and I was like no no I'm not I'm not a journalist I'm not from the media I'm here making this video for the event I'm a guest of the event you know and I couldn't get this across to them right Russia is a place where if you're not being shown the respect you think you deserve you kind of have to play it right yeah I mean this may be the first time I've ever heard you downplay the journalism part of your life usually like top card to come out BAM journalists face Lee independent I'm fiercely independent now I was just a lackey of say map filming chemistry I've never heard you downplay journalism ever before but this feels like the correct situation in which to do journalist I've never even heard the word what do you just don't don't Google me and maybe say so anyway I said look I need to go and get someone who speaks Russian to talk to you guys he is my camera I'll leave my camera here with you I went quickly back in and got like our mind and I also got answer Martin came now and they came out and this big discussion ensued and it was a big flurry and these people don't know they weren't having it but I wasn't having it either and they said he has to wait in here until after the prime minister goes and I said look if I'm not allowed to film the Prime Minister that's fine you know you guys make the rules but I'm not flying all the way to Moscow to come to this event about the launch of the periodic table at your invitation and then being locked out of the room hmm so I said here keep my camera I won't film it it's fine the rules of the rules but I'm going back in to watch because that's why I'm here and you tell me when I can have my camera back and when I can I'll start filming again I trust you with my camera there you go mm-hmm in the end I think they realized I wasn't going to stay in this pen with all the journalists right so I went back in and left my camera behind and then like five minutes later the woman who'd taken my camera comes back into the room where I'm just sitting in the auditorium now with my camera and says here here's your camera back we've decided you can have her after all that but then five minutes after that a message comes back but don't use your camera until after the play mr. Scott I was like in the end buddy went the Prime Minister was there he was there for five minutes and then left's right away well he was there there wasn't a single person in the auditorium who wasn't filming on their phone they were like thousands of people there everyone go person was holding up their phone the entirety of his speech my camera was sitting down by my fate I'll share a few other random thoughts I had about Moscow though because this time I went and saw Moscow properly last time I didn't actually go to Moscow properly this time I was based there so I went and walked around this and saw a lot more of it right and my thoughts are it certainly would didn't feel controlled like you know you were talking about this was a place where you could just you know just go anywhere it was just like a big city full of tourists and you know I went and had a McDonald's where I was sitting at a table looking at the Kremlin like literally right next to the Kremlin so it was like you know that feels like an American victory to be fair there is an obsession there with burgers and like American diners like everywhere you go there is like American style diners and burgers and hot dogs like there's like a crazy overcompensation towards American food since it came in obviously because there was almost no where you could eat that wasn't very Americanized I mean to be fair American diners are awesome it came in handy it actually came in handy when I did my one hot drop in Moscow as well because I was nervous about doing a hot drop mm-hmm you know furtively mysterious device right so the only place I did do a hot drop in Moscow was in a shake check I left a couple in a pot plant at the Moscow Shake Shack say it doesn't quite know Hill as on brand with the place that you're visiting as your friend no drop but you know you got to do what you can I was playing it safe I can understand that you wouldn't want to be hiding something outside the Kremlin oh here's a fun hot drop for people I tell you what the discussion I had in Paris with the Tim hotel explaining why I wanted to leave hot stoppers in their reception was quite funny but coming back to Moscow the city like exceeded my expectations for how much I liked and how grand and interesting it was except for a red square which was a bit of a disappointment but maybe that's because that's the one place I thought would be awesome but everywhere else I was really impressed by all the buildings and the scale of everything the subway is amazing mm-hmm I'm aware I think it was built a lot by prisoners so maybe that's you know there are sensitivities involved but the subways are very grand they're like banquet homes they have these amazing ceilings and chandeliers and it's like the subways are worth going into we went to the subway with a local and he just took us to four or five of his favorite stops just to see how awesome they were yeah we'd get out and look at them and think wow this is amazing and then we jump back on the tray to another one he wanted to show us Moscow subway ridiculous those things do look amazing and the one thing that also is really striking about them is there's no advertising yes they're beautiful things I've seen this from a few countries around the world where they do like the one thing that's kind of interesting is you don't have this commercial influence in all of these places and it creates it is just totally a different space and yeah I can't remember if it was Helsinki or another country where I went to where they did the same thing like the underground stations were just like beautiful cathedrals yeah I don't know if I'm over playing it because as someone who's used to and grumbles about all the advertising on the London Underground which is everywhere and awful I don't know if it's the change that makes it seem so much more striking but I can't help but feel that is a better environment for people to be when they're commuting is to just just be in a place that was architected to be beautiful rather than just a hole in the ground that is filled with advertisements trying to sell you stuff on your way to and from work I feel like it must have a positive mental impact to have these kinds of spaces as part of your day and it's great for a government to be able to say like no no no this is not a commercial space this is a space for the people passing through it another thing that was new information to me and I feel stupid mmm-hmm but maybe I should have known this already but one of the big things we did in association with the periodic table launch was we went and filmed with a company in Russia that's a huge diamond mining company and they gave us access to basically all their awesome diamonds which was brilliant you know it was so interesting for these videos we made hmm and one of the things we did was they showed us all their uncut diamonds how they come out of the ground and in my head diamonds out of the ground were always like quite boring lumps and then you know the cutters and the polishes would go to town and turn them into these objects of beauty mm-hmm I didn't realize that not all but most lots of diamonds come out of the ground as these quite beautiful octahedrons really like diamonds come out of the ground beautiful oh wow I'm googling raw uncut diamonds yeah in my head it was yeah like they're in coal that people have to carve away and and turn into the beautiful thing I mean they are in Kimberley yeah but they have they have a shape like they're much more diamond shaped than I ever would have guessed yeah when you get them out of the rock when you get them out of the kimberlite no but loads of them have this beautiful geometric shape that was really surprising the reason they were cold diamonds but it comes from you know I think I'm some ancient Greek for like sort of unbreakable uh-huh and the reason a diamond shape is called a diamond is because of the natural shape of these bits of carbon that came out of the ground that were called unbreakable huh so the shape diamond is cold that shape because of unbreakable diamond comes out of the ground with a shape roughly that way to set you another picture I took of some just you know another handful of diamonds that is really striking yeah you know before you sent me your photos I was just googling the raw images and it's beautiful enough that I'm seeing some places that just use raw uncut diamonds as part of the jewelry like they just mount it as is and is really quite a striking look the video yep shortly I'll send it to you great like some of the Diamonds they showed us you occasionally like clouds you can sometimes get cloud that looks like a dog and stuff you don't get diamonds that look like weird things like skulls or mmm soccer balls and things like that so they showed us a few and you do get lumpy diamonds that are just shapeless lumps that they then you know cut into shape like you do get the whole gamut but like the default is usually the octahedron or sometimes you get ones that are like quite perfect cubes as well I mean you know when you think about it it makes sense because they're crystals and they're forming as crystals but I didn't realize that crystal structure manifest itself so much on the Matt Chris go yeah no I never thought about it but this is interesting this is very interesting today I learn facts I'm looking forward to seeing your video on it huh no I was deciding what to call the video I've never had a video that I've had so much trouble thinking of a title I mean I was one of my favorite scenes we're doing a couple but one of my favorite scenes in the video about the uncut diamonds is they bring out like a million dollars worth of uncut diamonds and Martin just like sticks his hands in like washes his hands and all these thousands of diamonds so there's this image of like washing hands in diamonds I'm thinking do I somehow title around that and I was talking to my wife last night saying what am I gonna call this video I haven't got a title on you can't call you know washing your hands in diamonds cuz that's stupid and too long and stuff she says well what's the video about what's the main thing and I said well the main thing about this video is uncut diamonds because the next video we're doing is gonna be about how they cut and polish them and you know make them look amazing she said diamonds uncut and I feel stupid for not thinking of that I've been thinking for weeks about what do I call a video about uncut diamonds and I never thought to call it diamonds uncut diamonds uncut is good but it feels like it could be clickbait earr washing your hands with diamonds i think it that's clickbait to your brady i I don't like being to clickbait E&B isn't that too many words and too clumsy a phrase for a youtube title I think it's on the outer edge but I think that could work I mean look diamonds uncut that's the classy title it's cool yeah it's got a coolness about it classy title but does YouTube reward classiness or does YouTube reward clickbait and then a an outrageous thumbnail with someone making a like a shocked face at all the diamonds and then an arrow pointing to their hands being washed in diamonds that's what YouTube wants I don't know I I feel like in the last year mm-hmm I don't know whether it's like a you know YouTube suicide pact or something but I feel like I've really moved on to a point where I'm happy to not chase what YouTube rewards like I've been guilty of chasing the clicks from time to time I also think overall I've probably been had a fair bit of integrity on YouTube but I feel more and more pulled towards the integrity side of her it turns into more and more of a cesspit I feel like okay you know maybe it means the start of the end but I'd rather go down with the ship and a bit of dignity than this eternal battle with arrows and the shocked faces and bright colors and I'm glad you feel that way Brady because there is an arms race coming soon to YouTube over this stuff so I'm glad that you are content with your classy titles we are gonna have to make decisions along these lines aren't we yeah no we totally are how low do I go you know cuz if I could own tois CH I will go out of business and then everything stops I mean this is an age-old debate isn't it it just feels it like it's becoming more and more of a something in our face if I end up calling this video washing your hands and diamonds people will know that I totally sold out now I will use that imagery and the idea in like social media but I just don't know if I'm willing to have as the title of the video well the listeners will now know whether Brady cracked or not link in
