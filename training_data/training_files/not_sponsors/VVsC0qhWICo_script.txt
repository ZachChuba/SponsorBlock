hello this is chef john from
foodwishes.com with taco stuff zucchini bows
that's right zucchini is not very exciting or interesting or fun to eat
which is basically the opposite of a taco so what we're going to do here is
use the same beef filling used to make tacos
and we're going to use that to stuff some zucchini to turn something that's
generally unremarkable into something i thought was incredibly
remarkable right this is not some kind of low-carb substitute gimmick
as these really were amazing so with that let's go ahead and get started
by adding some diced onion to a skillet which has a little bit of olive oil in
it and then to that we will add one pound
of ground beef and we'll set that over high heat
and we will cook that stirring until our onions soften up and turn translucents
and our ground beef has been broken up into nice small pieces
and by the way if you happen to be wondering why my pants are blurry well
that's because i stain my pants and shirt with olive oil as i set up this
recipe which on camera i found unsightly and
distracting so i actually spent about a half hour learning how to blur out part
of a video which i have to say was surprisingly
exciting and it might come in very handy in the future
if i ever forget to put on pants but anyway back to the beef
which like i said we're going to cook stirring over high heat until it's
nicely crumbled and our onions have turned translucent
and once that happens what we'll do is toss in some minced garlic
as well as one finely diced jalapeno or any other kind of fresh pepper
or no pepper but i had one lying around so i tossed it in
and what we'll do is cook that stirring for about two minutes or so
before we add in all our secret spices and herb
and for me that's going to start with some kosher salt a nice spoon of chili
powder some paprika some cayenne pepper of
course some ground cumin a little bit of dry
oregano and then one possibly surprising
ingredient a couple teaspoons of cornmeal
which is just gonna help tighten up that final texture a little bit
and what we'll do is stir all that together and cook it for about a minute
oh and if you happen to forget adding your freshly ground black pepper
don't worry just stop and add it here and that's it once we've cooked in our
seasonings for about a minute or so we can go ahead and stir in our tomato
sauce and technically if we wanted to we could
just cook this for a couple more minutes and we'd be done
and we could use it as is or what i'm recommending if we have a few extra
minutes and that would be to rinse out whatever
we had our tomato sauce in with about a half a cup of water
and we'll go ahead and stir that in and then what we'll do once this starts
boiling again is turn our heat down to medium and just
let this simmer for about five or ten minutes
stirring occasionally until most of that liquid is simmered out
and our mixture gets as thick and dry as we want which for me looked a little
something like this so yes we are adding a little bit of
time to the recipe with this step but i do think we're going to end up
with a little bit of a nicer texture plus it will give all our ingredients a
little extra time to mingle together and that's it we'll go ahead and taste
that for seasoning and if we're happy with it which i was
we'll simply turn that off and let that sit and cool while we move on to prep
our zucchini and for that we'll be using a classic
four step method oh yeah the old trim half scoop and salt
which means we'll trim a little bit off that stem end if needed
before cutting these exactly in half lengthwise and please take your time
right this is not a game of speed and we really do want these pieces as uniform
as possible so that they cook evenly and then what we'll do once the trimming
and halving is done is take a small spoon or a melon baller
and we will scoop out roughly half the insides to create that classic zucchini
boat shape and while a spoon will work a melon
baller has a much sharper edge which i think is going to work better
for this plus you usually get two size scoops
so we can start it with the bigger one and then do some fine tuning with the
smaller one and by the way a lot of recipes say to
save those scraps you're trimming and then chop it up and add it to your
filling but i'm not gonna do that because the last time i had a ground
beef taco that had zucchini scraps chopped up in it
was never so i will not be using that and we'll just go ahead and throw that
into compost and then what we'll do once all our zucchini halves have been
prepped let's go ahead and salt them fairly
generously with kosher salt making sure we get that all over all
right powder stern starboard and port side and what we'll
do here is let these sit for about 15 or 20 minutes
and during that time as you'll see that salt's going to draw out a lot of
moisture which we can then blot away with a paper
towel and not only does this stuff season and make the zucchini more
delicious as in a lot more delicious but because
we're drawing out liquid it also improves the texture so it might
seem like kind of a minor step but it's actually kind of a big deal and
makes a huge difference and that's it once our boats have been
salted and that excess moisture soaked up
we'll go ahead and fill those up with as much taco meat as we can fit
at which point we'll transfer those onto a lined baking sheet
oh by the way i'm doing the all meat version here but if you wanted to
stretch your beef you could if you want toss in some corn
or maybe some beans or both i mean you are after all the dan
coats of your taco stuffed zucchini boats and
speaking of national intelligence it is a really smart idea to line your
baking sheet with one of these silicone baking mats
because what we're going to do next once these are filled is top them with cheese
a lot of cheese or a pepper jack in my case
and what's going to happen because we're using so much some of it's going to melt
and drip down onto the pan and as he's baked that's going to get
all beautifully crispy and caramelized and if you use a sill pad like i'm doing
here it'll be very easy to peel that off the pan
and we can serve that right alongside as an extra little treat
but no matter what you're using to line your pan once our zucchini boats have
been cheesed they are ready to transfer into the
center of a 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes or so or until our
cheese is beautifully browned and our zucchini is just barely tender
and how we'll know is we're going to poke it with things
are things like forks or toothpicks or skewers or the tip of a knife
and while we don't want soft and mushy and collapsed i really do think we want
these fully tender and of course that's just my preference
right just like real tacos you could do soft shell or crunchy shell
so if you want to cook these less go ahead
in any event once those are done we'll go ahead and serve them up
with as i mentioned a few pieces of that crispy caramelized cheese
oh yeah i would take a whole plate of that hey are you thinking what i'm
thinking and then personally i like to finish
this up by garnishing with some diced tomato
some freshly sliced green onions a drizzle of sour cream
and then last but not least some torn cilantro oh yeah you heard me torn
i think i'm done chopping cilantro it never looks that good
speaking of which i saw cilantro stem which i went to pull off
and it somehow grabbed and pulled off that piece of green onion which you
could not do if you tried so that was weird but anyway the point
is you go ahead and garnish this with whatever taco fixings you want
and that's it our taco stuffed zucchini boats are ready to enjoy
so i grabbed a fork and knife and asked the captain for permission to come
aboard and i slice myself off a nice piece come
on you can do it whoops oh yeah there we go whoops
okay third time's a charm and that my friends once i eventually got it into my
mouth was a shockingly delicious bite of food
just absolutely incredible so i went ahead and cut an even bigger
piece only this time i used the fork with the tines going in the right
direction and everything worked out much much
better and as i rotate this plate around so you can get a little better look
you can see what i think is the perfect proportion between our taco meat filling
and our perfectly cooked zucchini boat and while i'm not saying zucchini should
replace tortillas in your regular taco routine
what i am saying is they could since at no time while i was eating this
was i thinking this is good but i wish i had a regular taco shell
okay it never crossed my mind so i really was thrilled with how this came
out but anyway that's it what we're calling
taco stuff zucchini boats whether you're one of these people that
has to trick their family in eating vegetables
or you're just looking for a way to make eating zucchini a little more fun and
exciting either way i really do hope you give
