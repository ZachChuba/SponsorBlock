(This video contains indirect ads) (Bbom Bbom Bbom) Hello, I'm Bbomi I'm used to appearing without makeup I feel awkward when wearing makeup But you're going to see me 
wearing makeup today I'll be having a beauty 
photoshoot after a long time For the August issue of 'Cosmopolitan' In collaboration with makeup brand 'Urban Decay' I haven't got my makeup yet With these many staff members... As soon as I arrived here, I found the presents from Urban Decay They gave the presents not only for me, but also for the members I'll get my makeup done nicely 
with these products Okay, I'll be turning into 
'Bbomi with makeup' In accordance with today's concept, I got my nails done with light purple I just wanted to you show off Because I hadn't got my nails done
since the last promotion Really? Yes (Bbomi is turning into 
celebrity Yoon Bomi) Wow I applied purple eyeshadow, which
is Nam-joo's favourite I'm really looking forward to
today's makeup (She's got her hair and makeup done) All right, everyone The first makeup concept is finished How do I look? It feels awkward I'll go and take some photos Go, Bomi! (Bbom Bbom Bbom) (Chuckles) This is the second concept I never thought I'd have this 
hair style again since my debut (Feeling awkward) 28 year-old girl with twintails Oh I think I look 5 years younger (Haha) The highlight of the concept is
these scrunchies It's fun to have a photo shoot 
after a long time Okay, the second concept Let's go The photo shoot with 
the second concept is over The last one Everyone, only the last one is left Let's go I'll be back with the third concept Are you tired already?
Hopefully not I'll be right back The last concept These hair pins are 
the highlight of my hair style I'm prepared with 
hair, makeup and outfit Because of the lights, I might sweat Here's a little tip for you This is a makeup fixer I use this product very often You know, idol singers sweat a lot while performing One of the most useful items 
for a singer like me is not a waterproof product It's a makeup fixer When I spray the fixer after makeup, the makeup doesn't slide off my face Many professional makeup artists recommend this product Actually, many idol singers use this 'All Night Makeup Setting Spray' I'll apply it one more time before I go Now, let it dry It really keeps your 
makeup looking fresh I strongly recommend All right, then I'll have 
some watermelon I'll do my best till the end It's purple (Color matched) (Her outfit has changed) All right, everyone I've finished the photo shoot
for the August issue of Cosmopolitan Clap, clap (Happy!) I had a great time today thanks to the helpful staff I'm very satisfied with the photos It was fun Hope you like my cute looks Did I act too cute? Mmm... Hope you're encouraged (Hehe) by looking at my photos All right, my fans Then I'm off now
