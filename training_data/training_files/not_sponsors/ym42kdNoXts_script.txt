description it is free to enter roof campus since the beginning of rust they've been one of the most hated breeds of people to grace the game they sit in their ivory towers with their scope for rivals and rent death from a safe place perhaps that's why they despise so much because of their cowardice even if you manage to kill them before they kill you they're looters safe and all they need to do is walk back upstairs loot themselves and continue to shoot you now for me and my team as seasoned rust veterans like many of you who are watching no not to get caught out in the open and the sights of a live camera but sometimes an opportunity presents itself with a reward outweighs the risk but to get to this point we must first go back in time and get established Pookie and I have just started and we managed to find a chopper we were flying to where we wanted to build but where we wanted to build was currently a warzone Santara it must be empty or off oh yeah yep naked there's massive compounds the idea what do we build like where this clad built oh yeah like we're right here at this field yeah this has been asked yeah I've got about a full inventory where are you guys okay we are in export race yeah just gonna chainsaw you ready come over quick [Music] yes get him Jim Oh Sammy stop heaps of wood hey Joanne setting key edit jack and who should get a chopper guy yeah rocket ray right next to us let's go did you get any action why right no should we kill that wolf no let's just go I don't like it up here let's too much of rockets and [ __ ] going off baby yeah it looks pretty flat all right we got to build a two-by-two to begin with you the classic 2x2 had been placed a staple for any starter but the tools we had found the grind could now begin for beer and better things [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] being so tall Oh what oh my god Maui I forgot how to disarm I couldn't she just kept pulling out weapons over and over again [Music] you got the stuff yep I got the goods you got the money man if anyone else didn't get from me wait I'm hostile Oh your dad what did i do I ever killed anybody Nellie and perky fallen victims [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the grind was complete the basin at Stone forum was set we were just adding some final touches to it and running some loot across from our starter and that's when it began I didn't even hear the pace up the hill had become active and was now shooting at us from its group as we ran between phases this action would set the gears in motion for either a demise or theirs oh yeah real quick or a garage door to gargoyles because they can get in oh wow yeah they're really thinking on us let's got shot at all right [ __ ] this there's new wood he'll eat account here in a second come the morning the people from the tower had now turned their attentions on the heli which now made us turn our attentions to them our room would have to wait so you're five five six there's nothing here once countdown the turned a pretty good spot for them to view it [ __ ] we should just gonna keep that door real quick gonna be able to do dick oh yes the roof campers demeyers the bottom of that base if their tower is not properly equipped with shoot down spots then there's no way they can go out and get the loot from their fallen enemies and this base did not have that we had them trapped oh yeah I just got hit hard I got hit bed from 230 meters with the m249 he's up in this place I hear it he's not even in the base unless he is in the base he's not in the base it was gonna be we stuck on that schrodinger motif yeah like the solid site could be like [ __ ] throwing me off but it might be a sod now he's up there he's up there I say it it's sticking through the window I'm waiting for these pricks to come outside I've got the [ __ ] door watched he retired in that to have an active base right next door to you guys at the chopper and can like hold a bit without being seen okay just as long as you can see it right edge on him you dropped in xx I'd like to you to take for me oh yeah alright I'm stuck in there this possibility might kill themselves one arm in the base behind us I got some stuff like

window its tangled killed another south I need an extraction did he not see me run I love how he bitched about getting camp but he was worthiness critical we now had four c4 and six rockets at the time we didn't have a rocket launcher but we decided to take those four c4 from whence they came and march back up the hill but first we had to say a prayer for a successful raid what is nearly done
