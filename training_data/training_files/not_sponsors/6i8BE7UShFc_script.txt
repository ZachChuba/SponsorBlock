this video is sponsored by Squarespace Apple's expected to announce the iPhone 11 this week so here's 103 facts you might not know about the iPhone Steve Jobs and not set out to make an iPhone he wanted to make a tablet dad dad didn't want me but when he saw how cool the interface was he thought it would make a killer phone of course he did I do that all along the first iPhone was released on June 29th 2007 the same day The Globe Theater burned down in London well I mean 400 years after that the iPhone was announced several months earlier at the Macworld conference in January of that same year unfortunately the Macworld Expo is dead I pour out of 40 for you every January buddy at the time the iPod was a runaway hit it was a huge success and it played a big role in Apple's come back from near bankruptcy in the 90s the iPhone would end up killing the poor little iPod there's a lot of skepticism about the iPhone when it was first launched no 3G no expandable memory no removable battery no exchange or office support of course a lot of those concerns seemed silly now but the speed and connectivity was not for that first iPhone it was horrible connections where slow calls were dropped and a greatly taxed AT&T x' network when i just switched to Verizon well in the early years the iPhone was only available on AT&T Verizon had the chance to be the carrier of choice but turned Apple down they wanted more control over the hardware the tablet project that kicked off the iPhones developments started because Steve hated a manager at Microsoft this manager was always bragging about how Microsoft was going to own tablet computing Apple had been thinking about phones they worked with Motorola and made the rocker jobs hated it Steve Jobs hated a lot of things you know who Jobs didn't hate Johnny I've apples lead product designer who led the iPhone design team Johnny I've not to be confused with Johnny hive who died several years earlier in an unfortunate accident the first iPhone model was available with a four gigabyte hard drive in its lowest configuration but that didn't last long the four gigabyte model was discontinued two months later on September 5th 2007 and at that time the 8 gigabyte model had its price cut by a third from 599 dollars u.s. to $399 u.s. which means the 8 gigabyte model was now $100 less than what the 4 gigabyte model had been just a few weeks early and people were mad ended up giving early buyers $100.00 Apple gift store credit to say sorry Apple went on to sell 4 million iPhones in 2007 today Apple sells that many iPhones every five days that's around eight hundred and forty nine thousand four hundred and fifty iPhones a day give or take in 2018 alone Apple shipped two hundred and seventeen point seven two million iPhones worldwide the iPhone was originally intended to have a plastic screen like many other smartphones of its time Steve Jobs complained after the demo unit developed scratches after being in his pocket for a day he demanded that the screen needed to be made out of glass the glass that existed at the time shattered about a hundred percent of the time that it was dropped Apple worked with Corning to create a shatter resistant glass in the months leading up to the iPhones release that glass would go on to be known as Gorilla Glass which is very common in smartphones today during the manufacture process the glass is toughened by an ion exchange the material is immersed in a molten alkaline potassium salt at a temperature of about 400 degrees Celsius that's 750 degrees Fahrenheit people wonder what a french-fried dipped it in that would taste like probably better than an iPhone screen in the early days there were several controversies one was Apple's beef with Adobe's Flash flash did not run on the iPhone but it was really popular on the web way back in 2007 it culminated with Steve Jobs writing an open letter on Apple's website explaining why I would never run on the iPhone too long didn't read it was a battery drain and in creating security concerns then there was an antenna gate with the iPhone 4 if your hand covered the antenna lines along the side of the phone did it work so well Steve Jobs responds don't hold it that way who exploit our apples PR department took over decided to give consumers free cases to improve cell phone reception then there was Ben gate on the iPhone 6 plus kids were going into Apple stores and bending iPhones just for funsies Consumer Reports ended up looking into it and found that the iPhone bending thing was just kind of blown out of proportion wasn't a real problem during testing an Apple engineer left an iPhone 4 prototype in a bar it was found and sold to a journalist after publishing the details Apple sent Cupertino Marines after the guy the Cupertino Marines don't have guns they're lawyers they're far more dangerous Apple also got a lot of bad press for using software to slow down older iPhones this was done for battery health and safety but probably shouldn't have been hidden from consumers one of the original iPhone concepts looked like a really chunky iPod Nano the iPhone 4 design was based on an early prototype of an iPhone one mock-up Johnny ad was a huge Sony industrial design fan from back in the day and many of those early concepts were based on old Walkman prototypes in this iPhone prototype the designers took Johnny's name and made it look like a Sony logo for years a picture of Bono was hidden on your iPhone after putting a free u2 album on the iPhone Tim Cook learned that he was the only guy left live who likes you too Tim's about to learn the same thing about Jennifer Aniston the iPhone 5 was the first iPhone to add touch ID the iPhone 7 got rid of the clickable button 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain Apple's first phone prototype dates way back to the 1980s it even had a stylist Steve Jobs hate styluses or or did he I made a video on that I bet you thought I was gonna mention the Newton next well you're right came out in the 90s and it was a very early version of the smartphone it fit in the palm of your hand just like the iPhone okay more like the iPhone Maxx during development the original iPhone was so super secret that only current Apple employees could be brought on to the project and Scott Forstall could not tell them what project they were gonna be working on ahead of time the codename for that project was purple when Jobs first introduced the iPhone in 2007 he had to follow a precise scripted sequence of inputs that the team developed for him so he could avoid crashing the phone during the demo the time Cisco owned the trademark for the name iPhone they were using it for a voice over IP service similar to Skype both companies settled and now they both own the rights to the name iPhone prior to the launch of the iPhone Google was already developing its own phone operating system but it did not plan on supporting touchscreens that changed after the launch of the iPhone I'm not sure why probably just a coincidence the average American spends more than 3 hours a day on a smartphone Apple developed tools to make people more aware of where their time goes in iPhone ads the time is always 942 a.m. the original Apple maps icon suggests motorists should drive off an overpass nobody did which is why this fact is not included in the controversy section the first iPhone advertisement was called hello and it ran during the 79th annual Academy Awards on February 25th 2007 Apple reportedly paid 1 million dollars to Michael Kovak in July 2007 for the transfer of the iPhone dot-com domain name over to Apple today the iPhone accounts for 59% of apples profits the other 41% is from the sale of dongles and yes I consider the watch a fancy dog gold don't at me in 2007 the iPhone was named invention of the Year by Time magazine because it was deemed to be so revolutionary 2007 people still read Time magazine Tim Cook is about to learn that too the a12 Bionic chip inside the iPhone is built using 7 nanometer technology only 13 people in this world know what that means 7 of them are leaving a comment on this video right now because it's very important to them that we know who they are early iPhone releases saw people waiting in line four days before the release of new phones once a guy in Japan waited in line for the iPhone 6 for 7 months before it was released he's still single ladies in 2016 Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 you don't need a headphone jack you don't need a headphone jack you don't it did that work no fine here's an adapter iPhone screen too big to navigate with just your thumb swipe down at the bottom of the screen and you'll put everything in reach swipe left or right along the bottom edge of your phone to jump back and forth between apps swipe up from the bottom of the screen to get to controls swipe down from the top of the screen to get your notifications finger

get a notification a lot more better in life go to the settings see what apps are zapping the most juice there was no iPhone - it went from the original iPhone to iPhone 3G because the second iPhone worked on AT&T 3G network which at the time was big deal the iPhone has always had a camera the original wasn't that impressive though it was only two megapixels a second camera a front-facing camera was added in 2010 to the iPhone 4 this is included for Apple's killer new feature which they called FaceTime currently you can have up to 31 other people on a FaceTime call with you that's just in case you don't get enough meetings at work in 2006 a third camera is added to the iPhone 7 that made two on the back one wide-angle one telephoto to create a depth of field effect it is expected that the next iPhone will have three cameras on the back at this rate by the year 2046 there will be 13 cameras on the iPhone and 3 u2 albums the iPhone 4 was first with a Retina screen the iPhone 5 out of the lightning cable which is much smaller than the old 10 pin connector used since the iPod days there's no iPhone 9 you could stop looking now today the cheapest new iPhone you can purchase is $450
