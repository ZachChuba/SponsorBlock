while we were in quarantine dobe came in here and he made one big giant nest I'm up to my neck and Jane right now we can't cut a hole in a sheet rock wall in mass and less than five feet I gotta show my wife you know something I never thought I'd say this but I love seeing you guys here I am here today because Nikko has after all of these years moved out of the space on the other side of that wall I think those are on Febuary of those nine to time which I have right here right those are the same dollars that Nikko gave see you better believe it [Music] [Laughter] why I'm here is to do walkthrough with mr. porringer pairing ger okay and to negotiate an expansion of corridor digital corridor digital just won't be here anymore it'll be here the lights are on the fan is on while we were in quarantine Toby came in here and he made one big giant nest I'm up to my neck and jank right now oh now summer is supposed to be the boom times it's supposed to be the times where kids are home from school they're watching our videos ad rates are up and god only knows what's gonna happen this year seven to my office your office yes in here four days making this diagram lays out all the problems that we're facing going into summer it's all here you know how you get rid of a nest you pull each one of the twigs out because if you burn it you might end up burning everything else around it and you don't want to burn those little beautiful baby chicks first problem we got to move into studio three this is something we've been working on for a long time in addition to that I heard Jan's hardware just completely crashed out on him yesterday Clint's working on this dominos video that's like super high-level visual effects and in the midst of all this we're trying to get everyone back into the studio which is a total mess by the way we got this brand integration coming where Ren's gonna do this cool thing with another 360 drone I heard there's rats in the studio and on top of all this Steve's coming by and I need to get ready all the changes that I want to make to this studio so that it's an easy pitch to him when he gets in later this afternoon studio is indeed a mess we've been out of it for three months now and a lot of people took some gear homes so they could work them home and you know we weren't here to kind of keep the everyday organization going so what the future expansion will be moving a lot of this stuff so it's like nice to get organized prior to that so then we moving in the new space and we'll have this easy-to-use organization system within the office here we are in motion we're back and we're we're making it happen it's my second week here working at corridor well actually it's not really my second week I started during the quarantine but I started from home so now that we're actually here in the studio Jake tasked me with organizing these men's toys airsoft guns nerf guns bullets props but that's the thing too I don't know what's trash either like something would literally look disgusting and they're like oh no that gets so important we use it in every video I'm like for sure well the first time I came to this you go I was like oh man like this is so cool while I'm like taking pictures of like all like the guns and stuff and then now that I'm actually tasked with like labeling everything I'm like I'm just I'm gonna make their lives a little easier and mine as well and I'm gonna remember I'm wearing a lot in here I called a Nintendo switch at twitch yesterday so that's where I am now one of the problems that we face with the current set up in studio 4 is that we have a production and post-production happening right next to each other and that's a problem because when you're working on post-production you need train of thought and you need your tool your machine to work in real time with your thought process this is this is absolutely critical to the creative process so what we're gonna do up here is a nice air-conditioned quiet post-production space when it comes to renovation we're putting a new electrical new Ethernet we're painting we're doing ceiling fans doing LED lighting we're doing the floors all that good stuff this is where most of the heavier construction and renovation is going to happen this whole half of the studio is literally like a kill house qcb freaking airsoft so there's three rooms here I'd like this one to actually remain a bedroom when I'm in from San Antonio or when we have people guests come in I want a nice place for people to be able to stay comfortably it'll have air-conditioning it'll have lighting all that good stuff one thing you might notice is that these are just is like unfinished almost partition walls the guys built them back in the day they were just looking to do something quick it was not I don't think intended to be like a 10-year solution so this these partitions are gonna go all the way up so this room and the next room over I want to turn into an office seal this off cut this wall this will be like a little executive office with also like a little meeting them to access the studio that's literally on the other side of this wall it's my secret door behind this bridge the whole time Mabel's have not the whole fridge on here yeah just like the back of the fridge so we go through you cut the hole and we'll just go through the other side and you go into John Malkovich's head so you'll come through here and then this wall it's just it's just renovations we have to do up here as well as some of the smaller things we need to do in studio four I'm trying to get this done for under $40,000 well we'll see that's enough to do everything I think and make it a good comfortable working space for everybody at now at corridor okay since we've been back in the studio I realized that there's another problem that we're all facing here our internet here is entirely unencrypted it's Adobe snack and Dobby has been living off of these well guess what thanks to today's sponsor expressvpn we're gonna starve them out forever did you guys really think there wouldn't be a brand integration in my video come on Dean I need you to stop what you're doing right now okay all the information that you're sending back and forth across the network right now is unencrypted yeah here's what we need to do okay we need to install expressvpn on every computer it will encrypt all of our Internet information and will be safe and secure we're gonna starve Dobie out once and forever Fred's computer as well unplug the network Dean go I actually already got expressvpn using part court or a coupon what you have to get it again run install expressvpn right now my internet do you realize that expressvpn has the best current encryption services available well then we need to get them on my computer immediately connected don't use current location trick the internet they have servers in over 94 countries hey did you know that expressvpn gives you content unblocking meaning that you can watch content in other countries here in America mmm what's your favorite show if you can't watch it right now it means that you need to get content unblocking this happens a lot sorry Nico go to expressvpn calm slash corridor crew to find out how you can get three months free that's expr ESS VPN dot-com slash corridor crew d-r-e now now expr ESS VPN comm / corridor crew alright ii X I installed expressvpn on every computer and now if we don't have to worry about a thing how many days has it been since you slept well another problem solved around here good luck with that one Dobie it's gonna take you billions of years to unencrypt that information the node computer gave us some of the most interesting problems it crashed in the most beautiful of ways it actually wasn't like a piece of art I totally forgot to get a picture but I've been trying to describe what I saw cuz I've never seen that sort of computer era before ever what is this I assumed it was some sort of like graphics card driver error or something and he got this photo literally like three seconds before the computer totally crashed with the black currently I'm going to be editing the last of this medieval TTT faun a bundle of wood and the collective hopes and prayers of everyone in this room then Nico's computer is connected to Dean's internet because there are only so many pipes we have of good good fast-moving Internet Dobie man Dobie like smeared bloody poop all over your notebook here there at all right back story when I first got in from quarantine into the studio I found on my notepad next to my desk not just rat poop bloody smears like wait Griffin my brother gave me a bag of those sugarfree gummy bears that are like laxatives for a gag gift for Christmas so I've been keeping them on my desk just as like you know like look up who knew the soozluecke poop and today I found him and there was like a big hole in him and there was like half over Gandhi dude would explain it I think the rat ate half of Griffin's poop gummy bears and then well you know the rest so did my workout hey Steve beautiful day to die to die I like your mask when I'm walking down the street in Echo Park people go off the sidewalk and they avoid me at all cost because your mask well when you see a naked person walking down the street with a mask like this son you kind of want to avoid the building inspectors came by about two years ago and they said hey Steve we haven't checked out your building in 35 years I'm gonna take a look apparently none of the stuff that was on the original plans was on the plans as they stood so he had to have the entire building looked at all the city departments had to go through and approve everything that's now on the plans we can't cut a hole in a sheetrock wall you physically can cut a hole in any sheetrock physically can the City of LA and all of its infinite wisdom will not allow us to remove a sheetrock wall that we put up can't do it you can't remove an existing sheetrock wall that's on a preset of Plan C this is as a as a human being and as a landlord my biggest concern is safety they only require you to put one fire extinguisher in every studio I could three so I do I do whatever the heck they want me to do and you even joked a couple years ago when fire department was killing me you said when do we have to wear our fire retardant suits to the building that joke wasn't that far off because that's how it felt going through the that's another department by the way City Planning city zoning handicap division earthquake division building and safety the fire department that's seven electrical even if you're not doing electrical or plumbing is to go through just for them to go like this oh okay no changes so you have to do that multiple times over with each department the day is gone for by the way the city plan checker that I had he was a nice guy he was a very hard guy a tough guy he was and he said this to me while I was he said I am prejudiced against brick buildings I don't like brick buildings if I had my way I would have all brick buildings torn down so I was with my daughter in Santa Monica once so we were at a restaurant at a restaurant that was made of brick Santa Monica had some kind of like a little earthquake and quite a number of the bricks started falling down in the restaurant we all had to vacate the restaurant in viata yada yada and I said okay I've legally gone in this building through two retrofits and the guy looked at me and he said I don't care it's still brick what could I do there's your answer you are you were wondering why they came after you so hard there's your answer you had a brickest on your hands one less brick one more light brick so here's what corridor Romanian corridor may put a space here it's 36 inches and 36 inches wide for a set of double doors and it would go up to here 80 inches by 36 and 36 okay so that would feed right into this room then ya do the same thing here okay so you'd have a semi partitioned area that's really three rooms have janked together personally i don't even care once those are on a series of plans it going through this city this particular city and what they make you go through it wasn't even this kind of a nightmare 1981 and 82 when we when John and I went through this so yeah well it does suck to have my dreams shattered by the cold reality that is bureaucracy but that's just sometimes the way that the wind blows and you know what this means it means that it's an opportunity to readjust some of our DEA's go back and go through the process of getting this done right now that's gonna take a while but in the meantime there's plenty of other things that can get solved right here right now okay so Jordans been doing a lot around here but reorganizing the costume room is almost like a rite of passage at this point we've had a few people come in and do it and I want to see how what she did stands up to the others did you know that like it's a rite of passage around here did anyone tell you that yet yeah I think well you did it one time Christian's done it Brett did it so we have to see who's done it the best first impressions pretty good a good sign that you've taken the time to do it correctly is the new labels the new labels is key for me in my closet I want to be able to see everything I don't want to have to move boxes to find things so if you can tell you can kind of almost see every label so even like the one back there prisoners and jumpsuits you know you can see it you don't have to go digging even these up here you don't even have to look inside of it to know what's in that most attachments pouch best attachments yeah there's so many attachments well I think you've done a great job I think it is very competitive with the other versions of this that we've seen good luck with the prop room that is the real challenge as you can see we're doing a ton around here to fight off DOB and one of the things that we did is introduced this mocap pattern on a brand new all original corridor digital hoody [Music] not only is this hoodie one of the most comfortable hoodies you're gonna wear it's also got really cool hardware it's got hidden pockets for whatever you might need and it's dobby resistant this sweatshirt also comes in crewneck and I know that we ran out well guess what we restocked them and what else do we got oh yeah well now they can be your pants because we restock the spectrum of reflective joggers after overwhelming demand hopefully this stuff won't be gone by the time I tell you about it because we tell our website subscribers first they also get 15% off so if you guys want that go on over to corridor digital comm and sign up or not go record a digital that store and get whatever is left when I came up to me and he said do you know what your name means and I said just see mayor I said I think C is like EEE the you know the Pacific Ocean and mayor and he said know your last name means dried Bulls penis I went you know I have not had enough beers
