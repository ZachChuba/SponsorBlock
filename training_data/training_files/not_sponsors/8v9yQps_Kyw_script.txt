website I'll post a link it down below to it but for now video all right hey guys sorry this is a text I shouldn't be smiling today we are addressing a serious situation something that has been you know slowly be crawling inside my studio I'm not talking about bugs I'm talking about kitchen islands let me show you what I mean okay one two three four the thing that that's keeping me awake at night is that none of these kitchen islands are the same height same width everything is different even even the countertops are all different and this is the situation that I'm trying to address I'm gonna do that by obviously building more kitchen islands you asked me to solve the problems I'm solving the problem the big ones are probably the best but the material that I use for the top of this one is really nothing to be proud of you've got these lines that mess up with everything you're basically doing using tiles is more fragile than using stainless steel this one definitely is my favorite and yet it's too heavy it's it's bulky I would love it to be separated into smaller modules for now I'm gonna keep those two but I'm gonna say goodbye to this one and to this one so they can I'm gonna go and get myself some sheets of plywood I love plywood I know it's a bit random but there's a lovely video online about plywood it's called a love letter to plywood and it's made by some such an amazing nasty artist you should definitely check this out anyway end of the digression let's go and get these sheets of plywood [Music] I'm calling a metal company for for the countertops that I need stainless steel ones I know it's closed welcome to summer and buys even though I've been trying really hard to find sheets of metal for the table it seems like every metal company is closed in August a truss I fell a bit stuck but in fact I came up with another idea unusual but that could probably solve it and maybe even in a less expensive way so this is a sheet of stainless tea that is used by pastry chef I could basically turn this into a top for my kitchen island so here's the plan so I'm gonna be working at least on the first module and the first one is gonna be the utility one all the things that I need at my desk at least roles on this side maybe a bigger one at the button and same on the other side as well but all the same size in case I need to stop for example butters at the bottom then I would love to have the top made out of stainless steel because it's just like the best material in the kitchen and then on the side I will be thinking about the modular temporary sticky but for now this is what I'm gonna be working on if you have a store the place where I got all the wood is super close to an amazing Portuguese grocery stuff so I got some back allows feature some fish allow some octopus salad and a bit of Portuguese rice I'm gonna deal with this situation and on top of that it's TD's a food channel afterwards [Music] [Music] [Music] so now that all my modules are complete I mean Morris the structure at least is is complete I'm gonna be working on the mechanism that's gonna hold them together magnets its magnet time [Music] so in the end this is the baking sheet that I've got I really like this public form two things the first one is this ledge and the second problem is the way I'm gonna use and abuse these surfaces it's gonna be full of scratches you don't want that so I'm gonna bash it I'm not gonna brush it gently like this I feel pacer brush it aggressively let's flatten it out I'm sure you wouldn't believe me if I were to do that my neighbors actually love me this is a knife that I made with Alex steel via YouTube black mist amazing guy Emmet's this it's not even a it's not even a hammer it's a pen dizer so let's talk about the way these bad boys are you know sticking to one another so on each module you've got four magnets - on the left and plus on the right the reason why I did that this goes now plus minus plus minus you spin it around and you still get plus minus plus minus which is amazing because then you can stick them together I wouldn't call myself a genius on this but I think it's nice coming through so let's say you've got some big heavy wood meat vegetables fish so like a stand mixer it takes loads of real estate and that's good cuz you have plenty now let's say you have less work you could cut a few things use the stove over here and it's not taking too much real estate in the studio that's my point now let's go even further let's see an onion finds that but you don't need that much real estate you just need a small convenient kitchen island like this one I could also play you know that gang the three cars and then obviously if you feel like the ego is kicking back if you feel like you need more space more power always go back to this Optimus Prime configuration I like to call this Optimus Prime so here's the situation with wine crates in the studio they are basically everywhere you've got wine crates over there over there you've got 14 there got more tricks and they are even more weight raised over here there are also two bottles of wine at the end of the day I'm still a Frenchman so plenty wine in there I've got a bad back of the fun you can keep on giving me white buttons jiggle does my own wine about three butters of my own wine its coconuts for my research now back to these wine crates we're gonna use them and they are going to become the base drawers of those kitchen islands I think they can look good as long as I keep their face clean which is obviously what I'm gonna do I'm not gonna damage right so here's what I did with the drawers I integrated two of them and I think it looks pretty good it's like beautifully inside on top and iminium handles just keep the face clean while you know matching the airline service stroll a kind of vibe that these carry obviously nice all the faces of these kitchen island will have a dedicated purpose like I think this one would be dedicated to daily use like this could be like a very expensive bucket dump and this something million conclude a classic could be the most expensive dry trash can [Music] [Music] [Music] right guys I hope you enjoy that it's obviously not the end of this a kitchen island story I need to populate them as I mentioned earlier I'm thinking about a few different options I'm thinking about a sheet Roddick and I love tea I'm also thinking about all the kitchen towers paper flowers white spirits some disinfectant basically I want each module to be dedicated to one task plenty more content to come so in the meantime take care bye bye [Music]
