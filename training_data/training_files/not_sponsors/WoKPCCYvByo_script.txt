so here we are a long painful seven months after we first teased the concept of building the first ever linus media group gaming lounge and ironically pretty much everything else about this space is done so we've got our side table here this just arrived it's still got all the protective stuff on it we've got our board games table here this is actually a bit of a placeholder but whatever we could play board games we've got the media lounge that is like it's freaking awesome and the one part we haven't actually started on yet is the actual lan gaming center fortunately everything's here oh my god so it's time for us to finally build the first real system except that we had a small problem we were having trouble getting the core i7 processors that we had intended to use from our prototype system way back when so we figured you know what well we're only running rtx 2070s anyway would amd really be that much of a performance compromise here well there's only one way for us to find out orange interior check it out at the link below [Music] so before we get into building our actual final spec rig i guess a bit of a haul video is kind of in order here isn't it man this is a lot of hardware every system is getting a g903 no no i it it's actually worse we went a little further than that we went even further over the top those are extras every system is getting one of logitech's pro wireless gaming mice okay as if half the people that are going to be using it are even skilled enough to know the difference everyone's getting a g513 carbon with their romergy linear switches everyone's getting a g935 headset and thanks to logitech's recent acquisition of blue microphones a yeti nano mic because you know the built-in headset mic i mean we've got it it's not like it's not a super high-end headset but we're gonna use an off-board mic you know whatever then moving into the systems themselves we're running ryzen 2700 x processors so yes we lose a little bit of single threaded performance compared to the 8700ks we initially expect but we can probably overclock them a little and quite frankly in the esports titles that will be running for the most part i don't expect it to make a difference although we will be testing that out today and then cooling them we're going to be using h100i rgb platinum water coolers from corsair we're going to be pairing them with 16 gigs each of ddr4 266 megahertz rgb ram from also corsair every system gets an mp300 480 gig boot drive do we have hard drives for these uh yes and octane oh nice everyone's getting a brio 4k pro webcam so everything's gonna be stream ready and update all the updates all the obtain oh wow okay so that's pretty cool that means our 480 gig ssd is going to handle os duties and any critical applications and then our hard drives are actually going to have accelerated caching so that the games that are played most frequently even if they are on magnetic storage are still going to load faster than if they were just on a hard drive also pulling cooling duty corkstar sent over a whole bunch of their light loop 120 fans first let's talk about what they're going to be driving so asus sent over 12 of their vg279 gaming monitors so these are 1080p ips with three millisecond response times and they run at 144 hertz so these are basically you're kind of no frills but still looks really great gaming monitor they don't have g-sync but now that nvidia has enabled g-sync on freesync displays we're not expecting that to be a problem for our geforce rtx 2070 graphics cards the whole thing's going to be hooked into asus tough series b450m plus gaming motherboard and installed in a crystal series 280x case from corsair for power we've gone way over the top see sonic sent over their prime titanium 1000 watt modular power supply i told them like 750 plus this is literally three times the power we actually need but cool thanks i guess actually a couple things i forgot minor details a quantia sent over their 10 gig nicks so guys we don't expect this to make a difference to the actual gaming experience but while installing games off our steam caching server which you can check out the video about up here this will definitely make a difference while we're pulling down from all these machines at once so that's gonna be sick and these chairs from max nomix so we haven't actually reviewed one of their chairs in quite some time but this is still my daily driver in my office actually not quite this one but a similar model and i'm super excited that when we're here for hours after work we're gonna be sitting on something as comfortable as their classic office chair we got the black one right jake yeah and it's embroidered oh that looks awesome as the kids would say i'm not a kid anymore i'm not saying it i just want to hear you say it it's lit it's lit yeah lit af lit af thank you thank you see i knew you were gonna say it damn it i said it okay so while jake puts together a couple of the chairs which we're going to need for our head-to-head mono amano gaming session i'm going to put together one of our final amd based rigs so we can find out when we put it head-to-head against our original intel based prototype over here how much if any performance we're leaving on the table with our 2700 x's you know what i think i'm gonna mix things up for this build i'm gonna start by getting everything ready in the case then i'm gonna put together my core platform on my motherboard here i haven't even gotten as far as putting the fans into the case and we've already found a problem because we changed from an intel board to an amd board sort of midway through this project we might have overlooked a small compatibility issue now it's nothing sort of game ending here we still have room for our triple slot graphics card and our 10 gigabit nick but what we are losing is the ability to put in our optane module because this board only has a single m.2 slot and yeah there's no additional one on the back or anything like that yeah that's a little disappointing actually uh hey so jake how are we arranging the fans on these things because we can either design it for optimal airflow and have two in two out uh or we can have our light loop rings all visible externally and it can look badass and then it'll be like highly positive pressurized but but they're all filtered two and two out two into out yeah you gotta better than the system's overheating he's not gonna do it i just wanted to check something real quick with you though however i build this first one that's how we'll have to build all of them right well i could always just fix it all right i guess this one is done now hey not bad pretty good man i mean it's just i have this exact same chair at my desk so oh yeah a vivo sent over their um so they don't actually sell a complete desk they just sell do they yeah well that's not what we got we needed a big one that's not the one that i bought the other week either um yeah they they sell just like a standing sitting like leg assembly so that's what we're going to be putting these custom d brand skinned mdf table tops on top of i'm actually super stoked for how good that's going to look those things are really heavy please be careful so this is a pretty cool little piece of kit this is a corsair commander pro and it plugs in using sata for power and then usb for data and then it's got all your led ports here you've got up to six fans that you can plug in directly it's got temp sensors right here and then two usb internal headers in case you have a motherboard that only has one and then you're taking it up with this thing well this way you can plug your front panel usb 2 into this or any other accessories like say for example one of corsair's own cpu coolers which we are probably going to need to do in this case so we're going to replace our existing fan hub with this guy yeah cable management man i tell you the adhesive that they use to hold the original led and fan controllers in is ridiculous just barely get that thing off sounds like something a beta male would say holy crap ow like look at my fingers what are you gonna cry too you know what you take it off show me how it's done alpha guy oh man that's pretty on there oh it was really loosened a lot uh-huh why did they put that much adhesive on look i love you guys at corsair great great people sent us a lot of hardware for this project okay yeah we're going full rgb ringness here it's taking me as long to do the rgb wiring as it would to build a normal computer of course it'll be all worth it but like we've got the two we've got the the commander pro we've got the rgb hub we've got the the leads for all the strips and all the fans two power leads for the whole thing i think we're finally ready to put a motherboard in it look at the chairs though but the chairs are done god damn it you know the funny thing is i've always just kind of used whatever like brand loyalty is not a thing for me but because the community's perception of me as some kind of fanboy one way or the other is so strong it feels a little bit naughty building an amd system see check this out this is what i love about this case this side like look at that it's not clean or what and then this side in typical linus fashion i'm like getting pretty close here actually i just gotta pop the power supply in wire that up then i need my graphics card network card and then i'm good to go i don't know who would use this as a standing desk but maybe if you're like an nba player or something well i wasn't sure if i could do it but after giving it my best effort i think i've succeeded in making the contrast between my cable managed side and my non-cable managed side even more stark good job linus it's a real shame about that video card sage that's actually not that bad uh it's not great i was expecting it to be a lot worse than that i'm not okay i'm also a little upset about the one yellow accent can you just get the tea out of there finish the tea off so it's just off gaming gaming for gamers you have to do this like like this yeah like this otherwise otherwise it's not you don't get the white out look otherwise look how beta his his writing game is here look at that it's gorgeous thanks to uh aki for sending these mouse pads xl mouse pads very nice with the braided edge this is the moment we've all been waiting for yay nice okay so my nick is showing up my 16 gigs of rams all showing up my hard drive is not showing up oh it might be a sas drive i just grabbed something off the shelf because our drives didn't actually arrive okay i will figure that out later but we still have a couple things to do here so i'm going to set our docp so that's amd's xmp equivalent which should configure our ram to its optimized settings and then install windows so this is it is finished amd system versus the old concept intel system on a test bench i mean really the point of all this is to find out how much we compromised by going amd so uh i think we're two and two right now aren't we jake is that does that sound right also i'm pretty sure that while i was pretty far behind before you're dead again and uh my kill count is pretty close oh oh would you look at that am i out ahead now huh because i remember you talking some smack about how you're like a young hip gamer or some oh nice spawned right behind you like that performance wise oh it's it's not making a difference it literally doesn't matter uh what are you at in terms of fps oh like around 300 250 250. it really depends on where you are in the map yep i'm anywhere from like 150 to 250. okay we're here this means okay that's me it's me okay so let's just look down look down the thing i just want to know what the fps difference is like okay mine's higher what yeah yours is quite a bit higher do you have anything in the background no i mean remember cs go is a notoriously intel favoring game right so yes there's a difference but like i didn't feel for a second like i was affected by the difference and you know when we're talking 150 versus yeah it made no 240 fps i'm i'm all right with it okay why don't we try a different game gg you can't alt tab out of this game yeah i won okay man i haven't played on 1080p in a hot minute it's a little different than 1440p ultrawide yeah like it's it's like a 10fps difference well remember csgo was behind so i was thinking about it over a second but like csgo was behind in the context of like 160 versus 240 fps like it's not i don't know it wasn't that much it felt like it was like 30. no it was a little bit more oh there's two crap okay well sorry we got wrecked ah that wasn't bad no the frame rates are good i mean yeah dang it you did more damage all right all right so you're better at the game that only you play and that i don't play so okay that's good that's good so then that's our takeaway jake isn't actually that great at video games in spite of being one of the young kids actually depending on you know what game you're playing you might even get a better gaming experience with the 2700x which did surprise me in apex legends anyway that's like 100 bucks cheaper no regrets then now we just have to build 11 more that's my regret that's my only regret is doing it 11 times having this idea
