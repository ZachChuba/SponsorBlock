In a few hours, this sloppy wet concrete will harden into a solid, which, after a few days will be strong
enough to hold many tons of weight. Pasta also starts in a moist amorphous state,
hardens after a few hours, and it can also hold a lot of weight. But there’s an important difference between
capellini and concrete – noodles dry out (which you can tell because when you add water,
they re-absorb it and become soft again), while concrete sets (you can pour as much
water on it as you want, and it won’t become soggy - which is good because you don’t
want buildings and bridges to get soggy when it rains). The distinction is that when pasta is made,
water simply evaporates out of the dough, leaving behind a desiccated, starchy scaffolding
with plenty of holes & gaps ready to re-absorb water in the future and re-soften the dough. When concrete sets, on the other hand, calcium
oxide, silicon dioxide and other molecules in the cement chemically combine with water
molecules to create new compounds like calcium silicate hydrate. These molecules grow into
crystalline fibers that bond with each other and literally cement together rock, sand,
metal or whatever else you put into the mix. So when concrete hardens, it’s not drying
out, because water isn’t leaving it – water is reacting with and becoming PART of the
cement. In fact, concrete continues to set for months and even years after it’s poured,
increasing in strength over time and enabling the construction of miraculously strong and
durable structures, like the 2000 foot tall CN Tower in Toronto or the 2000 year old Pantheon in Rome.
