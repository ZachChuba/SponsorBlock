uh they're all going to lights oh i killed yep uh i'm sorry i was right let's see always um excuse me i'll follow your lead yep just remember to spaced event that is fine uh they're all going to lights i killed yep uh i'm sorry i was um what's good dk hey what's up well three of you coming up on that yeah that's really exciting okay can i can i defend myself yeah go for it i know it doesn't work but listen hear me out hear me out i walked by and i was like wait someone's dead up on that note and i walked up to it you know you didn't see me on it in my defense but if you feel safe sending me out so it doesn't everyone's not like wasting time on me i completely agree with that so from from our perspective from our perspective we came out with to the right there's a body dk just stood like two steps away from it and then reports it as we get wait before you send me guys can i say one thing yeah yeah don't let steve get the end game so be careful there's two left that's all i'm saying but i i'm glad you're saying because it you know you'll be successful it would come back to bite you in the future yeah yeah yeah but guys i'm just saying crew mates there's two left be careful check out this how'd that work out for us okay please i didn't mean to do that i was sick stop tying out i'm sorry it's a force of habit from other games i think i clicked the event that i i don't know what happened weird click it just like actually click it oh no i must click this oh i was trying to stab lights um she's really slow and opening those two viruses i didn't um oh okay so here's my scenario uh i said all right i'm gonna go do specimens just get it done it's early in the game i go down there i do my numbers i do the jewels and fix that the lights are out the lights come back on alpha's down there wait what then i go you were down in a specimen with me but i go up the uh ramp and there's a dead body in the decom north okay i think i can clear uh both botes and steve yeah all right we were on the left the whole time and we fixed lights votes came after she was really slow to try to open doors we opened all of them and we fixed lights and we we're like in ot right now pretty much for the entire round or a self report yeah my counter for that was junk i entered specimen from bottom side and then i was on simon says and i never saw you lights were out i had a task up so i don't you know i'm worried what's around could dk have been wrong sorry i'm a little worried here because okay yeah i am sick of losing to you today so my patience with you is a little yes i want to right now i mean i think the queers are right now yeah but junk and alpha are in specimen and literally the i think it is very unlikely this is a self report from jungkook yeah no i don't know i like say the four people the three people who walked up on dk were ross and major and they're both dead who were essentially a confirmed crew and steve okay elbow junk i guess goodbye guys goodbye bye yes oh my okay stefan what do you think you oh this is bad because he can [ __ ] this up um where'd he go i don't know is she killing a button yeah just killing the button please thank you yeah wow i said and immediately was like well it's gotta be you i just said the thing that was true like we were with someone yeah exactly she just let go me and steve both fake the same note and then peter walks up and then i i was trying to sabotage lights and then i invented it and then i was like okay well let's kill him yeah she's like this is i i i quote this this is what i quote uh i think my task will open right as you vented so i didn't see anything she she said um i have control everything just remember to press space to vent i walk over and she jumps in the vent in front of you i was clicking sabotage was like these lights and steve was there me andrea and steve i was not there andrea just went along i heard that she said she cleared you but i didn't say you were at like devin i
