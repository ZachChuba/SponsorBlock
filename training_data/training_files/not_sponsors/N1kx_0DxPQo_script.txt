what's up guys Dan here from kilowatt auto so in today's video I want to share with you a recent road trip that I took in my Tesla Model 3 so in total the road trip was about 340 miles and over 300 of those miles were driven by the car in autopilot so I do have full self driving and my car was running version 2020 24.6 dot of X software version and in today's video I want to share with you my overall impressions of how the car did as well as look at some specific instances where the car did struggle definitely consider subscribing so you don't miss any of my weekly videos I to Jerry to be my first referral code user I want to start out by talking about the strengths of both full self-driving and navigate on autopilot in next week's video I do plan on getting into more of the numbers so in that video we'll take a look at the mileage the efficiency numbers charging time and charging rates and more of the metrics in terms of the road trip but in this video I just wanted to focus on how the car performs look at its strengths and then also some opportunities for improvement so navigate on autopilot was able to take me from on-ramp to off-ramp without any issues it was able to take me through construction zones where there's cones on the roads where the lanes might shift without any issues as well and then it also was able to accurately predict battery levels at the charge points that I would have to stop during the road trip and I'm not sure if this has to do with the weather being a little bit warmer so with the warmer temperatures the batteries are definitely much more efficient so the car was able to accurately predict the mileage in the battery at the point where I stopped to charge and I've mentioned this in past videos but navigate on autopilot as well as full self-driving greatly reduced driver fatigue and that ultimately increases safety so the entire road trip took about six hours total and because most of it was actually done by the car all I had to do was mein still engaged with the vehicle as it's driving because there were certain scenarios where I did have to make some minor adjustments but overall the car kept me much safer than typical driving for an extended period of time where you start to combat the highway hypnosis and just getting tired with longer duration driving in terms of some area for improvement I think the biggest area where Tesla's still need to get better is their driver etiquette so what I mean by this is that a lot of times when the car is going to make a lane change to pass slower moving traffic it'll still maintain the speed that it was moving at so the car will shift over into the passing lane and if I have it set at 70 miles an hour it'll maintain that speed until it passes the car on the right regardless of if there's 20 cars behind you that are tailgating you to try and pass so something that can be a little bit annoying and a lot of times I'll just adjust the speed up so we pass the cars on the right but it would be cool and a little bit more convenient if the car was able to adjust the speed even if it was by 2 or 3 miles per hour once it's in the passing lane so it passes those slower moving cars a little bit quicker the car did phantom brake twice while we were on the highway and for those of you that don't know what phantom braking is basically it's whenever the car breaks for no apparent object in front of it so we were driving about 70 miles per hour and whatever did phantom brake it would drop significantly down to either 60 or maybe even 55 miles per hour there weren't any cars following close behind me so not a big deal had we been in traffic though or if the highway was a little bit more congested that would definitely be a little bit more concerning another area where the car definitely needs a little bit of improvement is when it's changing lanes to follow a route so a lot of times if you're on a two-lane highway and a lane opens up on the right whether it be an exit ramp or a ramp to another interchange the car will move over into the left passing lane when it really doesn't need to so this again becomes a driver etiquette issue where the cars potentially getting in front of faster moving traffic it happened a couple times throughout this road trip so it was just something that I noticed that definitely needs a little bit of work because the car could have just maintained the lane that it was in and still followed the route now I want to get into some specific instances where the car either made a mistake or there's some opportunities for improvement so I talked a little bit about construction zones earlier and overall navigate on auto it handles construction zones fairly well one thing it does not do though is slow down for construction zones so I recognize that the cars not yet at the point where it's reading and interpreting speed limit signs however I think when it notices cones on the road it should be programmed to automatically slow down a little bit oftentimes as we're moving through these construction zones there's lane shifts and the cars just maintaining its speed whether it be sixty five or seventy miles per hour so definitely an area that could benefit the driver if the car recognizes a lot of cones that it should slow down a little bit just to maintain a more safe speed in terms of traffic light recognition the car is still doing very well with this feature and on that note if you missed last week's video I did go into traffic light recognition and just took a bit of a deeper dive into how the car is now following leading cars through intersections but also reading traffic lights as they change to both yellow and red so definitely check that video out if you missed it but on this road trip there were several portions of the highway that had traffic lights and one weird interaction that occurred a couple of times is that some of these lights actually had warning lights about a thousand feet ahead of them so these were just posts over the road with flashing yellow lights alerting drivers that hey there's a traffic light up ahead and I noticed that the car would actually label and recognize these as traffic lights and in some cases it did start to slow down so I did have to hit down on the drivers stock or give the car a little bit of acceleration just so it didn't stop for those supposed traffic lights and this is again something that will only improve with time so Tesla's neural net is drawing along the experience of all Tesla vehicles that are actively using autopilot on the road so as the cars begin to recognize that the lights are not actually traffic lights and they're just warning signs that hopefully will be phased out over time and the cars will stop labeling them as traffic lights and then my last example is where the car was taking an interchange so this actually ties in the whole notion of where the car will move into the left lane to follow the route and then it decided also to slow down about 20 miles per hour so it did create a bit of an unsafe situation there weren't any cars behind me or closeby though so it wasn't a huge deal but again it was just sort of a weird interaction I'm not sure why the car felt that need to slow down that significantly for the interchange all I had to do though was just bump up the speed on the steering wheel and then we were back on our way so again not a huge deal but definitely an area where the car didn't make the best decisions overall overall full self driving makes longer road trips incredibly easy and a lot safer for the driver and I've mentioned this in past videos but the cops are programmed by humans in a way that unfortunately sometimes limits their ability to drive like a normal human so just something to keep in mind you still have to remain engage throughout the entirety of the trip but you're not engaged to the point where you're on edge all the time waiting for the car to make a mistake overall and in aggregate the car is extremely safe when you're using navigate on autopilot and makes that driver experience a lot easier and much more enjoyable especially for long road trips as I mentioned earlier next week's video will breakdown more of the numbers of this trip so we'll look at interpreting efficiency numbers as well as mileage and charging peak rates just to take a look and see how you can interpret your castles efficiency and plan for longer road trips but make sure hit the bell so you get notified when that video is posted next weekend the get you 1,000 free super charging miles but that's actually where I'm going to end today's video if you enjoyed it make sure you hit the like button thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
