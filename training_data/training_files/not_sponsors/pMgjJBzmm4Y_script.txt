hey what is going on you guys it is missing Oh sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new video for you all today so as promised I know this upload was a little bit later than expected but this is the official blooper side of loot from 1,000 players in this video you will only see me kill I think maybe 1 or 2 people and I also managed to add in a few good escape clips as well from getting away from clans and stuff but for the most part in this video you will just be seeing me die approximately about 180 times for example in this clip here I had just gotten a great kill and I was trying my best to get away but you know as you can see we had a PK iran-us and looks like we had no food no bruise left and considering I was tanking and red D hide and rune I definitely thought I was going to die here but you know you do occasionally get these lucky moments in runescape and you really got to take advantage of them as you can see I predicted his switches pretty well and we did actually manage to get away and I'm sure that guy was very upset now of course that was just one instance of things going right for me when I was in a situation of where I was about to die but in a scenario like this when your target is spark Mak and you teleport right up to him you know unfortunately he was leading one of the biggest groups at the rib caves at this time I think it was like 3 o'clock in the morning and yeah I mean I was trying to tell them hey man you know you got the wrong guy I'm team but I don't think they were buying it so yeah but that was the only time I did die by spark Mak throughout these 1000 kills but yeah shout out the spark Mak I mean that guy's been peaking for like 14 years straight so absolutely crazy now I'm not gonna lie about 80 percent of these deaths are pretty casual and usually on average every time I would die I would lose anywhere from 300 to 500 K but I think the highlight of this video will be all of the times that I lost a plus-one which was very regular leaves probably every two days or so and I didn't get all of them on video but this right here is the very first instance of me losing a dragon claws and what happened was essentially I was doing some target hunting in the bounty hunter world and one of my targets was at Callisto so I teleported up and started attacking him and all of a sudden his two friends instantly scold and I was expecting that so I ran South you know I was talking a little bit just kind of making fun of the situation and while I was kind of doing that you know trolling them getting ready to teleport I accidentally clicked my map and I wasn't paying attention to my prayer and yeah I lost dragging Klaus on day two from a group of PVA MERS at Callisto so you know don't feel too bad every time you see a PBM are getting killed because they might actually be an anti PK heir and they might actually just have a moment like that were they PK an insane amount of money certainly a lot more money than they would have made PBM in that days and of course you know when you're peaking at the rep caves quite a bit you are gonna be outnumbered and as most of you guys know I only did team P Kang probably like three different times throughout this video it wasn't really my type of thing so you know you can't expect quite a few deaths in multi you know just being at the wrong place at the wrong time and as you can see there I did died to some people doing wilderness Slayer and to also targets risking a whole lot more GP than I was so as you can see this guy was risking a berserker necklace as well as full obsidian and we you know we almost did get the kill there but unfortunately he did hit much higher than we did so we didn't get it but you know it's always worth it when you're risking about 300k to definitely take the L if your opponent is risking 10 to 20 times your risk so you know unfortunately there wasn't too many double deaths of that occurring during this video but there definitely was a few and I did throw those later on in the video such as this clip here chances are if it's four versus one you probably don't need to be using ice barrage and because of that we did actually manage to get that kill but we went down at the same time now if you curious as to like why I was teleporting to deep level multi wilderness you know kind of an obvious tell that there might be a team or a clan there waiting especially locations like annacarl or level 50 obelisk or near the fountain of rune and usually that is because when I would teleport to these locations it would always kind of be like a calculated risk if I would see like two people there I would instantly just rush and try my best and a lot of the times I would just instantly log out you know teleporting directly up there and being on my logout screen one tick away from just logging out and what would usually happen is if I see a lot of numbers like 10 plus or something like that I would just instantly log and hop worlds and try again so a lot of that bounty they're teleporting was very dangerous but it wasn't always dangerous you know I did get away a lot of the time just being very lucky but as you can see in certain clips you know my prayer would drop to zero because there'd be so many people smiting me as you can see in this clip you know starting at 32 prayer points and you know just not paying attention at all to a single prayer point of mine and somehow someway I did not lose my H yes here this is actually quite a few occasions of this happening during the video and every single time I'm just more and more grateful that I did not lose it because you know as I mentioned in my previous video we did lose money throughout the making of this because of you know stupid mistakes like that but also because of 200 deaths overall and anymore plus ones really would have just you know been adding insult to injury so I'm glad that we did have the occasions where I would get that luck because it did turn the tables a lot and had I lost plus ones on those certain days knowing me I'd probably just log out for the rest of the day and it would have taken a lot longer to do this video so I'm glad that we had some good rng there I did have some luck with DHS but you know any time that I would get a target that's just basically standing in Edgeville with full D H on you know I would always school up in hopes that they would fight me and honestly most of these people did they weren't really that mad that I wasn't risking as much and I think that's because there's such a small amount of people that are my combat that's still PK and bounty hunter edge Vil you know the low levels of wilderness most people at this combat peak ain't deep wild so you really don't see too many DHS nbh but you will still see a couple or you know one or two every few hours and those people would always fight me so if you were one of them shout out to you thanks a lot for you know not making me grab a set or anything like that never have been the greatest dhp care and you know these guys really embraced my rune and red D hides so shout out to them and some things to keep in mind if you ever do one a D H PK or if you're like a level 120 and just want to do some rune fights or anything like that ideally the place to go is world 324 or 25 whatever the pvp world is at that time and you know North Grand Exchange is where all those high levels go and believe it or not I only went there once during this video and I did die so that's why that's in this video but I didn't really stay there too long more of a fan of the wilderness than anything pvp's always been great don't get me wrong but the wilderness is just old school you know it's the thing that came before everything else so I've always just preferred being in the wild than being in PvP worlds and there were a few occasions where I would deathmatch my opponent you know whenever I was peaking near the rep caves there's always an escape you know you can always kind of go in and out of the cave and then eventually log out when you get the upper hand however if I was fighting someone who wasn't safing who wasn't you know flaming or ragging me usually I always just stay in DM I mean honestly it's not that much to lose and I guess people do appreciate that so not all the time would I just teleport or run out and here in this clip I was sharing my love and passion for frosted flakes you know kind of hoping for that Tony the Tiger orangey but it went to the other guy not me so yeah we did take the L there tell you what man that our middle godsword speck really works both ways and this next clip represents a suicide mission you know teleporting directly up to center gdz and this was an example of when I definitely could have logged out as you guys saw there was a split half second where I could have touched that logout button uh but you know I decided the numbers weren't too bad you know one versus seven and I was a quick fight to my surprise I did not win but you know [ __ ] happens and here's another example of when I should have lost another pair of dragon claws but somehow someway we did a get that prayer in at the right time and his hit was not high enough so he did save our second pair of claws but don't worry the next plus-one lost will be shown very soon and I gotta say - this next clip coming up what an idea I mean I would have never thought that I would lose a plus-one in this form but essentially let me give you the backstory before we show the clip here so there was someone outside of the revenant caves with a slayer helm on and I kind of thought it would be a good idea to attack them you know PBM er who's not expecting anything so you know he started attacking them I had an anchor with me had dragon claws was pretty optimistic about the kill and they were just slowly walking down the wilderness you know about to teleport so I figured alright I'll just chase them and we'll see what happens now it is important to note that I was live-streaming this so all of my attention wasn't just on the runescape screen you know I was reading a twitch ad I was listening to the music out doing all sorts of things you know making up all these excuses and yeah it definitely backfired so here's the clip enjoy essentially I was attacking this girl and she just kind of stands and Spa and I'm thinking all right you know she's probably just lagging or something and all of a sudden somebody logs in on top of her not too sure what to think at this point but I still stay on and little did I know the guy who was logged in on top of her had max strength and Ferno cape with Dragon Claw spec ready to go with smite on and yeah we lost our second pair of dragon claws because of that you know I would like to think that those pair of dragon claws that were sacrificed and honour of this video will help someone else out you know if you're killing someone and things are going pretty good and it seems too good to be true most of the time it is so just be cautious keep that prayer up no matter what and if you're ever in a situation where you're you're just getting Specht out and your prayers lower than your HP is just make sure you sip on that prayer pot because it's always worth it to save the bigger item then save yourself you know a couple hundred kay what's that compared to something that's worth so much more I don't know what was going on in this clip I have honestly no idea there's a guy doing some wilderness Slayer and some other guys peeking and annacarl with dragon long swords and cooking capes and all sorts of stuff always nice to see people just chilling and having fun really had numerous close calls throughout this video you know a lot of these deaths my opponent is always below 20 HP and it's just a you know simple risk that I have to take especially on these da chores you know sitting at 2 HP on like three ticks there and still just going for that hero spec sometimes it would come in but a lot of the time due to the lack of strength bonus it wouldn't and you know I would actually get killed by ringer recoils as well I mean there was all sorts of types of deaths during this video and if you happen to remember that guy from earlier I believe his username was monkeys who took my dragon claws well actually saw him again in level 44 and he reminded me of this but sadly he killed me right after he reminded me of that so yeah shoutout to monkeys I guess third time's the charm for that fight so uh maybe I'll see him in the future now other than losing plus ones we did lose a total of about 25 Dragon defenders throughout this video that was just because I would always be past 20 or 30 wilderness anytime I would be using a DDS as a speck WEP so I would lose you know the defenders but that would save me from losing a more valuable +1 oh there would also be a few occasions where I would run into a team and I was peeking with staff of the deads lot throughout the later part of this video and I would use the staff of the dead special attack and it would almost save my life a few times but even with the staff of the Dead you know invincibility special attack ten ballistas is still ten ballistas and it definitely can take you down and in that clip there when I was tibi than out of food and died by that small team go figure the guy who killed me was actually one of the guys who won a Deadman mode one year and his name was mayn't so yeah shout out to him did actually encounter I'm pretty sure just him and spark Mac during this video as it goes for like content creators youtubers live streamers whatever would be cool to run into some more familiar names you know I haven't really seen anyone mainstream in the wild for quite some time believe I saw Tor Vesta three years ago saucy engineer two years ago especially spark Mac on a daily basis but yeah you know I'd like to get more involved with some maybe potential future videos of you know teaming up with different youtubers or maybe just fighting them or something like that definitely wouldn't hurt to have a team especially for a video like this but in general you know I've only ever been a part of one pecan clan as an old smiting clan many many months ago close to over a year ago and the name of it was BA they're still around today go by a different name but yeah that's one thing that I've never really considered is to join a pecan clan I definitely would love to but I just feel like there's too many commitments you know so that's kind of been something that's always been in the way however I think you know clan videos is something you don't see really too much of and I'm not too sure why I'm maybe it's just not the most entertaining thing to put on YouTube but I think it would be interesting to kind of see you know clan vs. clan fights it's one part of the community that I've almost never been involved in so yeah alright let's take a break from all this insane rambling and show you guys the next plus one that was lost you know I was having a great fight with this noob who was at Benin Addis I mean this guy was wearing mystic gloves and as you can see almost had a few close calls of just killing him happened three times in a row pretty much where he was almost dead and if I just would have hit a few little hits higher he would have been gone however he was just standing there and of course I was just not paying attention to what was underneath him and yeah the same exact thing happened from earlier and I died by a Dragon Claw spec now here's the upside the upside is I didn't lose dragon claws but I did lose a toxic staff of the dead and the only major arena to max cape that I had on this account and if he just missed it in the clip right after we did lose a zgs as well so that was near Callisto that time but yeah you know I didn't really mind risking a toxic staff of the Dead because it was just so Opie to bring with me and it helped out so much it definitely was a huge loss every single time we did die with it and being in these multi locations risking like an automatic 15 mil because I would be stacked with the occult necklace as well as the tomah fire in the toxic staff of the Dead and usually my special attack weapon would be either claws or an Aes so it was always a risk I always knew that a clan or a team could log in any second but you know it's just all about pk it's all about the video and some things just got a risk now this next clip here goes pretty fast but this was again another toxic staff of the dead loss right here as you can see I was risking an 8 GS and a toxic staff and I just got cloth SPECT right out of my shoes so yeah did lose a second toxic staff of the Dead there and if you ever curious as to you know why I was killing so many PBM errs at the later part of the video it's mainly because the situations like that I mean I just couldn't trust myself it can be argued that I was not good enough to go against other PKS especially with a risk like that and I was just kind of choosing my targets a little wiser you know just going for the guys that wouldn't fight back but even if they did fight back I would mostly die and it would definitely cost me a lot so yeah I mean that is why I was killing so many more PB immers than @p cares because anytime I would attack one person around level 30 wild it almost seemed like that one became two and then that two became 10 all in under like 5 seconds so you got to be very cautious you know when you're in deep wild for example in this clip here I was just chilling you know doing a little bit of peeking at black chins this max team I believe their name is wolves just logged in and absolutely dominated me so yeah you always got to be careful when you're just you know a lone PK and even if you're in singles you know as long as you get hit with a half TB or a full TB I mean it's really all just an on and off game of getting you know dark post spec Dragon Claw SPECT armadale God's heart spec it really just doesn't end you know now something else that I should have improved on especially later on in the video was that I should have been bringing more saradomin brews and especially more superest every single time I would go in deep wild and it doesn't even really have to be deep wild it's just being 126 combat you know even if you're fighting one person let alone a whole team I'm gonna be getting dealt a lot of damage and bruise really extend that fight and can honestly just save your life especially if your tea bead by a team or something like that personally I don't really PK a lot with saradomin Bruce just because I don't know I'm just different you know I've never enjoyed sippin brews and not having my stats up I've always like always enjoyed being potted the whole time during a fight brews were never for me but I will say if you are high combat definitely don't be shy from bringing them because they can help you out dramatically also shout out to this team AC also known as air conditioning here they're a great pecan clan I did teleport up to multi a few times and calah SPECT them and this clip was hilarious this chick had an inferno cape and I managed to get the double kill there okay now for the next plus-one loss this is toxic staff of the Dead number 3 I believe so in this clip I was pretty much teleporting out of the obelisk because I had no food and I was risking a ton and as you can see that last ballista hit did hit a 22 and I was risking HGS and toxic staff and I did lose the toxic staff of the Dead by probably the biggest group of noobs that I've ever seen in my life but it was a fair fight so a good fight as you can see in this clip here I did lose a Toma fire seers ring as well as an O cult but I didn't lose a plus-one that was worth a ton of money so that was good and for the next plus-one loss another toxic staff of the Dead the story behind this one was I was peeking south of Annan Addis and all of a sudden a three-man team logged in honestly I wasn't even worried because I was about eight steps away from singles and I was tanking very well as you guys can see here didn't even think it was necessary to do a staff of the Dead spec even though I should have because it probably would have made all the difference however I got stacked out by two ballistas and I did lose another toxic staff of the Dead so that was very upsetting because I think I'd lost two in one day at that point so I was really salty and I just didn't think that ballistas should be hitting that high and I've always been against ballistas so yeah I had a little salty moment there but it is what it is and that is one of the last + ones that we did lose during this video and it is important to note that we almost did lose in Armadale godsword but as shown in my previous upload and through it in this video as well and there was a clip there where I dropped it on the ground just milliseconds before I would have lost it and my friend did save it now when we get to the very end of the video because I'm voice over it right now and I actually still see there's multiple plus ones that are still to come that I lost I will be calculating all of the losses and pretty much give you guys a very good thought-out price check simply just talking about the amount of money that we lost during this video not so much about like it was last video how much we made but yeah I mean there really isn't a loot tab to show as you guys can imagine because it's just a really big death compliation for 20 minutes now but yeah you can kind of see throughout all these clips and throughout that number kind of adding up over time that these deaths did cost something never you know underestimate someone just because they're using red D hide and split bark everything is a risk it really is and everything adds up over time you got to always factor in other things as well such as food runes potions arrows things like that and there's another DEATH where this time we lost a fury in a sears ring but we did keep the toxic staph the next death after that was a full D H set that was the only D H set that I did lose during this video that's pretty obvious by now that I'm not good at D H P Kang so yeah only tried that once and it did not work to my surprise now this next death here I was very close to escaping but unfortunately I just could not tank enough I only had it run down maybe five more feet and I did die I did lose another oak Colt there and no another Toma fire those deaths right there are about three mil - burnt pages and all of the runes as well as everything else I'm risking it really does add up there those deaths really aren't as bad as the plus ones but they do add up you know over time especially when you die multiple times for multiple sets of gear like that overall though I will say no matter how many times I died no matter how many plus ones I lost and you know no matter how upset or mad I would be at the time it was all worth it you know I've made all of this money that I lost in this video from this loot series you know none of this money was made staking it was all made from killing a ton of different monsters a ton of different times and yeah man I kind of came into this knowing that I would lose money so I really didn't care too much and overall I had a great time and I think this is not my best video yet but definitely one of my best videos yet as a for loot from 1,000 players so as all these clips do finish up here and you kind of just see my character fall down again and again I just will say that there is another toxic staff of the Dead that we did lose almost getting away we were one step away from teleporting but we did lose it south of Qin's and of course we did lose another staff of the Dead as well as an oak cult and Tomah fire pretty much near vetti on I just got stuck with a clan and I did lose that again so you know you can kind of tell we did lose a lot of money towards the end of the video but that was to be expected and now we have to add up overall how much we lost all the plus ones and all the supplies so let's go ahead and do that and let's see just how much money we lost from killing 1,000 players okay so overall we lost two dragon claws to Zam rock cod swords 6oh Colts six tomes of fire one fury one elder maul and six toxic staff of the deads and if you were to add up all of those items the overall loss of just that would be 251 mil approximately and just in the normal gear of the 180 deaths that we did go through all the barrows gloves the rune the split bark that adds up to be about 54 mil and then all the potions all the runes all the supplies the bolts the food you know how much did that all come out to be just about another 30 mil so overall we add 250 mil to 54 mil and we're at 304 and then we add the 30 to that and we are at an overall loss of 334 mil you guys saw all of that I think I only missed the elder maul clip and one zgs clip but for the most part we did show all of the losses during this video now we all know just how much money this cost to make and overall like I said before it was a great experience and I look forward to making back all of that money with my newest upcoming video loot from 1004 calf with all that being said I hope you all enjoyed the video thank you very much for watching all of it I know it was a long ramble you guys are the best and I will see you guys in about a week with a new video and until then mr. no sleep
