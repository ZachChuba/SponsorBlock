hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with no need country-bred that's right this delicious and gorgeous loaf
is part bread recipe part science experiments in part fun family project
when you're all stuck in the house together looking for things to do and
while this procedure is very simple it does take about 24 hours to do start to
finish so if want this today make sure start it yesterday and what
we'll want to do first is add some flour to a large mixing bowl and I'm going to
be using two kinds okay I'm gonna start with some bread flour
although regular all-purpose flour will work and then I'm also gonna add a
little bit of whole wheat flour which in my case is gonna be some sprouted spelt
flour which is by far my favorite whole-grain flour to bake with and then
to our flours we will add a little bit of dry active yeast and I mean a little
bit okay a no need bread recipe only needs about a quarter teaspoon of yeast
and since apparently there's a big yeast shortage going on that is some good news
and then what we'll do is give that a quick stir with a wooden spoon before we
stir in two cups of cold water and I know we usually use warm water when we
make bread but with this because we're gonna let it rise for such a long time
some cold fresh water from the tap actually works out better and what we
want to do here is stir this with the wooden spoon for about three minutes
until a very wet extremely sticky dough forms and then once that's been
accomplished we'll go ahead and add the last ingredient which will be some
kosher salt or sea salt or any salt that doesn't have any additives and that's it
we'll go ahead and give that another stir for another two minutes or so
at which point believe it or not our dough will be done and by the way
there's actually two reasons we don't have to knead this first of all we can't
right this is way too wet and sticky to work with our hands and then secondly we
don't have to rely on needing to build gluten because when let a dough
ferment and rise for a very long time it actually develops gluten all on its own
which is nice but anyway what we'll do once our salts been mixed in is simply
wrap this in foil and let it sit out at room temp for about 18 hours alright
give or take which is why I generally like to start this in the afternoon
sometime so we can bake it up sometime in the afternoon the next day
so like I said we'll go ahead and cover that and let it sit for 18 hours at
which point if everything's gone according to plan it should look
something like this oh yeah that is looking good and very bubbly but more
like a scientific experiment than a bread dough but that's okay because just
watch and at this point we'll go ahead and take a spatula and we will deflate
this by scraping down the sides after which we'll kind of slide our spatula
underneath and fold the dough over the top of itself like this okay sort of
turning the bowl like this as we go and besides deflating and degassing the
dough we're also giving all that gluten that developed a nice stretch and that's
it once we've done that about a dozen times or so we will go ahead and scrape
this extremely soft and sticky dough onto a well floured surface okay be very
generous with the flour and we will also want to sprinkle some over the top and
it might look like we have a little too much on the table but we're gonna use a
lot of that on our hands as we do the next step which is somehow someway form
this into a loaf shape and initially we're just sort of slapping it back and
forth trying to get it to release from the table and then once it does we'll
use a combination of rolling and folding and turning and tucking until we have
the dough formed into some kind of uniform shape and while you're doing
this make sure keep your hands well floured and by the way the shape does
not matter right it could be round it could be oval but what does matter I see
end up with a nice smooth skin over the surface and really once achieve
that should just stop which is not easy because this feels really really
good right you'll see and then what we'll do once we are happy with our
shape and we have a nice smooth surface is transfer this onto a Silpat lined
baking sheet or if don't have one of those can sprinkle down a whole
bunch of cornmeal and once our dough is Panda up we can do a little fine-tuning
but not too much all right we want to make sure this looks homemade and in
fact that's why we call a country bread so that it doesn't really matter what it
looks like okay US country folks just want to eat some bread we're not trying
to impress anyone with a perfect loaf that's what French bakeries in the city
are for but anyway once we formed our loaf and it's on a pan what we'll do is
let this rest somewhere uncovered for two hours or until it doubles in size
and personally my favorite spot would be inside it turned off oven but no matter
where leave yours about two hours later it should look something like this
and it will have approximately doubled in size
although because our dough is so wet most of that's gonna happen outward as
opposed to upward and then at this point we will do two things one of which is
optional we will preheat our oven to 450 and then if we want we will make one
slash down the center with a very very very sharp knife or a razor and
sometimes I do this and sometimes I don't it depends on my mood so I'll let
decide I mean are after all the Steve Nash
of whether it is slash man I miss basketball and by the way the main
reason for the slash is simply to prevent random ruptures in the crust in
other spots all right so it's really just an appearance thing and then before
this goes in the oven if have a spray bottle I like to give the dough a
light misting with water which is gonna help it develop an even more beautiful
crust but that is also optional and it's gonna look great even if we don't do
this and that's it our pan is now ready to transfer into the center of a 450
degree oven for about 30 minutes or until beautifully browned and looking
like this oh yeah that does look like it came from some artisan bakery but it
didn't made that can always test this with a thermometer but the
old-school way to tell if this is done is by giving it the old tap a tap and if it sounds like that it's probably
done all right it will have a nice hollow sound and that's it all we have
to do is transfer that onto a rack to cool and cool completely okay if you
slice into really hot bread you're gonna lose moisture and it's gonna dry out
although off the record if it's still a little bit warm can probably get
away with it and fair warning as this cools it's gonna contract and it's gonna
get bumpy but that's okay because those bumps are from bubbles and it's the
bubbles that make the bread as you'll see here as I slice in and that was
looking just about perfect in fact let me go to a tighter shot so can see
and even though it takes many many hours by using this no-knead method with such
a wet dough the texture you're gonna get here is just incredible okay that
outside is going to feature the perfect amount of crustiness and the inside will
be wonderfully light with just the right amount of chewiness and yeah spreading
on some butter is highly recommended so I finished that end piece and cut
another slice and of course you're not supposed to slice on your marble slab
with your nice serrated knife a lot since the bread is the same color as my
wooden cutting board it just doesn't look as good so I took one for the team
and not only does this super easy no need technique produce a great texture
but in general breads that have a long fermentation time always seem to have a
better flavor oh and I should mention if this looks familiar
give or take a little bit of olive oil and a slightly different technique this
is pretty much the same as our ciabatta bread in fact if shape this into a
rectangle that's what can call it but anyway for a little bit of dessert
I'm gonna spread some jam on this last piece and as I ate that I couldn't help
but wonder about all the people that have no idea just how simple it is to
make bread I mean it's just mixing up some water and flour with a little bit
of yeast and a touch of salt and then a day later with a very small amount of
effort have this which is why I really do hope give this a try soon
and also share this with those people I was just referring to so please follow
the links below for the ingredient amounts a principle written recipe and
much more info as usual and as always enjoy
