what are these people inhaling and why is it making their voices sound so deep what would happen if this stuff was in our atmosphere this is what if and here's what would happen if the atmosphere was 10% deep voice gasps sulfur hexafluoride now that's a mouthful you choose it's more commonly known as sf6 or deep voice gasps because but sulfur hexafluoride isn't just an expensive party trick it's an extremely potent greenhouse gas that's five times heavier than air its density explains why your voice drops if you breathe it in but inhale too much of it and it won't just be your voice that gets deeper sulfur hexafluoride is a non-toxic gas but if it were to suddenly comprise 10 percent of our atmosphere we croak not literally for the most part our atmosphere is made up of 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen humans need an atmosphere that's roughly 19 and a half percent oxygen to breathe normally so if we were to replace 10 percent of the oxygen in our atmosphere with sulfur hexafluoride we'd be left with an oxygen level of 18.9% which is actually still enough for us to live but here's the problem because sf6 is five times heavier than air when you breathe it in it compresses the lighter oxygen in your lungs this in turn reduces the amount of oxygen making it into your bloodstream which means you'll eventually pass out falling prey to asphyxiation our planet wouldn't fare much better sulfur hexafluoride has a global warming that's approximately twenty two thousand two hundred times greater than carbon dioxide over a 100 year period and it can live in our atmosphere for as many as 3,200 years and yet it's often used as an electrical insulator in components that are susceptible to leaks in fact studies show that 15% of equipment containing sf6 will develop leaks and for a little context just one kilogram of sf6 has the same warming effect as 24 people flying from London to New York and back again but despite the danger the number of components using sf6 is expected to increase 75% globally by 2030 [Music] fortunately our atmosphere will never have 10% sf6 living in that kind of world would require a complete redesign of our lungs and a major leap and evolution but life on Earth has gone through unbelievably fortunate turns of faith evolution has given us eyes arms and intelligence and has overcome the danger of near extinction so it's not impossible that life wouldn't adapt to such a drastic change that's something promo code what if during the signup process come to think of it there is one creature that could possibly survive in an atmosphere that's ten percent deep voice gasps that's the mighty eight-legged tardigrade these near microscopic critters can live in ridiculous extremes including being able to survive supernova blasts and gamma-ray bursts but what are the odds of one of those happening anytime soon well that's a story for another what-if [Music]
