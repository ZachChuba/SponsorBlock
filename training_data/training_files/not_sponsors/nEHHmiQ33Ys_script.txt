this is a cooking show and something that I frequently employ is a reason to culinarily educate yourself is the cash stop petting $13 at a brunch spot no smoothie needs to be pre-portioned and shipped to our doors now look at how much walnut oil costs the recipes are all posted online for free personal finance is a notoriously scary topic and I'm no expert there's an undecipherable cryptic tome of jargon that knocks you back to the starting line every time you try to start learning and it keeps the big bucks behind a barrier of entry so hopelessly insurmountable most Americans give up and try again in their 40s when they're older wiser and significantly further behind and you could be but what gives the YouTube home ech kitchen Nancy the idea that he can use his soapbox to talk about money like the big boys well like it or not money just like food is indivisible from culture society class behavioral science and the human experience in its entirety it's all incredibly loaded and not worth getting into right now when there's knowledge to share so I'll spare you the headache here's the only step one that you need stop spending the majority of money that you make and save it instead you'll get into 401ks IRAs and TNA's later on when you are a pro and you have time to master at all but most of us are young and dumb and shout it at day in and day out that buying things solves our problems and boy oh boy do we have problems almost all of my viewers are under 35 that means if I generalize you probably spend almost half of your food dollars eating out at restaurants and bars but if you open a Roth IRA right now and max it out with your brunch money every year you're just about guaranteed to be a millionaire before you get your first gray hair laugh all you want at the guy who said that avocado toast is pricing you out of home ownership but making memes about I'm supposed to have how much saved by 35 isn't going to put your kid through college or pay for your funeral so don't be surprised from the beyond when jr. spits on your grade at the end of his eulogy for you our boomer elders that still seem to think that hard work is the key to success and it turns out yes they are technically right but what we seem to get wrong is thinking that hard work means staying up late rise and grinding for this bread and hashtag adulting yourself into a bowels [ __ ] purposely misspelled cuz you still like to have fun with it by and large we're not breaking our backs and the salt mines anymore the extent of our hard work is as easy as rejecting convenience rejecting the convenience of Alexa order a Vitamix Pro 750 at whatever price you think is fair rejecting a convenience of I sure could use a subscription box full of hot sauce samples every month and rejecting the convenience of I work hard to afford these $16 eggs benedict and by god I deserve it once you learn how to cook better than a neighborhood bar & grill and I bet you're gonna be pretty surprised at how low of a bar that can really be you'll be proficient in a skill that's going to make you healthier happier and way more fun at potlucks so smash that [ __ ] subscribe button and i'll do my best to get you more comfortable and confident in your kitchen now stop watching YouTube and get back to work
