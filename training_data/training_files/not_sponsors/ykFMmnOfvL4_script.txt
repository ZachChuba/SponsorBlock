Dude, so, seriously, was
that one of the best moments in Modern Rogue history? >> Now, that I've distracted you, did you notice that I might
have taken your wallet? >> No! >> And then, when you go to look for it, he pulls his hand right out. >> Okay, so you get the proof
that you can steal watches. [Jason laughs]
>> You explain, oh, oh you actually thought
he had taken the, oh. >> This is not my wallet. >> I know, this is. [Jason laughs]
[Brian claps] >> Literally one of my favorite moments. I was blown away, terrified of you because I was watching for
it and you did it anyway. >> By the way we're back
again with James Harrison, pickpocket extraordinaire. >> All right so, in the wild, how do people steal
wallets and cellphones? >> It's what is called an
opportunistic skill, okay? I'm not going to go after someone who has like a big fat chain on a wallet that's about all the way
down into the pocket. I'm looking for opportunities. That's phones sticking out of pockets, wallets that are not pushed in all the way and I take advantage of that opportunity. >> So this goes back to what we learned on the last episode about casing the joy, making sure you sort of have laser vision for different targets. >> I am very, very
ashamed to admit how often I look at men's butts. [Brian laughs] >> That's why I have dad pants, I carry everything in my front pockets because I'm paranoid about
losing my wallet or phone, or getting pick pocketed. >> Here's a question I'm afraid to ask. I perceive that front
pockets are not pickable and that's why I always
have stuff at the front but I'm afraid that he's going to tell me that they're very pickable.
>> Yes. >> I'm going to start
using the bulging pocket. Prison wallet.
>> [laughs] Also pickable. >> Where are my gloves? >> What are the different techniques for front versus back pockets? >> For front versus back
if I'm going in the front, I need to be able to access this and if I'm going to use Jason for this, I'm going to literally ask him
to help me out and move stuff so I can get in there. If I'm going to do it where
he's not seeing the stuff, my favorite distraction
is asking for help. >> How so?
>> Is that your phone? >> No, it's mine, sorry. >> [laughs] I was like, he did it again! >> I almost said, "No, is it yours?" >> Under the pretense of
being a wayful tourist that needs help, I'm going to
ask Jason to hold on to this and maybe show me on the
map where I need to go. >> Okay. >> Now his hands are my distraction. >> Right. >> And I can just easily lift
this up while he's doing-- >> Oh my god, you know what else happens? Is if you're asking for direction,
you have an excuse to go from this, to, "Okay, yes." Now we're both looking
at a thing together. >> I can get right in his bubble. I've given up my power and he's in charge. >> Again, you've made me a
Confederate, I'm helping you. >> Exactly, and I betray that
trust by robbing you blind. [Jason laughs] >> So at this point you're looking at it and you're just what, you
just slowly pick it up? >> Yeah, he's doing everything
here, I'm putting this hand, like I'm trying to get
as much attention here, and under that guise I'm
literally just moving things out of the way. Once I'm ready to go, I can push him, I find that the pocket's a little tight so I need a little extra oomph. >> Right. >> For him not to feel it,
so I'm just going to go, "Oh, what about this here?" and as I'm pushing him. >> And now you've got two
fingers one on each side. >> I'm putting two fingers
literally onto the phone. >> Okay.
>> Okay? And when I am ready, this is
where you're going to create imaginary characters because
Dad pants have one very good thing and that's making
sure everything is tight. So me just yanking on this
is not the greatest thing. >> Right. >> But what I can do is I
can make an imaginary friend come along and push me. >> What do you mean, oh, oh, oh! >> Is Scooby Doo going to steal my wallet? >> No, [laughs]. >> I think he means, he means feigned that you've been bumped into. >> Oh!
>> Like one outside. Someone is walking by or
whatever and it's like, "Is that Trump Tower? "Because I've always wanted to go there." and then "Ooh, I am so sorry, sir!" And then under that guise. >> Did you feel it? >> I just slide it right out.
>> I wouldn't have noticed. >> That's great! >> I did feel it because I
was paying attention to it of course, but it would have worked. >> Yeah, wow! >> I have no doubt about that. So, again, it's finesse over speed. >> Yeah, if I go too fast, our
eyes are designed to pick up fast moving objects for us to survive. If I reach in and I do
something very, very fast, then you're going to notice,
and you're going to be like, "What is going on?" >> So it seems like there are four stages, first make him a Confederate, then pierce the bubble
of their comfort zone. Then work your way into position, so once you've got the clamp on and then invent the
distraction for the extraction. >> Exactly, you've got it down to a T. >> Is it all just the
same on the back pocket? >> Yes and no, you're doing
a different technique, mainly because you're dealing
with a more sensitive area. >> And I guess also, you
wouldn't be using this particular way to make a Confederate
or pierce the bubble. >> You can, but I'm going
to share with you guys something more along the
lines of what you have to worry about which is not
knowing they were there in the first place. >> Okay, what does that mean? >> You're never going to see me. >> Got it. >> In this particular scenario. >> Okay, so. >> So when I'm behind you here, >> Yeah. >> If you're standing
in line, me lifting this isn't a big deal especially
if the line is long. >> I literally didn't feel anything. >> Yeah, all I'm doing is
making sure there's enough space for me to reach in here. Now the one thing that
is going to be the same is I'm still using two fingers
to go into this pocket. [Brian laughs] Okay, I know it feels great
doesn't it, when you know? >> No, actually I barely feel anything, I don't even know that I would notice. >> Now, what's going to happen is, is I'm going to create a little V, an upside down V, for your little wallet to fall into my fingers. >> Okay. >> And what I mean by fall is
that I'm going to go like this. My knee is going to come up and
I'm going to bump your butt. >> Oh man, I could, in a subway situation, I wouldn't find anything
suspicious about that. >> I'm just going to
bump your butt like so and my fingers will grab it. And then I've noticed that it's snug, so I'm just going to just do it again. I'm going to bump you again, boomp, and then it comes out again. >> And I'd be like, "Excuse me, sir." >> Exactly and then in that case-- >> So their turn actually
becomes the distraction for the extraction point. >> Not only a distraction,
but allows it to move and come out of a tighter pocket. >> Again, I'm co-operating! >> Oh! >> I'm the Confederate because I'm turning and doing the thing
and then at that point, you're just like, "Oh, I'm so sorry." Holding the wallet.
>> "I'm so sorry." And then this is the best
part, is that I never hold. I never have anything that I've stolen. That's what my friend is for. >> Dude you just hand it
off to, all right [laughs]! >> So if you see my face,
if you call the cops because your stuff is missing, I'm not-- >> That they could check you head to toe.
>> I'm good to go. I'm ready to do my thing. >> That's awesome, gimme
my wallet [laughs]! Again I guess the take
aways are just be aware of your personal space,
constantly be asking why. "Why are they asking me for this?" And wait for that little tickle
in the back of your brain that says, "Something weird's happening." >> Trust your instincts,
that's the main thing. >> I think this is one where
anytime your personal space is invaded, be on guard. >> Oh, of course. Now, one thing I will say though, is that, if your personal space is being affected and you're a tourist and
everything like that, sometimes if you notice this is happening. It might be better to just let it happen. >> Oh. >> Because you don't want
to find something inside-- >> Yeah, there's more than
one way to get that wallet. >> Exactly. >> And I guess there are
pickpocket resistant wallets out there. >> There are. >> There are better
places to put your wallet. Oh I did hear, tell me is this true? I heard that sometime people
will do the obvious clumsy bumping into you move for the
express purpose of watching where people check afterwards. After they've been bumped
into, they immediately verify where their wallet is. >> Oh.
>> Absolutely, absolutely. When you go on vacation and
you go check out Europe, you will see signs that say, "Warning, beware of pickpockets." they weren't put there by the police. >> Oh wow! >> Because as soon as you see that sign. >> You watch somebody watching the thing and then they adjust, that's brilliant! >> Again, you're making
them do the work for you. >> Exactly. >> All right, well I
hope you enjoyed your one and only appearance on this show [laughs]. >> Yeah, go back to Canada! I know they're all thieves
up there, I liked Canada! >> Why do you think we're so nice? >> Oh. >> They're constantly apologizing
because they've stolen your wallet! [James and Jason laugh] Hey, where can people see so
much of your amazing content? >> Again, PickPocketMagic.com >> Dude, Thank you so much
James, that was a total blast, that was pure magic. >> Oh and if you ever want to contact me, my card's in your back pocket. >> Gives me this, this--
[Jason laughs] >> This is not my wallet! >> I know this is. [Jason laughs]
[Brian claps] >> That moment with your
reaction, I am ashamed to admit, that you clearly instantly
realized what had happened and it took me like two,
three minutes to realize. I was thinking like,
"Wow, that's really good, "that he was able to
make that substitution "while teaching us all this stuff." And then like an idiot I
remembered before the cameras start rolling, because we knew he
was a pickpocket and we know that we're shooting the
episode, it's not weird at all for him to say, "Hey, can I just make sure "that your wallet's the type of wallet "that will work for this?" "Oh great and if you
don't mind me positioning "that in there?" He never, he never put,
he never put it back! >> No, I handed him my wallet
and then he put duck tape If you are one of our
beautiful bosses over at patreon.com/modernrogue Guess what, you get a
special bonus featurette where you learn how to do the tricky class that was on Jason's watch. >> And there are too
many other things for us to even bother listing right now. >> Dude, behind the scenes footage. >> The monthly wrap up. >> Oh live streams, you
get to watch us record. >> We've got-- >> Early access to outtakes! We're out of time, we're out of--
