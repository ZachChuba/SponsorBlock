every one em tests here and this is gonna be the first time I've used sun shot in the new meta in the new update with the change recoil with the increased magazine size and my brand new catalyst that I ended up grinding for right before the DLC Sun shot has it hasn't been great for a long time with only 8 shots in the magazine it struggled and when they returned with the catalyst all of a sudden it could be good but that magazine size always held it back well now we've got the magazine we've got the catalyst and Sun shot we gotta test this bad boy to see if it's gonna be a top 2 your pick now the explosive rounds that it shoots out they actually don't really have damage fall-off so it it further extends the range of this so it might actually be pretty damn good in the new update so let's jump into the content let's jump see half the damage is explosive so half the damage being explosive means that there's no damage fall-off on that damage missed I gotta get used to it but pop it off brothers okay triple down triple down the thing is is when you shoot them and they explode they do like a lot of AoE so for something like control this could actually be pretty good you're dead you're dead baby nearly guys weak couldn't save him you tried to riff and what a good teammate wasn't enough it wasn't enough roh-roh okay come on the shots I miss a shot he just whoa look at this guy's connection what what was that bro dude I weakened our guys so much the explosion come on let me get one of you guys dude watch explosion yeah then we're cool it's enough I'm feeling it I'm feeling it dude it's got some range it has got some range on it I gotta try one more dude if you're using another hand Canada that that range you'd be hitting like tens I'm serious Oh Cowabunga boys this is nice this is nice feeling it feeling good I'm feeling I'm feeling lit whoa dude you get your little hand cannon out of here you got no chance yeah I'm dead there's a point of the game to the skull um that explosive damage is like the no damage fall-off makes it feel like this has double the range in some cases what what no no no it's alright hey that guy went down before I could shoot him I'm gonna use that recoil I got used to recoil it it bounces a lot like that's the only thing I'll say is is the like it's just very hard to pick out the reticle and everything I don't know maybe the other ornament is better I'm gonna try the other one man I'm gonna just see um default ornament let's just try it and see it's a little bit better cuz that one is hard to see I'm struggling with it god I can't get into a duel with this thing I mean it's not that big a deal but it's gonna be good got my fast reload taking out a scout rifle boys got him damn this is actually pretty good for how like I don't know I guess maybe it's not accessible to everyone I don't know what the changes are a new life but I'm guessing everyone has a son shot I don't know if everyone has the catalyst following us tonight let's go quick oh you're lucky you would have gotten barrassed all right going back to it we're flying we're gonna catch him what I did one damage come in here come on you kidding me I got a two-for-one Michael Michael please land your shots my god Oh baby I'm telling you though sons your medic was your mark oh um like no meme son shot with explosive rounds Oh Pete you'd do just crushes at a distance come on I believe damnit okay well jumping into a rumble game late against some sweaty sweaty boys this will be the ultimate test if I can do like I don't care if I win oh [ __ ] I'm already get me a little bit of just give me a little bit of Hope here hey that's fine I don't one he wasn't paying attention but I still got one what did you just shoot me with for one bullet what the hell okay nice yeah if I would have got that melee off I would've got my health back too bad I would've got my overshield I could have maybe continued on with the push why you snapped on that guy's snapper damn it I snapped on his snapper and it just don't matter [Applause] I gotta turn on my ultimate power Hey look at that and I start with three shots left I love it I'm not taking that one nice try sister nice try you little little hunter you think I'm gonna fall for that no chance hey but can I win this duel what can I win this one ah come on I believe I just need one more second come on just one more second come on no I just needed another second for my bubble chest okay well there's a run from me ah all right uh it was fine it it did okay let's talk about it I mean I kind of got [ __ ] on I didn't play great I didn't play great but it's not the guns fault I think it's just I got mountain topped and recluse tanned I honestly think if I'm being 100 with you it is a good gun visually it can be frustrating at times but it is a good gun the range on it for a 150 is very very good the explosive shot on it is very very good the potential to get some AoE damage and things like 6v6 awesome as well and when you put on other pieces together in the puzzle I think that SunShot is a good gun now if you're comparing it to other and cannons like this you have a competing one called the thorn and the thorn is gonna be similar because there's no damage fall-off on the tick damage right so that's always gonna be valuable and so between the two I think thorn is gonna be stronger but between this and many other hand cannons in the game currently I think that this is a very very good gun there's a lot of damage fall-off issues with hand cannons now that they've changed things and if you're outside that range you get punished hard and it takes like seven shots to kill someone well if you're outside of the range with Sun shot you're only usually extending it by like one or two little shots because that explosive damage is always the full amount I think that this could be a meta weapon I don't know until I see some sweat players using it like some top top to your guys you know I don't know for sure but the Sun shot is way better than it used to be thanks for watching hopefully you enjoyed and I'll see you soon my friends bye bye
