so I was on set for the second season of Comedy Central's corporate and usually when I'm working I like to read during my downtime set the little annoying overachiever inside of me is like I'm gettin paid to read I'm gonna pay to learn it's just like college just without accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and a flailing job market economy fix your education system America but anyway I like to binge authors or genres and at this time I was binging relationship self-help books shut up don't scroll down to the comments right now and the book I was reading was called how to be an adult in relationships and trust me I know everyone who saw me reading it was like judgment judgment Oh judge man finish her judge judge away you know we never learned how to be in relationship except by actually being in them and you would read a book about surgery before attempting surgery wouldn't you but one of my posters actually saw what I was reading and we bonded over her mutual love of what is that oh yes you guessed it therapy and personal development and she said you know I went to couples therapy years ago with my wife and they gave us really good advice they said if you're ever gonna fight with anyone ask yourself how old do I feel right now it all made sense I mean if you're in therapy you probably know that your therapist always brings it back to your old wounds from childhood right you always roll your eyes because you're so tired of freaking talking about the anxious attachment style you form with your parents but this question really works cuz when I thought about it there are several instances where it's like when I fought with my best friend Kat about feeling left out I felt like I was 13 and my friends had ditched me at the mall when I fought with my partner about being ignored inside I felt like I was like nine years old and struggling for my father's attention against my siblings so whenever I ask myself that question I would always find out what was really going on because I could trace it back to time when I was rejected or bullied his kid then I could just explain those core feelings to her and we would work at him and I thought this was just such great advice you know I mean my brother and I were even talking about how ridiculous it is that were not equipped to deal with relationships I know why don't they teach this [ __ ] in school like there should be classes on how to manage your emotions how to communicate in relationships and just generally how to sort out your stuff I couldn't agree more like we need to remember the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell I couldn't agree more like oh no wait you're doing great you're doing great it's great acting great acting and just generally how to sort out your stuff I couldn't agree more I'll wait no let's always remember them vitac Andreea is the powerhouse of the cell [Music] never forget the nucleus I'm Anna Akana stay right here for an animated ad by Bethany Radloff awesome Gotham what checkout [Music]
