hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with the ultimate garlic peeling trick that's right i've learned a lot of things from martha stewart how to fold napkins how to cover turnip into the shape of rose how to make a shake out of a broken prison toothbrush but if all the things i've learned from her this garlic peeling trick might be the most useful so check this out we're gonna peel an entire head of garlic in like 20 seconds so what you're gonna need for this great technique is a head of garlic and then two metal bowls and it's easier if they're the same size but they really don't have to be as long as you can hold them together like this it's gonna work so step one here we're gonna take our head of garlic we're gonna give it a whack on the cutting board to loosen those clothes which we're gonna toss into one of our bowls and by the way you could just toss everything in including that papery skin i picked a bunch out just for the sake of filming but when you're doing this there's no need to do that just toss everything in and once we have our cloves in the bowl we are ready to commence peeling except we're not peeling or shaking simply cover the bowl of garlic with the second bowl hold them together and shake and after 20 seconds of vigorous shaking you're done that's it I'm not kidding the garlic's peeled check it out and even the ones that don't look peeled and didn't pop right out of the skin those are totally loose the skins loose just grab them with your fingers pull that skin off and remove those from the bowl and you will have like I said about 20 cloves of garlic in 20 seconds and I should add this is a fantastic way to win a bet with your foodie friends bet them like $1,000 or you're gonna peel a head of garlic and when you're done you will average less than 2 seconds per clove oh they will take that bet every time and they'll owe you $1,000 and you'll be so excited you'll find my paypal and send me like 200 of it I'm just kidding unless you're gonna do it so anyway I'm always getting a ton of emails for quick and easy techniques videos so thank you Martha and I think I could speak for both of us when I say we think you're gonna find this garlic technique very appealing so head over to food wishes comm for all the ingredient amounts blass not true there's no ingredients but you know what I mean head over to food wishes comm for more information and as always enjoy you
