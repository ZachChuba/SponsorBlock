hello and welcome to another video so this week I received updates 20 2016 . 2.1 this is rather quickly after I actually posted the video on the speed bag so I will be testing that as well to see whether or not it has been resolved but let's find out what's what in terms of autopilot [Music] so as usual we start with the Hillcrest and on the downward section the lane markings are disappearing and in the previous update the car was really pulling to the left at that point so let's see whether it has improved in this update so here the lane markings disappear yep it's better again so that was a fluke in the previous update and now it pretty much is behaving like before where it goes a little bit to the side but not too much right the infamous s-curve and the regulations still haven't changed so what I would like to see at this point is that the course starts to slow down before the turn so it can make it it has done that before as I mentioned in previous updates but we'll see yep it is slowing down oh yes okay it is rather slow and still going to the outside but it is completely slowing down on its own again after several months of not doing that anymore so thank you Tesla this made this section a lot safer again right so let's test the on-ramp so I need to confirm Lynch's oh it is slowing down for this turn as well okay in some of the previous updates it was almost missing to turn there as well but and unfortunately the blinking continues even after being on that Lane okay double exit taking so this is the first one let's see if it takes the second one adjusted the route so it should in the previous update it seemed like it was Becky but I didn't test it on this section because I didn't need to take that exit now let's see it's still continues on navigate on autopilot it is rather abruptly taking this exit let's see yeah so it is going until halfway through the exit here so not entirely up until the traffic lights but yeah that side roads it's still highway but somehow that was not classified as highway in several previous updates and now it's back again so that's good as well now let's see what it does with the weaving or moving out of the center of the lane when you're passing a truck so here we have a truck and let's see what the core does will it go straight down or move to the sides no it is moving to the side again and now it's moving back so it's a lot quicker in moving back but again if you have multiple trucks then that's that's a problem because then the course was going left right left right and it's uncomfortable in that situation now here again let's move to the sides oh that's a nice thing to test here what if I go back to the secondly so initiating moving moving up cancelling canceling moving canceling Wow Oh and now it got into the timeout oh okay so the Tesla is detecting the truck in the second lane while it is not and therefore it cancels and now because I had two trucks it cancelled several times and then we got a timeout because of the UN ECE regulations that's still a huge bug that definitely needs to be fixed right here we have the exit where in the previous update the corn was attempting to take the second exit again so let's see if that has improved because back then it actually disabled autopilot midway through the exit so taking the first exit slowing down before the curve maybe not enough okay so yeah getting the auto steer limited because of the UN ECE regulations now let's see if it will take the second exit or whether or not it will abort again so here we have the exit yep it is taking it nice I would rather see it a little bit more fluent but no it's it's a lot better than then it used to be so let's see what they have done with the speed bug that I reported so I'm doing 70 here's the sign says I can do 50 nope that still hasn't changed let me slow down here so I don't get a speeding ticket at the traffic light and if I hold the stock it says 50 and not 60 the way it was doing it in the previous update so it seems to be fixed but let's try another location where I demonstrated it in the last video and see if it's fixed there as well here the same when 50 70 it doesn't go to 80 and then back to 70 so it seems to be fixed and as usual we have the lane shift up ahead seems to be a red light so let me slow down a little bit hoping that it will turn green in time yep leaving some room to allow me to get up to speed there's also truck parked so I'm kind of curious to see whether or not it will break for that truck no it doesn't okay seems that we have an improvement there as well that it doesn't break for that parked truck so the car knows that this is not in its path and the path is going next to the truck cool all right let's try this a second time hopefully there's not a car in front of me the light is green so I can actually though it's turning orange again but let me see if I can stretch it a little bit enabling autopilot already so let's see what we can do here already on autopilot so that's not an issue helping it accelerate a little bit let's see if it breaks for that truck it does a little bit so it was kind of following the car in front of me earlier which is which is good and it uses that information so it's not entirely fixed but it's not slamming on the brakes either what it was doing before and here we have the final bit where the lane markings disappeared altogether and they are basically the parking area around or a little bit in the middle of the street whoa it is searching for the middle of the road Wow now it is Wow okay that definitely has gotten a lot worse so instead of hugging the right lane marking it actually searches for the middle of the remaining road surface that used to be a lot better but it also means that I can test the section at the end with the little divider because I can't enable autopilot anymore on this section unfortunately all right time for another conclusion and what can we say about this update well first of all the weaving to the left when it loses the left lane markings on the hill crest that has back at the same level as it was before so no real change is there but we do have one big change on the s-curve and yeah it actually slowed down again before the curve and it was able to handle that curve again exactly the way that I'm expecting it well not exactly it's still a little bit too lazy in the it should be more centered on the or within the lane but right now it is a big improvement over the last update we still have the bug where if you drive on the dirt lane and a truck is in the first lane and you want to move over to the second plane then it thinks that the truck is in your lane and this time it was just the worst because of those trucks those two trucks being close to each other yeah that was just not usable at all and that's a bug that does not really needs to fix because it's been there for quite some time and I don't see any improvements there the automatic exit taking well it while it's still a bit jerky it is doing it again and last time when I hate the exits to lokrum it's disabled autopilot on the second exit right now it's doing it and again that is another improvement also the speed back that I reported in the previous update or in the previous video that has been fixed and I don't know whether or not it's a coincidence but I posted the video and a day later I got the update and the update basically fixes what I reported so yeah that's that's good of course some people were saying that well it's the fleet speed so called fleet speed means that just like goddess data from the entire fleet and determines what is a good speed to take this turn but it was not a case it was just a bug just as I thought now the final section that is a little bit worse because right now it doesn't hunt for the side of the road it just keeps to the middle of the road so that has gotten worse but again it's not yet intended to be used in that specific situation so I'm testing the limits of the system I'm expecting it to have difficulties with that situation and we are seeing that right now but again yeah room for improvement also this update was supposed to give better pedestrian detection so I tested it by having myself walk in front of the car while not driving of course but I don't notice anything so maybe this is an MCU thing again because I still am on MCU one part where 2.0 with no vision yet or no roadmap yet towards hardware 3.0 this law still cannot say when I will be getting that unfortunately so maybe it's related to that and maybe with Hardware tree we do not of them see you it would be better in the pedestrian detection but right now the way I see it my son is already halfway the car and then it pops up as a pedestrian and then it is really jerky in the movement some cases it didn't even detect them at all so I don't see that improvement on my car specifically but your mileage may vary of course so there you have it I think this is the best update we've had since many months I think since New Year or something a lot of improvements that have gotten in there so I really like it I really like the improvements especially the s-curve that has gotten a lot safer again so thank you Tesla for fixing that one and as usual if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe using that button down there and make sure you hit that little bell I can see don't miss out on any new videos and for now thanks for watching see you guys next time bye bye
