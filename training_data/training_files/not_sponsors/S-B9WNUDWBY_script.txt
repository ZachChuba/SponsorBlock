our plane landed in New Orleans as that Chiefs Texans game kicked off we were watching the game on Evan Fox's phone and I have never and I mean ever seen anything like that football game right there Texans come out throttle throat stomp curb stomp you name it none of us cut against it I was thinking in my head Oh No the bye week got another team just like they got the Ravens which we'll talk about with the Titans here momentarily I thought that was going to happen to the Chiefs this dynamic football team this team that didn't make a lot of mistakes all year this team that has these playmakers in every single aspect of the game came out a little bit flat special teams was terrible for both sides it was massive and then Billy O'Brien build Oh Brian somehow someway lost a playoff game in which he was up 20 or nothing and not just lose the game he lost by 2044 points wing 40 44 points wing in one ball game 28 point 28 points wing in one quarter and it all revolves around the special teams all of it unforeseen one there when they were up 21 had a chance to make it a four point yeah well it would have been a four score game no matter what but they could have made a 28 tip in the red zone fourth in one they call a timeout everybody assumes that they're just going to go ahead and step on the throat but instead Bill O'Brien decides to kick a field goal I don't hate it right get some points but what Bill O'Brien said after the game was he didn't have a play ready yo it's the divisional round bro it's the second quarter who doesn't have a play ready week 19 of an NFL season in the second quarter he says well I thought I was a first down I did have a play ready we decided to kick the field okay no harm no foul we can make sense then later in the same quarter fourth and four on your own 30 you decide to run a fake punt which ultimately get stuffed which gives the ball to Patrick mahomes in scoring position already bingo bango that leads to the Chiefs coming back and making this miraculous run Andy Reid only coach in NFL history to be up 20 points in a playoff and lose a game in the only coach that has been down 20 points in a playoff game and win the game that is what Andy Reid is though he has the ability to take over games his plays are magnetic his plays are majestic and everybody thought in the first quarter of that game that Andy Reid season was back it was always been a topic of conversation that Andy Reid has no discipline now now I'm not saying for off the field that people could say whatever they want I'm talking about on the field they'll go the thing that was said is Andy Reid uses all of his place and that by the time you make it to the playoffs they have no place left so everybody knows exactly what you're gonna do they get stumped boom boom last year there were one offsides away from Dee Ford to go into the Super Bowl so we thought this was different first quarter this game the internet was abuzz there was walrus Andy Reid photos there was this guy doesn't know how to win into playoffs this guy will forever stink hi this is Andy Reid he wears Air Force Ones he's really good during a regular season but never gets you the big one all these things are being said about Andy Reid all of these things were being said about Patrick mahomes and how great he was all season but just couldn't get it done here in a plus and then whammy that fake punt gets stuffed by Sorenson a fake punt that they should have checked out of by the way Justin Reed who was the personal protector his job is a hard one his job is to tell the senator to go right or left on the blocking scheme depending on how many people are lined up on the right or on the left his job is to decide who's coming who's not going and then he was walking back pacing to see if the look was there for him to take that ball and run with it and when people have to know is a lot of times there are fake punts that are called that are checked out of Iran to fake punts in the NFL three fake punts in the NFL for fake buses yeah hey three of them success nope two of them successful two massive failures but there was like six or seven other times that there a fake punt code or onside kick code that I checked out of due to the fact of not having the look I think Justin Reed who is the personal protector who was put in that position by Brad Sealy the special teams coach of the Houston Texans who's been coaching special teams in the NFL since 1989 I think the conversation was hey if you have a guy spying you like Sorensen clearly was you check out of that we punt the ball back we're still up two scores no harm no foul instead Justin Reed says nah dawg give me the ball I can outrun that white guy right there get a first down Keith deshaun Watson on the field let's build on this lead that we have and he was completely wrong well hello there CT now back to the magic momentum completely changes in that moment there was a lot of other things that happen before that but what happened after that was nothing short of miraculous with what Patrick mahomes that offense and even the Chiefs defense were able to do so rattle off 49 points in a 44 point swing in one game and have zero doubt zero question and just absolutely slaughter the Texans I mean that's just a statement game by the Chiefs to say hey no matter what we are into going into the future next week whenever they have to play the Tennessee Titans who are ground-and-pound team who will try to keep Patrick mahomes off the field which has been the recipe for success for teams beating the Chiefs this year is just keep that ketchup loving some [ __ ] on the field then even if they're down they're gonna have in the back of their mind hate last week last week where we down 24 ain't nobody give a damn about what the score is anymore with the Chiefs they know they got it in the bottle everybody knows they got it in the bottle and I think them in Titans are gonna be an awesome game and I everytime Patrick where Holmes gets the ball I'm excited for it but that call of not checking out of that fake punt by Justin Reed there is going to ultimately be the deciding factor on why Billy O'Brien is no longer the Houston Texans coach amongst other things come on not having a play ready on a fourth and one dum-dum that's next level but that fake pun is ultimately gonna fall on the head coach's desk as it should and he can't be fired right now because there's no GM but the McNair fam was gonna bring him in like the Jones family doesn't say hey pal needs you to get the hell out of here for more reaction we send it to Indianapolis in two boys if you're Bill O'Brien lie like just lie you can't admit that you don't have a play a one-yard play even after you take a timeout to then think longer about a one-yard play kicking the field goal is fine like that's fine but don't admit that you don't have a play on fourth and one what happened that's a what hey that's a guy that doesn't have a boss correct yeah that's what guys Bill O'Brien is the GM which Bill Belichick Bill O'Brien [Laughter] head coaches who don't have GM's who act as the GM he doesn't have a boss so whenever he goes up there's nobody like for him to like think oh I gotta impress this person the McNair family when was last time you heard him speak never I think they know I'm not even sure they live in they might have moved to Tennessee I don't even know if they're even around the organization that is a guy that has no boss and no self-awareness now do I appreciate the fact that you told the truth I mean I guess we should because in our world we want people to tell us the truth but he sounded so stupid so I didn't have you caught a timeout what you got that big-ass sheet in front of you 40 seconds you can't you had glasses on yeah we need how many yards one yard don't we have one with JJ Watt where we can just line up this big ass and just hand him the ball is there something we can do it made no sense to me the way he handled all of it it was obvious that guy had no Bostitch you mix that into it the fact that the Texans went for it on 4th and 1 this year more than any other team in the NFL more than any other team so he definitely has plays they've done it they're comfortable in it like it's just it's inexcusable Tommy plays on that play sheet are designed to get more than 1 yard all of them every single play on that play sheet is designed more than one yard the funny thing that they just brought up there that should be noted is that in football when you design play they are to gain yards what the house person one yard is the least amount of yards you can possibly gain if you don't have a play that gains yards or a yard what the have been doing
