however on Tesla Tom here thanks so much for joining us on Ludacris feed today we're going to look at our Tesla Model 3 and how long it takes for the car to lock itself when you got it on walk away door lock whether it's a time-based thing or a distance-based thing so I've got some footage here in a basement car park at a shopping center let's have a look at it right now experiment today I'm just a basement car park just getting some dinner for the family and I just want to see how long it actually takes to walk away before the car actually locks itself another bet you but sometimes with the model three because there's no keys and when you walk away it locks itself I get a bit anxious and I always look back to see how long it actually takes for the car lock I'm gonna give that a try today let's find out what happens okay so I'm just closing the door now this way it takes yes step I want doesn't look yeah son where's Dale okay so you could see that it's actually probably about one two three four parking spots that I'm away from the car before the lock blinkers come on so assuming each parking lot is about maybe two meters across so that's a good eight maybe ten meters before the car locks itself so I set up an experiment basically in my garage just to confirm that and here you see on the ground I've got some chalk markings of the distance from the front of my car in one meter increments and I thought I was being very clever and seeing how long it would take to lock the car the further I walked away from the car I just wanted to nail it down to the closest meter basically I didn't think it would be that far eight to ten meters I thought maybe because I was walking away from the car there was some lag in the car catching up so let's watch okay so you can see I'm right in front of the car so zero meters away from the front of the vehicle I probably stood there for about five to ten seconds at the most before you hear the car locking itself so that whirring noise is the side mirrors closing in got to take my word the car locked itself when I was right in front of the car I thought okay maybe it's different from the front to the side of the car so what I did was I repeated the experiment in the garage but this time I marked out some chalk marking as one meter increments perpendicular to the b-pillar of the vehicle you can see they're one meters to three meters I couldn't go any further than that because that's the width of my garage so let's see what happens when I did that experiment from the side of the car okay so you can see that when I'm perpendicular to the car facing the b-pillar of the vehicle the car doesn't actually lock and I've got my phone in my pocket all this time from my little experiment I can see that when you are facing the b-pillar like right angle to the car the car doesn't actually lock itself unto your a fairway from the vehicle as I showed in the basement car park at the shopping center so I was about eight meters away before the car locked itself when I was at the front of the vehicle I stood there for five maybe ten seconds at most and the vehicle locked itself fairly promptly which makes me think that I guess in future to relieve some anxiety on my part when I'm driving this vehicle what I'm gonna do is instead of walking away at a right angle from the car I'm just gonna go to the front of the vehicle for a five seconds and then I'll know that the car's locked itself so that's my little take-home message for you today for the walk away door lock option for the Tesla Model 3 if you want to relieve some anxiety I would say once you get out of the vehicle once everyone's out of the vehicle walk to the front of the vehicle and then confirm the doors locked before you walk away if you want to know the door is definitely locked if you're not concerned it doesn't matter walk away check the phone later if you want but I must say though I had not once has the car let me down when I've walked away the car is always locked itself so this was just a double check and an extra security measure to know that the door has locked when I stand in front of the vehicle all right guys I hope you enjoyed that little experiment for our Tesla Model 3 and the walk away door lock option which can be found in these settings of your Tesla Model 3 take care guys thanks for joining us I'll see you next time and as always happy charging
