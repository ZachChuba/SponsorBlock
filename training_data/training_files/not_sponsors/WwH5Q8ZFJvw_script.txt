by now it's become more or less mainstream to have a solid-state drive or SSD in your computer or even your phone and why not with their fast response times and more recently falling costs they're often recommended as the best single upgrade the average user can make to an older machine but most SSDs are based on a storage technology called NAND flash which has actually been around for decades now and as we demand faster speeds and storage solutions that can handle tons of requests at once which is especially important for all those cloud-based services that we love this aging technology will become more and more of a bottleneck enter Intel obtain a new fundamentally different storage tech based on what Intel is calling 3d crosspoint although they're treating exactly what sorts of materials they're using in 3d crosspoint and how they're arranged as a top secret what I can tell you is that obtained has a few major advantages first up is latency the delay between an i/o request and the drive acting on it although opt-ins latency isn't as low as the cache on your CPU or as low as your system RAM it is much lower than any of these existing storage technologies and yet obtains data density is much higher than RAM meaning that it can be deployed as either Ram like working memory or even as longer-term storage due to its combination of quick access times and high capacities on the subject of using obtain for storage to be clear it won't be replacing the mechanical hard drive anytime soon but unlike Ram it's non Vaal Tildy means that it can retain data for a relatively long time without a constant supply of power and it's faster than even the fastest NAND SSDs across the board including in the small random reads and writes at low queue depths that account for the bulk of the average person's usage not just in cherry-picked benchmarks that don't reflect the real world in fact octane can hit close to 100,000 AI ops at a queue depth of 1 and over quadruple that at around Q depth 8 not Q depths of 32 which many SSD makers advertise but which virtually never occur in real life obtain also provides much better quality of service meaning that random dips in performance are far less common and it can handle many more transactions per second so performance doesn't degrade nearly as much even when the drive is getting slammed with i/o requests this could end up being very important on the server and cloud side of things meaning like video messages or controller inputs in cloud games could go in and out more quickly and reliably if these enterprises started using octane and it looks like the technology should catch on due to its lower cost per transaction obtains ability to be used as high capacity Ram could also make it a compelling solution for things like machine learning think about developing software for self-driving cars for example and scientific research we're having a large pool of working memory is more important than having it be as fast as possible but line is cut I'm not a scientist researching artificial intelligence I just want to know how I can get this stuff in my home battle station well right now the only optton product available on the consumer level is an MDOT to obtain cache solution available in 60 or 32 gigabite capacities that places frequently used data like operating system files and save games on to the cache automatically which in some situations is faster than running things off of an SSD even if your main disk that it's accelerating is a mechanical hard drive there is a catch though you'll need a supported platform namely a KB Lake or newer CPU and a 200 series or newer Intel chipset as the company didn't want to do the validation and testing on anything older or for that matter anything AMD opting instead to tell consumers we know this hardware setup will work so use that the good news is that this octane cache drive looks like it's going to be supported by nearly all major motherboard manufacturers as well as the big boy OMS like Dell HP and Lenovo and there's more good news assuming you've got the dollar dollar bills there will be a full fat obtained storage solution that will function as a normal drive over a PCI Express slot or a u dot 2 port without needing a specific motherboard though high-capacity opt-in drives in an MDOT two form factor probably won't be available any time soon due to power and thermal concerns so then that's today but octane is so fast that it currently saturates a PCI Express 3.0 x4 connection which has a theoretical max speed of a little under 4 gigabytes per second so at some point we should expect to see new interconnects and protocols that can fully harness the potential of obtain whether you're modeling the best way to build Skynet coating a real-world matrix or you're just worried about Google Chrome loading a few fraction of a second more quickly have you ever get 10% off your first purchase so thanks for watching
