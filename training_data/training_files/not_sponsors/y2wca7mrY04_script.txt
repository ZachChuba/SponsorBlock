hi my name is Sarah I'm a filmmaker and today I'm going to be reacting to wannabe by it Z and also the dala dala dance practice as you can see by the title this is another collab with my very good friend anis we're doing a thing where we suggest groups to each other to react to and to check out I suggest him boy groups because I love boy groups he's suggesting me girl verbs because he loves girl groups and this week he told me to check out itseif hello I'm honest ha see from honest ha see the channel oh my god I am so happy that you enjoy dreamcatcher I love that group it just suddenly came out of nowhere in my life and I love that you enjoyed us so much and the reason why I chose to Hara because I knew that you didn't know about their silly side so I'm glad to introduce their other sides and that they're not only like a k-rock they can rock any genre and I really hope you're gonna check their other works out because they're an amazing girl group for this week's discovery serious I want you to react to it see I know that you know some of their songs from other times but you need to check out wannabe you need to see how crazy good they are I know that you're gonna love them I just have a feeling I just have a feel like I know you for the bias challenge I think your bias is gonna be ryojun I don't have to fight this group every member it's perfect looking seriously I can't choose between these girls I love all of them equally which is something rare for me but you know what but I think your bias is gonna be ryojun if not it could be edgy you are ing type of girl like that could be a thing - but ryojun is my number one bet honey oh I'm so excited for you to see how perfect of a girl group they are no other girl group can do a girl crush like them go you need to watch it right now so honest guessed that my favorite member would be Yujin I don't know if I'm pronouncing her name right as I've already seen I see and Donatella maybe I can already say that I do like Yoo Jin a lot because she's a rapper and I'm usual they always like the rappers and I really liked her pink hair in icy but I also really liked eajy and maybe someone else is gonna jump at me in this music video so I'm gonna tell you at the end if he was right or not I've already seen one part of this video where ryujin is standing in the middle and doing like her shoulder thing because that's unescapable I've seen it everywhere I've seen people cover it I've seen dance relays where she did that I've seen oh my god it was just all over Twitter for a while and I think I've also heard the part that she's singing at that point but I don't know the verses of the song I don't know what the MV otherwise it looks like so this is pretty much an like a blind reaction I am gonna put on subtitles I don't know if I will be able to read them all in my first watch through because I usually concentrate on the music video because that's what I'm able to talk about but I will skip through the video again and read the subtitles if I couldn't read them in my initial watch so what I'm expecting from this video is a lot of colors very fun the song fun the video fun graphics a lot of graphics I know I see has a lot of graphics I don't remember if dala dala has a lot of graphics but I feel like it was kind of their style based on only I see so maybe it is not a lot of cuts very fast and fun I feel like it's er just really fun but before I get into subscribe to my channel if you like my videos let's watch wannabe buy it see I am very excited [Music] you know glittery of boots lots of years and I already know it's in the beginning I thought that was of course Greece bones already [Music] I'll read the director [Music] it's early softer than I expected it's softer there for me [Music] I'm definitely watches again only I'm she's a pretty girl that's how I heard one of my hair but I failed [Music] nice cut nice cut saw oh sorry so good [Music] [Applause] she's so cool [Music] her legs are so long look at me chocolatey Wow [Music] stop want to say okay yeah I think you're right on us I'm making ready for a dance break oh I feel it coming oh my god Oh graphics I was gonna say did I say no graphics it but very subtle [Music] so pillow what happened [Music] that was so good that was so good that might be my favorite song so far I've heard of them I need to crank up my volume that was so good I want to watch it again it doesn't even matter that I didn't read the lyrics first time because I want to watch it again this is gonna blow my ears out but I don't care so I mean obviously also since the chorus is in English I understood some parts of the song but I thought I thought there I thought that like shoulder thing was the chorus it's literally in the beginning of the song I really have to I think I have to watch this three times because I need to like read the lyrics now but then also I want to look at some edit stuff this is so would like I love the editing in this video so well done those are some of the best match cuts I've seen in music videos recently and I think we can all agree that region is magic okay let's watch it again I love the colors in this video I already knew this was virgin when I saw the woods [Music] [Music] I love her smile she's so cute okay enough of my stupid dancing let me read the lyrics I don't know if I'll leave any of my dancing in I mean it makes it authentic I'm not a dancer yeah you do [Music] yeah I really like this song like the message [Music] I'm gonna leave in my dancing because they're telling me that I should just be me and I really like dancing she reminds me fuel in that shot like all this English [Music] that's your Donna you know I got one her legs are so long those shows I would break my ankles I don't know why I like this section so much visually musically everything oh my god this is so good [Music] oh those are drones look oh my god I'd love that song I really thought I see is like an amazing song and I was like well I see so good I'm sure it's gonna be my favorite song from them for a while but want to be next single I love it oh I'm really want to watch it one more time Lea is the one with the long legs who's walking on the table I'm pretty sure I'm kind of sad that I can't listen to it but I'm gonna listen to it not for this video like a million times oh crap I forgot I'm watching another video oh is this gonna be another thirty minute video okay set dressing is insane colors or anything by the way if I ever use any terms that you don't understand please ask me about it in the comments and I will gladly explain them because I want you to like understand what I'm saying oh I love how the song comes in like what now region is my bias honestly oh my god like what also I wanted my hair like she has it I failed you love their wardrobe I love their styling they have such like strong styling choices like out there styling and it just looks so good on them I love the choreography for the song oh my god they're so good at dancing so she's doing something in like oh I can't remember the word of this but she's like in a place where they make these uniform firms uniforms and then she noses like drones or on her so the drones are like spying on her because like I feel this the message of the song is kind of like we're in the media so people criticize what we do but I'm just gonna be myself other drones like a representation of the media following them around or something I love how she smiles she's so cute I like this video - I don't think I said that I like it a lot the editing I think in this section right the match cuts here are so well done oh she looks so much like moo mule in this shop is she my bias because she looks like moonbyul no but she's also a rapper which is like my pretty wrappers oh no those bad felt those magic cuts are so well done I mean honestly if if in like if a girl like that walks into the club the spotlight should be on her she's so gorgeous oh look at her oh my god so that's Lea I think oh I don't know I'm confusing Lea Yoona and yeah G but I think this this is Eugene that's Lea oh I wanted to say also I have for a second when I first saw this I thought she was walking on stilts is that the word because her legs looked so long I was like whoa but I think it's the pants that make her legs I mean she I'm sure she also has really long legs just like naturally cuz she be blessed also she's backstage at a modeling show and she says she's like expected to walk in these high heels maybe wear the coat but she's like I'm not feeling it I'm gonna turn turn I'm gonna take off those heels and maybe take off that coat and just be myself on stage and also I could never walk in those heels so I feel you girl I don't know why I'm like this this whole section so much musically like she saw I love this outfit I love the accessories she's wearing oh my god I love everything like this - the effects are so cool like oh my god this is so cool is that a cut I will I will be able to tell in editing but the artificial camera movements and the cuts that are done here are so well done I love this video choreography together with the editing the editing is so good in this video one of the best edited videos I've seen lies there was rude on on the wall somewhere before lies is the only one I can really read this is gonna be in long ass of you so sorry I think I have nothing else to say though I just I'm in love with the song the choreography the video the editing them they're all gorgeous they're all amazing dancers they're all amazing singers and rappers honestly I think they might be my favorite bro group so far I have not heard any of their b-side track so so I really should do that I swear JYP is killing me with their groups my favorite group like I like with it see now I stand for of their groups I loved Asics they're my old group got7 straight kids now it see who else am i selling monsta x + 17 like 4 of their groups versus two other groups jyp really really really really has taste in music plus all of his groups are so different I really like that I think that's all I'm gonna say cuz I'm gonna watch the dance practice I'm not really gonna speak much about the dance practice though so I did watch the dance practice but something happened to me and I also decided to watch the music video as well I don't want this video to be 30 minutes or longer so I decided to inter cut the two and to just show you my most interesting commentary or reactions I tried to make it as smooth as possible I'm sorry if it's a little all over the place but I really didn't want this video to be super long so here's what happened to me after I watched the dance practice I don't remember if I've seen it or not let's just watch it I'm I I just want to I love I love I love it e I'm just hate me with it just do it yeah region let's Saturday of your song right I think it's all excuse me what the [ __ ] can you not comment me like that girl what did I ever do [Music] Yugi I think it's the tallest one yeah here I can differentiate them this is Yuna cherry on region ug and no ug and Lea sorry got it wrong still I love their wardrobe their styling is so good I don't know who their stylist is but they're know like okay that's green screen you can tell a little bit I was like budget I think the row behind them is still real and then the row after that is green screen now region is my favorite I'm gonna say it oh okay scary so they keep always have this message of I'm just gonna be myself because myself is perfect the most fun or whatever okay this was probably a super long episode cuz I cuz I watched like six videos No thank you very much honest for recommending me this song because I [ __ ] love it oh my god it's C I don't think there is another girl about there that are like that much I like mamamoo but to be fair I've also only heard like 2/3 mamamoo songs um but I just really like it C style they're so like bright and colorful and fun and their messages are like I'm just myself so what the [ __ ] do you want from me which I love and I love their choreographies I love they're super fun concept just in general I just feel like they have a really fun concept like I just feel like when JYP was thinking of okay so I want to do another girl group what should be their concept fun it see I don't have anything false to say I think I said everything honest you were right about virgin I was kind of thinking maybe I would also really like eajy a lot I like all of them a lot but ryojun I keep saying her name all the time and I'm probably mispronouncing it I didn't really get into a lot of technical stuff but I don't know what much to say it's the the the the wannabe video is pretty technical everything seems to be shot on the location or on like a set there's not a lot of green screen or CGI going on from what I can tell beautiful lighting as in every kpop music video graphics in that one shot and then like a few effects in the shot with eg in the club and like artificial camera movement but the editing is editing is fantastic in that video and dala dala i still don't remember who I've seen it before I think I have but maybe once as I said I think there's screen screen going on in that one shot with the cars otherwise I can't remember but there's a lot of effects going on in general so okay thank you very much for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it I hope you learned something or maybe you saw something that you didn't before thank you again honest for collaborating with me and for suggesting me it see I really hope you also enjoyed got7 as much as I just enjoyed these beautiful wonderful amazing talented
