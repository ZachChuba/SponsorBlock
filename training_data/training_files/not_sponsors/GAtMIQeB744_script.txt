the fifth angry spot and it's at a place that is totally not the entrance to a secret evil lay Sears fitzy mercy me like a can you come back to the fourth angry spot and I should be able to see your name from there I think yeah I think I'm on the other side I have a chest in here though that I can definitely grab before you spend the effort maybe uh maybe you should just do it and see if it ends us I'm I'm right here at the gate no no no go to the fourth angry spot though one two three hello hello right up here it's just right up here at it how did you get back towards the earlier angry spots
