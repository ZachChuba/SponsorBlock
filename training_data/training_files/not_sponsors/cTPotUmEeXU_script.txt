[Music] yeah this probably is the most vocally talented group that has almost totally disappeared for over a year a girl group that was created off the popularity of members say Jung and con me knob from produced 101 and debuted with Iowa cuckoo Don should be known for the high-quality vocals but are they even known at all with no first win and named flops and kpop why are they having such a long break since their last comeback today we're gonna go over Google Don's history and of course what happened to them and where are they now but before looking forward I was like to look back since 2016 the produce 101 series has been the beginning of tons of group success until the show's sudden end in 2019 due to the voting manipulation scandal which I covered in my what happened to x1 and I Swan videos check those out if you have it the series helped create groups like vici Mickey piston cosmic girls Chun ha and so me solo debuts and for season 2 produce 101 cix a b6 and kang Daniels solo career all of them are born from this show and so did Google Don's with members Kim stays young economy not breaking high and making it into Iowa promoting with them for a year then towards the tail end of Iowa's contract jellyfish entertainment revealed they were planning to debut a new girl group with of course the popularity of sejong and mina already being so unknown by korea it sounded like a fantastic idea but apparently jellyfish wasn't planning to debut a whole group there were rumors about them wanting to debut kim seyeong kang mina and a trainee to make a 3 member girl group which we actually got to see what they really wanted later on but instead they formed the company's first-ever girl group called cuckoo Don literally meaning times tables in Korean this 9 member group was ready to debut in 2016 with the title track Wonderland [Music] it was a memory concept that if you compare what Google Don has done more recently it's totally different and it's pretty interesting to see a group like Google Don to come out of jellyfish entertainment whose only other contribution was giving us VIX back to Gugu Don their debut was actually met with backlash by debut and Mena and sage young in the group fans have produced 101 and I why thought it was a waste of their talents they probably would have liked to see them more as a duo or maybe even in a trio group like I mentioned before and this caused some concern as Google Don's debut album and song had a mild response on the music charts Gugu Don had a very shaky start at best before having a complete group comeback sejong teamed up with Zico as the producer for her first solo song flower way which completely proved why fans wanted to see Satyam with her first ever solo song flower way gave her a perfect all-kill in only two days of the release with carefully crafted lyrics about showing regret for not appreciating their mother more it really struck a chord with listeners and so it was a hit among Koreans oh yeah and she even beat mamamoo black/pink and twice to get her first win on the show [Music] that should give set Jung and more importantly Koga thon more motivation to strike when the iron is hot and they did when the first comeback was released in February 2017 this was the song a girl like me with the album act to narcissus completely dropping that debut concept immediately and that was the smartest thing they could have done Google Don finally understood what their best at not the concept or the sound but those vocal belts they should have done this sooner but nonetheless a girl like me was Google's first kind of hit in kpop breaking in the top 10 debuting at number three on the guy on charts that is what people were missing out on kuku don is really talented and they just need help showing it Sejong continued to have a very packed schedule in 2017 to continue to promote herself and the group singing the OST for the kpop drama legend of the blue sea becoming a host of the make up TV show get it beauty and even making her acting debut after being casted by the drama school 2017 say Chong is so beloved by Korea in fact she won the best new actress at the 31st KBS drama Awards Kim Saotome [Music] if Google Don could capture say chunks immense popularity that would be perfect that is what they try to do when they announced the new comeback in late 2017 and all I can say is that they tried something different again aside from this being an alternate timeline Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and having more sponsors than a youtuber although I don't think G&G is a real candy something that didn't change was Kouga Don singing ability shining through now this song could have hit harder and maybe should've groups like orange caramel and crayon pop were known for their fun concepts and rewatchable music videos however that formula may Award for them and it didn't really work for Google Don as choco cocoa performed slightly worse than the previous release a girl like me why I have no idea and the amount of people sleeping on Google on would be even more disheartening later on one year into Google Don's career the group has yet to find some commercial success which isn't that bad yet some k-pop groups take years to reach their peak think about newest it took five years and some members competing and produce 101 season two for people to start paying attention to them so what Google done planned for 2018 was probably the best thing they could throw at us now back with the title track the boots googled on nail'd almost everything about this comeback concept check instrumentals and interesting strings and wind instruments check oh yeah and those sweet vocals check I don't see any other k-pop group doing acapella like Google done they could really sing any girl group under the table and still this comeback came and went without people taking a second glance jellyfish entertainment continued on with business as usual with Gugu dawn moving into the Japanese market with a mini album of their previous releases and this got me scratching my head why enter a brand new country when you still haven't established your group in your own country yet now yes it might have been an attempt to find success elsewhere but by not creating at least a new Japanese single song is seemed like an empty attempt by jellyfish entertainment still Google done made their debut and held a fan meeting in Tokyo Google Don would also greet fans at kcon 2018 in Japan and also Taiwan while they were still branching out into new markets member Haiyan stepped out of promotions with Google on in October and would ultimately leave the group still young haein found it better to leave Google Don for health reasons and to focus on her studies but she would still be signed under jellyfish entertainment to maybe return to entertainment in time back now at jellyfish they thought instead of a group come back they should reveal what could have been that trio group we talked about earlier this sub unit was called kakouton tsamina giving off that early mamamoo vibes tamina still carried that vocal talent to make this summertime debut it was a bob but would it succeed not quite it's still performed as well as any other regular group release so at this point Guga don tried multiple comebacks a Japanese debut a subunit even another subunit of Mena and Heian before she left and say junks solo songs and activities they were hoping to find the answer in late 2018 when it was Guga dan would be returning for the first time only as eight members but this time it had the makings of something special not that type was a powerful dance track playing on Google's ability to harmonize and hit those impactful notes yogathon dominated this track without a doubt but was this the answer to Gugu Dan's failed attempts no in fact this new album failed to chart in Korea at all but there was a silver lining here if you take a look at the US UK and Philippines iTunes chart Google on hit number three number four and number five in songs and album charts Goo Goo Dolls potential can be seen when you pull back the curtain now it's been over a year and a half since Google don't release anything new as a group what are the members up to and where are they now haeseong was casted in some acting roles with her ladies being announced as the lead of a drama this year she also released more solo music con Mina was the long term host of the music show Music Core but has since left after two years just weeks ago all other members have had some solo activities here and there like variety shows commercials and musicals but now it seems like the future of cuckoo thon may be in trouble as members Sally just recently announced that they got kicked out of the company when sally was a contestant on the Chinese audition program produced camp 20/20 in an interview she revealed some troubling news she said I debuted after being a trainee for five months in Korea but I sensed a big difference between members from then on two of the members were already well-known so there was a big gap they already had fans in the public focused on them then she talked about the big news at the beginning of 2019 my agency told me to go home when I asked them when I should come back they told me there was no need to come back she said that all the members went to their dorms and packed up everything and left they tried to stick together but in or Cal Google Don's future as a group doesn't seem like it's much of a future at all this wouldn't be the first time members from Iowa would run into trouble with their own groups if you just imagine what happened Kristen it's easy to call Google on a flop but can you really when you get to hear their undeniable talent seriously and the more time passes the more it will be difficult to make a comeback members are getting older and contracts are running out calling Google Don underrated is itself an underrated statement talent and determination should lead to success plain and simple Google Don has all of that times a hundred that's it for me guys hopefully what happened video remember every single Friday what do you think about this episode what do you think about Google done it's one of those groups that have fallen into the void of their company having no idea what to do with them it's disheartening to see talent like this go to waste what do you what do you think jellyfish entertainment need to do to help Google Don you know get some traction in kpop because they deserve it man you you saw the talent that they have let me know all your thoughts down in the comments I'd love to have a discussion about it and big video or something else but later those guys thank you so much for watching I'll catch you guys in the next one I'm
