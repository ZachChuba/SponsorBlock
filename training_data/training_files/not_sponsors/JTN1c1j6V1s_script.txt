so this is a computer and not a weird low spec one or something that was designed and built from the ground up to bring Linux to the folks who can't be bothered to compile their own kernel hunt down all the right repos or even build their own PC it challenges so many of my own assumptions about the Linux community like for starters wouldn't anyone with the time and inclination to tinker around with Linux also have the time and inclination to install it for themselves in the first place so it seems like the goal here is to make Linux more accessible to normies so let's go through this together and I want to see your comments down below about what they got right and what they got wrong Moss has updated their packs pack buy it today at the link in the video description [Music] starting with the system76 webstore the goal was clearly to simplify the shopping experience they offer both AMD and Intel platforms with a huge amount of customization but they boil their thelia system offerings down to three models a good better best if you will with the system upgrades presented in a way that is simple but might actually bother many hardware enthusiasts for example the mat pro 27 inch IPS display has no model number listed whatsoever and this 30 terabyte hard drive is just six five terabyte hard drives with no indication as to how they're going to be configured prior to shipping now we're gonna talk about our hardware config and a little bit but first as a non Linux user I want to poke around pop OS a little bit when you first boot it is super easy to encrypt your data just enter a password and reboot that is pretty neat then when you come back you're given the opportunity to set up your online accounts for integration into the OS including access to your Google Drive cloud storage right in the file manager now we've actually seen pop OS before in our gaming on Linux update video and one of its major departures from its parent Ubuntu is pop shop a ridiculously easy to use app store so it's actually ported over from elementary OS but with one key value add system 76 curates their own packages so if you ever need something basic like steam for gaming or the latest in video drivers it's just a click away actually for your graphics drivers it's easier than updating them on Windows the only real criticisms that we had were the lack of UI scaling by default on our 27-inch 4k display and the way that our secondary storage drive won that shipped in our system was kind of hidden away we think this should be front and center like the cloud storages so hopefully they fix that soon as for if you need to fix anything you can access the pop oh s recovery environment that lives on the boot drive by holding down space or escape during boot this is a full copy of the installation media meaning that you get a live environment to access and backup your files refresh your installation or even just nuke it and start over from scratch and this is all without needing a thumb drive now one fun idea is that you could actually use this recovery environment as a sort of super incognito mode that's separate from your main install if you were so inclined now on to the hardware our figlio is specked out with a rise in 720 700 X and a bunch of other good stuff so we threw both gaming and productivity workloads at it where it not only performed pretty well overall but in some cases outperformed Windows and this is on literally exactly the same hardware now obviously our gaming results fell a little behind in some places but what's noteworthy here is that we're even running these games if you're not up on the latest in Linux gaming news I don't blame you but valve proton enables a huge number of Windows only games even once that aren't on Steam to run on Linux now it is supercool onto productivity now right now for some workloads like video editing Linux isn't a great time because the industry standard tools aren't available on the platform but for other things like color work and DaVinci Resolve our system performed really well and in some cases absolutely crushed our windows performance numbers but check out these blender results if you if I didn't see it happen I wouldn't believe that they're on the same processor ok then so so far we've got good performance a relatively simple Linux software implementation green light to buy them well hold on a second now we intended for this to be a review of the system but so far everything we've shown you can be installed on commodity hardware that you assemble for yourself so let's take a closer look at the box once you get it out of the shockingly nerdy packaging the most striking features of the figlio are its wood green finish and it's tantalizing silver power button and accompanying white LED ring there's no sign of any front i/o to disrupt the clean design language they've gone with which means it's beautiful but also means unfortunately that we're stuck with what we've got on the rear and back here is interesting so more of that clean at any cost approach the i/o is cut directly out of the chassis that means no simple motherboard upgrade although again it does make for an uninterrupted premium look that really screams Apple even though when we pop the hood with these thumb screws we can see that this is clearly a standard PC motherboard on the inside but we can also see in Harris they've done a pretty bang-up job with the cable management helped significantly by the generous real estate provided under the main fascia which doesn't attempt to seal the computer so much as it conceals that means that there is a bit of concern from our end about dust accumulation through the side panels and the potential for noise to sneak out from under the chassis using the air gap as an echo chamber unfortunately sure enough it does get a little loud when the fans are running full tilt and it's not just whooshing air noise something that we generally don't complain about rather it's a kind of droning whine that's a little bit harder to tune out honestly I think a Noctua or a be quiet fan swap would help tremendously here because it seems to be that the arctic freezer 12 CPU cooler is making most of the racket and that might also help with thermals our Rison 720 700 X stayed cool enough to prevent throttling but at 85 degrees under full synthetic load I would prefer something a little beefier as for our EVGA graphics card well that was right where we wanted it in spite of the diminutive size of our chassis despite its acoustic shortcomings though the interior of the figlio does carry the same level of polish and attention to detail as the exterior so the CPU cooler shroud is both stylish and practical pulling double duty as a guide for the CPU coolers exhaust and as a bracket for mounting a chassis and similarly the gpus retention bracket acts as a brace to protect board flex check this out - up top we've got this row of screws weird right well they're here for a reason this hot-swap drive Bay allows you to just push out this clip slide however many screws you need down the rail and then screw them into the drive line up plug in and it couldn't be simpler and you don't even need to worry about losing the box of case screws that was included with your system the only issue here is that you better forget about mounting a full size three and a half inch drive two and a half inch SSDs and hard drives only also we haven't gotten to the coolest thing about this yet the case and all of its accompanying bits and pieces open-source just like the operating system so there's literally a github page with the CAD files for everything that you see here and for its bigger brothers the figlio major and figlio massive now that's not to say that every component in the system is open-source the motherboard CPU Ram video card storage devices and power supply are all proprietary in design with the IP owned by the individual companies that made them but system76 says that they're developing their own firmware wherever they can in order to make the hardware as open as possible something that they've already done with their laptops which are otherwise just standard clever designs this openness comes at a cost though Aarthi leo starts at $1100 it sounds reasonable but that's a really basic config the spec we ended up with costs quite a bit more and with the standard warranty we came to just shy of 2,400 dollars when we compared that to specking out the exact same system components for ourselves - the case our total came to $1,000 less whoof so then case aside what are you getting for that thousand dollar difference well while the operating system itself may be free system76 does have paid staff that actively developed their OS and that's to say nothing of the user support commitments that come along with that perhaps most crucially though the figlio chassis manufacturer and final assembly are both done in Colorado by a team that's about our size so no mass production system 76 says they want to improve this situation in the future but for now it means that the costs add up really quickly so to sum it up you're paying for the case us manufacturer operating system development and support from a small team of enthusiasts now whether the design and concept of a well integrated Linux desktop is enough to make you pay the extra that's a choice I leave to you but overall we think it's really cool and a huge step in the right direction big thanks to
