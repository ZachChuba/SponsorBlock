guys I have a huge announcement this is the longest I've been single since I was fifteen fifty Thank You small crowd of children for the last seven months I've been working on myself working out and working working working working as a therapy and now that my heart has scraped itself off the floor and stitched it's broken bloody mangled body together and cleaned herself up I'm ready to get back out there and I have never been someone who like goes on dates I almost always meet a person through work or mutual friends and then we like each other and then I'm so navigating the dating scene has been awkward for example the first date I went on when like this I like watched all your videos like you know figure out what you're all about and I feel like I know so much more about your life than you know about my life oh so tell me your life story I'm boring okay but I do have two cats oh okay cool you know look what the [ __ ] is up with vegan places so they're always trying to make like baked versions of like real food [Music] so what do you do for a living oh I work for a tech company well that's cool do you like it no I [ __ ] hate it but I've been there for like eight years okay and then I had to sit for another half hour and talk to this gentleman but I'm learning how to be comfortable saying no not only because I don't want to waste anyone elses time but I also don't want to hurt their feelings you know by being dishonest or by ghosting oh I guess the can have sex now someone that the real transparent being well haven't you seen the movie Ghost [Music] oh he what would I die so I've started being totally upfront about how I feel Who I am and what I'm looking for and if someone can't meet those expectations no hard feelings and I know dating can be confusing and difficult but if you navigate it by knowing what you want and are kind and respectful of people's feelings and your own most importantly it is an infinitely better process and yes dating so far has been a literal nightmare but as me and my friends have liked to say I'm Anna Akana Anna for 10% off that check [Music]
