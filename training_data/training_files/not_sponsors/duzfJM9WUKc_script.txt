hey guys welcome to the market is open check out our website the market is open calm in this video we're gonna be talking about Tesla's virtual power plant and their auto bidder product in relation to vehicle to grid technology and the million mile battery Elon Musk is expected to be hosting the Tesla battery day sometime in the coming weeks or months and there have been no shortages of rumors for products and innovations that Tesla aims to unveil during this battery day one of these things is called the virtual power plant which Tesla has been cooking up behind the scenes and there's speculation that they may unveil this product or service that could connect distributed power walls and Tesla vehicles to help the power grid Tesla also quietly released a professional product called Auto bitter which may lead to the potential of virtual power plant technology in the future however while this sounds a little pie-in-the-sky I believe that Tesla's virtual power plant is actually already here so let's have a look but where we give a shout out to our patrons at the end of each video so a virtual power plant is made up of many distributed parts small-scale energy generation or storage endpoints that can all come together through software to behave like a single larger power plant - the smokestacks of course for example there may be a wind or solar or battery assets available on the grid for power generation there's a centralized controller in this case someone or a team of people who operate a subsystem or portion of the grid during peak power usage times the grid may need more power temporarily to meet demand currently this central authority perhaps requires its own peaker plant or natural gas plant that it can fire up at certain times of the day in order to boost electricity production and meet demand otherwise you could get blackouts however these gas-powered plants a run on fossil fuels a lot of the time be they don't exactly match the flow of electricity demand and see there the responsibilities of this central authority maybe they had to purchase the speaker plant which only is required 5% of the time but they had to make big investments in order to buy this infrastructure so an interesting concept is why not make use of the various energy assets the are already connected to the grid integrate them all together through software such that they behave as a single entity for example your home solar panels might not be nearly enough to boost the grid output during peak hours on its own but maybe if we combine solar panels from a thousand homes we have a virtual peaker plant so how exactly would this work let's first look at the Australia horns they'll power reserve which was having constant issues and blackouts before Tesla helped them out it's a power generation plant that's powered using wind farms this is the one where Elon Musk said he would complete the battery project within a hundred days or it's free Tesla actually completed the battery insulation and grid connection within sixty three days this is the largest battery deployment in the world and it can react significantly faster than a gas-fired plants and matching the electricity load on the grid remember that if you produce too much power you need to dump it somewhere and if you don't produce enough well you have angry customers and blackouts the problem with wind farms is that you need to use the power as it's being generated and if you're producing power and no one's using it then that's simply a waste and then when the load spikes you're not producing enough to keep up so Tesla's batteries are key here historically batteries have been expensive and they don't hold that much power however Tesla is the largest producer of batteries in the world and they continue to bring down the cost and increase energy density so basically they install the batteries the batteries hold excess power that's generated and they can discharge that power when the grid needs it to really match the demand quite perfectly and instantaneously something that even fossil fuel peaker plants cannot do and also nuclear and some hydro generation plants just produce electricity constantly they're really not that flexible you turn it on and it just keeps going for hydro you can adjust the amount of water at some stations but basically not all the electricity can come from these sources because of their lack of flexibility and you need to have these pker type plants a Germany is one example where they've been really big on solar panels for many many years but without batteries the solar panels don't make a lot of sense given the peaks and troughs with demand usage now the horns they'll power reserve itself isn't exactly a virtual power plant or it could be but it's not exactly a distributed system it's big enough to be a power plant on its own for example say you are the horn cell battery reserve grid and you're connected to a nearby grid that why're some extra power at peak usage time say it's gonna be a really hot week and everyone's air conditioner is gonna be on well because they really need that power they're willing to pay a high price for it because of this peak at the same time if batteries at horns they are already fully charged and they likely won't be needed maybe the weather will be so hot for the area that the horns they'll supplies power to then they can agree to sell that power to the nearby grid maybe a few weeks later the same nearby grid is generating excess power and needs to dump it somewhere so they end up giving it away at a great price well horns Villa can check its battery capacity and see if there's extra space to charge its batteries with that power on the cheap so effectively Tesla's batteries have become energy trading vehicles and can help power plants make or save money however Tesla was actually encouraging residents of southern Australia to join their virtual power plant which is made up of a network of battery assets this would be an actual virtual power plant as it would abstract away the individual batteries and aggregate them all together into a unit that looks like a single power plant Tesla was actually offering and will probably offer in the future huge discounts for southern Australia residents who connected their power walls to the system saving sixty two hundred dollars Australian dollars which are about 90 cents on the Canadian dollar and 65 cents on the US dollar nevertheless that's huge savings about 60 percent off the price of a power wall so that just hints at how much money there is floating around these grid systems and how valuable Tesla's batteries are especially if you can unlock value by adding the product to Tesla's network that makes power wall and other battery products extremely competitive against other fossil fuels or even other batteries where the company doesn't have this type of setup so in order to unlock this value Tesla created a piece of software called auto bidder which allows the operator of Tesla batteries and energy resources to trade power auto bidder is an energy optimization and market participation platform so it's a professional platform that allows utilities and energy producers to better monetize their batteries by trading energy in real time furthermore auto bidder is already operating at the horns they'll power reserve in South Australia so how exactly does this work well the cool thing about auto bidder is that it could use large-scale deployments like the giant battery deployment that Tesla created at horns Dale or it can use a distributed set of batteries such as those power walls in residential homes and aggregate them together to create a virtual power plant and bid using that energy asset and anyone who agreed to connect their power wall to the system would benefit from auto bidder Auto Meter is all about software and again for those who still think that Tesla is a plain old car company well there's certainly pretty good at software an auto bidder is just the tip of the iceberg so first off auto bidder which sounds like a product for trading cars but it's actually for energy though in the near future might be energy stored in cars basically the software uses strategies similar to rapid fire stock traders but in the energy market they connect to and look at multiple energy markets in order to immediately capitalize on opportunities using the energy asset study controls auto better uses machine learning something that Tesla specializes in to forecast prices loads generation and they use the weather data to make decisions one example that they gave at Tesla was that if there's going to be a big peak in demand auto bidder would jump in with its energy assets and supply the grid with power however the strategy was then to charge up the batteries after the peak which ended up causing a peak of its own so they learned to spread it out a little bit better throughout the day and so far they've had many learnings with the auto bidder product as they're in the midst of deploying it guys if you're enjoying the video so far please hit the thumbs up button we'd super appreciate that okay so people are buying power walls and vehicles these are distributed batteries how long will it take Tesla to create this distributed power plant and add the necessary hardware to its power wall devices and when will they launch this concept into a product it could take years to have everyone upgrade or buy new power walls the million mile battery needs to come out for vehicles and for this idea to be ironed out and the crazy amount of software that needs to be written to manage this complex problem so maybe we'll get some timelines at battery day right it might take a couple years well actually surprise Tesla has already done most of this Tesla says that they already have IOT chips on all of their devices or all of their products including their vehicles which are ready for vehicle-to-grid technology these are basically sensors that can measure certain things like temperature voltage etc they can also control aspects of the device with controllers for example accepting a remote command to in charging or discharging so they already have the necessary inverters in place furthermore each device that Tesla has already shipped has an edge computing platform built-in which you might already be familiar with and that's basically software running on a Linux operating system which is Tesla's platform of choice and they can do whatever they want with this software as long as they have these sensors or controllers existing for what they want to use it for and Tessa can push new software as usual over-the-air so we know that that's true for vehicles but it's also true for power walls and I guess it seems obvious but this is exactly what's required for the virtual power plant and all of the devices are already connected to the cloud and you can think of this cloud as being connected to the control center which can pull information from all of these devices and also send information and commands back to each individual device so this is a high-level view of Tesla's architecture which I thought was pretty cool they use WebSockets to communicate from the device to the cloud and they have Apache Kafka which is software for streaming loads of information from a distributed set of devices in this case so that's how they can send these sensor information to the server at the same time they can send commands back from the server to the device and this is found in every Tesla product you might already be familiar with the fact the Tesla has detailed logging for every vehicle that it can access remotely other automaker competitors have likely just started trying to copy Tesla with this and to view their devices as IOT devices I think they've been missing out because every car sold up until now or a couple years ago simply has no connection to the Internet at all but because Tesla is vertically integrated that's a key strength because they have access to all of the telemetry data from all aspects of power walls and the vehicles in terms of vehicles if you're an automaker and you purchased an electronic part from another supplier for example it might be more difficult to get fine-grained telemetry data or send commands that device that they're not supported on top of this tesla runs applications for example auto bidder which can talk to devices that contain a battery and that includes supercharger stations which is pretty exciting as well but from the application you might want to look at device data Tesla has a Postgres SQL database that's a typical relational database with rows and columns as sort of like looking at a microsoft excel sheet or grid they also use in flux DB which is a time series database and it's useful for perhaps making graphs using their data over a period of time and they say that they're going to store the data for the lifetime of the device so this is all stored on the server so there's basically infinite storage space they wouldn't store the complete history on the device itself because it would run out of storage space pretty quickly two other things I found very interesting was that Tessa says they do a lot of virtual modeling of real-life devices which they called digital twins that's basically just storing enough information or details about a specific real-life device so that they know its attributes and capabilities for example a particular device is an inverter here's the serial number it's in this power wall with this other serial number and that way they can do things like find me all of the devices in existence with this type of inverter in it or find me all setups with two or more power walls connected to each other the key here is that they have all of the data and they can query it any way they want the other thing is that Tesla says they have over 150 micro services running that's quite a bit these can be lightweight services that run as needed they say that they have one for real-time streaming aggregations which they use for their virtual power plant or their auto bidder application the nice thing about micro services is that they're separated from each other if one of the services were to go down for example it doesn't take down the whole system only that service would be down now one downside is that it may be difficult to manage so many micro services so in addition to that they use kubernetes which is well I believe it was originally developed by Google but what they use it for is to help keep their services running with no downtime say you want two copies of a service for redundancy or for load balancing kubernetes is great at scaling these applications up and restarting them when they fail they also use something I've haven't heard of but it's called akka and akka streams which is used for sending messages between services and IOT devices and such it's distributed and resilient so there's no single point of failure and it also runs on the Java Virtual Machine which is probably why Tesla uses a programming language called Scala which also runs on the Java Virtual Machine okay so with regards to the virtual power plant now that we've seen a high-level overview of Tesla software stack what they can do is is query all the devices attached to a certain node the devices each send back real-time day I guess it's what their real-time aggregations microservice was for and they can use this data in auto bidder for example to make decisions for energy trading what's cool is that they can query all of these different types of heterogeneous setups like for buildings and homes and what they would really be interested in in this example would be how much charge is on your battery right now and are you going to need that or can we use it and they aggregate everyone who replies back in is online in order to group together that energy to create this virtual grid for auto bidder I'd assume that since auto bidder is a professional tool it's given to the grid manager or centralized authority as we talked about earlier and that authority can only have access to the power walls within their network you can't have the hornist they'll power reserve in Australia accessing someone's power wall in the US and saying okay send me power because it's not on the same grid that would be pretty bad so having proper access rights is very important and I'm not sure exactly how Tesla knows which grid system or particular power wall is connected to they do say that they can organize or filter the devices by electrical substation topology I guess that would be set up when you install the power wall originally but correct me if I'm wrong I don't think power walls have GPS but again they don't move very often if you were to use a virtual power plant with Tesla vehicles as we talked about in our million mile battery video which many people believe would enable that technology and electric has reported that Tesla's I do have a bi-directional charger so they are set up for that but because vehicles move around a lot maybe the GPS would be useful for this to help determine which grid a vehicle is connected to or perhaps more reliably you could connect your vehicle to some sort of fixed asset like a power wall for this to work and that way you could use your vehicle to effectively participate in the energy trading thing at one location and then drive over and plug it into a different grid and use it there as well because I'm guessing what would happen is Tesla queries the network by electrical topology so it would have to know which assets are on which grid system they get the data that they need to make an offer and if they get accepted they send a message back to those devices with a command or instruction to start discharging power now that's all done over the internet but now the discharging of power is done on the grid which is effectively a different network so the two are sort of discs and in reality they're just modeled in software so you better be physically connected to the correct grid otherwise you could impact a different grid which may not be in the world if you're just a small number of power walls anyways the power wall or your car batteries start to discharge and altogether with a combined power of all the devices discharging it will boost the grid during a peak time and then your grid or substation could sell that power to a nearby grid system for example or use it itself okay as I said earlier the idea of a virtual power plant isn't exactly something that Tesla invented there are competitors one company which is also located in California is called n phase I had actually owned a small amount of their stock for just a couple weeks and I sold it a few weeks ago for no reason in particular other than it was up and I liked the company the ticker symbol is Iain pH now they install solar panels and they also have battery solutions they're very similar to a pure play on Tesla's energy division and it looks like they partnered with this company called green sync to basically do a virtual power plant solution so I still think that Tesla is is better they're much better because they have more scale they have they're completely vertically integrated as we talked about and they have the vehicle side of things as well which could possibly cannibalize power walls depending on how Tesla does this or it's going to complement power walls if the vehicle needs some sort of reliable connection point to the grid which would be pretty good for Tesla now model three is like four or five power walls on wheels so it has the advantage of being mobile but with a company like n phase you can capture the upside of just the energy division whereas the Tesla a large portion of the business will always be vehicle sales so Tesla seems to already be quietly rolling out this technology and it is absolutely game-changing I think the adoption will start with auto bidder that's the killer app with large power providers use auto bidder even if they don't have batteries they can unlock the power of the batteries on their grid it's really a win-win for the power providers who may be able to offload or avoid upgrading expensive infrastructure and they can buy and sell electricity at better rates a Tesla of course because they're offering this end-to-end solution they can make money off the power and subsidize their own products and be highly competitive and also the consumers who can out profit or save money off their power walls and vehicles one asset that I think is overlooked is that Tesla already has a giant distributed network of supercharger stations which could be connected to the virtual power plant using their battery systems and also the vehicles that are charging many superchargers are also powered by solar panels so they already have energy generation and they have access to storage so I think the supercharger network can take advantage of this system when it's not in use by vehicle charging I think that can actually save Tesla a lot of money and also make them extra cash by selling reserves at peak times and by buying them back when they're cheap so they may be able to pass on some of these savings to consumers to actually sell electricity below the regular cost which will make them hugely competitive to their competitors who are already usually more expensive anyways so for example this supercharger station has 20 cars charging right now and someone wants to offload some energy to it they can power up all those cars with cheaper power so overall the virtual power plant is a difficult problem to solve there's many many parts all distributed everywhere on the planet there are also local laws and different geographies that Tesla would need to abide by but with Tesla's software and hardware expertise and the fact that there are a leader in battery technology and figuring out how to scale battery production up to new levels this makes the virtual power plant a perfect and lucrative addition to their business and guys let us know in the comments below if you think Tesla will start aggressively rolling out virtual power plant solutions after battery day and if you think super chargers can benefit from the virtual power plant or if there's any assets that Tesla has that we may have missed also leave us any comments or questions on Tesla's million-mile batteries their software stack or if you think power wall will be cannibalized by vehicles or will work complementary to them alright guys I hope you enjoyed this video please hit the like button we'd
