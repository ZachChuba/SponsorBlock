[Music] hey guys it's applet welcome back again to my channel so today is the last video before Halloween so that means the last you're gonna see of the Halloween themed stuff anyway for today's video I've been getting many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many requests for me to do another drawing euro C's video but I thought that maybe today I could try something a bit different if you've read the title and if you saw my community tab you would know that I asked you guys to send me some photos of yourselves so that I could choose a few of you and redraw you but with a spooky twist to it so I'm gonna be turning my subscribers into different sorts of monsters for Halloween before we get into today's today's video anyway let's just get into the video so the first person that I've chosen to draw for today's is a girl named Paige she sent this image to me which I'm going to keep up in the top left corner as well as everybody that I draw for this series I'm just gonna keep their reference up there so you can kind of compare to what I'm drawing so for this video in particular I started off before drawing it all by deciding what types of monsters I would turn the people that I chose into and it was really just a gut feeling kind of thing so this might sound silly but because Paige had such a big smile on her face I decided to make her into a vampire because I wanted to change her smile into her teeth and her smile into having fangs and then change her outfit and like different details like that to make her a vampire so yeah I mean this this could be a new series on my channel depending if you guys like it I know as I said before a lot of you have been requesting my during your o'seas series again and I still am doing those but I definitely want to change it up a little bit and this is definitely really fun as I was sketching out the picture of Paige I mean you guys know that I really love drawing portraits and her face is really animated and so I couldn't not draw it also the fact that she has glasses I think just look really good with the overall look I was going for the black frames contrast really well with her outfit which you'll see later so something I was really excited to draw out which I already sketched out here but it was her her hair style specifically she's kind of got like a short pixie cut but I really liked her swoopy bangs and I was like those are so fun to draw I know I probably sound really lame like an art nerd but like there's certain things that you just like drawing you know what it means and I like drawing swoopy hair so pretty standard coloring for her it worked out that I wanted to turn her into a vampire because she was already pretty pale and I didn't have any colors any lighter than my normal peach skin tone colors so I just went ahead and used what I had but you know they always look a little darker when I put them down at first tried to not use too too much of my darker colors like e11 which is barley beige but you know I still needed that to shade a little bit but yeah I tried to keep her pale because she is a vampire and I debated on whether I should turn her eyes red or not she has these like greenish blue eyes as you can tell from the reference photo in the corner and I was like maybe I should turn them red for a vampire but I don't know I felt like it would be a really nice pop of color because as you'll see I was planning for this drawing to carry out the colors red black white and some Browns and gold's in her hair so I felt that the blueish green was a really nice pop of color something I was also really excited to color in were the lips because whenever I'm drawing semi realistic looking mouths like this in portraits I always have a lot of fun coloring in the lips with different shades and stuff and I always make the upper lip a little bit darker than the lower lip that's just a stylistic thing but I also think it looks better because the lower lip is the one you typically would shade it a little bit more like have the highlight in the center of the lower lip and so the upper lip can just stay dark and then you put more of the gradients into the lower lip at least that's how I color it for her hair I didn't want to leave the highlights in her hair just plain white so I filled them in with a golden color that I had on me side note before I colored her hair in brown I actually was going to refill my brown Copic marker and I accidentally filled in or refilled East 70 which is not the same color at all and I was so mad because I just like basically wasted a bunch of brown ink and put it into the wrong marker basically like destroying the color in that marker so I was a bit of a dude but I filled up my brown marker and ended up using it I'll figure out what to do with East 70 now I don't know it's not a 70 anymore but we'll see as you can see for her outfit yeah I kind of turned it until like a vampire esque outfit with a big collar I gave her an earring and some red accents and then for a little Circle in the background I decided for this portrait to do a half circle instead of a full circle behind her I colored it in red because kinda remind me of like a Blood Moon and so I felt that that looked really good and like I said the Papa colors on the eyes I think was the better choice than to do red I think it would have been too much red so yeah let me know what you think Paige I hope you liked the way I drew you and that I turned you into a vampire and now onto the next subscriber [Music] so the next subscriber that I chose to draw is Jordan as you can tell in the top left corner Jordan if you see yourself that this is you so for Jordan I was trying to decide what to turn her into and I was cycling through a few different ideas but you know like I said my process my mic that my thought process might sound kind of silly I don't really care if it sounds silly but okay here's my thought process so she's wearing a hat a visor and I thought to myself well why don't I just play off the elements in the drawing so I want to take the Hat and change it into something and maybe some of the nature aspects and use that too and so I decided to turn her into a witch and change her hat into a witch hat and then include some of the floral elements like behind her kind of like it is in the photo um whether you think that's silly or not I don't really care that was just my thought process so yeah I tried to frame her kind of in the center I knew her witch hat would be going off the page anyway because it's so large so there's no way I could have fit the whole thing on here but at least that her portrait portion was in the center of the paper was the important part to me now her hair was actually one of the main reasons I chose to draw her because it's just so cool like she's got two tones so she's got like half black and half blue and but it's like this bright electric blue and it was really cool and I was like I think this could make for like a really cool witchy theme because it's like that pop of color and like unconventional hairstyle not just one color so I felt that that could play well off the whole theme I was going for here and also I personally have never drawn cornrows before or this type of hairstyle in general and so I felt that that would be really cool I'm trying to branch out into different types of hairstyles and things like that that I don't necessarily draw because technically when I sit down to draw I fall into and I mean I think a lot of us do this we fall into the same kinds of things we always draw and same types of you know like faces or same types of hairs aisles are just outfits and it's really nice to try to push yourself to branch out so that's one of the reasons why I like doing these types of videos is because you guys are basically giving me the prompts you're giving me the pictures I just choose which ones I want to draw and I can just be creative with it from there so here I filled in all of her skin and now I'm on to doing the eyes but like honestly throughout this whole thing I just couldn't wait to get to the hair I was like so excited because I had like the perfect colors it's like these two blue tones that I don't typically use too much when I'm coloring with my copics just because they are so bright that I don't really have much to shade them with in general but I was like this is literally gonna be perfect because her I wanted her hair to stand out and so why not um so for the actual shading of her hair I went in and first I just wanted to shade underneath the Hat where like the Hat is just kind of covering over her head and then I went in with my for the bolt I started with the black portions and then I moved on to the blue but I went in and outlined all each individual braids in her hair and then went in and filled it in with my really dark Gray's and tried to give it kind of like different shades in between so like lighter grays and darker Gray's mix in there to kind of show that the light is bouncing off her hair and then I went in and I did the same thing with the blues I used a dark blue marker to outline each section and then went in and colored all of it and I really really like how it came out I think it captured it pretty well let me know how I did um I'm just trying to learn so let me know if I did a good job with that type of hairstyle and then I went in and I colored the rest of her accessories and her outfit so I wanted to do a really deep purple for the Hat and not a black because her hair already has some of it black and that's a lot of the part that's touching the Hat at the top of her head and the side of her head there is black so I didn't want black on black it would have just mixed in too much and you wouldn't have really seen the separation of her hat so I figured using a dark purple would work well and also still be like super witchy anyway I his purples and stuff are for the season I colored in the band black and then I added a orange kind of like a marigold but not really orange flower on the hair they're using one of my prismacolor markers that I had laying around from a previous subscription box and then for her outfit I just wanted to color that in black all black dark like no no shading or anything just pure black and added some little white lines to it to give it a little bit of a little I don't know pop color there and last thing I did here was I went in like I said I wanted to incorporate some of those leaves that were behind her so she's kind of like a naturey witch and filled in right behind her half a circle of orange to kind of match the orange in her little flower on her head and that is how I colored Jordan let me know if you like what I did here if you like the colors I used if I did a good job Jordan I hope you enjoy here's you as a witch happy Halloween and now on to my final thoughts
