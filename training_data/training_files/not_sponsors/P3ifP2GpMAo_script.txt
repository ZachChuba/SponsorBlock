everybody knows one plus one is equal to two by no - it's SMS one plus one okay okay that's do some math of fun here work on compute the square root of 100 times banjo and 100 2 times 9 3 and then plus 1 everything sings out the square root of course we will not be using a calculator because otherwise where's the fun right and as always please pause the video and try this first okay hopefully get to have a chance to try it and let me tell you guys that the answer to this right here is 25 and then 15 and then 0 1 like this yeah of course I didn't do this in my head I did this beforehand and I memorize the answer and I just put on the answer for you guys by the way I'll show you guys how to do this right here and here's a deal whenever the question is asking you to compute some crazy-looking expression without a calculator usually don't use a calculator use algebra for it of course if you can use a calculator it's the easiest but you're using a calculator why are you watching my video for this right so we all make the observation so we can see how to change this into an algebra equation and as we are not the easiest way to compute square roots that we hope the insights just a perfect square that's the best one right so maybe the insides actually a perfect square you will see so here we go let me write this down here for you guys we will make some observations first of all notice that we do have a nice pattern right here and if you call the first number to be X and the next number will be X plus 1 and then we have X plus 2 and this number will be X plus 3 and don't forget a plus 1 right there as well and now don't multiply these out in comparators entirely because that would be just as bad as doing this by hand in the first place right huh let's see first of all though you might be wondering could we let this be X so this is X minus 1 and this is X plus 1 and X plus 2 word up easier you can give you a try I will continue from here right so let's see well seriously we are not going to multiply everything out but if you look at because you have done so ultra so many times if you multiply this and that you can sound pretty nice is pressure and let me write that down right before you guys again just this in that we will end up X square plus 3 X plus 2 and this is very nice because if you multiply out the rest which is this X with the X plus 3 right here they are going to be very similar because you are going to get X square plus 3 and notice this right here has the plus 2 this right here just the first two terms right here so they are pretty similar to each other and don't forget the plus one right here yet and now here's the deal everybody knows one plus one is equal to two by no - it's a same s 1 plus 1 well I feel like a genius already check this out look at this - I'm going to look at the 2 s 1 plus 1 and by doing so I can do kit insight as four terms this this this and that right and I have this in front so I would distribute this carefully first of all this is how we will do it I will take this right here and distributed with the first three terms so we will end up x squared plus 3x and then the first three terms himself this parenthesis we get x squared plus 3x plus one like this and then we'll take this times the one which is just that by itself right so we can just write down plus x squared plus 3x times 1 which is doesn't matter and then thankfully we have another plus one right here that's very nice and you'll see that this is technically our first term because we're these times that and then you have this right here this is the same as that so we can actually factor this and that out very nice so here's the deal I will factor this out we get x squared plus 3x plus 1 and the left over is this right here which is x squared plus 3x and just like you out about teacher will tell you don't forget it's like this and you have the one right here so you have to put down the plus one like this very nice as you all know the best friend of black pen is of course repent this and that they're best friends why because together they produce a perfect square so we get x squared plus 3x plus 1 to the second power this is very nice and now the original expression is just going to be you can put this inside and of course this end our can so very nice and you just get x squared plus 3x plus 1 and your profound doing there so you get parentheses 500 square plus 3 times 500 and then plus one master see guess don't you guys just love the Google algebra days right anyway it multiplied everything you get that number so this is it maybe you guys noticed this is very similar to the answer that we got found at video right few days ago because can leave a comment down below let me know what the video is all about right which video am I talking you think it ssj4 all of their courses another question for you guys is that is this a prime number just think about as well very cool question anyway probably gets all like this video if you do please give me a like if you're new to my channel be sure to subscribe thank you guys so much and as always that's it
