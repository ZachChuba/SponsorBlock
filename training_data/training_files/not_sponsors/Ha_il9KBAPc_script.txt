probably our most famous flora or one of at least globally Shirley originally I wanted to do something like this but I feel like it would be nicer if it's just a nice gradient background with a nice simple silhouette of gum leaves then text over the tops I think I'll just have to jump into it and see how it looks and then if it doesn't look good I'll try again [Applause] [Music] Petrus saying it's like it well so well lit must standing on a big mount right now would you say you're professional photographer how weird I feel like you owe everybody shots yeah okay maybe not the pink but look

good as the high holy that's so good and also I think you than any cheaper that I've ever seen in my whole life we're never seen a puppy though right yeah I never see a pop alone but I don't care [Music] today I've just been working I had a meeting with my mentor figure he was my ex boss and basically he works in America now so I don't see him very often but it was really refreshing because it reminded me that I want to a try and living overseas at some point and also be I need to restructure my business that are this more sustainable and less like scary for me we ended up getting coffee which lasted for like four hours so what to eat most I didn't join coffee I had a nice chocolate because coffee is gross [Music] wakey-wakey time you have a you have a guest anyway so this is like an independent illustrator lady and I ordered one of their gentle and it feels that she sent me two of them but she made a forest great journaling like a p-channel oh they look we like my perfect journal layouts I'm really excited like oh this is beautiful it's a forest green one how gorgeous is it and oh this is beautiful and I was like there must have been so expensive to make she's like yes I was like oh my god how much were there to buy $40 each why we got one and then she sent me an extra that's cute yeah so sharee over lunch yeah let me the pink one well she left you an idea yes oh that's a rude thank you so much lovely shot I hope these diaries witness beautiful things Bianca oh wow this is what the details been Matt so no she's like a letter uh so she would have done she's looked handwritten holidays and stuff in Oh perfect layout she's just from I think Melvin oh can i what yet but I want the green one so you can have to have the pink one oh yeah I want the pink one I ordered the green which one do I like actually I think I like the green when I have journals I like when it has all the day's laid out in one spread and then have like somewhere that I can write my weekly listen and bring it I believe that's called week to a page and I like that the weekends are the same width as the normal days because I don't know when I'm working thank you the empty cash I set up the lights in the camera cuz I was gonna film a Q&A but I really felt blah and I didn't feel like really doing it I have no idea why but for some reason rocket suggested that we just do it while getting drive-thru it would be good and I said yeah though good because that was an option that involves food yeah I think I don't do the video about people that II did they call it was like a Content cuff I like food reviewers that eat in their car luckily are not reviewing food I'm reviewing your questions we're in the costume and we never left at somehow because I don't know why okay whatever just look putrid I feel like I've got a lot of conflicting styles or ways of working I feel like in a way it stops me from doing things as I feel nothing fits aesthetically do you have any tips should I find one thing and stick to that or should I keep doing many things what's your opinion alright I feel like I relate let me tell you about my life story I was born in 1992 I think it's purely just having to put in more hours to be able to refine and be able to decide what you want to focus more on this is practice practice practice and then it's such a layman it's such a lame advice but it's like so true the closest thing I have to that is when I was starting out with digital and I couldn't reconcile my digital style and my traditional style because the mediums was so different that my work in digital was really flat whereas my work that my traditional work was really really textured so I guess my advice would be if you you need to decide whether you want to be a specialized illustrator or a designer or whatever you creative field um or if you want to be a generalized and generate isn't bad because generalized you can get a lot more commercial work it doesn't rely on your popularity at the time it doesn't rely on trends because you're able to be a chameleon of sorts yeah I have lots of friends that a commercial illustrators and they're killing it suggests she has a styling I can tell it's hers but she's also really good at just keeping to the brief and I feel like I can do that in a way too but I've I've chosen to be more specialized and that's just come with that's just me being opportunistic with how my career has come about I think if people approached me me for my style anyway so I don't really need to do it whereas when I was a designer I'd have to to evolve my style a little bit more to suit the client and that's important to just hard for people to go down the route of like not being stylized because instantly as soon as you see somebody that has this body work that so style is you like you kind of just feel really down about yours because then you like their being able to make a living and they can express themselves and have this like thing that's like a dares yeah what about Jessica heaves she does crazy different typography or lettering even Gemma yeah she does crazy different lettering if you're gonna generalize I think you just need to work really hard to refine lots of your different styles to a certain level because what's probably what people probably are not as comfortable with is the fact that when you're working with all these different styles it's a lot slower to like increase your skill set because you have to refine all these different styles I think she said something like should she try and combine them you can't do that I think you need to find one style first though or be very sure about all the different stars so that you know you can figure out which parts to like pluck and not morph together well your commercial work is really very depending on what client is like you're really good at working to a brief yeah and that's really great and that means you get the really high paying jobs because you're giving the clients exactly what they want at a very high quality yeah and I'm sort of at that stage as well I've been doing all this commercial work and I kind of feel like I don't have like my style and I get really envious of everyone around me that has this style and now I'm sort of pursuing something as well which is just like driven by myself and you can always do that later on what you pressure to get everything done now make it perfect now we all need to relax a little bit because it's like burning everyone out and making everyone feel like crap hey just be happy make what makes you feel happy do you and rocket have any non career goals in mind could be for the year or for like long term goals etc hope you both well like somebody there is just trying to fish to see if we're gonna get married you know my husband and I but I don't really have any known career related goals cuz like my career is like what makes me happy it's my whole life what about like living overseas we want to do that eventually you have a couple places in mind I wanted to for this year buy a new car take that one off or one day I'd like to buy a house that might never happen yeah how have you found integrating I don't welcome elements into your more analog practice from question yeah that is a good question um Thank You Bella for the great question it's been really difficult for me because I haven't been able to it easily and convincingly achieve like the textures and feel that I want at the end of last year I really established a most simple style it's almost like a part of my work that can be simple like reviewing the motifs that I used in my work for let's say like the houses the trees and having those motifs that I use in my watercolor work and drawings meant that it could easily translate to to digital because it wasn't about the styles about what the subject was and you know what I mean and the simplicity of it the iPad made it a lot easier at first because it's like with my walk um I initially had like an inch or so I didn't have a screen on it and so having the iPad being able to see where I was drawing and also the realistic feel of the pencil was really good and that was kind of like a bridge for me to using the Wacom which I got because I did a job with them I'm creating some like outlook for their magazine so I used the iPad for portable stuff when we're traveling or just going to cafes and working or doing sketches and then I use the welcome for like heavy duty work like doing vector illustration and doing like big Photoshop files yeah what do you have to say about improvement slash motivation to get better as an artist again practice practice practice motivation that I really want to answer it my answers basically is gonna be like quoting you because I think I know I think your answer to motivation is actually genuinely really good basically what I tore up if he feels I'm motivated is that being motivated is not the way to work you need discipline so basically you need to force yourself to work especially when you're a professional creative because you're not always gonna want to draw and you're not always gonna want to take photos but there's deadlines and they don't move just because you don't feel like it so you need to get into the habit of being able to work when you need to and that doesn't mean you need to burn yourself out you need to recognize when you're burning out and when you're just feeling lazy I've said that before like complacency versus laziness but basically it's not it's like when when I'm like oh how do I lose weight and it's like go to the gym and it's like oh I didn't want that answer I wanted an easy way there's no easy way even I have it where I'm like I don't feel like doing it and so I'm just like I have to do and even though the starts just kind of like I want to die not literally once you get into it then it gets a lot easier once you know that you can just jump into it and just push yourself to do it even though you don't want to it won't seem so difficult each time you do it we all face it we could all get over it we just have to do it if it becomes stagnate and you feel like you can't work sometimes changing your location gives you like a fresh start it's very distracting to be in the studio because there's so many things but if you go to a cafe and you all you have is what you need to be working on for example like video editing or emails or photo editing or sketches or pitching then you have to get it done because there's no other distraction of like oh maybe I'll just work on this or maybe I'll just play video games I always find it also just feels like motivating as well I look up and there's just like people that look successful and people are just living their life and then you're like you know what this it really is not very big I think you're different to a lot of people baby because you get motivated when you see things that you would like but comparison stuff is not good for a lot of people like that person has that I'll never have that it makes me sad where's your like that person is that I want that I'm getting that are you working towards any sort of solar trade this year or potentially another launch event for your next book project I love your work and sharing it with as many people as possible as a blessing for us all and who names fun I think or that's how you name it still cute I would love to do a solo show this year that's one of my major goals and then I would love to do like a mini solo show too because I want to learn how to do like ceramics and paints and bars but we'll see if that one happens that's kind of on the back burner I'm not sure if I'll launch my next book this year because it's a bit bit late and I still haven't submitted my manuscript so I think it's gonna have to be like a 2019 release I'm gonna be in a group exhibition oh sure we have a group exhibition on Wednesday which is gonna be like the coming Wednesday after this is released here is the fly up bulla it's a bunch of like established Sydney based artists that are trying a new medium so the group says I just kind of like a challenge I'm using gouache Rocket's gonna be drawing I think or painting I'm doing some form of non firt photographic work yeah come see us if you want to we're gonna probably gonna be there all night so yeah yeah do it bench I might be there if you don't if you don't like asking for bento yeah I feel like that's enough to you I just squarespace.com slash burn little page thank you for watching have a lovely day see ya I'll see you soon hopefully I want to hear my prediction yeah what I reckoned that in a hundred I reckon that in 500 years humans won't have pinky toes yeah because why do we need them we don't they help me balance like if you're a monkey obviously their pinky toes are so long sweetheart yeah and now the trunk trunk trunk will just be treetops texting texting texting maybe some index fingers too yeah that's nice anyway we're going home now do you like my friend my face track track traffic my face
