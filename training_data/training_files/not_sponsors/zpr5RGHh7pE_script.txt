>> [singing] Hush little
burrito, don't you cry. Don't say no words or you're going to die. I've got a shiv and it has your name, and if I get caught, it's you I'll blame. >> That was really good. [laughing] I didn't know if I could land that! >> You nailed it! [laughing] >> You nailed it, sir! [film projector crackle] >> All right, when we
decided to do this episode, we called it a prison burrito. I did not realize that a prison burrito is the same thing as spread, because I have had friends
who have gotten out of minimum-security prison
and have cooked for me. They invited me and my wife over, and we had a whole meal
and they made us spread! So, the moment I saw these ingredients, I'm like, I thought we were
doing a burrito, not spread! >> This is spread? >> Yeah! >> I thought that meant something
very different in prison. >> In prison, right, so spread is, the way I had it was in a bowl. I guess when it's in a
bowl and kind of loose, it's spread, but we're going to condense it
into, like, a fat carby bar. >> Yeah, kind of a paste almost. Here's our base. >> Yep
>> This is our burrito. We're going to take a
bunch of these Doritos, and we need the bag too, so we've got to be careful with the bag. >> Now, I believe the recipe is-- We see multiple of them online, they all disagree, they're all different. We're going to do our best guess on this, but in this case, this is more Doritos than
we actually need, right? >> Yeah, and of course
like with any chips, if you look in there-- >> It's mostly air. >> It's mostly air. >> Here, let's get rid of maybe
a little over half of that. Do you think? >> Okay, sure, just-- So the first thing we do is, we're going to mix this with the ramen. >> Okay, but do we-- I know there's some
crunching at some point. Do we crunch them all together, or do we crunch them separate? >> Yes, you mash that up. You can just mash it
in the bag if you want. >> Can I confess something? >> Let's do it. >> I love ramen so
much, that I figured out that if you take out
this biscuit of ramen, you run it under the tap
so it's all just wet. You open up that seasoning, and you just sprinkle
that seasoning over it, and you just eat it like a cracker. >> Really? >> It's the best thing ever, so good! >> Man, if it wasn't so high in sodium, I would totally do that. >> Well you can self regulate, just put a little bit on there. >> What's your flavor of choice? >> Chicken or shrimp. Sometimes beef. So we want it all the way down to dust? >> Yeah, you want to get it-- I mean, the ramen is not so important that you get it to dust, but I think the burrito, since
that's the main substrate. >> When I think of a burrito, I think of something
wrapped in a flour tortilla, but we're subverting that, I mean, it will be more a--
>> Like a tamale almost. >> Like one of those deep fried burritos. >> Oh, like a chimichanga? >> Yeah, right? >> Mm, Chimichangas, it's going to be good.
>> It's going to be delish. >> All of the recipes that
I've seen have the ramen-- You can see the little
chunks of ramen in there. >> And I would imagine you probably want a little bit of that texture. So here's the question: are we going to put in just
part of a flavor packet, or the whole flavor packet? >> I don't know man, because those packets go a long way, right? >> They do. And it's not like it's going to be diluted with a whole bunch of
water on there, either. All right, are we adding
this whole thing in there? >> I don't know, what do you think? >> BRIAN: That's perfectly dusty. >> JASON: Do you think that's right? >> Yeah.
All right, so what, add this? >> Yeah, go ahead and put that in there. >> BRIAN: So you mix all that
up there, I assume, right? >> Yeah mix it all up really good, and we're going to go ahead and put some Slim Jims in there. Some of the other recipes that
we've seen have stuff like, Cheez-its or different
flavored Doritos, Fritos, whatever you like. >> A lot of that sounds very carb-centric. This might be the only really robust part of the whole thing. I'm not getting too fancy. I'm just going to make a bunch
of little cubes of Slim Jim. >> JASON: No, that's good! >> This is one of those
moments where, on paper, I should be all in on this, because I love each of these
individual ingredients, but I'm still a little bit
afraid of the outside chance that it's just like, I have one bite and I just die of salt poisoning. >> The sodium count in
here is going to be like, at renal failure levels. [chuckles] All right, so what,
throw all these in there? >> JASON: Yeah, put them in there. >> We have the roast
beef flavoring packet. You want to put half of it in there? >> I think that sounds good. >> Okay >> It's a delicious gray color. >> BRIAN: [laughs] Look
at that fine spread. This is the part where we
add hot water, warm water? >> Very hot water. >> Okay, so should I zap
this just shy of boiling? >> Yeah, yeah, get it really good. >> Okay, I think we're
just shy of boiling here. So how much are we-- Whoa, whoa, whoa! >> You all right? >> That was a slip and boiling
water went on my hand there. Everything's fine. We're all fine here; we're good. So do I fill it up to the line, or what? >> Fill it, yeah, you want
to get everything wet, but you don't want to get it too soup-y. So, it's kind of a guessing game. >> BRIAN: All right, here we go. [water pouring] >> JASON: Yeah, it says
pour hot water into the bag. Just enough to cover everything. What we do is we want
to keep the heat in-- >> This is hot. >> So, make an air-tight
pocket with the Dorito bag. And then we're going to
wrap it in this towel to preserve the heat, and let it sit for about
ten to fifteen minutes. >> BRIAN: Oh, oh wow! Okay. >> It's really pretty amazing
how many of these recipes involve cooking something
in a bag of Doritos. >> I'll tell you what, man. That Mylar is amazing stuff. That's part of the reason
that people thought it was an alien that landed at Roswell. Is because in the 1940s,
nobody had seen Mylar before. That's why you see these reports of, like, a strange type of metal that
nobody's ever seen before. That was the Mylar from a weather balloon. >> Agree to disagree. >> Okay, all right. [both laughing] Go back to your documentaries
of ancient aliens! [laughter] >> Don't you throw that in my face! [cackling] >> JASON: Oh, it's warm too? Okay. >> [gasps] Oh, you're
swaddling your baby burrito! >> Swaddle your burrito, and then we're going to sing to it. [giggles] >> All right, moment of truth! What do you think? Does it feel-- It feels still a little bit warm, but you can feel how firm it is. >> Is it firm? Is it a firm baby burrito? >> [Brian} It's as firm as anything I'd get from Taco Bell, right? I mean, actually it does feel pretty warm. >> Yeah? >> I guess at this point-- Here, feel that. Is it too warm, should we let it wait? >> It is, it is pretty warm, but you know, food's good when it's warm, generally. >> Yeah, okay. So, let's see. What, do you just bite
this to get that started? >> Or, this little seam?
>> Oh, the seal! Smarter, smarter, that's smarter. Use your teeth to get it started. >> Or not! [laughter] That's what they did online! [bag crinkling] >> Hulk, sun's getting real low. [both laughing] >> JASON: Okay, do this. >> Perfect. >> What a good baby burrito. [giggling] That's right.
Who didn't call me out? That's right, you didn't! It's still very mushy, I feel like we can leave
it out to dry for a while, and it would be-- [burrito thuds] [both laughing] A little bit too much water. >> Go on.
>> Too much water. >> JASON: What do you
think, how does it taste? >> When you love all of the ingredients that goes into a thing, you tend to love the thing. >> Uh, I don't know! One time I put mayonnaise on a cherry pie, didn't work so well.
>> Oh God, I can't believe you said that. I can't believe that
thought is in my mind now. I have to bury myself
in this delicious spread in order to make that go away. >> It's not bad. >> It does make a difference
when you get a bite with a Slim Jim in there. It's much better with that
meaty texture on there. >> I want to make this with, like, all sorts of other types of chips now. Ooh, dude, funions! >> Oh, that sounds awesome. >> We haven't even done a weed episode. [cackling] >> We're going out of order! We got to pair this with the CBD oil! >> That's right! >> I don't know how to
rank this or rate it. >> Mm, it's edible! That's how I'm going to rate it! It's actually, I mean, you keep taking bites. I keep taking bites. It's not disgusting,
it's got a good flavor. >> Here's the important question: is the sum greater than all the parts? Would you rather have those
individual ingredients, or would you rather have it
all together exactly like this? >> Uh, you know what? With a little bit of sauce on here, like, maybe some enchilada
sauce or some sour cream. I don't know what you
can get in the commissary or steal from the mess hall, but-- I think this would actually be better! >> I think it's better. It does taste like a
meal, it eats like a meal. It's delish. So, I'm going to say, well done prison! >> Good job! >> And well done for you to not talkin'. >> Doritos, Slim Jim, ramen. F, marry, kill? >> I would marry Slim Jim, because it reminds me of
Macho Man Randy Savage >> That is a very legitimate reason, but I would totally kill. Also, I did not kill
Macho Man Randy Savage. [laughter] >> [exaggerated masculine voice] Oh, yeah! [laughter] >> [exaggerated masculine
voice] Prison burrito is ready! [laughing]
