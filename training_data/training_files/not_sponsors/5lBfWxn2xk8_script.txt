it's time for a change of plan my bank value on runescape has been sat between 60 and 120 ml for a long long time every time I got a paddle old school runescape I stake my entire Bank I haven't really been able to get my bank value past the 140 ml mark and I feel like it's time to start taking initiative instead of waiting for money to come so for that reason the spectra hunt is over and from now I will start grinding for the inferno cabe despite having little to no sleep of late I was rather confident about my first Inferno run on this account if only there was a champion seal of the Drake I'm so rusty at the inferno that this happened on my first attempt I made the same joke back in 2017 when I first got my cape on my Mane and no one found it funny anyway as you can tell by my setup here my bank clearly is worth more than 60 mil this is a story of how I was able to afford an SGS in one day okay first things first I gotta go to my player in house and build that dummy you can use an ancient mace special attack on the combat dummy and it raises your prayer level above your base prayer level unfortunately the cost of this is about over a meal because I have to use a black mask I want to start doing runs as soon as possible so I'm going to do 14 hours straight of zorro we start the Soraa grinder where we left off on the last episode yes magic Frank eight free for Casey I'm rich I've made it we've done it it's over it were nothing is over everything Sony just begun really whoa dude what the hell why did I get steel arrows no I clicked withdraw now no you didn't see nothing in my sneeze Bros inside my brain and my nasal right now it's just 99.9% anti-bacterial rated It's Made first all that Scotch one it looking good actually I might get PB yo new PB on the eyedropper count one minute 16 seconds I'm gaming I have a lot of youtube series on my radar that I've got a watch actually I've been really behind on watching risky I got another magic Fang oh my god it's happening today let's go my 73 kills so fast seventeen point four million tastic I'd been gaming for four hours straight and that was my second unique at zora in 73 kills hilarious idaho as i've made 17 military of myself to an ancestral hat and i've upgraded my infinity boots to eternal boots let's go that is such a nice drop that's worth well over 250 k 100 kills already today 20 mil made very very nice right i'm gonna try and scrape together for a majors book let's see if i can do it all spear seed sort red thought i've got pet right let's check the bank value wow I can't believe it we have a nice nearly 100 mil no way oh yeah I'm actually quite shocked mm-hmm there you go guys just gotta sell thousand kills it's already nice the Big Z pet is one in 4,000 so I've had a pretty good shot at getting this pet it's definitely my most killed boss on this account and I only really tend to do it was some rebuilding but this time I'm doing it to save up for something so I kind of need to avoid getting this pet right now oh wow it's got a new PB I didn't think that was a fast kill but it turns out it was nice my Zora trips are definitely more fluent now that I got vengeance okay I only need about five more millon til I can afford this s yes oh we're done wow that's a good note to end on ah yeah boy all right tanzanite Fang on 1070 Casey 250 v Zahra in 14 or 15 hours i've done 2 55 Zara 3 uniques and I've made 41.4 email nice here is the final price check of the grind to the SGS I cannot believe I managed her by an SGS pretty much all in one day 255 Zora kills took me about 14 to 15 hours my dink out no big way to the bones on the Iron Man account finally I might have some buffed and curl it I hope I get a feature in a knife habit I'm going to get the dragon full helmet I can't stop [ __ ] pogchamp I hope I don't get one of those stupid potions they have a free to cool down like food run away and let make a suggestion but that feminidiot because I made Gianni I have returned but this time to mock you for your lack of a rim top I ended up getting 20 a dee-nice which is the most expensive item you can get from two turbos that isn't the dragon for helm but I want to go for a cape on this account I could do with getting an Arabs top so back to barrows I go hey 686 KC why are you wearing a 38 shield it's actually my best in slot 4 barracks a bit of a weird flexing all right about to open chest number 700 I've been doing barrows all day today and I've had I've had nothing I think I'm about 50 for dry and we're still drying our rims what the [ __ ] is that whoa for such haste monster whopper on the 707 'the kc i believe i don't have that item I don't and I also don't have a Varrick helmet I probably want one of those too yo Derek legs are 1 point 1 mil 714 KC and I don't have that item either I got bought a Barrow so I went to saradomin God was here's what happened are you kidding no I don't accept that as a drop right now bastard and here is a reminder of why I will probably never make another hardcore Ironman the servers are very packed right now with this whole lockdown thing happening so yeah credit where credit is due I think there were only server issues for like 5 days and then Jonas got their [ __ ] together and the servers have been really good ever since but I did die sadly I don't need one you should save them for skilless ok let's sell this giant zara tab and buy a Sarah diamonds God's sword this has been such a crazy day I can't believe I've managed to get 48 Mel back fast unfortunately I can't afford to keep my ring of suffering for Inferno attempt so I'll have to go in with an archers ring but at least I can use the SGS no no guys just died just died guys I don't wanna moan but I'm gonna moan I there was another clip where I died but I just I got angry changuk's I don't I don't really want to show it yeah long story short I called them bugger pissed shits the servers are dreadful at the minute but I'm hoping they resolve soon I gotta have to catch a lot of red Chin's here to buy back supplies alright this run is looking pretty good I've used a couple words but I'm very okay otherwise yeah I really got to relearn these corner safe spots hello darkness my old friend I am once again seeking financial aid at black chin chompers again I've run out of money first supplies again I think I have to catch like 200 Chin's every time I die at the inferno pit risky vert is gonna be done as a hunter level place your best in front okay poor night hunter first let's have a look at the amount of Chin's I got well 4.3 ml and Chin's already a 83 hunter absolutely huge level I can now catch what are they called draconian in plinks wait I think I have a master clear in the bank I should go do that I I've got to do a quest for it though the the penguin one I need help making my [ __ ] work clockwork use your Spade on or dig next to the newly-built how to cover it in snow don't mind if I do talk to talk yeah talk to lat yeah they talk to Larry to enter and pay attention to the cutscene bow laughs no shiver flap shiver option three please Fred option one please a Fred oh I'm bullying him that's not very nice

go to our case library this box is broken you need a new one I thought so thanks mate Rober I think this was no it's fixed - thank you well I got a car scare night it's over 2 mil then I'll probably rather hop in the in front of tomorrow if it's under 2 mil then I'm going to be probably doing some more black chains let's see oh yes oh my god oh what a tremendous gaming moment I've just had I just got a anguish ornament kits were off 8 mil nice man I can now afford us I can afford to keep this suffering instead of using an arches ring for Inferno attempts tomorrow ok I have a confession to make I have yet another account that I haven't told you about meet hi knocks hi knocks is my oldest account that I can actually log into he once was an iron man he said he doesn't talk anymore because he's kind of pissed that idea and him just like a lot of other people were when I di earned him but I don't have an inferno cape on him but I do have Bank on him so I'm gonna practice the inferno with this account [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] no I died that was the run man I was doing so well Oh God ah ha my dog jumped on me I still love you but why did you do that [Music] [Applause] [Music]
