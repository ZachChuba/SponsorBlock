attended thank you boy are you kidding me these jeans of super sad my friends and welcome to this week's PvP challenge now this was actually an idea that was requested on the last video I got a bunch of love so I figured why not let's send it you guys really seem to want it in this episode link and I both get to kill eight different monsters of her choice and of those monsters we get to kill them 25 times each now the key here is is that any monsters that we both decide to kill get completely negated and whether you get the drop you want or not all drops from that monster that we both decided to kill it get completely nullified and you can't bring it in the final fight now there will be some exceptions we're doing no boss monsters no R evidence no rune dragons and no brutal black dragons the reason for this is just because they are such an extreme meta enemy would both kind of feel forced into doing it but blocking those out it promotes more planning and different types of monsters so hopefully your plans are very different by the very end but guys very simple rules we kill the same monster it gets completely negated 8 monsters 25 kills each let's fire on in to the video so this one again like always definitely definitely a bit of an odd one and a really weird way to think about how to progress in this challenge I mean I would say firstly it's best just to do what you think is best because then if he kills it it just gets negated if he doesn't then you get all the gear and if you don't kill it then he gets all the gear that they get in 25 kills so I would say firstly that's where the best thing to do but there are so many good monsters and that's the problem we only have eight to kill 25 kills each and with the amount of monsters we can kill there's probably some things that aren't worth going for and some things that are worth going forward but there's no way to really tell without knowing links plan but I would say firstly we're gonna take the knife safe approach we're gonna kill gargoyles and neck rolls the reason because it just simply they have a good drop table and even if he kills them as well it gets negated it's like nothing happened and if he doesn't we can get some really serious cool loot and there's our first drop we were 13 kills in so getting a bit nervous that nothing was gonna pop up there also I'm getting some runes but I think going magic is probably the most risky thing you can do because if you're playing this magic and you have all these runes let's just say in this circumstance gargoyles and then he went to gargoyles which is a very safe common approach then you can't bring any of these runes that you get from gargoyles to the fight but we at least got their info helm so truthfully I'm just doing this more as a block monster rather than expecting to use this in the fight so I'm not too picky with the stuff I get here truthfully but it would be cool if you didn't come here and we have a roomful how maybe like a room battle accidents you H or something but we have 9 more kills to go hello everybody welcome back to another PvP challenge you guys know the rules we've got 25 different kills and if we kill the same monster all of that loot gets taken off us now the thing is with this is it sort of makes sense to just go for the best things possible and then fill in the gaps at the end so as you can see I am here and we are gonna go and take on some demonic gorillas because you know the drops they drop we've got rune items a dragon scimitar some huge stuff that would be very very helpful for this challenge so we're gonna go ahead drop on down and see if we can get ourselves a decent bit loot in 25 kills this is gonna be the first kill there and we got ourselves a javelin shafts not all we're looking for 1,200 of them this is actually the first time I've ever killed demonic gorillas guys so I do apologize for how poor I'm doing kill number 3 we got a prayer potions ah ok - prayer potions Wow ok so that's gonna be a full prayer pot kill number 4 room plate legs yes yes please on the room plate legs that is absolutely awesome kill number 5 death runes 68 of them ok oh my god we just got the dragon scimitar kill number 8 we get the dragon scimitar I'm putting so much effort into just trying to make sure I'm doing things properly here that I can't even commentate properly I do apologize guys speaking of a room battle axe there is a ruin battle-ax but like I said guys I'm not too excited cuz he's definitely coming here it's funny because as you guys watch this you guys will see what we kill as we progress but of course we have literally no idea while we're progressing so it's gonna be interesting I just [ __ ] know it and that is 25 kills guys again ruins I think are gonna be very bold if you go magic we can't use the the materials that we get it's only actual drops usable drop so we can bring in the fight so next up we have greater neck reels I'm not gonna mage them just I can count my kills properly because when you mage and kill things on the same ticket it counts it we're done ruined light I just want to be absolutely sure I killed 25 so I will see you guys there Oh a D kite shield little upgrade there but of course again this is another block monster that I think he's gonna go for as well mainly it's just so he doesn't bring items from necros to the final fight got ourselves a cheeky little rune square she'll drop I think that's better than the a D kite so we'll drop the a D kite and this is our new best in slot shield that we have from the neck rolls Hey and then rune boots I'm just so upset that all this is definitely gonna be cancelled out ah this would be height I really hope he doesn't come here so with three kills left we got ourselves a rune Matt Helm and I definitely did drop that addi kite shield the rune square is better by a lot actually in every single way so we're definitely sticking with that that is the neck rolls complete 25 total kills less tele on out of here so now I have a bit of a predicament there is multiple ways to go about this I think that link is gonna try to really focus on a weapon and get a few weapons that he can get and there's a lot of things that drop rune scimitar so I'm either thinking go down paths that I lock down all the rooms see me drops and also secure myself a pretty good weapon but again I need to get that weapon first before I go down that lock the rune scim ii path but um or I could just kill really good monsters and and hope he didn't kill some of them I'm gonna die because of that dragon scimitar I literally I can't even focus on what I'm meant to be doing right now that is absolutely amazing as I said earlier I think he's gonna have done this so I don't think I'm gonna be able to use the dragon scimitar in final fight we'll see but you know if he if he if he hasn't done it we're looking really really good because I drank scimitar is huge Oh two sharks lovely let's get out of here two sharks for the final fight to upgrade with very very nice been pretty sorted out so far but again we're just doing this to make sure that he doesn't get it haha no we just got a room plates card do you think my leaves are crusty again [ __ ] sake right this is gonna be the last kill of the demonic guerrillas guys I got I've got used to them so you know it took a little bit of time I was really struggling to just commentate and bloody talk at the same time is killing these at the start but we got used to them now they're actually not too bad and the fact you can get 14 mil drop you know the zenite shard is pretty ridiculous to be honest let's see what the last kill was gonna be it's gonna be a prayer potion so we didn't actually get ourselves a rune chained body unfortunately but we did get the legs and we did get the dragon scimitar as well pretty nice there but as I was saying earlier I do think raagh would have he would have gone for these so they're probably gonna get cancelled out but we'll see we're going back for our second monster it's gonna be the tortured gorillas which do have a slightly worse drop rate in terms of things and but in case rogues gone for them I need to cover it unfortunately I can't really get any upgrades here they don't drop a rune like body they drop rune legs and a rune scimitar but obviously I was still want to cover them and I want to make sure that rug doesn't get these for free so that's the reason I'm killing them and you know maybe he doesn't kill them maybe he doesn't go for it and we actually get ourselves a rune scim II or some rune legs because he didn't go for them you never know where in these Psalms that we can venom them straight away as well just to make this a bit quicker but this should be fairly simple they they're just the same things as before but they don't have overhead prayers so very nice first drop is gonna be some sharks okay I'll take it one shark to add to the the final total more than happy with that I did get an upgrade kill number two we get a rude med helm so I was actually talking [ __ ] there at the start it does actually mean that we can upgrade that that we didn't have that before so a room there to go on to the final fight so I think to start us off and we'll see how it works out before we do any sort of crazy planning we will kill Drake's I know link doesn't like Drake so I don't think he's ever really killed drinks in a PvP challenge they drop that dragon mace that has never won me a PvP challenge but they also drop a mystic battle staff and like the embraces red D hide body I think a room full helm things like that so it's just good all-around ok this is the 20th kill and we literally have nothing but a bunch of nature runes and Lauren's and apparently now fire ruins as well [ __ ] stress now because I thought for sure link wouldn't come here and I can score myself some decent loot that I could really bring to the final fight but the fact I didn't get anything really doesn't help I mean I think the roomful helm itself is 1 out of 28 not 128 one of the 28 the staff and the mace or 1 out of 8 e5 I think the red D head body is 1 out of 42 and of course when you average all that together wow the amount of times I ran out of prayer filming this today you can actually see the amount of times I run out of prayer but um yeah bit [ __ ] stress I didn't get one thing yet and we have 4 more kills to go maybe this could be the killer maybe complaining because there have been many times where I've complained and then have gotten what I wanted to kill I was complaining on No More nature that's brilliant 450 nature runes guys in 22 kills we got a high alpha King link got the fires - no I'm on agents I can't even [ __ ] do that last killer guys last kill at Drake's come on Jagex gah - if you're watching well I'm so depressed right now that that's Fox that is Fox I just wasted a monster I guess it's I guess when you kill 8 sets of monsters it's bound to happen a 1 I think link will also have the same issue on submaster but hopefully it doesn't happen I'm like the gargoyles or neck rolls you know one that's just gonna get negated so right ok on to the next monster the fact that we don't have a weapon secured now is kind of concerning the other monsters they have definitely drop a lot of weapons so I'm not I'm not stressed out I think right now we're gonna hit up a B and Z's because they drop a rune dagger poisoned and I think this will be a really slow fight and poison is gonna be huge and the slow fights are the ones where poison does the most damage of course because it's just longer the poison is out there doing damage so let's head to God Wars dungeon kill some abeyance easing Square selves a rune dagger p+ yes another rune med helm from them a little bit annoying it would be nice to get this rune scimitar just so we actually have you know a weapon from these guys in case Rock hasn't done it but yeah to room ed Helmes now little bit annoying death runes getting quite a few death runes together at the moment actually and we definitely got over a hundred and maybe twenty somewhere around there so yeah maybe we could go down the major route if we want to okay this is gonna be the last kill kill twenty five whatever yet no nothing that we wanted really we got the room for med help and a shark that's that's all we got from there but we did plot that task off the rock in case he got anything good from it okay the next thing I'm going to kill is Drake's and the reason for this is the red D hide bodies that they drop they drop black D hi Devon braces a room full helm and of course a dragon mace as well which we've seen rug bring a couple of times to PvP fights and it hasn't been great but this could be a wild card that rug doesn't go for and if we can get ourselves a D hi body or van braces that'd be great protect yourselves from magic and still get a decent bonus as well so wait yeah that's the reason we're going here twenty five kills of Drake's let's hope we can get something you [ __ ] beauty I would have preferred that over dragon mace all day long red D hi body very very happy with that kill number seven as well so really really early I'm so happy oh my god that's brilliant cause I don't think he would have gone here I think this is a bit of a weird one to go for I'm sort of going on the fact that he might go magic and that's why I wanted it so happy days if we can get this mace now that would be beautiful hey just got a room full helm as well so that's an upgrade on the room meds we had before so very very nice also got myself fifty one rune arrows so if I do want to go down the range we do have 51 arrows that could be used that's easily enough for a final fights it's on my mind as well maybe if we because we do have the red di polity which does not give bad range bonuses either so yeah maybe if I come up with some sort of plan that could be what we go for I've got three more kills left of the drakes we just got a mystic earth stuff as well which is the same rarity as the dragon mace I believe a little bit annoying I don't see myself going magic in this in this challenge to be honest we've got a lot of death runes though I think I've got like 200 total something around there at home so we got potential for everything at the moment potential for everything okay we're here to kill the AVN's these are gonna come up here so the only thing I really want from these guys is in fact the dagger we can't make materials so truthfully the ADI bar drop is useless it's only one at 11 so I definitely should get it I don't want to jinx myself knock on wood this is probably the best place to kill a bee and he's over here yeah cool so hope that we get what we want if we don't we're just extremely unlucky to be honest but that is the only thing we can get I guess you could get the antsy poison as well oh my gosh are you serious that is so sick that is [ __ ] sick I guess we're gonna keep killing I'm gonna try to get the ante poison but the ante poison is 1 out of 25 if he kills a bee and sees that this is negated anyway so we didn't get the any poison but I'm really not that stressed because again we can't use materials to make something so you can't get like a weapon poisoned drop and add it to a dagger you actually have to get the die could drop with the poison on it and if he can't a B and Z's that means that we both can't use the room dagger so yeah not that stressed I didn't get it to be honest so we got exactly what we came here for so while we killed a total of 4 monsters now we have 4 more to go now we need to really focus on you know getting some really high quality equipment I don't want to necessarily block out the rune scimitar because if he did gargoyles and necks then I'm gonna have like [ __ ] gear because that's all the gear I have to show for cuz Drake's gave us nothing so let me think for a sec figure out the best that we can go for going forward and we'll [ __ ] send it so for the next monster as you see killed one so far we have black demons guys black demons and wow that cannon gets depleted very very quickly black demons are up next they have a lot of rune on the drop table and an a/d play body but the main thing I really want to see is a rune short sword the reason being is because I don't think links gonna come here so I think everything I get here will be brought to the final fight and even though the stuff is pretty rare the rune short sword is 1 out of 32 so yes I believe : 25 but it's it's still very possible that I actually do show up with a rune short sword or at least one other rune equipment that I can bring to the final fight bit of an odd monster but I really want to secure myself some decent loot that I know I could count on and link Cage the wilderness the black demons here are the only ones that have this pretty cool drop table so I don't think he'll be coming here guys I really don't so let's hope for the best and hope you get something that is kill number 24 what are we gonna get death runes of course we are okay brilliant so way yeah the magic the magic root trying to force me that way but I don't think I'm gonna do it and that is gonna be it complete law runes for the last kill 25 kills there yeah very very happy to be fair okay next up is great and neck reels mainly because they drop the rune square shield I think that'd be quite helpful to get they also drop an a/d kite shield so if we don't get the rune kite shield the rune square sure we could get the kite shield they drop room boots and the rune chain body as well so yeah they seem like a pretty good way to go here and of course they do drop those runes that could help if we didn't want to go down the magic routes oh wait yeah that's why we're here let's see what we get 22 kills him we get a mystic air staff I also got a room full helm so if he hasn't killed these I have secured another room full helm here mr. Gary staff probably is my best weapon other than the earth mystic staff and of course the the dragon scimitar so yeah if both of those get knocked out then we can use this as well as a weapon two more kills left blood runes you've got a lot of death runes again blood runes of what I'm lacking if I do want to go ancients I'm gonna have to get some some blood rains together but we'll see and that is gonna be the last kill and it's some soul runes 25 of them okay I didn't get the rune square that I was looking for all the a decoy a little bit annoying but some runes together to be fair okay next up I'm gonna kill ice troll runts because they drop the ground light shield and they drop a rune kite shield as well you know two opportunities and getting a really good shield I just can't say no to so what 25 kills here let's see if we get it and unfortunately we cannot cook sharks and stuff so they are not going to be super Opie like they normally are that would have been eight sharks for the final five but we have to get everything dropped so we can use it straight away so that's a bit annoying it's the way it goes there what do they get away did I get away I think I did but I'm going in like the most dangerous territory possible but I think we're good I thought that was Dee boots for a sec [ __ ] that's just gonna mess up everything but yeah we're good now [ __ ] my cannon is there and everything I decided to just get on some ranged gear not even any bolts just kind of sit here to get that ranged attack pop some cannon balls in there and let the cannon do all the work because it's very PK heavy right here so I'm just chilling here with some super stores to drink up protect from melee on and just let the cannon do literally everything so we still have like 18 kills to go or something so a decent amount guys a decent amount so guys we have two kills left two kills left and that is a total of 25 black demons killed and there is nothing so far from these guys it's absolutely devastating I was really thinking these guys are gonna pull through and be some meta strat and you know if you average all the drops together I mean definitely should have got I don't least one thing one more kill and we're out of cannonballs in here let's reload those awesome so we have one more kill left I'll show you guys that last kill and hopefully it's that rune sword or it just anything at this point anything okay here it is so this one doesn't count this black diamond doesn't count is what the [ __ ] uh man so I am in a bit of a predicament right now I don't really have a strong weapon that I can rely on the room battle axe from gargoyles is probably going to get negated the rune dagger from a V and Z's there's a chance it gets negated but even if it doesn't that definitely should not be my main hand weapon to bring to the final fight that's just something I poison with them and switch to a different weapon so link loves worms but the dragon dagger there is one out of 76 let me only get 25 kills so I'm gonna take the risk and not kill worms thinking that he went there and didn't get what he wanted there's Sam rock warriors which drop a rune scimitar one in 50 it's probably the easiest way to get a rune scimitar by far by far and I want to say that's something that link probably would have tried if he didn't get the dragon dagger from worms so I think at the very best he got a dragon dagger from worms and then I go and get a rune scimitar from the Warriors and even if he wants the warriors it just gets negated and if he negates that and I negate that then that could be a problem for both of us going into final fight but I can't let him get one of the best to your weapons out there and the thing is is I don't even need to get the rune scimitar drop for it to be negated so I'm gonna go to the same rock warriors and kill 25 of them and hopefully we get the Rinne scimitar but keep in mind guys there's a very high chance that link went there as well ridiculous kill 5 kill 5 yes plays absolutely beautiful rigged kite shield [ __ ] up over the babe that is amazing I mean we're probably wasting the rest of these kills here because I don't think they can really give me anything else they could give me a granite shield if I want to do that if I want to if we wanna upgrade this year I'd give me a gray light but uh yeah that's just ridiculous rune kite shield SiC yard right this is gonna be the last kill 25 I stroll runts and we get ourselves exactly what we wanted I mean could have got the ground I assured if I really wanted but one in one to eight probably wasn't gonna happen very happy with that I don't think kids would have come here okay next up is dust devils the only reason I'm doing these just to block them in case Rob got something good from them like a dragon dagger or something I don't actually really need anything some of the VAM braces would be really nice if we could get the the van braces then yeah I would take that but I don't actually really need anything from them oh we got the red D hard van braces kill 24 this is kill 25 last one also got myself a mr. guessed off again so we've got like three or four different mister get staffs or stars from different monsters now so we've got a choice we have a choice of what we want and if he hasn't killed any of them we can use it as a weapon they're not too bad 50ml a strength really really not that bad at all so let's get on to the next monster okay next up is gonna be undead druids for me I'm gonna try and get myself an amulet of strength or an amulet of defense one of the two not to bothered which one I think I'd prefer the strength but the defense would be great what we don't want to get is the magic because I'm not going magic and it gives no magic defense it just gives magic offence so it wouldn't be too helpful for me but 25 kills here let's hope we can get one of those there we go kill number 4 we get the amulet of defense so we got 21 kills to try and get ourselves a strength a me please give me a strength to me I'm happy though that's brilliant just giving us that defensive bonus across the board so it doesn't matter what style he goes for we're getting a +7 for anything so that's really really nice but I think I would go strength army over it guys 3 kills and I get it in fact I don't have to kill this any more because this is the best item it gets it even if I get a second tier item like a a D long sword if he killed it everything is negated so it's either I use a rune scimitar or bust in this situation so I don't have to keep killing any more interesting Wow ok it's just funny how things work that this is rarer than like the rune short sword and I got this three kills in and the first could drop from wyverns we actually at the tele soon but we did get two prior pots in eight so a decent man kills left I'm not too worried yet but this is actually like really huge because with flicking we always get the attack bonus on piety but with prayer pots as effectively we get the 25% increase in defense the entirety of the fight please don't die please get the kill are you kidding me am I not gonna get this kill come on there we go what do we get and kill number 9 blood runes now we're out of here we got a bank oh my gosh yes kill number 10 let me actually make sure that's kill number 10 yes kill number 10 so what if everything he killed I want to say wyverns probably weren't on his list I realized that if he's killing wyverns right now I'm I sound like the biggest idiot but yeah really really really happy about that that's one in 64 um I'm actually pumped and the fact that we have 15 kills left is just it's got me buzzin right now guys it's got me buzzin and the last kill of the skeletal wyverns let's see we get kill number 25 oh my gosh that is exactly what you want to see guys that's exactly what you want to see we did get one from gargoyles but again definitely taken by link so if he didn't go to wyverns we're looking very blue guys and I like it I like the color blue now for my last monster because we do have one more monster to go I totally forgot about demonic gorillas I totally forgot their thing the reason why link and I never instantly thought about demonic gorillas and all of our other challenges is because link never really had a monkey man is to done but he does have that done now and it's not out of the monsters that are blocked so what do you say we guys send the last 25 kills at demonic gorillas and we can see if this is gonna be a play and a half he might have done it as well and worst case scenario we just blocked what he does because the the drop table is pretty banging in there it really is so let's go kill some demonic gorillas and I will see you guys when I'm there the first kill room plate skirt yes yes if you didn't come here I'm telling you this is gonna be a Power Move and a half so first kill we also get things like a room chained body dragon scimitar like I said before so yes lock it already I'm just so happy I got that genuinely first kill nothing too much to worry about right now guys nothing too much to worry about we just got a grubby K that is absolutely unreal I'm not sure if this is allowed I have no idea it's super early in the morning raagh isn't gonna be out because I'm see I'm five hours ahead of him timewise he's not gonna be up so I can't even ask him so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open it and then when we get to the reveals I'll ask him I'd be like look I got a grubby key it was a drop can I use it so we were all going open this after we do these 25 kills that was kill number 10 just there [ __ ] off what the [ __ ] bro what is going on with the orangey right now that's a one in a thousand that's a one in a thousand chance of happening and that's like a one in 75 or something back-to-back [ __ ] hell unfortunately not gonna be something I can use to be honest it's not better than room for realms unless I get the the roof all Helms you know crossed off in the room Ed Helms then I guess we have this there's the amulet of strength we completed all three we did we got the magic the strength and the defense which is pretty crazy this is actually the last kill as well I got a load of mud runes which are water runes for ancient magics I mean we could go and do IceBridge got a few blood runes as well it takes us to about a hundred blood runes were on now another amulet of strength brilliant home yeah looking pretty good to be honest looking pretty good I'm gonna go ahead and open the grubby key now and let's see what we get here Oh rune chain buddy yes yes yes yes yes yes yes now all we need is that dragon scimitar and I think that's pretty much everything we really need to get from these guys but even if you don't get the D SIM link technically you can't bring one to the fight because this is the only way to get it and of course me being here would have block that out so I'm not even that stress if you don't get it oh my gosh kill ten kill 10 kill 10 is there anything else I could even get from these guys that's it I mean I guess I could get some sharks I could get some sharks so I guess I will stay here and finish off the 25 oh my gosh guys oh my gosh if he does not come here that's gotta be game over dragon scimitar and it's one out of 50 I just walked right into that crap yes yes yes yes yes yes right let's see if we can get these sharks to bring to the final fight I'm messing up so bad right now because I'm just so excited yes sour brute drops too but I guess we can't really use those because it'll lower our stats and everything but yep shark drops is what we'd need I know that's the same as a room plate skirt but I actually just got all the armor pieces on my 11th kill here so it really it really is like doing me back good right now yeah absolutely just so I can love to see it honestly so happy open the chest egg potatoes we got the ranging potion and a super defense okay we'll take that we'll take that and my last Monster is gonna be mutated blood belts the reason for that is they drop 30 blood runes at a time commonly and there is a chance that I could go magic we do have everything that you know we could you know put out a pretty good magic fight and obviously we're gonna see each other's gear and stuff and if we cancel out anything we're able to then swap stuff in so if I feel like I could swap in a magic build that would absolutely tear apart what he has [ __ ] beautiful 30 blood runes first kill and then I think that'd be a really really good way of going about it especially is this so much lag on the server at the moment home but no I think it'd be a really good way of being able to cover myself if he has a really strong melee build I'll be able to just go down the magic route and and hopefully mess him up that way so I yeah that's the reason that's why we're here let's hope we get a few blood runes because we have loads of death runes lovely second kill as well this is gonna be your last kill and the whole last kill well nothing else to kill after this can we get 30 blood runes please no we can't we do get soul runes so there we go we got a hundred and eleven blood runes to add to the total it would probably be enough especially if we were using one of the the mystic battle staffs we would then be able to Mel a with it as well and it's not a bad many weapons so let's go and show you what my best setup is and then we'll see what kins has done and see what I have to change an altar okay so this would be my setup if raagh hasn't killed anything I've killed very very unlikely that I'm gonna be able to turn up in this gear or at least keep it all of this gear maybe bits and pieces we'll get to keep i think it's an unreal setup like i think i've done sick here for 25 kills 8 monsters i think this is a really really strong setup obviously with the super defense the prayer potions the egg potatoes and the sharks along with the swordfish we were given at the start i think it's a really solid setup it's just depending on what he's done now to be honest so let's go and say kill to kill to hell I'd literally just got dragon scimitar crap out of prayer yeah I really can't focus right now I'm so happy I got dragon civvy and then I got room plate legs and then tea shark drops I'm so [ __ ] happy and the last kill guys we have 24 kills 1 more kill left and let's see what we get the worst drop you could possibly get actually why do you even pick that up anyways we only got the one shark drop so we have two sharks plus all the rune equipment got the room chain body the ruin legs plate skirt and of course the dragon scimitar so guys I'm gonna just put everything in my inventory that I've gotten that I wrote and down from all the monsters of course depending on what link has some of this will be negated so how we're gonna do it is we're first gonna list off the monsters that we have negated then we pick our final gear setup and then we fight so more than we do the reveals and then fight so that's how we're gonna do it guys but I'm gonna show you everything we have before we list off the monsters okay guys this is the final gear before we list off the monsters a lot of rune equipment so I am happy about that the two prior pods and two sharks are pretty clutch as well unfortunately a lot of this stuff is gonna be negated it's all in the order of what I got it in pretty much for the most part at least so this was gargoyles this was neck rolls a B and Z's and so on and so forth so it's gonna be such a hit or miss who knows maybe we're going and fight with like no armor because you know we've had such a crossover monsters and everything and maybe I'll be using an adamant dagger in the fight but let's put it this way if I'm using an addy dagger in the fight which is what I got from black demons Oh God then I want to say then he's pretty messed up too because then he would have had all of his gear from the monsters I killed so there's many many ways to think about it let's assault those monsters and see what the final gear is going to be linkie boy my man how did you how did you find that challenge difficult what my difficult one because not only did we have to like try and get the best gear we were excited to try to block each other so I dunno I don't know how I've done that I think I've done okay yeah I mean cuz there's no way to really tell I mean there was a few ones that I thought you would definitely go for so I figured I'd try to block so I'm tres must you know go my own path so guess we'll see I guess I'll see so I'm gonna read through my entire list and then you tell me if you've also killed them and of course that means that everything from that monster whether we got the same drops or not everything we got from a drop from that monster is going to be blocked out cool so who bought in if you say one I've done I'll just like did it yeah exactly and one you will read any ones that I didn't read off because of the remaining ones that I did not do Coco oh okay first one gargoyles no really okay Wow greater neck girls slash normal neck rolls yes I do it he did it yeah it's you right this one I think is a bit of a wild card for you Drake's did it a guy did I did that thinking you wouldn't okay Wow avi anze's no I didn't do a PNC's that's that's what you wanted like in here what you want to do I hear black demons no zamorak warriors in the ZM I know he's going really that's that's like links power move right there that [ __ ] rune scimitar okay um skeletal wyverns no I didn't kill Skelly boy hey wow there's a lot less Phil I thought we were gonna be dude really yeah okay and finally now this this one I hope you didn't do demonic gorillas I did do dry gorillas because I got a dragon scimitar yeah let's hear Druids [ __ ] loves on did roids you take two blood belts he's going for runes dude is is this is this obvious or my stupid or something dust devils runes okay next nice run do they drop real Bobby dropped water runes or something right for this last one tortured guerrillas mate to be odd I know they have a similar drop table to demonic but I thought it was like pretty dumbed down I didn't even check truthfully it's the same but the Dragons see me is a room to me I think I was pretty much it isn't everything likes like much rarer as well the same chance I think it's just the zenite and all that is way more alright okay oh yeah a bit nervous about that right okay um well we have about five minutes to figure out what we have left at everything and we still we will fire into the reveal then let's do it both of our MS workers are cleared of all the locked monsters that we now had that we couldn't use the gear from so link I'm gonna let you pick the first item and we're just gonna start moving the reveal like always in my inventory like got cut by two-thirds of what it looked like yeah let's go shield kids all right shield shield shield bit proud of this one man well I skeletal wyverns wow they really treated me I strove Rob those little bastards dude yeah yeah I was gonna go on a route kite shield quest but I got it straight away for the first one I tried it's like one in 64 or two he's got 20-yard kills and he gets it okay thank you that would uh I thought that would be quite a good one but with matching i which i love to hear let's go let's go helm okay this does make me feel pretty good what would you say if I have the overachieving cousin of the rune met him that yeah I [ __ ] fell back from I got this both from gargoyles and skeletal wyverns I'm simile gonna bring one getting widened the ultimate flex dude bring your oomphel helps to a fight you know skinny widens really sought you out yeah yeah definitely okay I'm gonna go gloves I do not have any gloves okay I'm good fairly simple with the D hi Devon from dust devils okay link I gotta be honest though I don't have anything oh no he said no I went yeah yeah okay it was kind of all three I mean aren't there like one in 20 125 or 1 and 12 somewhere around there yes I got all three so I'm a pick of the bunch the moment you said I was definitely expecting it I I will say I'm happy I don't see a magic amulet though I was gonna go magic but you cancelled out all of my runes pretty much with demonic guerrillas and neck rolls so yeah I think this God from my boys over mutated blood well [ __ ] daddy change so that was pretty nice that was pretty nice too looking like a tanky boy right now I'm a tanky boy back ok and yeah I don't nobody likes unfortunately using like an a/d battle axe or something a bit worried what you've gone through Ducati from Avion Caesars in a tepee I can't really remember well they drop a rune dagger P+ okay yeah it's a bit worried that that could come out you've also got the rune semi that could have happened oh is that the only way for you bro you got a switch I have a switch but like oh you really let me show all my cars before you reveal that you have this is that mystic or I got like four or five of them throughout all the ones dislikes they were pissing down the base oh my gosh I don't like the Audi chained body though man I have speed and poison on you though yes okay Wow what about your inventory are you just rocketing full swordfish or just I just need to grab wall because obviously I couldn't fit any of it yeah you couldn't either yeah like this this could determine everything you know oh this is huge because I think it's pretty close at the moment right I'll just throw okay [ __ ] where'd you get that from tortured I [ __ ] knew it because I got two sharks from demonic that I can't provide yeah I got two from them as well actually I had three so skeletal wyvern sorted me out also with bats yeah okay yeah I was expecting I didn't I actually got I think a two-dose from tortured but I'm not bringing it really yeah okay fair enough I guess if we're going pots Allah I'll put this bad boy up oh my gosh he got a grubby key didn't he get a garvik he kids I did get a go what is the chance of a grubby key from those guys one in 70 I think yeah I it crossed my mind but is the reason I did it I was like I need an amulet there's the chance of the grubby K [ __ ] it and I got that I got the grunting the mask of renewal and all three [ __ ] necklaces in 25k see please tell me you got the ranging part with that or is he but throw up a superset might be my only saving the moment you said grubby right you know what sixteen or my mixin Anna that's not too bad and then the rest is sorties I'm just writing swordfish after that wow this is gonna be close that defense party I was actually pretty confident on a really close fight but the defence pots kind of throw in my brain yeah that's the room shame post defense port is going to be enough to keep that semi out but they see me I think is better DPS because you have like plus sixth Ranger but that's a tick slower so whether you're gonna be cut through me efficiently or not yeah let's do this dude hey guys but before we hop into this fight I want to tell you real quick about links up though that goes like the exact same time that this one does we have to predict the monetary value of our PK setup then make the money in two hours to then buy that gear so it is higher tier gear in this PvP challenge over on links channel I'm a little vague on this side no but go check it out I promise you it's it's very different than anything else we've really done it's very little I think is you might not PK like P cares but at least we look like them which you know sometimes it's just a matter of the first impressions link but I mean and unfortunately everyone knows we suck at PK so it's probably about a hundred and tenth impression but we have a fight to do link pretty nervous about this one not gonna lie that defense spot don't know what to think but who attacks me whenever man okay cool man are you ready like me whenever I am ready yes okay let's do this - spot Oh is he poisoned is he poisonous yes okay cool cool cool cool just gonna hope that that deep it's just just does nothing for you mate come on I just hope it doesn't take me nine hits to get a poison on see oh this is gonna be the rough part the fight for me right here oh my god Mott and you're not poisoned are you you are a little cheeky [ __ ] oh oh we go here we go yes oh no we're come on come on yeah nice that poison this needs to be a long fight I get the longer the fight the better my set of bests yeah that chain body you didn't have that chain body this would be a dub yeah 100% 100% yeah poison question is when do I repose in you know Wow Wow trading blows mate trading blows oh God go on go on [Music] okay yeah I didn't want to say anything but [ __ ] we're just like rocking Khao territory yes [ __ ] this thing it's this thing hits me I'll tell you that I'll tell you that we know we know it's one of my favorite weapons in the game yeah we have the mystic staff first the room full hell right now it's it's literally as canon as you can get oh love it when do I read put me out defense how long is this fight gonna last the class probably repot now link you know yeah Wow dude [ __ ] bro Wow your daily red balls mate nearly red ball I don't think you can hit like a 35 but that though I think probably at 27 it would be my guess yes yes the clicky buoy right now or a clicky boy you might this is just coming through yeah to keep me in this okay all right just need a few good hits few poison splats and yeah man yeah yeah yeah go on down down down down yeah lovely man I was hoping the fact that I could just can't play tea the whole time would kind of make up for the lack of a defense pot but how do you I was that fighting so hard yeah just carry poison Knight doesn't want to kins is not feeling that wasn't feeling it right there man I respect it might come on hit hit hit hit hit yep let's get some hits let's get some hits hit hit hit put him down ohh low right now yeah yes yes really like that come on do big hits okay all right all right y'all take it I'll take it slow and steady wins the race you know you sound like my [ __ ] mother now you know ice come on come on yeah okay it's a [ __ ] story straight there more than a sortie exactly right come on yes yes come on come on hit oh is he out yes yeah oh wow Wow okay okay that's that's pretty awesome human finish vine [ __ ] a detain body did it maybe how much food for eight nine ten eleven twelve Wow one of the bigger I could say
