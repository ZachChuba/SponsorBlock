hey guys welcome back to my channel so yeah yesterday just to tell you really quickly I was so ready like I was on my setup and everything I was ready to film and everything I kept on refreshing the page just to see if the music video was going to you know come out at some point and nobody did it i guy went on Twitter I checked it there was this you know update or whatever regarding the music video they said that it would be released later like delayed for I don't think they specified why exactly I still don't know why they had to delay the music video I suppose they had to edit something out I don't know Zoe I'm not quite sure if you know like please let me know in the comments down below but anyways it is finally here I had to stop myself from watching the performance video because I didn't want to have like this song in my mind just yet you know just to have like a real first impression so with that being said decrease the story over this one I have the captions on there just go ahead this is gonna be like phenomenal I already know I already know okay Oh like this is going much harder than I expected it to oh she's done name I honestly their visuals I will never show [Music] my queen [Music] this is wait should I say it [Music] this is the best song the 8 die wash [Music] the aesthetic and how is a bit like psychotic it is just slightly and like it goes like low-key heart [Music] oh yeah she's gorgeous [Music] yes oh yeah yeah [Music] this is the best song honestly I mean none that they've had like a bad song you know but this is oh what I was expecting for the drop to be like right there holy crap I love that music video I feel like as I said previously in one of my other videos their music videos are like one of the best if not the best in the whole entire industry at the moment I feel like they have such like a universe of their own it's elegant you know it's very feminine it's very like aesthetic it's a thorough like the visuals are off the roof it's insane but not only the usual isn't everything like everything together you know like the makeup the the outfits the accessories everything put together ties the whole concept together like it's a complete concept if that makes sense anyways this song as I said I feel like it is if not my favorite like just to be clear when I say that best I mean it in a way that that's my favorite so far I've loved the music right but this song has a harder drop in a heartbeat which is usually what I prefer when it comes to you know music in general so here when they have this elegant concept and with the powder bead issues like everything that I love so like I'm being extremely well fed it's sound very summery but at the same time I could see it being perform like throughout all the years if that makes sense so that just goes to show how the song is incredible in my opinion I know I'm talking a lot about the usuals and everything but they're not only just providing that they're also providing incredible vocals like this is obvious you know but this time around the rap even though it was really really short they like they came in and they killed it I could have done with honestly a lot more I wonder what the you know that the line distribution is and everything but damn I feel like when it comes to you know screen time in this music video specifically it was a little bit more well divided it seemed more equal this time around oh yeah so one last thing about the dense this also ties to what I was saying earlier when I said that that concept is so complete every time the dense also tells the story of the music you know of the lyrics and everything with a swan they have incorporated a lot of like those you know wings movement kind of so that also good just goes to show how complete their concept is and how well thought-out it was in how well prepared they were for this so yeah this just feels so great you know this whole thing it's it's complete I love it anyways to subscribe to my channel and I will see you in the next video bye bye [Music]
