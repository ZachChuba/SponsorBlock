take precautions here all right go spray down first Jimmy all right it's real good okay let's go all right Jimmy just come on over this way have a seat over there thanks again for coming on course it's an honor John I was Ritz it's our pleasure trust me look at you not you're all grown up you're a big boy now yep the [ __ ] you laughing at you think this is funny this isn't funny this is serious this was child abuse what happened to you it's great to have you here can I can I offer you anything before we start which I'm gonna crack a can of Bush's baked beans sure thanks sorry this should hydrate you for weeks oh [ __ ] oh god I'm sorry so this is the real Jimmy this is the real he's really here this is him Jimmy we have a lot of questions for you and I'm sure everyone watching at home I'm sure everyone is curious I'm curious we're all curious but we want to get the real scoop from somebody who's really there you say your um your memories a bit fuzzy then right yeah it's 13 years ago so fuzzy yeah so you were eight then and you are 21 now mm-hmm okay so just tell us what we really want to know is was it as real as it looks so so people didn't listen to adults I mean they they meant no parents obviously there's cameramen and stuff yeah people that there was no cameraman or anything like that's what I'm saying I figured I figured the cameraman wasn't it like like what's the robot yeah robot or I would even think it robot I was thinking like a toddler but wait so so so yeah there's adults manning the station's the cameras and stuff and every now and then they would do their dictate some things you did like I found a so I was on the poor team okay the porky poor team you mean like the labor class yeah yeah yeah do we have that down here see there you were child feudalism that's you down there see you were there yeah I see that right there the laborer class I was one of the dams yes yeah show you that anyway so you go on um yes we got like I don't know it was like four or five buffalo nickels which was the currency buffalo nickel buffle they were they were just silver with buffalos on them fair enough currency the Old West and I spent all my money in the candy shop and on root beer you were you were you were going to a payday advance like right after that weren't you you were try to get a welfare check I love you were you were waiting in the unemployment line yeah I was but and so I didn't have any money but like like for the most part spent all of it and then you save it you come on I I didn't know what saving wasn't it was a I'm Way too young for this and so they were they some of the Karen or like oh look what we found here and then kick some dirt and they got the buffalo nickel he should pick it but they planted it probably oh they just they just would like throw you more money yeah so was it a real functioning economy I mean to is to an extent yeah I mean like I would go I didn't know we had a general store I didn't know that didn't didn't communicate that I just knew there's a candy store and a soda shop it sounds like they didn't clue you in on much then yeah I also probably was listening very well because I was eight come on did they give you like food that wasn't shoulder did you really have to eat what they cooked so for the most part we ate what they cooked and they had like it was horn what the kids cooked yeah yeah [ __ ] it was horrible I knew it so they really weren't feeding you you had to feed themselves to my memory they fed us one time it was after the big other the kids started to look real pale like I would start a test at home after the um we got trench foot after after the like the big event we came back and and everybody there was no time to cook to me did the event we were all like freezing because it was it was very coldly enough it's called New Mexico at night and so they they fest it was this I I didn't like vegetables very much it was a weird a weirdly cooked chicken breast and then like this purple I'm assuming this cabbage now but didn't know what it was at the time purple [ __ ] wasn't good oh my god I did not eat very well cuz I'm that we had the whole dusty pancakes and molasses syrup so they really they just said children make your own food really eat it and stay alive and there's no problem with this they're there they one of the intervention they had they had pupils walk around making sure you're hydrated they couldn't have people passing out some okay that'd be bad for ratings yeah dad that's one assistant who's always giving me Gatorade oh and they gave us this dust to brush your teeth yeah what'd you do this and you could just pick it off the ground it wasn't canister with like powder that you okay rub on your teeth and spit I guess the main question is to what degree was that really like just you versus the elements how much intervention was there there was enough just to get us by but other than that I didn't think there was a whole lot because I like I said like okay so when I'm sleeping I had I had a mattress that was probably probably this thick and I'm blanket this thick that was the thickness of this carpet what they really did that to you I'm like it and then my pillow I didn't have one so I used my red puffy coat I puff up and use it as a pillow and I long hair so I got cut in the zipper a few times wait but that must have been like legitimately scary for you a little bit right was it oh yeah I also shared it with like four or five of them boys I just met so there was no way out of it until the fight yeah yeah yeah you were you were forced for the first four because I love weather like don't worry this isn't some kind of crazy show you can get off you gotta wait like two weeks like that's really what they did right so that's not fake you couldn't you couldn't elect out not that I mean if I like it if I really like throw tantrums I probably would but suppose you could have run in a different direction until they found you they had like a wall of like security people like really far off let me make sure that no weird people or no animals like that's weird it was it was like it was like pans across America is that what it's called the thing in the movement I'm not sure it's not like that but they literally had you like surrounding a tiny leg like this little chains but they looked like they were I think I'd be concerned if a weird man just showed up at the border uh-uh a random ghost town yeah so wait ya know did you like were there scorpions in there I never saw a scorpion I saw Jackrabbits a jackrabbit I tried to murder them I'm sorry Peter I mean like to a certain degree you can't get all the scorpions out of there Aaron I don't I don't look they put down the scorpion repellent pesticide Baba I I didn't see anything did anybody see any critters that were dangerous not that I know if I think that's what the people actually when we were out like jack rabbit hunting we we can't we weren't really far off the area but like we had obviously people accompany us we saw this I've never seen like cows and bulls but they were tagged so they like right belong to a farm they weren't wild wow they're else yeah I don't know I think though there are very dangerous and a big brood if I'm being honest no but the thing is right because I was wondering I was like cuz they're making you sleep in these dusty old cabins with like you know that probably space between the floorboards right yeah so so I'm surprised you didn't come across any I wasn't there very long so maybe maybe there's some Nate I'm curious I'm curious to know if anyone else from kid nation knows if there were critters in or around your area I want to know that was that was a legitimate thing that I was wondering about so you had to feed yourselves you really were pretty much open the elements like wasn't it was it insulated was it cold at night in there oh it was freezing I cuz it was really gonna keep me warm yes you were a hit I sure every night you shivered yes they really genuinely put like I cuz like the thing is I'm just trying to figure out where the line between reality TV and they really are putting a kid in nature it was pretty alright so we had these yeah we had these crappy old houses and then they stuff like six of us in there tiny magnet fin mattresses very thin blankets in the middle night in Mexico it's freezing I was like I'd have to weigh like full clothing I wouldn't be able to go in like PJs I had Wow I had like sweatpants since I feel like there were a couple times at camp like that but it was always like a little bit monitored on the bus when you're when you're all coming in yes do they tell you where you were going no that bus ride was like two hours and we hadn't know it I remember I was just in so we were at status on random New Mexico hotel I was on the bus I remember just like I was on the like the window seat and I was yeah I was like looking out the window I saw my mom and my sister were just like rovol way and i was like [ __ ] this is real and then like wow i have no end we've drove forever and they never told their like whose idea was it for you two to get on this show come on the show um I think I was like my mom's I mean like we I was kind of interested in act when I was little and so I auditioned for this like the new role but I wasn't gonna have to do any acting I little did I know and so I went to UM an audition in Boston and like they were like oh we like you but you're too young and that was about seven so I was a year and then the next year they were like oh I guess we I guess I still liked me so they're like you're one year oldest you're better now well they called your mom up and said we've got the perfect role friend we're gonna strand them in a random location you can't come yes if you call the police will come for you we have people you got a call from like an acting agency to your mom and you were trying to do acting you weren't like I'm so ready for the social experiment yeah yeah I was more into the playing a character and being in a nice movie set like this or something and didn't know you thank you by the way for saying that it's a nice movie set here in my actual basement no but it is pretty no but yeah so you you weren't trying to get into social experiment like did you know that it was gonna be like real real or did you think this was gonna be fake like what was the import when you got off the bus did everybody suddenly realize it's more real than they thought III mean I went in with like a whole different deal like I was like I want to be like coolest kid I asked I'm gonna have a fun time like I was if I can be more like an adventurer like oh it's gonna be fun right like parents let's like drink root beer until like midnight and oka tell us our bedtime kind of things like us great I got there was horrible right now if I were a kid I think I would think the same thing like did you have any concept at that age of like oh it's reality TV but it's probably not gonna be like totally real so I grew up watching Survivor like my parents didn't always watch it and that seems very authentic so I was like god it's gonna be like a kid survivor but like there was a decent amount of intervention and I think it was mainly because it was just like everywhere you turn there was a camera it's something don't really realise when you're watching is that we're actually there that's like cameramen everywhere so what your parents think of this whole thing I mean so in the beginning they were all four cuz it was it sounds like a cool adventure like oh he's gonna go out like it sounded like a little bit more extreme summer camp yeah it was a lot worse but when I came back they were like my mom was very glad that I came home because you didn't guys how much she would like missing me after right having to like a leave her child in New Mexico and go back to New Hampshire and how long were you there from like from the time you got off the bus to the time you left so I okay so I was at Bonanza City for four days four days and then when I left I don't I think it was like two or three days I was in a hotel with one of like the PA at UConn peas production yeah yeah yeah one of the PAS I was just like in a hotel with it that sounds really bad you know was he hands off okay two different hotel rooms he was just like me Roberts liked them all really kind of we have a fun time great guy hey not for hands-on very hands-off okay so has this like followed you did school mates find out about this and stuff oh yeah um yeah I feel I was the only kid from New Hampshire on it so like talking to town right yeah and Aaron and my fourth-grade everyone was like fine with it and then I think as we got older and we got into that prepubescent like I got a lot of backlash from it a lot of yeah backlash I don't understand why was like backlash from like wouldn't you think people would be like oh that's Jimmy it was like I you're all put the desert by producers like what why would they make fun of you for that because I left early and I cried no aids people don't cry apparently I'm the only person that cries you were now in the episode that I watched plane to cliff look at all him crying everyone cried they all that's what I was gonna say that's how I felt like I knew this was real like to have to have two kids break down eventually yeah and I'm like that's what I really wanted to that one scene where do you remember there's a scene where you're just crying somewhere in the in the back of a barn did you really run away I actually did run away and then the producers or the Karen found me like hey Jimmy quick can we film you he did that's what I said I made fun it it's really what happened he came up he's just like can't give me more of that way out of it do you mind if he filmed me like this would be pretty good and I was like does it mean interrupt you I was like this'll be good yeah Jimmy I know you have no concept of anything your prefrontal cortex hasn't even grown in yet this is gonna be great for ratings can you keep the waterworks coming Oh honestly what's what cuz I joked about that but I'm like cuz oh my feeling was you filming an eight-year-olds crying it's not it's not fake no I can't be like like Haley Joel Osment when you see him crying on in AI or whatever movie when he's a kid actor you're like okay so he learned to cry but what a kids like silently like ya heart kind of heartless so we're there any like was there a fallout from this was like a lawsuit or anything um I did not sue them but they were sued a bunch of times so kids kids drink bleach did you mean is first part of that so glad you're here to tell me about so see you and tell us about the bleach yeah so I was not there for that part but you know kids don't know how to clean things very well so it's like ah this is a dirty glass bleach you mean they bleep they wash because they instead of washing it with soapy water or just hot water they used bleach to clean it and then drink from it didn't they didn't wash out very well next next glass did they get sick do you think it's ambulance came oh my god but like was it like a real reaction from drinking bleep oh yeah or was it a preventative of ambulance I mean there's no there's no way you feel good after making bleach Wow another girl got burnt like I really I don't know how bad but oil burns your serving face probably hopefully maybe well probably you haven't seen it so maybe yeah wait no no no is that what she got burned how she was cooking and she didn't again kids on how to cook so they're like ah I need at least three cups of oil in this pan oh yeah deep-frying it they just were trying to cook it like that and I think pretty sure they got sue for that those are the only two I'm because I've never heard of it and when you try to buy this thing online there's one clip of this show online we keep everywhere that it's listed you can't buy it it's not for sale I assume the lawsuits to do they try to bury this thing yeah I think so too but they gave all the well at least me I should speak they gave me a DVD of every episode so I have all okay was there really one bathroom only yes well for the guys know cuz I peed behind every day one yeah I'm here everyone okay wait so was it really just one outhouse for 40 kids yes so there so it was actually right outside my room and the funny thing was if I woke up there was a line of like 20 kids waiting to use the outhouse and I know it's really real I'm like 40 kids yo D kids one outhouse there's gonna be a line the math shows the line yeah and there was 20 kids waiting mm-hmm that's why I'd peed outside from this part Jimmy see you really were the smartest uh yeah and then I also have a bit of a problem with that just a girl pee on the outside on the side of the house spray I got just ask one more times one that was there's no other way there was no other way to relieve oneself no and I did not defecate there Jimmy you didn't you didn't drop the kid you're passing your parents drop their kids off but you didn't drop your kids off at any pool i I saw the outhouse I saw a girl come out I went in you know and I just saw a lot of poop and I was like you can knock open you saw the scene you saw the you saw the crime scene I tried you tried to bleach it from your mind not not literally just that wait so can you just expand on the statement I saw a lot of poop I was afraid that if I sat down it was going me and you get more up there and I don't want that to happen you have enough boiling up inside and so I just I was like I can't do you don't need an insertion I look back I don't know who would ever empty it slowly it was literally just pile up nobody emptied it I don't think so cause right when I went in it was kind of a tower it was at our time I was wondering like if this really was so they genuinely were like do you want to watch cartoons kids or would you like to have sanitation did you guys take showers so for the first three days we do not take a shower but after our big like event wouldn't have like the walk colored water all over us then we took a shower for like where were those showers they had them in like little trailers so they could have brought you more porta-potties yes he just hit it wanna yes he wanted to torture you on purpose yes did Jonathan cars have his own bathroom I think had his own trail officiate a nice luxury bed wait I got it I gotta ask you about Jonathan Karsch it's creepy strange alien lizard man isn't he cuz whatever he was talking to you guys he was very direct he was just like you are looking like easy pickings down there yeah he would repeat the same lines over and over again because it would be like oh that steak was a good enough so robotic he'd be like and there are towns objective is this and then the Baker say it again then he would say in hard town subjective so he would repeat things over and over again so we're really like you know this guy like broken you know always kinda look like he was talking at you not really to you oh he definitely was I mean also like lying left he's just like towered over me he was he was just like looking down he was like bye [ __ ] that's how one of there's a few things because we do media we know certain tricks of the trade and I noticed certain things that were like you could not fake like you were looking up at this towering man like giving him this kind of look and I'm like my god Jimmy's truly like in awe because normally like at that age adults talk to you kind of in a different way they may get down to your level and try have a conversation nah but he's just like power figure well I guess you're leaving little boy the door is that way was weird I really thought we were you freaked out by him I was I didn't feel safe around him I'll say that he didn't feel safe around Jake Arthur King I don't know you saw him preview that we put him right that's where he wasn't the feudal economies right Dave is king Jake are you go I called Jake ours today what did you what are you guys calling I didn't know his name that man that that Specter that shows up yes and taunts me with stars so they didn't tell you about the star until you didn't know about until you left I I knew about it like on the flight home cuz I cuz I went in I was my mom alluded to the idea like oh maybe you'll be able to win money so they might I told her friend about that how'd you feel when you found out you you lost the chance at the start without even knowing I was I was a little pissed I was like yeah tell it I don't know if that would have kept me around but it certainly would have had a fact it would have had a push to make me say I really wondered that cuz you walked out and then he's like alright here it is yeah I didn't know until like a few days later hey what the [ __ ] it's crazy do you know what happened - Jared three years before that day I've been wondering that myself because I'm very very I'm worried for him I don't know what happened every years ago some really badass scared so you said you were on the news about it yeah yeah so so I went out when I was eight but you're an heir to a year later if I was on the news like are there like some [ __ ] news channel like like around the time was aired and they were like ah you know we feel bad you missed out on a chance to win a gold star so we got you one for the studio I was like oh my god I'm gonna get money oh I was like look at this I was like wow that was rounded it's not even doesn't even leave it's also paperweight that I accidentally broke oh it's a paperweight how did you break it in read people people keep screwing me over I'm just a little boy it was but yeah this is probably worth you I could I could see that at least you can probably turn five ninety-nine on Amazon maybe not these days that doesn't even look like the same kind of star mm-hmm it's kind of kind of small so what are you up to these days what have you what have you gotten up to I'm going on to medical school in the fall medical school he's going to save lives see that's what happens people who go through traumatic life events so you see your go to medical school for what kind of what kind of what field I'm not sure yet um I'm thinking like oncology right now but I mean if I gotta change oncology what's oncology cancer okay I don't ever do this I don't ever do this I'm gonna pretend anyone ecology was does it don't look that dumb I know most fields are I didn't know the cancer field is called oncology that's a weird name I'm really weird so give me what field are you going into um right now I think we're going on college oncology for all those who you don't know that's the cancer one I I knew that so you don't feel stupid for not knowing that okay so yeah you're going into the field for like research or actual surgery or I'm think I might like I hope probably both like research and like clinical work like working with patients nice brilliant well Jimmy you seem like you're real nice cool guy is that ever you describe you that way told you that no well Jimmy thank you so much for coming on but before you leave we've got a little something for you we wanted to right this wrong okay and we wanted to finally give you that star we feel you deserved that's right bring it out boys there we go sorry it's that's the best we can do we're working with random magenta on the printer we can't go out and get me everything everything's closed so here you go Jimmy how do you feel there it is that QR code you just scan that one free Big Mac no drink though I'm sorry let me let me disinfect that for handing it over to you all right there it is for the big guy hey I feel Jimmy complete you get you scanned that you scanned that you scan that code one free Big Mac no drink though I'm sorry we got to work with
