one does what one can uh they made it a reserved occupation I didn't anyway would I have done any more by sitting on the backside in France for the last six months would I yes it is a lovely war wouldn't you if you were in my place wouldn't everybody doesn't everybody was a blasted phony anyway actually that's not true this video is sponsored by the free premium time we'll come back to this later on the morning of Sunday September 3rd at nineteen thirty nine the aircraft carrier HMS courageous arrived back in its homeport of Plymouth she had been away for weeks and the crew were looking forward to some much-needed surely after barely a few hours with their families though the entire crew received the summons back to the ship Britain was now at war and courageous was to sail at once to hunt for u-boats exactly two weeks later she was hit by three torpedoes fired by a German submarine you 29 sinking in 20 minutes with the loss of 518 of her crew courageous was lost in a period of the second world war known strangely as the phoney war this term is commonly used to describe the month between a declaration of war by Britain and France and the German invasion of the Low Countries in May 1940 it's a time where it's thought little fighting took place despite a state of war existing between the two sides throughout it Britain was led by Neville Chamberlain a doddering old man he preferred to drop leaflets rather than bombs on Germany it's a nice narrative and it's one that sets up the British transition from incompetent to determined as the war progressed the only problem is that it's simply not true don't get me wrong a phoney war did exist but only militarily in France on one particular front in one particular theater elsewhere the poles and fins fought bravely against huge odds the Chinese continued to battle the Japanese and the British German and French Navy's traded blows in the Atlantic courageous was the first major victim of the Battle of the Atlantic a campaign which began with the secant line ruthenia less than nine hours after the declaration of war on September 3rd this campaign was not some sideshow to the events in France in 1940 but an immediately desperate struggle for survival between the Royal Navy and the u-boat of the Carice arena less than a month after the loss of courageous things got even worse with the British when the German submarine new 47 crept into the naval base at Scapa Flow undetected skippered by lieutenant Gunther Prien the submarine moved silently past the anchored British ships and hit the battleship Royal Oak four times the torpedo capsizing at her mooring Royal Oaks sank with the loss of 833 sailors by the end of 1939 221 allied merchant ships had joined Royal Oak and courageous in being sunk nine German u-boats had been destroyed in return it was an intense start to a campaign that would last the entire duration of the war and would be fundamental to its outcome for those serving at sea the war was extremely real extremely quickly and nor was the fighting during this time limited just of the Atlantic a fully fledged military campaign took place in Norway after the Germans invaded on April 9th it was a two-month battle that involved tens of thousands of troops on both sides ending in allied defeat only after thousands of Norwegian British French and polish casualties as the war in no a big an a month before the invasion of France it's often forgotten lost in the hazy memory of the phoney war so if the military reality was evidently so far away from being a phony war where does this idea come from well to answer that we need to talk about the war experience of those living far from the frontlines back home in Britain by the time war was declared the British government had already spent months preparing for potential dangers of the British homefront and top of the list was the threats of large-scale bombing by the Luftwaffe believing that the bomber would always get through and seen the damage inflicted by the Germans during the Spanish Civil War the British massively overestimated the damage that could be done by their opponents they projected that the first few months would result in a million civilian casualties and 3 million refugees being created along with the disruption of most of London faced with this grim picture all the stops were pulled out to mitigate it gas masks were handed out plans for a comprehensive blackout put in place and a programme of evacuation begun which took at least three and a half million people out of threatened urban areas and into the countryside by a time war did break out the UK was a country collectively braced for the worst and then it just didn't happen no bombers came across a channel to deliver the expected rain of fire four months after war began the danger that Brits thought to be the greatest of the war simply failed to materialize through a public that had been fought to sending their kids away to the country and for to drive around with their headlights off in the pitch dark it's not hard to see how the war suddenly starts to seem a non-event particularly when you compare it to the more obvious sacrifices made in later years such as the battle at the Britain or the Blitz the lack of activity on the Western Front in France compounded this feeling creating this sense that it wasn't a real war because it seems so different from what the public had expected and what they had experienced in the First World War a generation before a real disconnect developed between the experiences that those fighting away from Britain and those at home who could see little change from peacetime you can see this in another part of the scene from the 1958 film Dunkirk I showed at the beginning of this video this phony war business well isn't it no it's not I've just come out of hospital after 10 days in an open boat off the ferrars and I'm sick and tired of looks likeyou is soft jabs ashore I've lost two fingers off that hand but I'm gonna take you outside and knock your block off with my right here you can see a clasp in these two worlds the civilian and the military at a time when their wartime experiences could not have been more different despite the efforts of historians and movies like dunker the phoney war myth has remained prevalent this has to do with how the war is remembered by people born well after 1945 and in particular the way we remember two men Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill Churchill is the most famous British figure of World War two and his reputation is the man who won the war has only grown as the decades have rolled by his elevation to prime minister in may 1940 takes place at the exact moment that Germany invades France providing a really clear moment which has been used to differentiate between the phony war when Britain wasn't really fighting and the real war when her qualities of Bulldog spirit were evident embodied by Churchill Chamberlain by contrast is remembered as everything that Churchill wasn't an appeaser who had overseen the phony war and bungled any military actions that he did take he was famously described by Spike Milligan as a man who did Prime Minister impressions as always though things are not quite so clear-cut Chamberlain was ultimately forced out due to the catastrophic failure in Norway but he was replaced by a man who was far more responsible for the defeat than he was the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill but such details have been forgotten Chamberlain has become a prop of the Churchillian legend the leader whose incompetence magnifies the accomplishments of his successor according to the cultural historian mark Connelly he has been remembered in order that he might be forgotten this memory of Chamberlain plays a key role in shaping the phony war concept after all if you accept that Chamberlain was so abysmal and you consider the huge effect that church who had on his war effort it logically follows that in the time Chamberlain was in charge Britain's war effort must have taken on the same characteristics muddle-headed incompetent and complacent and so the phony warmoth perpetuates itself through a weird kind of circular logic the phony war was phony because Chamberlain was in charge and it was because Chamberlain was in charge at the was phony the reality is that the difference between Britain's approach to the war before and after May 1940 was not as large as is often thought it is absolutely the case that Churchill and Chamberlain were key influential figures in their respective government but one man does not make a war effort like with so many other events in world war two the phoney war myth takes a complex time and simplifies it to an easily understandable narrative that turns out to not really fit the historical reality aircraft as well as three days of premium time I'd also like to thank my
