hey there far travellers I'm Pruitt this is Jim Davis and today I got a plain little intro on intro to the plains where we're gonna take you to heaven and hell and back again and show you all the elements to walk these Plains on web DM this week's sponsor is hero forge they link in the comments and description all right Jim let's uh let's get philosophical as well as inspirational what are the plains like what the hell is a plain where is it what is it how is it why is it it's a weird concept because it comes from obviously there's concepts of other worlds and spirit worlds and mirror worlds and the like that come from a variety of you know folklore and mystical traditions things like that but the specific iteration of planes in Dungeons and Dragons the Theosophical movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had some interesting ideas about where people get knowledge from souls how people are born and as sort of higher order of the site right yeah you can see the transition if you if you look at spells like contact other plane in like original D&D and and the way that they structure the planes you know through that spell and then by the time you get this first edition you've got the grid of you know this is the Mount Celestia yeah nine hells of you know at the time was just like hell it's very much Indiana it's very much a kind of a modern sort of concept of higher orders of consciousness hence astral projection thing like that but also it needs to be a place that you can physically go to because it needs to be a place that you can adventure yeah and so where the like the real world esoteric traditions these are states of mind states of being you enter into them through you know meditation or drug use or something I don't know ecstatic visions and it lifts it right which is fun to import but you know sort of back import into your DD games but it does sort of have this because it has this tension between dimensions or or places where your your consciousness resides on a higher level your subtle body as it were but also you also go there in adventure to be able to swing a sword cast a spell climb a rock jump around I do find there's a tension in Indian DS concept of planar travel everything and you can exploit that tension for you know adventure ideas and and like I I think Planescape tried to grapple with it and came the closest to really like taking it seriously but also had some flaws in execution so what are some ways you can arrange this this jumble of cosmology where characters go when they die like deal should have a general understanding of the plains but they don't need to have like an intricate model or something and if they want they can borrow one of the many that have sort of sprung up over D and D as you know as it's existed and I think the biggest one and the one that is sort of official for fifth edition is what's known as the Great Wheel while the fifth has changed it somewhat especially the number of inner planes that get thrown around that the basic can see here is that if we think of the planes sort of like an onion or something that that has an inner core the the inner planes and then as you go out there's the transitive material then the material a stroller than the outer and then in the outer planes you sort of conceive of them as being like like a pie for instance right with sort of a crust on top onion pie sure it's an onion pie and uncooked onion pie it was like a crust on top which is the Outlands the plains of balance to neutrality the center of which sits sigil which is on top of the sort of like a spire it's a physical place and the closer you get to the spire the less like divine power there is so that if you're sitting at the bottom of it like gods are just nothing they have no more divine power and it's kind of a weird place because it suggests that you can walk an actual physical Road around the Outlands to get to a gate town and a gate town is sort of where you know they're you access the first level of a plane Planescape had all of that really fleshed all this out and really added a lot of terminology and and like denizens that live in these places and it's sort of like fleshed it out from a world building perspective but didn't always give you the tools to like run an adventure there but in terms of just the potential of adventure sources and places for conflict the Great Wheel is like just almost - almost offers too many options right you have like fantine outer Plains the to transitive all of the inner planes plus positive and negative energy planes it's just like so much going on and making it all fit together and make sense is kind of a balancing act that for some just doesn't cut it and in fourth edition they tried to you know try to shake things up and take the elements of the Great Wheel but but make them into something a bit different and I didn't like it at the time because I was like diehard Planescape fan how dare you change everything yeah Rumph but looking back at it I'm calm cool like a little chaos and and the mixing and blending and rearranging of everything to create the world axis was just I kind of like it I wish they went into it more in the dmg than just the little paragraph that they demand on it I went to it whenever I was starting my spell chamber campaign because I was just thinking like oh well there's certain aspects of this that you can just be a planet and you can just kind of go what's on what's already there you can use that as a basis but you're absolutely right it's it's one of those things where it's just like choice paralysis like and I understand that that problem but you have to start going like well I just need a town on the plane of fire I just need a city sure you know in the city of Brad yeah or whatever because the I'm thinking of the couple of playing scape games that we've run let know there are three because they played as Abaddon is Jarek and then the the one where we use cypher is the actual rule sis yes yeah we were playing in the plane right yeah and I always like the great wheel I don't know it just the symmetry of it in just the shape I made it just easy to remember yeah and you got the upper and you got the lower and you got the stuff in the middle you know and the in the elementals that each whatever you and so it's just I don't know it was like it was easy to to know how to navigate it's just like how do you navigate it sure we're gonna get to here exact so like it was a way of ordering things that kind of like helped make sense of it all and yeah but my characters in those worlds like I would just imagine I'm like well there used to this so like the complete randomness of it I just would be like yeah it's fine yeah it's but as a player yeah it's just like I was ecstatic because it's just like every new place yeah you know there's just a whole world of discovery but you know we'll come back to it later yeah there's a whole universe of discovery well it really is it really is like that night that's how I felt similarly it's almost like to run a really good game you might wanna just focus limit your options focus on a handful of planes but you can also do that at this step in the cosmology where you know they're great wheel is meant to accommodate all of D&D yeah right like the the Material Plane and the great wheel contains every one of our campaign worlds along with all official settings all linked through the phlogiston you know that's just the material plane and then it's the you know inner and outer as well I I liked conceiving of the Great Wheel and it more literally and the outer Plains are places that have no physicality to them if you even the only way to travel there is through astral projection or if you do use gate or a portal or something your physical body is left behind you can't go there there's nothing there for it to interact with there's nothing there for it to have an adventure with but the rest of you your subtle body your soul can go on and have adventures there your souls a reflection of yourself and so I wouldn't change anything mechanically it's just like yeah your body's back home in the same way that when a demon comes here and you kill it it just goes back home yeah similar situation it's not like the matrix no no not it might be for like I don't know low-level scrubs or something like that Plains and die yeah right conversely like the inner planes are for it for me like a roiling mass of primordial essence you know it they are ultra physical you know you leave your soul behind when you go there it's - it's sort of like the soul is too advanced of a thing to have here and maybe your own body becomes more primitive more rudimentary and depending on how how I'm feeling it might you know if you're you travel to the plane of water you might like devolve into some sort of proto mammal fish or something like that or if it's the plane of air you might break down it like the iron and minerals in your body might expand and and take over now you know the fire is well fire inside you combust and that's why you're gonna die yeah you know and air is another one of those where you might just you know it's how I necessarily do it might be another one of those well you know I'd be able to move around it kind of sucks so no one's ever been there so I don't really put that much thought into it but those are my thoughts such as they are so yeah for yeah for my spell chamber campaign I just kind of use a loose wheel cosmology like it's all there yeah but it's more of just like everything's just stacked like everything is overlaid sure one another sure that's more of just like a transition from one state to another and it's not an actual like yeah physical journey although you can't take a physical journey to find a doorway to get to another place certainly certainly yeah yeah talk about the transitive planes here to me because I like those I like an idea for like creating adventures out of your travels through the astral and ethereal planes but some other cosmologies that are mentioned I'm a huge fan of ever on sort of Horry planer or in that sense the planes are planets or you know that that physically sort of orbit ever on and their proximity to ever on determines like win-win and how they're influenced the place there's thirteen of them or something there's a lot sort of a keeping track of which ones are where and how they influence things can be a challenge or it could be just like a simple table that you roll on if you don't want to create like an entire celestial calendar for your campaign but this is the one I use for know beyond my my land between two rivers and aquatic adventures world where it's the most of the other planes or planets in in a solar system that's gone rogue it kind of and you know so something like hell might be a place that's been mythologized that has mystery and spirituality all kinds of things injected into it but it's not necessarily a metaphysical place where evil originates it might be something else and the denizens there just might be taking advantage of the gullibility of mortals yeah so I I like doing that because it's a science fantasy setting and I want to blend and mix those elements and to me planes are like dimensions they are places where your higher consciousness goes if you want to have a physical adventure you got to stay on the Material Plane because that's where material things are yeah and so that's sort of how I conceive of its it's got that dark the Dark Crystal Lorene since I saw it as a kid aughh resort is like always loomed large in my mind and I try to find a way to fit and order into any setting or world whatever I can I enjoy it for just there's an alternative to the Great Wheel I really like it yeah the idea of hopping on a wooden rocketship and traveling to you know it's somewhere you know the plain of rock is just like a dead moon or something like that you gotta go really get down under the crust before you find the crystal aliens that live there or something like that yeah yeah that's where you harvest doing stones but there's others there's the world tree right where the various planes hang is fruit on its vines and its roots are gnawed by the chaos dragon that's going to destroy us all exactly right here's what I want to use that I have not had a chance to and it is everything is in one world and I there just is a little paragraph in the DMZ where it's like hell is a place in the world that the abyss is probably at the bottom of the ocean like hell is probably at the center of the earth and Mount Celestia is right over there and like mountain we can only see half of yeah right right and it's difficult to get to Elysium because it's like a really long way away across an ocean that doesn't really have any there's like nothing there no place to stop no it's an endurance match and so like I really like that or maybe heaven isn't a mountain maybe the mountain is allows you to ascend into the sky to the upper atmosphere where heaven actually lives which is like sulfide salt and sulfide it's a great word solar fire it's all about solar light sola fide cloud castles and the like where the gold dragons and cloud Giants and Imperium Titans live that claim to be gods and you know the mortals down below certainly feel it when they deny the rain and the like so it like I want to do that one world because I like the idea of like yeah I don't really need magic you're determined you can get there and and I have done a campaign where you guys like traveled across a desert you remember is like y'all were traveling across the desert was like some nomads and got to the city where the Dead lived and they were answering people's questions yeah was that when you climb the ziggurat to talk to the celestial eagle who was God and you could look out across all creation wasn't that your creation campaign that was now that was the wizard King that was where everybody was started level as a 15th level wizard we're tired of 30 different like we're just gonna start the campaign it's you know if you wanted to talk to God you had to physically cross this desert and and make your way through a city of souls who were responding to people's you know requested a seance or a prophecy or something there were vampires there who had to stay indoors you know cuz they would be turned to ash by the divine radiance of the celestial eagle and you could climb the ziggurats creation and look out and you work from the vantage point as I conceived of it heaven was just a place that where you were see if you were standing in this place you would have the perspective of God and therefore would be God and so the celestial eagle is just someone who just never leaves that place that's how I looked at it and you you can visit kind of looked that just was how I conceived of it it's fun and I thought it more interesting because like otherwise you're what you can do plane shift of Mount Celestia I buy the book buy the book you could certainly but one last thought for this I if you combine the one world with the other world concept like the mirror world that I think that could be really cool because then the one world has its places but if the other world are the mirror world is supposed to be a dark reflection of it like what's the dark reflection of the abyss you know what's the dark reflection of hell if those are places that live in the actual world so like just like the idea of there being a mirrored opposite and maybe it's like the abyss is not such a terrible place and it's really those fascists and not Celestia that are the problem that's been a way to look at it for sure chapter 2 of the dmg is really really good for fleshing these things out and just check it out yeah so you know in however you want to order it there are spells and items and rules in the game in order to to move about yeah right yeah so so what are some things to remember to keep in mind as you're creating your cosmology yeah with regards to that so the two big things wait the two biggest hurdles that I see and I fell to my own planar campaigns just travel and survival right most of the means of travel to other planes they're not available to characters until much higher level and really in 5th edition you're limited to two spells that get you there directly and then two other spells that can get you there indirectly and they're all high-level magic right like gate plane shift ethereal 'no sand national projection they're all high level spells and they're not really you know that easily access some of them have weird and especially expensive or difficult to acquire material components you know I can kind of be difficult to to reconcile how I start a low-level party with all these the options they would have through spells or this high level and like those spells are neat they're great by the time players can cast those spells you're dealing with a different kind of D&D yeah instead I just there's plenty of like magic items even other things that you can use to facilitate a planar player campaign a couple those magic items I mean obviously the Amulet of the planes every low planes is a good one and it's sort of the its County yeah it's portable take it with you it's it doesn't have the limitations of say like a cubic gate but if I recall it's it isn't it doesn't like work automatically it makes a you gotta say yeah and it's a you don't you may not arrive where you intend to you might not arrive on location yeah not ever I arrive on a hole in a plane like a random one including the ones where you can drown or be incinerated or crushed or plane of negative energy you just needs to be yeah yeah so it's dangerous and player travel is your - I include survival in it because I kind of see as you know as long as we're talking about magic items the first magic item that a potential planeswalker would want to acquires a necklace of adaptation because that's one of those magic items that's just it covers sort of an aspect of a planar survival that spells and other things don't have an in-plane scape there was a whole host of player survival spells spells that you cast is like a reaction to establish a secure habitable bubble around yourself for a bit or or ones that you know would last all day or something like that so in this list I would put obviously Levens tiny Hut if you can get one up in time or somehow are able to you know I don't know sure how you would do that maybe a contingency for that high level you can sort of like connect with an environment that is you know counterintuitive to my existence yeah contingency for tiny Hut is there better well that you anyway I this is why I don't play Wizards anymore because it takes two it takes no time to tell her I rage and hit this guy wow it's the best way to survive is killer so we mentioned cubic gates I mentioned the amulet of Plains cubic gate does one of two things it either takes you to you know whichever one of the sides the cubes attuned to or you can like double tap it and then use it as an offensive type match you can lets you make someone else be playing shifted and that's what I like about plane shift is you can for yourself you can something else it's a it's a fun fun little spell well yeah you just you don't kill them you just take them to a place so other magic items it's there's not like they're not necessarily in the dmg or stat it up but there's like planer boats that are capable of traveling on the planer rivers that will get you to places like the sticks or for the lower planes and I think the planer River of the upper Plains like Oceania or something like that thethe and so these are planer rivers and if you can find them or find the spells and magic that would allow your vessel to transport or so like translate onto them that can be a way of traveling complaints paladin and he'll had one of those where you're given like a chaos ship by a miracle and it's best with demons you take control of it yourself but it's capable of sailing the river Styx and it'll get you to whichever the fifth layer of Hell is where the adventure takes place so yeah those are you gotta go will you right been taking notes maybe it was stitch yeah yeah I believe I remember that in Paladin hell because we were coming down the stairs at the Harbor yeah when all the white wolves came out and breathed on us and killed us all I remember correctly wherever survived hopped on the on the boat and got away yeah we didn't even make it to hell it was uh yeah that was one special more that's when I realized the placement of AoE generating enemies is important you can't just have them all attack at once I mean you can't you can't I guess it is theater money you know D am I truly Maurice listen villain would do that yeah they certainly would other places and ways to get around the plains the World Tree it's sort of one of those the ideas that you can sort of hop along its branches and climb along I think Midgard the setting cobalt press setting has something like this where there's either monsters on the world tree there's something to deal with like spell casting squirrels and snow and there's also the infinite staircase staircase is one big favorite first of its connects to places where where there's creativity so you really put it in like some mirror there's some exotic and bizarre places if you want its an Escher painting of a place and I like it because you have to hoof it you know you you there's an adventure not just waiting for you at the end but in the getting there and what I love about DD is that it's journey and destination combined it's we have the travel adventure the good Fellowship of the Ring style epic journey and then when we get there we have the site based adventure where we explore the location and along the way blah blah blah to mention all the random encounters not to mention all the random encounters in MPC's you're gonna meet and just sort of the the act of exploring and moving about and playing in a world can be very satisfying and I know some people don't like it they want to get to the next beat but I like to meander and you know surprise and resources are your items so that and you can succeed in the actual adventure sure you can succeed and you can gather information stuff and so the infinite staircase provides that because you have to walk along this stair casing you have to know which door so like just knowing that you you know that this back door to an old abandoned theater that you know was you know the patrons by the king and the other members of the royal family and yeah it's just an abandoned door but anyone can step through it doesn't require a key doesn't require a spell doesn't require anything you just open this door into a staircase that it's suspended in air who else is traveling it where do you want to go not all places that are creative or particularly safe you know it's a pretty creative violence out oh certainly yeah the Ulysses especially you know do a lot of creative things with flesh and brains and the like so it's it's a fun way and if you're looking for a framing device for a planar campaign it's a great one to use because it allows the players to engage with the nature of planar travel on their own terms presents sort of uh you know flowchart of where the stairs lead to and connect how long it takes to get there is it days hours that kind of thing looks more like a subway map than a you know then a traditional dungeon and you know a little random chart of travelers who are on there there including Celestials who are there to help and and repair the staircase and make sure everything's safe yeah everywhere that the door opens is just a little adventure yeah now in the tales from the infinite staircase there's an overall sort of you know plot of some kind of like metaphysical virus that's sapping creativity from these places but you can just easily have one-off episodic type adventures using that framing device oh yeah and some great inspiration is to go back to the matrix like the the back door hallways oh yeah I mean like literally it's that's kind of what it is except a staircase yes you know there's the infinity staircase with their doorways but there's also just random portals everywhere yeah right certainly right like and the portals are what the uh I think plane scapes biggest sort of contribution to this was I think is that any enclosed liminal space you know a doorway without a door or a tree branch that's fallen over or everything a threshold yeah can potentially be a portal and maybe it's a matter of timing and at certain times this thing just opens up maybe it's a matter of having something in your possession and it could be related somatically to what's beyond the door or it could be not you know it's really one of those things it's it's both there's a double-edged sword this concept of portals and keys because it's great it's so open-ended you can do whatever you want with it anything you need anytime you want the party to travel somewhere or have a brief adventure and a fantastic place they can just like come up with a portal and a key but also like it sometimes can be but pain to have to come up with a key for a portal on the fly and especially if you're running a game like Planescape or a portal hopping game where like knowledge of keys and where the portals are is how you get around it's like oh man we got to get to fire but we can't get there from here but we can go from there to out land so the thing to this that will eventually end up in fire but it takes like six gates to get through there well I mean it's like the like The Dresden Files with using them never never yes yeah no this gets me to here in st. Louis and that that bus station will take me to Hong Kong would yes take me to yeah yeah you're like switching back and forth between these two places and yeah I love that and I like anything that that stretches out the journey a little bit mostly because it's an opportunity for you to just have some fun for the players to interact to show case some of the world got more opportunities to deliver information to them if they need it and like to me it's the essence of the game and a lot of times people seem to want to skip past it to the location-based yeah thing but the getting there is half the fun you just you know it's a skill like anything else got to run it well Oh Oh most definitely and it's probably because maybe one of the last elements here is maybe you don't have a party member who's a horizon Walker which wasn't right yes the fact that they can sense these portals yeah since these these gateways to other planes yeah and and not having like needing high-level magic to do so sure yeah and being able to sort of like look at them and interact them you can imagine that there's certain parts to the horizon Walker and wizard or perhaps even I know I could see maybe bards type of bard like a wanderer yeah planar wanderer type and these are the kinds of campaigns where that kind of character is really valuable right like you would want to have some way of determining whether random portals are around so that they can use those features and a have maybe like a list of you know potential keys or something like that if it were me honestly I would go to one of the I'd go to like a beliefe or one of the other random generators and just like come up with a d100 list or random stuff you know fresh pick strawberries a broken pencil you know an old feather used hanky well yeah a feeling of feeling of happiness trying to think of a third thing is it'd be a thing a time and a random either an emotion oh yeah you know yeah you can easily do like a d100 list where it's like every 10 you change the theme so like the first 10 is like things you find in the wild that ii tan is like things you find in the home and then it's like feels you know or you know are you sleepy are you crank it maybe just when you're in those positions you're just like I don't know give me like the names of 7 Disney characters and I'll find a way to make them have been effective this work I just need something please yes cross the Christian the kitchen threshold at lunchtime with a fully cooked meal and an empty stomach yes and you'll end up in the hearth of whatever the ogre chef yeah she's gonna need to give him that meat otherwise yeah you can't keep up you're next but it's free buffet otherwise so I those are these sorts of hurdles that I ran across when I was trying to run planar adventures and like having a character like a horizon Walker would have been good roben handy because you have an excuse to kind of like pass the information about how to get around here yeah yeah to that character but at the at the end of the day you're gonna have to like take all these inspirational elements and and like constructed an adventure out of ya you're gonna have to actually run the game Sodor what's your advice for doing that like to put all these elements in just the right place so you don't overwhelm your players with choice but you incentivize them to go explore the absolute unknown I treat it as the plains are there to facilitate a fantastic adventure and not like they're not there to like be reflective of anything other than that and I think sometimes especially as world builders and we and we get locked into DM as world builder mindsets and then we play from that place we forget that like we need to switch from DMS world builder to DM as game facilitator in those moments and we you can prep for that you know as by making sure that your place has game ax Belarus are there n P C's for the parties members to talk to are there identifiable places that that they can go to seek information to seek resources to have a bit of respite or a home base as it were what sort of dangers problems issues are in a location that you would both associate with it so that it highlights the sense of place for the planar location you're using but also like gives the party something to do and in my opinion this is one of the things about the Planescape products at least is how I remember them they had a lot of great inspirational material for like what's there and and like this NPC and this you know location or or this sort of thing and they'd have adventure ideas but there wasn't sort of the tools for like saying I'd contrast it with say Ravnica and Ravnica is like here your guilds all right here's the missions you can go on here's a lies you might have here the enemies you'll encounter and having it broken down not like pros right Lords like it's fun to read inspirational not terribly useful at the table yeah that's a con yeah it's sort of like that's what I want I give me all the inspirational material you want but if I'm gonna sit down and make my own tables I've got to sit down and like map out my own starting town and make my own little delp's you know a little one-shot kind of places that the players can sort of pick and choose from or if I've gotta like sit down and go okay here my NPCs here are their plots here's how the players can get involved on this conspiracy of this investigation this interaction a lot of times I do both you know sandbox and investigation and that's what I prefer out of a out of any kind of game product and if you're gonna have to make those things yourself in a lot of these cases yeah and the dmg is inspirational it'll tell you what's on the plain of fire it'll tell you all about the city of brass well not all about it will mention it you can go online and find out about the city of brass but at the end of the day you're gonna have to come up with a table of replicas enforce it e of brass you know d50 fire genes you know with it I was gonna say but also go to the mosque for me mantra manual because you know they have some entries there for the citizens of these plays yeah yeah help facilitate some of that they can help facilitate some of that but you would want to pare it down you know the thing with D&D that I don't think Dini does a good job of communicating is that it is a tool box that art that is offering you all the tools and then you parse it down to something that's manageable something that fits your group your table your play style we don't care about these kinds of creatures so we're never gonna have them I hate dragon it's not gonna be in my game and as the whittling down of that is the creation of a campaign world and so you just apply the same principles that you would to generica Fantasia for your traditional you know fantasy setting to you know the outer Plains and give the players a place to start give them an obvious place to seek adventure I'm gonna tailor my game towards the group to the best of my ability but you can always go off the beaten path and find a dungeon and stick your whole you know stick your head around the hole and poke around what are you like didn't mean fried to be as dirty as a Camberwell glorious listen let's just think about it that way so let's take a you know a plane that that can maybe be difficult to just sort of consider like a scart the plane of sort of situated to just to the just above limbo i guess you'd call it it's chaotic good with just a bit of like carelessness and recklessness it's and it's like a really good outer plane to set an adventure in because it's generally because it's in the upper planes it's not like a total literal hellhole and it's also a wild place though and so you can have like Giants and Valkyries and and the honored dead and you know feasting Vikings and all sorts of things in the end and you can draw upon the real world cosmologies that D&E uses or you can make up your own you can look at say the way Pathfinder has changed their cosmology and so like mixing it with that match gathering is another great place for inspiration or versus probable universe where listen like the Kirby's spit the Kirby ask like sort of just Celestials are total space gods and and in the way that they used to draw the Asgardians as well is another one of those like those don't I mean they come with like Vikings no space aliens and so yeah that's but anything like Kirby I think is a great fodder for for this sort of thing not just but he's especially good for it it's a matter of having to like take the principles what you would use to make a game or an adventure in your homeworld your material world and just sort of transferring it there the difficulty is there's less resources less examples you know a lot of the monsters are like you know they're tougher you know especially if you're going towards the lower planes there's usually not like an intermediate fiend that like a CR 1 or 2 fiend all the time they're a lot of times to jump from these scrubs the treach's the mains and like up to the sort of rank and file and so the marrow use orcs goblins ha once these places are inhabited by trolls and and all manner of things if you're going like traditional D&D all of those creatures in the Monster Manual like their deities live out here these didn't a lot of those are things are probably from here you know and then they make their way to the Material Plane so maybe trolls on you know one of the hell layers of hell or something have you know they're even more badass you know they have something else going on and they're immune to fire and they're immune to fire that's sort of how I would go you know what does it look like for you know a dragon that lives on one of these planes so how would that look like is it a proper dragon that's been warped and twisted or is it something else you're just using with dragon stats for yeah mean destroy a fairy drink very drake son like that yeah like what cut are the npcs in a place like you know he'll want you know do they live there is this just their plate you know do you have to worry about that kind of thing of sort of like the quotidian day-to-day sort of concerns or are they all magical fiendish sort of creatures waiting to you know take your soul i think there's merits to both yeah i like treating these places like they're more real than they seem to suggest you know the people here there are people that material needs they can go to a place like dis and if you're savvy can make it there yeah it's just getting there sucks and your neighbors are not particularly nice well I mean you stuff deal with the day-to-day but all those fiends have to get the chains it's the chain of their victims somewhere right you know I'm over here at the blacksmith making chains yes yeah yeah yeah I I so fer for mine I treat this as light a conspiration of disc from Blade Runner and to me dis is like an iron metropolis that sits between AB Ernest and ii layered sort of like the gateway into hell and a Vernis is the just the crappy front door like it's the it's kinda late as its presented and in baseline D&D just more reckless more lawless like and this is the sort of just teaming they're like steampunk London but Blade Runner but hell metropolis would like coke town and you know the oh there's a big bureaucracy yeah and I also it's also Brazil is a great inspiration for hell in that particular sense so you'd there's a lot of bureaucracy a lot of like getting licenses and permits and greasing palms and the like and I would set up structures for play there I would create a table or some kind of thing to just like secrets that NPCs I didn't plan for might potentially have like secrets are going to be a big deal and a lot of the things with these planes especially the outer planes because you've got like they're about ideas you can do fun things with themes and and the like you can encourage certain behaviors reward them with inspiration for acting in accordance with the plane that's what they want so it's a lot of fun things and like send them out send your characters out there I don't know third or fourth level like it's fine they'll be okay yeah you know you control the world so like don't put them in a place where they're gonna die if you don't want them to die so like that's kind of a thing that you the DM script I I don't get like ICC if I can't send my players to their first or second lecture can just don't send it to the part that's gonna kill them earth king right you know so yeah it is a balancing act of being you know fidelity to the fictional place and then you know what your game needs but in those balancing acts I usually tend to favor what's gonna make for a good game and you know like not and immediately dying it's really gonna make for a good game yeah just a good player if you liked the video give it a

supposedly this wizard attuned one fort to every plane yeah so you only need this one for right and you know cuz it's expended right you doesn't yeah or yes oh yeah loosely profile that would be an interesting plane and plane safe adventure yes you know it's the kiri thank you fine it looks like a bunch of Allen wrenches yeah you know find me the fork tuna the keymaster yeah this master the university is that little thing I like plays the that's like a big cosmic think the cosmic key yeah that's like an accordion flute yeah then I remember the key master from matrix we had another yeah major gloated also dissimilar I he just he can open any door can open any back door in the matrix which is just another cosmology I didn't I mean yeah oh there's no they're basically in purgatory down in Zion relive a same thing yeah really ran over the other recursive because they were used to except heaven yeah their North cursive loop because they're refused to accept everything and that's the Gnostic I mean that's why it's the Gnostic thing because talk about that totally I mean who made these places and whether or not they are good or pleasant to be in it's serious God's an [ __ ] I mean this is what this is ultimately why in the land between two rivers the real villain of all of it is me and that is why there are three NPC's in the world who have broken the fourth wall they know they're in a game drove one of them insane another one became a villain and another one just as happy did not you know its contempt fine he's like that when we speak to each other occasionally well he speaks to me through the in prep works but yeah that's the ultimate villain and the time travel thing is just a justification for retro actively changing a whole bunch of [ __ ] and all my campaign worlds and all that kind of stuff it's all any time I make a change in the world I put a location in the game tied to some kind of relic or artifact that represents that change the game the players can like interact with it's not like if they wanted to bring back dwarves there's a place they can go in the world to bring back dwarves yeah drops so I like I do that's how I no one's figured it out yet that's fine them I mean they may never that's the delicious part of being a DM is to have secrets that never get revealed I think a lot of people to handle that
