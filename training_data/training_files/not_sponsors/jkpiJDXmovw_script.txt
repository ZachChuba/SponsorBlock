this thursday a very exciting update is coming to old school runescape hard mode theater of blood theater blood is already some of the most challenging content in the game so to get a hard mode for this just has me really excited i'll be live notified when i go live and since you're button because this video is going to be hilarious oh i'm getting the one on the wall okay he said wow that's a door i should probably inform you guys that i've not raided in five months i am a little rusty so to get warmed up for the update i have two objectives complete a duo and get a new personal best i completed a duo before but that was a long time ago it's not the hardest thing in the world but it really forces you to clean up your act so that's what i'm starting with first and after i get the duo completion we're gonna go for the fastest time possible i mean fast we are going for speed one third that's pace so we came up with a goal complete the raid in 16 minutes now i've gone for speed runs before and this is going to be pretty challenging because my personal best right now is 17o died on thursday and for now enjoy that was close easy clear i totally helped a lot on that one i don't think we should use any prayer like before reds just you know oh yeah yeah i'll just flick pretty sure i flick piety like when i yeah it's all muscle memory but yeah i'm pretty sure i do that oh wait let me uh let me drop something okay and i start up there all right ready i'm sorry [Music] um that was awkward oh god let me just eat my shark right now yeah that's that's what happened that's fine tactical picking it up now it's fine we have six pillars people can do it in solo we can do it with double spec vegan a pillar might fall on the next one yeah oh [ __ ] don't die please uh i do need
