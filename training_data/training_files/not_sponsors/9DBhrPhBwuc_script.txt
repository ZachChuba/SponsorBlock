[Music] you always said we were that good hello everybody I'm just here with my cup of tea this morning that is very hot I've wanted to leave a link to this jumper in a down bar for a while now but I keep forgetting so I'm gonna leave a link to this jumper in the down bar because honestly it's like all I'm wearing at the minute it's so cozy I got it in a size way too big so it's I mean it's huge and it practically covers my thumb it's like a tent but it's so comfortable and it's so nice for winter and I think I'm gonna order a different color but in like two sizes smaller just so I can actually wear it out but yeah welcome to another vlog I thought I would sit here have a nice cup of tea and like a call then and have a little chat with you guys and just ate some breakfast and I've got really bad cups I get hiccups after literally everything I vlog and let's just carry on with our day I did want to insert a clip from yesterday where I tried out some new makeup let's pop that in here I wanted to do a little makeup kind of haul and try on all of my makeup had gone off and I was still wearing it and I said this in a couple of videos but my makeup was really hurt in my face and I couldn't work out why I was like am i allergic to makeup and then I realized I've had all of the makeup I was wearing for two years and over so I've been dear and I bought some more makeup and yeah I just wanted to try it on at the start of this vlog so if you are interested in finding out some amazing makeup bits because honestly everything that I've put on my face today I'm in love with carry on watching but if you're not what the devout make up I will leave a timestamp here I'm going to skip to [Music] the first thing I'm gonna try is this magic away liquid concealer by Charlotte Tilbury I don't own many Charlotte silver things at all so I give them a go [Music] that's really nice actually it blended so well so everything else I got comes after bronzer unlike setting my face and stuff so I'm just gonna do that quickly [Music] now that that's all done the next thing I thought that I'm gonna be using is the glossy a telescope this in the shade quartz I think I've only used the shade moonstone if that's what it's called before it's the lightest one so this is like one a little bit darker and I just blend this on my fingers because I think if you swatch it on your face sometimes products like this can take your foundation off so I just I'm having a right waitress singsong while I film this video let me know in the comments what your favorite musical is she's bloody gorgeous I know the lighter version of this was probably my favorite highlighter ever so this one I'm gonna love it it's just so natural looking how did people highlight the nose I've just seen people do it so now I do it but I don't really know why so the next thing I'm gonna be using is the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion I haven't used one of these in years actual years I've been using my Marc Jacobs one but it's literally two years old now and I feel a bit gross putting it on my eyes so we're gonna try this one I do remember really like in this I mean I can't really give you a review on this eye primer because I need to wear it all day oh my gosh something I'm very excited about I treated myself to this Charlotte Tilbury eyes to mesmerize in the shade Marie Antoinette so it's just like a liquid cream eyeshadow oh my god it looks beautiful so this is one of my favorite eyeshadow colors I don't even know how to explain it how to spineless clothes like a silvery bronzy gold it's like a warm toned silver this is so perfect for everyday wear honestly Wow I love this a lot I wish I bought this in summer so I'm just doing two layers of this and I'm not doing anything else to my eyes apart from mascara that is gorgeous I'm so happy I bought this it's like the easiest eye product ever definitely worth the splurge [Music] something that I've been obsessed with it for a long time is glossy boy brow I do not do my eyebrows without using this now so this in the shade black it just makes your eyebrows look on real and I can't even explain why they just works so much better than any other brow gel that I've used to I told him that they're great to see that oh I love it so the last two things that I've brought bought that I knew is a mascara this is my all-time favorite mascara called the caution mascara and then I bought a Charlotte Tilbury lip pencil and lipstick in the shade his clear so much stuff about this I thought I would try it myself [Music] carry on on dice two coats of that mascara it is friggin amazing it's my favorite mascara ever now I'm gonna move on to lips and then we are done I've had at this free game coleslaw for literally a month I've tried cold sore cream nothing is working so let's just ignore that and get on to lips as I said I bought the Charlotte Tilbury lip cheat lip pencil [Music] that color is gorgeous and I also got the matching lipsticks let's give this a whirl it is beautiful [Music] I can understand why this is so many people's favorite lipstick it's like the perfect shade [Music] so this is my finished makeup for today I absolutely love it 10 out of 10 would recommend everything that I've used to be honest I love it this highlighter will always be my favorite but I think my next favorite thing aside from my mascara cuz that is my best mascara ever is this lip pencil and lipstick it's the most perfect shade and it feels like there's nothing even on my lips it's so nice okay so we're flashing back to me sat here with my cuppa tea obviously you haven't got makeup on today I should have filmed this yesterday sometimes I'm just not in the mood to vlog sometimes I am sometimes I'm not and I always feel like when I put makeup on I am way less likely to vlog the day because I'm more bothered about like how it feels on my face which is bizarre to me because when I was at college I wore Ruby woo MAC lipstick which is like the driest lipstick in town I walked dream up mousse which is like the thickest that grossest foundation I wore false eyelashes every single day to college I would get all extra early and do my makeup put falsies on put my red lipstick on and I would wear it all day and an idea musical-theater at college so I was dancing singing acting and like I don't know how I did that with that much makeup on but I just feel like I was so insecure that I felt I had to wear it which is a big difference from now because although I still am insecure I just don't need to wear makeup to feel happy with my day anyways that was a long run you see this box behind me this is my Christmas tree I'm keeping it here behind the door so I don't often see it but I am so excited to put it up I think I'm only gonna wait like maybe another week or two definitely want it up by the first of December which I guess is completely normal I bet some people have the trees up already I'm having a little bit of a bathroom switch around so I have this in the corner this is from Ikea and held my towels and it looked really pretty and to be honest I really liked it however I bought this cabinet and this cabinet was supposed to go in my bedroom but it doesn't fit anywhere so I shoved it in here just to like shove it in here while my mom comes so she could collect it to have it her house so then I really liked in here and I thought it's way better storage than this so we're having a little switch around I think gonna put towels in the first two and then extra bits in the bottom but what I'm planning on doing with this is taking it down to this height and then having it over here because it'll have a lid on it and I don't have anywhere for my toothpaste and my toothbrushes at the minute they're just in this cart then I can put my toothpaste on my toothbrush on it does that even make any sense I know what I'm talking about so I'll give you a little update washed all my brushes yesterday which is why they're all on they're all clean but yet this is what the cabinet looks like it's actually a way less see-through in real life I don't know why you can fully see through it on camera but I've just got towels in the top two and then toilet roll and then like random bits and I've still got to hang my toilet roll holder and then I've got this here which it actually works so much better because this has got no clutter on it now dear that is my bathroom at the minute looking all cute and fresh and nice I definitely did prefer that thing in the corniche you could see all my pink towels and stuff but this is way more handy I'm bringing back the pure box haul in the vlog I just want to say a massive thank you to Locks Etan they very kindly sent me some of their new range and it's their new range full of homie bits so if you like the look of anything on here definitely go and check it out this will be perfect presents for Christmas so I'm gonna open these I've got a candle which I definitely need I don't own any candles you okay so this is called decor con salinity who lavender bergamot mandarin orange and geranium let's give this a cheeky smell oh that's nice you like this would be a really nice bathroom candle very very fresh smelling that is so nice thank you so much and then we have got a home mug my mum was just saying I need mum was oh oh they've added some tea for me so then looks like this how cute is that hand drawn little drawings has got the same packaging as a candle hard and then whoops the last thing that we've got is a source of harmony poem perfume so this smells like thyme eucalyptus and a lot of other things let's give this a spray oh my gosh I like that a lot again that's just really fresh smelling they both smell like products that you would smell if you went to a spa that is gorgeous so thank you so much to lots of time for these hello it's me okay I think I'm gonna head out now because I've got some work to do on my laptop and guess what I think I'm gonna go to Starbucks you guys haven't seen me go to Starbucks in a while but I might actually go to the beach as well I just want to get out and about it's really nice and cold lately yeah I just want to get out and about have a nice little chilly walk and I haven't visited to see in kind of a while actually so we might go ahead and do that all the leaves are brown all the leaves are brown and the sky is gray and the sky is Greg can you guys see them Brown leaves shaking in the wind that makes me so happy you have no idea [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm now home I got a whole video edited in there I was in there for ages I'm so chuffed with everything I got done I always find that if I work out of the house I get things done quicker because I've got no distractions like Netflix but I'm gonna head off now let me know if you like the kind of makeup tutorial in a vlog thing or if you don't in the comment I know my makeup videos don't really do that
