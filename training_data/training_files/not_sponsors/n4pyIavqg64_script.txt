[Music] [Music] okay so i'm alex i'm rachel i'm going to give you a little bit of an update on what we've been doing over the past 24 hours so we left vancouver yesterday morning and we got on the road at 10 a.m and hit the road for uh 15 hours for 15 hours to left bridge alberta so we were able to wake up nice and early to go and pick up my new rescue puppy um so a little bit of background on why we chose this order so rue or bell who is getting renamed brew bell is a catahoula leopard dog puppy she's about four months old she was she's blind and deaf deaf she was surrendered to save a fox rescue in minnesota i'm blessed lovely human beings by the way if you are ever able to donate please do it they are such an amazing rescue literal earth angels okay so we chose this border we're at the um montana alberta border we chose it because it was a 15-hour drive or 16-hour drive for us it was an 18-hour drive for cilia and sylvia sylvia and leah were the volunteers that drove her from minnesota to us but you know what i'm ready and i'm excited and you know pig's excited and she's gonna explore the beautiful trails bc myself rachel's help and it's gonna be [Music] fantastic [Music] what everybody recommended to us is that because we have our own business we were to get an import number which would allow us now and in the future to import rescues that weren't able to be helped in the states and that would open up our field to like help a lot more animals as well which is something that we're both very passionate about so we have all of our documentation spent countless hours on the phone and online doing a bunch of research to make sure that this drive was not a waste we spoke to like 10 different people and not one person said oh you might have this issue oh hey by the way ladies this might come up nope you got this you got that you guys are good to go you guys are rocking and rolling yeah good for you really linda you're serving you're saving a dog how cute yeah it shouldn't be a problem we get to the border today this border guard who again was probably just doing his job following the regulations told us that because we weren't a basically a semi truck bringing in commercial goods we were not a trade that the us would benefit from so they did not want to allow us into the parking lot in the meantime we can see sylvie and leah in the rest stop right in front of us just waiting and we got turned around and the u.s or like the canadian border was like we saw a trade like this last week it honestly it probably just depends on the border guard [Music] we pull over we're looking up flights i'm crying my eyes out walling her eyes out because i i'm worried i'm gonna have to say goodbye to my sweet baby without even getting to know her so we're on the phone with flight like airlines to see if they will trains bosses trains um canadian borders on with some of their lovely lovely followers looking traitor privately in order to get this dog to us so we got on the phone with a border at blaine washington this sweet baby angel he so i'm on the phone with him let me tell you i said hey listen this is what just happened he's like well that's really weird because here in blaine we've been seeing this daily and i was like he's like so i'm not really sure why they would tell you that so that being said i was like well if we came asap would you let us through and he was like let me tell you what i worked from 8 a.m to 4 p.m it's like if you're here tomorrow between 8 a.m and 4 p.m go into the truck crossing and ask the border card i need to speak to yoda i'm not joking and i'll let you in and i'll let you in i will walk you we'll go get your dog and then you can go home so at this point i've been holding it together this isn't my dog i'm just along for the ride okay and like she'll be hiking with that she's she's missing she's your easy yeah oh and i'm gonna love this of her it's been a very emotionally charged five hours so as soon as he's like no problem get yourself to blade tomorrow between eight and four and i will make sure that his dog goes home with you so we both started sobbing our faces off because we get to at the gracious hands of this man who has a heart and wants to help us rescue this dog we get to bring belle or boo home so we got on the phone to sylvie and leah and asked them if they wouldn't mind driving another 13 hours to play in washington and they said of course because they are angels actual angels they are so lovely everybody who's been a part of this operation and like this mission is to everyone that follows save a fox to the people that were willing to help you have no idea what this means to us us and them as rescue and what this means for belle i promise with my entire being that i am going to give her the best life she can ever imagine i will let her be as normal of a dog as possible hike every day with us with our business um and pig is just gonna be the most amazing big brother to this sweet girl that deserves the most normal life so i am so thankful for all of you mary kayla sorry i'm so emotional i just appreciate everybody and everybody else that was willing to help and yoda thank you yoda we don't even know your first name yet but i don't even care i will give you a chocolate bar we will see you tomorrow my first board okay take her first board it's not
