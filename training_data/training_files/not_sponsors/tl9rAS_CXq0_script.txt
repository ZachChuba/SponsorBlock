alright guys we're back welcome back good to see you guys all here thanks for hanging out today is a special day because today I am going back in time today I'm gonna try to return to my roots of flying and now what I mean by that is lately I'm doing crazy things like building these a TENS and lately we've been doing Corsairs we're making toilets fly we're doing all kinds of crazy stuff and it got me thinking it's been a while since I just built a simple plane and so that's what I'm gonna do today today I'm returning back to my roots and not only building a simple plane but also just simple flying so we're talking three channel long flight times low and slow as little flying Cowboys like to say that is my favorite style of flying to this day I have had the honour to fly some amazing aircraft very high-performance aircraft very expensive aircraft there is something to be said about a simple flying simple to build plane the simpler the plane honestly the more enjoyment you can actually get out of it so that's what we're gonna be doing today I got my foam cut out here I'm not going to tell you guys what I'm gonna be building yet for those of you oh gee flight testers out there leave a comment down below if you can guess what I'm building before it's actually done but without further ado let's keep the building alright so if you guys are new here if you're one of the 42,000 people that have joined us in the last month welcome thank you for thank you for subscribing and thanks for hanging out with us if you're new to these planes and you're wondering like what the heck is he building cardboard plane or something it's actually not cardboard this is actually foam boards it's foam in the middle and then it has paper though the brown stuff is paper on the outside and it is originated from the dollar store we used to buy foam board from the dollar store same type of foam board that you do your school projects on and we've been building planes out of these now for a long time like almost 10 years it turns out it is a fantastic way to build an airframe that performs just as good as some of the traditional mediums like balsa or composite it flies just the same you can build a huge substantial plane the nice thing is is when you crash which you will because crashing is a huge part of the hobby is you only have like five bucks or however many dollars into your airframe because it's all foam both on board barbecue skewers popsicle sticks hot glue we use common materials so that's what this brown foam stuff is and this one particularly as you saw was cut out on a laser now we have about 50 different planes that we've made over the years designed and built they all have free plans so you can check the links below will link to the free plans for this plane and you can go to the dollar store and you can build this airframe actually you can build this whole airplane for less than five bucks which is amazing it's back in the day that wasn't even possible and so to be able to get into the Hobby so easily and excessively is is really something that's just become a reality in the last like 10 years or so so now this one particularly is what we call a speed build kit now you probably wonder if this is just like a hobby that we do on the weekend but this is actually a business and part of the reason how flight test supports ourselves how we make videos like this one right here is we sell these speed build kits basically instead of downloading the free plans and taking hours of your day to lay out the plans cut it out on the foam trace everything and yadda yadda yadda you buy our pre-cut speed build kit and it just saves the time of cutting all that stuff out with an exacto blade it's basically convenience I like to say we don't sell kits we actually just sell convenience and if you haven't guessed it yet I am building here the tiny trainer now this plane is actually several years old now but this is one of my favorites and so this tiny trainer is very very similar to the very first plane that I became very comfortable and it has trainer tendencies and a lot of people here trainer and they think it's not going to be very much fun but in reality it's actually the opposite as you can see here I have the fuselage done and now this was flat foam about an hour and a half ago and you glob some glue on there you fold the sides up and now we have a rigid fuselage of an airplane super-lightweight I've got my two servos inside there it's coming along very very quickly I have to say here though that returning to the basics of a simple design plane and also it's going to be simple to fly it's been very refreshing I've been enjoying it a lot so that being said and getting the motor mounted up now we're gonna build the wings and before we know we're gonna be flying this thing through the air from flat foam to flying through the air in like a matter of hours before we start building let's get back to building because I have a wing to build let's go all right so as you can see here look at this the plane is done and quite honestly probably no exaggeration probably about a three-hour build for me which is I'm honestly pretty proud of normally I take forever but the whole idea behind this little tiny trainer is to not only give a beginner a great flying experience but also to give you a great build experience is it covers every single build technique that we use in all of our planes so the idea is is if you can build this plane which you can you can build any of our plans it's like an introduction to our whole universe of scratch built foam board planes this is still one of my favorite forms of flight it is just very relaxed you're learning to actually fly off of the wing you're not just flying off of a huge motor in the front and speed you can cut the motor a lot of times and just glide and feel what it feels like to actually manage that energy that being said I figured what better way to show you how cool tiny trainer is then to get somebody out here that is a little bit unfamiliar with flying you guys know of our good friend named Jeremy he's been an awesome part of our team now for about two years he is known for some of our best pieces of content like the a-10 versus the tank he has been instrumental part of our team the funny thing about that is is that while he is very very busy he very rarely has any time to fly so you see him building quite a bit you don't see him flying too often and today it is my goal to start to change that and so what I'm gonna be doing is I'm going to be getting this tiny trainer ready for a beginner to learn how to fly on and I'm gonna teach you guys how to do it as well so if you're already hobbyist out there you can hopefully get other people into the Hobby but also if you're new to the Hobby hopefully some of these tips that I'm about to go over are gonna help you as well so I'm speaking of Jeremy look who's just showed up so Jeremy tell us a little bit about your experience that the hobby thus far before flight test did you ever fly before I never flew RC before flight test my dad's a pilot a real pilot yeah not current but in middle school I got to fly a little Cessna so yeah before flight test I have always had interest in getting into a hobby but you know when I was young it was too expensive now that I've been working at flight test I still well here's the funny thing is that we make videos about flying and Jeremy's job is to make those videos so typically when there's flying going on he's holding a camera and it's my goal to kind of switch that and I think this tiny trainer here man you and this plane are going to become very good friends this is awesome man thank you I am looking forward to flying this I we want to go deep for a minute so in my Thor's hammer video I talked a little bit about struggling with anxiety and depression actually my diagnosis is PTSD and so it's been challenging for me to fly because every time I go to fly I have a lot of anxiety about it it's just it's something that's not logical it's just a visceral reaction so I spent a little time on a simulator and I was even having anxiety about crashing in a simulator which is crazy I am going to conquer this I am looking forward to learning how to fly and over my process of healing it's been really cool to have these kinds of opportunities to face my anxiety to be able to put myself out there and fail and it be okay and then to have success and to have the euphoria from that so that I can enjoy the Hobby and have confidence in my abilities to fly and if I can do it you can do it too yep I like to tell people that there are a couple different learning curves that you have to overcome to have success in the Hobby one of which being is building and then once you get the plane built you need to learn how to set it up properly and kind of like tune it and then once you get those two learning curves overcome then you can actually start learning how to fly and so my mentality with building this for Jeremy today is to help him kind of bypass those first two hurdles and this is something that some of you hobbies out there can practice as well if you want to try to get your friends into the Hobby build them a plane get them past that part where they have to build and get it tuned properly and get them right into the flying you'll learn if you get that success early it kind of changes your mindset a little bit and it's gonna allow you to have more success in the future so without further ado enough talking we got to get the paintin so we can go out and fly alright guys so as you can see right here the plane is done and actually pretty proud of my paint jobs I've been getting more more comfortable with the old spray paint can do a little bit of pinstriping this time it actually worked out pretty well so check this out dude I love the color I love the pinstriping why did you have to make it so beautiful I don't want to wreck it so this is one of the key things to getting new people into the Hobby if you're hobbyist out there and you're thinking about getting your buddy into the Hobby when you're going through this process you want to make sure that you are using a plane that you personally are not attached to you can't have any attachment to your plane or this is not gonna work and so I built this plane specifically with Jeremy in mind I wanted to give it to him if it does end up crashing it's just not a big deal because crashing is a big part of the Hobby now that being said for the first couple flights with Jeremy I have what's called a buddy box setup and so we have our traditional transmitters here and they are hooked up so check this out so this is my controller that's Jeremy's I have control right now and when I hold down this button Jeremy moves the sticks now he has control he starts to crash I let go of the button and I have control back and he does not have control Josh said something this morning that resonated with me enjoy the crashes yes embrace them like the crashes are a part of the fun it's gonna be fun alrighty so we are out here and unfortunately real world you're gonna have to deal with some weather today we got a little bit of wind it always be better can always be worse it's about a 10 mile an hour wind it feels pretty steady which isn't a lot of wind but for a plane this light it's gonna be a little bit of a handful especially for a beginner so that is all things to take into consideration now when you walk out to the field with friend another thing to keep in mind too is to share your experiences with them so something one thing that I personally like to do is take a look at the wind direction so it's coming straight at us so we're going to be taking off that way but also once you get up there in the air where are you gonna be flying so we have the wind is one obstacle the Sun is always another obstacle which is up there we have some trees and stuff right there so right now Jeremy I'm thinking we're gonna take off and we're gonna fly a nice like left hand pattern right here I pin it in front of us so we never have to turn around fly that way now obviously things don't always go to plan so we can adjust if needed but that's the goal is to let's try to keep it in front of us so I'm going to take the plane off and I'm gonna show him myself doing it first and then with the buddy box system I'll pass the controls off to him so cool all righty I'm gonna go this way now cuz it feels like a win again alright relatively calm and we're gonna put it into a nice left hand pattern right above the building between the poles and the building above the building just like that all right so just keep it coming around left I'm passing you the controls soon as I turn it around here there you go that's you left left up pull back so left and pull back as your two main controls occasionally right to counteract your too much left a little bit more throttle nose down there you go hahaha so that was great though the wind is shifted so right now that's going into the wind yeah and as soon as you turn downwind like right here it just takes you it's going to take off and so it almost immediately you want to be pushing that left that left aileron control it's technically your rudder but it's hooked up to your alarm just keep pushing on it and have faith that it's going to push it around because at first it might not feel like it but it'll turn around so we're going into the wind here I'm going to give you control left and up that's what you want to focus on left go ahead unfortunate well that window go euro good keep that left again yeah there you go there you go that's great dude well that wind is really blowing me yeah so just kind of roll kind of fun yeah just kind of roll with the punches and don't react unless you have to if it tips one of your wings then you can react but other than that you could the plane will self-correct itself alright so try to bring it back toward us a little bit yeah when there's any kind of wind especially when you're new and a light plane like this you'll very easily get very far away from yourself very quickly yeah so you want to maintain your distance and you're doing a great job thanks man I'm getting the hang of it and actually for those of you who are training somebody how to fly having somebody it sounds silly but having somebody say great job is so helpful because like I feel like I'm doing a terrible job our throttle and throttle and climb-climb-climb oh wow yeah there's a bunch of turbulence over there thank you your battery might be shot I got control I'm gonna try to bring her back here alright so now typically I'm gonna land it here I love window lanes land so typically you want to use a two cell battery but because today is unique and we have a little bit of crazy wind going on I'm going to put a 3-cell on here which is one gonna give you more power but it's also going to give the plane a little bit more weight and help it penetrate through this wind a little bit 3-cell take one let's try I'm gonna do something which really helps me a lot just to kind of feel the characteristics of a plane I'm gonna take you way up there huh I'm gonna give you the control touching that cloud of us there you go all right now go ahead and cut the throttle yeah and glide it down in a pattern and see if you can land it again tiny trainer is great for this because it is definitely an airplane when you have the motor on the front but it's also a glider it has lighter tendencies so it carries its momentum very well and actually it can even be built as a chuck glider comes with two different wings and two different noses to give you two different kinds of experiences whether you want a glider or an actual powered airplane well a little bit nose down you know keep your nose down to bleed off that altitude look at that dude well that is great and honestly the cool thing about flying and challenging conditions like this is when you get a nice sunset evening where it's perfectly calm and you've experienced this that's when it really starts to click and this muscle memory starts to kick in it was a little bit beyond what I would typically recommend for a plane this size and all that being said you did great man thanks fantastic so and definitely having you there to bail me out of those situations that would have been what five to seven crashes yeah where I might have been frustrated by myself honestly I like to tell people that flight tests exists and we've had some of the success that we've had because of how unapproachable the hobby has always been and so we wanted to make this video and kind of capture Jeremy's journey into the Hobby in hopes that we would help you now if you guys are out there and you're considering taking the plunge into the Hobby we really encourage you to get involved with our we call them family but the flight test community is really really awesome it's some of the most caring and giving community that you'll ever experience you can check them out on flight test fans on Facebook it's an awesome group shout out to all you guys on Facebook as well as the flight test forums there's tons of great information and people on there willing to help and then also all the whole YouTube community we wouldn't be here without you guys so thank you so much for watching if you haven't subscribed yet make sure you do so and we'll see you guys next time thanks Alex you're welcome and you'll put in our batteries let's do how we can crash
