What company is this? [Eyes rolling]
Please close your eyes. How dare an entry level employee barge in with a question while the department head is talking? [Where am I? Who am I?] [Zoom]
Oh, thank you! Huh? Didn't he give the card? I'll resign from the work. [Life Corp. Entertainment Department] [Warning: The following video is the office comedy done by idols :)] [Where is everyone? / Not even a glimpse of a person] [The first one to arrive is Ms. YUQI] What is this? [Ms. YUQI (Age 22) - Singularity: She is courteous]
Oh! Hello. [Awkward] [Exerting the aura of the experts / The second ones to arrive are SOYEON and SOOJIN] [Spots them] You're late. [Nope]
You just came early. I see no passion on the first day of work. [We're doing a comedy at the moment]
-It's not the first day. We come here every day.
-Yeah, so it's the first day for today. [Peek-a-boo] [MINNIE, SHUHUA, MIYEON / Late comers not ashamed]
-Hi~!
-Hello. You're late by 4 minutes. Whatever. That's cool. Are you perhaps the daughter of the department head? [The daughter of department head] [Are those the daughters of the CEO? / Loafing around] [SYSTEM: MINNIE joined the selfie mode] Good morning! Gosh, you scared me. [Department head(Age 45)]
Good morning! Oh, hello! [Translation: Greetings, Mr. Department head!] Let's get a grip and start working. Cheers! [Hang on]
What does it mean by work? Work! What company is this? Entertainment. Don't you know an idol group called (G)I-DLE? Is there someone who doesn't? [(G)I-DLE / No. 1 in her mind]
I would love to cast them. [Pfft]
They are so talented in my perspective as well. [Okay, accepted]
-Let me call them right away.
-Please cast them! Yes, I love (G)I-DLE. You like them, eh? I'm their big fan. Who do you like the most? [Isn't it obvious?] YUQI. [I love YUQI]
She is so cute. She's a bit noisy and bragging a lot. [Get out, YUQI]
I love MINNIE more than her. MINNIE looked pretty today. [Her lips moves in agreement]
I know, right? She's so my type. But it seemed like she did the makeup pretty lightly [Her hand movements are as fancy as the freckles]
-that I can see all the freckles.
-Oh, yes! [Please understand as she's a foreigner]
-Maybe she's a foreigner.
-Guys? [Is this really a company? / No more chatting]
Instead of personality tests for a more sound company culture, [His point]
we'll do the ubrevisor test. [Out of blue?]
What is it? -What is ubervisor(ggonde)?
-Applause, please! [Clap clap clap] [What is ubervisor?]
What is it? [Uncomfortable]
How dare an entry level employee barge in with a question while the department head is talking? [What is going on?] That's what ubervisor does! A perfect example! It's the worst! [She still doesn't get it] [11:00 AM Morning duty: ubervisor test]
Alright, let's get started with the test. Start! [Everything is in Korean]
Boss! Isn't there an option for Chinese? I need Thai. [Korean is hard / All the employees from overseas are shoving questions]
-What is an organization?
-What is dear? What is belonging? [I wanna go home...]
It's as if you feel like belonging. [They give up after 10 minutes]
Maybe I should just say Not At All to everything. It's so hard. Let's open the Thai dictionary. Why are there so many? [She did only one-third] [On the other hand, Koreans are at peace] [On the other hand, Koreans are at peace 2] [On the other hand, Koreans are at peace 3] [Whatever, no one can stop me]
Oh, I'll just say Yes to everything. I don't get it. And there's the result! Already? [There's no way!]
Wait, weren't you at question 13 just now? [The department head decides to help the foreigners out]
Do you like spending your [I love being alone!]
free time alone? [Yes] I can't live alone, no way. Then how do you shower? I listen to music when I'm in a shower, at least. [Nope]
I don't like listening to music when I'm in a shower. Even when she's off to the restroom, she asks someone to join her. What are you, a baby? Seriously, are you? [Our baby]
-She must be.
-Don't you feel safe? Do you have to enter as well? No, I wait outside. She's a little tiring. Next, most of your thoughts and choices turn out to be right? I feel like all my thoughts are on the right track. [An ubervisor-to-be]
That's what you call a bluff. [Accepted] [Whatever] Do you express your emotions directly to others? Excuse me! No, not that... [Thrown off for real] [Fine, I accept the challenge]
Make yourself at home. [No, no] [Everyone's tests are done]
-Are you done?
-Yes! Shall we show the results in turns? Level 2 for me. [MIYEON, Level 2, Drunk Warrior] You're not the one to say so. How about SOYEON? Level 2. [SOYEON, Level 2, Chatterbox Teacher] Chatterbox! [I can't accept this]
No way, chatterbox is her! [Haha, I can't breath]
Hang on! -SOOJIN?
-Level 1 for me. [SOOJIN, Level 1, Flashy Punisher] -Level 2 for me.
-Oh, 2. [MINNIE, Level 2, Transparent Electronic Brain] I'm level 2. [YUQI, Level 2, Flashy Punisher] Maybe level 2 is pretty high. No, it's normal. Level 2 is normal. What about you, SHUHUA? Level 5? [SHUHUA, Level 3, Narrow-minded Pacifist] -3?
-Yup. [There's the ubervisor]
-The hidden ubervisor!
-I thought you'll get level 0. [The youngest on top / Congrats on being a ubervisor!]
Oh, congrats! You got the highest level. [She has something more to say] Narrow-minded Pacifist. -Huh?
-Narrow-minded Pacifist? Isn't that a good one? I see a lot of you denying your result. [That's why I prepared this]
So, [Testing to see who's ubervisor with a high-standard system!]
let's apply the system used in Silicon Valley nowadays. [Silicon... what?]
Please close your eyes, everyone. When I call upon someone's name, [I knew it]
please raise your hand if you think she's an ubervisor. Is MIYEON an ubervisor? [Hand] Is MINNIE an ubervisor? [Slow] [Hand] [Always one stop behind]
Wait, are we voting right now? [SHUHUA is at it again...]
Oh, gosh, SHUHUA... [Hilarious lol]
SHUHUA! [Forget the secret voting]
Fine, I'll vote MIYEON. [No rigged election, please!]
It's already passed! [Let's move on / Calm down and continue voting]
Close your eyes, and let's vote on! Is SHUHUA an ubervisor? [Revenge] Is SOOJIN? [No one] Is YUQI? Is SOYEON? [The leader came clean] [With the clean vote, MINNIE is the top ubervisor with 3 votes]
MINNIE is chosen as the top ubervisor. [She accepts the result quickly] Please step forward, MINNIE. [Emotionless]
Amazing, she's awarded~ [Possibly the best actress]
Please cry! [It's so unfair]
Aren't I on the top? [Why did we go through the test?]
What's the meaning of the test? [The glistening armband that is passed down from all the prior ubervisors]
And here is your award! An armband for the Queen of ubervisor! [You can have it!]
Fine, I'll give it to you! [The band is on her arm now] Well, I feel pretty cool about this. [A firm taster of acting]
There she goes with her acting. I'll do it like a Queen. Since MINNIE is the Queen ubervisor she'll be the errand girl of the day. [Yay]
No, you're the errand girl. What? [Now she gets it]
-I'm not the one who'll order people around?
-Nope. [Get some work done]
Please start working. [Transformed into ITZY]
Stop nagging! Is that how the song goes? [Hehe] Boss! [The first time talking]
When are we getting food? [Exaggerating]
We already worked for 5 hours! [Very sensitive due to hunger]
This is too much! Should we get some food then? Yes! [A nice boss leaving so the girls can enjoy their lunch]
I already have plans, so you guys can get the food yourselves. [Is he actually leaving..?]
Ah, thank you! [Bye, boss]
OK! Bye! -I was scared if he's going to eat with us again.
-Exactly. He didn't give us his card. Huh? He didn't? I'ts OK, our preachy sister is going to buy us food. [Not my money, so I don't care]
She has a lot of money. They love buying others food. [How ridiculous]
They kind of enjoy that. -Isn't that you, then?
-No, it's not. [Saying random things because she feels guilty]
-But is that being preachy? That's not true.
-What should we eat? Should we get something to eat from pantry? [Food over work]
-Yes~I want to!
-Let's go! [Her armband more important than food]
Ugh, I'm so tired~ [Running] [Imagine if we didn't give her that armband..] [12:30PM lunch time]
-Are you guys hungry?
-Yes~ I think I should eat something sweet. [Arrived / Going for the refrigerator first]
Let's check what's inside the refrigerator! [Opened] Don't we have Korean beef? [Here you go]
This is a Korean beef sandwich. [Thanks]
Oh, really? Isn't there anything interesting these days? (G)I-DLE has some good songs. [Love]
I know, I was shocked. [(G)I-DLE is.. unbelievable..]
They are so good! Who wrote the song? It's a very good song. I know! A genius songwriter, you know. [I am that genius songwriter]
-Jeon Jelly?
-Not her! [What are you talking about]
-It is Jeon Jelly!
-The one that wrote 'LION'! Oh I don't like that one. [Jeon Jelly, how is she? Not that good VS She's a genius]
Oh, really? I respect her so much! [Please respect my taste]
Really? We have two different tastes. [Jeon Jelly (22) / Speechless] Is the one that sings the first part called Minnie? I don't know why she's in it. [What about Minnie?]
She's so charming! [You guys don't know anything]
You guys really don't know about music, right? Wait, does our boss never work? I've never seen him work. Wait! Isn't the preachy one our boss, not me? I heard he just got planted on the position. He can't really do anything. [Talking negative stuff about their boss..]
He always says he has some plans. [Feeling better]
Since the lunch time is almost over, let's go back to the office before our boss gets there first. I really don't want to go back.. We have to, we gotta work. It's so hard to earn money, really! Don't you know about him? [Going back before the boss starts nagging]
He's going to start nagging if we get there later than him. Ah~ I don't want to work.. [02:00PM Afternoon work] [Ta-da]
Happy afternoon. Did you enjoy your lunch? [Thanks to you]
-Yes~ I'm so full.
-Really? What did you have? [Racoon Ramen]
*** ramen. *** ramen? [Real Ramen]
Ah, I had *ramen. -*ramen?
-I also had *ramen. Did you steal it from the pantry? -We had almost everything there.
-It said we could have them. They're only for me, though? What on earth? It's OK, I'll take it from your next month's salary. [Shocked] [You don't even give us much!]
You don't even pay us a lot! [Not listening]
I'll write down the things you need to get done for the afternoon, the first thing! Organizing the papers! The most basic thing. Second, sealing on the contracts! -You have to be careful with it, though.
-I know right. Third, SHUHUA, what do you think? Uh...eating Korean beef? Eating Korean beef? [What a great lady]
You're something SHUHUA! [Expecting Korean beef]
[Shin Chan in real life / SHUHUA cannot be stopped]
Looks like you're not that full, SHUHUA? [It's not Korean beef]
Third, organizing the receipts We're going to divide into teams. [I LOVE Soo-jin]
I want to be with SOOJIN! I don't want to be with SHUHUA. [Hurt]
OK, so dividing up based on where I'm standing. [Lazy]
This is great. -OK?
-I'm quitting. [MIYEON, MINNIE, SHUHUA]
Since MINNIE is the preachy one, this team is called the preachy team! [Whoa~] [SOYEON, YUQI, SOOJIN]
This one is called the not preachy team. [Proud]
Not preachy~ I'm going to be out on business. I'll see how much you've got done after I'm back. You leave the office often, boss? He's going for a meeting! Don't blame him. [A slave of capitalism.mov]
He always says he has some plans. [Huh?]
SOYEON, I like your attitude! SOYEON, I'm going to cut half of your salary! [What??]
-Cut?
-Yes, cut! [The boss allergic to compliments]
I don't like getting compliments. I like receiving feedback. [Boss..]
Wow! He's the best! Do you want Korean beef after this? [Happiness level MAX]
-Yes!!! I love that!
-Korean beef? [The boss leaving to get Korean beef]
-OK! Bye!
-We'll look forward to it. What do we do, now? Well, we need to organize the documents. [Working hard for Korean beef]
Alright, let's do it. [Document organization game 1. Categorize the documents] [2. Staple them] [3. Put them into the assigned envelope] The first thing we have to do is document organization, you know? This is easy, right? Start! [Quickly] [Roughly separating them] [and giving them to So-yeon] [Chaos]
We've failed [Just stapling everything she has] Excuse me! Ah, wait! I can do this quickly x2 [Stapler: Just kill me..]
-MIYEON..
-Switch with SHUHUA! Why doesn't this work? [Keep failing / Struggling with the stapler] [I'm coming]
Quickly, quickly! What are you doing? Huh? How did you do this? [Taking..forever..] [YUQI (22) / Impatient]
Hey! Should I do it? [The preachy team working well] [Let's see..] [Realizing that they've failed]
We've failed.. No. Quickly! x4 We're done! [Document organization / the non-preachy team submitted first]
Done! -This came out..
-And we dropped.. [Sneaky] [Although submitted first, since they cheated, the boss will decide the winner!] [Sealing contracts 1. Stamp it] [2. Sign it] [3. Separate based on the names] The next work is to seal the contract. I hope you guys can do it right this time. We did! I know, I was talking to myself. Let's start. [Start!] [Stamping without hesitation] [Vertical stamping skill] [A sorcerer controlling MIYEON] [Bang, bang] [The preachy team finished stamping first] Wait, are you done? There should be some that's not been done. [Finishing a little later]
Perfect. We're done. [The pen not working well now..]
Wait, this pen's not working, though? [The preachy team having their time]
Ah, we won, we won, actually. [Signing the papers quickly real late] They're good at work. Ah one paper isn't signed over there. [The preachy team is on their last step of the game] [The non-preachy team is also on their last step]
-Let's start cleaning up!
-How are we supposed to clean this up? [Airheaded]
I thought of putting all of it in.. It's here. Ah is it not? [Shush...] I've never seen MINNIE that passionate. [Smirk] [The preachy team  is almost done]
I'll give it to you here. [On the other hand, the non-preachy team is still in chaos]
-We're good.
-Wait wait... wait... [Done imprinting the second contract / The preachy team submits it first]
Done! We didn't even get to put it in. Ah... [Annoyed] Ah YUQI is kinda scary.. I feel like she'll change it. [Checking what each other did]
-Ah what is it?
-What is it? [Wait] [It's stamped vertically] Hey we didn't do this one! [Lol found a loophole~!!]
Ah! They didn't do it! What? Who are you making a contract with? We're rejecting (the contract). -Our company almost collapsed if we didn't sign the contract.
-I know right! [Continues to suspect]
Is this how we put it in? -Yeah.
-I heard you guys put it in oppositely. Didn't you guys just change it? [Mad]
No! Ah let's not play it dirty like this. [Both teams made mistakes!] [Organizing receipts 1. Unfold the receipt] [2. Attach it with glue] [3. Calculate the total] Now we have our last job left. [Tada]
It's organizing receipts. You know that this is the most important thing to do right? Our company might get screwed even with a tiniest mistake. [I know I know]
Yeah, even a 0.1 difference! We have to make sure that something like we just did before doesn't happen again. [Attack / Oops..]
We can't organize them oppositely like we just did. Should we start? [Start organizing receipts!] [Waiting quietly] We can do it slowly. Right. [As the other team was chilling] [Full brain operation] [Gluing it quickly] Are you a genius? [Believe in me] [The preachy team is doing it quickly thanks to genius SOOJIN] [One page done] [What is that] [Aha!!] [I got it] [Let us use some too~]
Ah she's so smart! They copied ours. [Really?]
Why are you copying ours? [The non-preachy team  starts calculating the receipts] [Still attaching them / finishing up with the calculations] But who do you think spends the most money on our team? [No hesitation]
Shu Hua! [Strong opposition]
It's not me! It's really not me! [(G)I-DLE's official eater]
-Ah a lot of money gets used for SHUHUA's food.
-Right. I think it's SOYEON. [Making up excuses]
I still use it properly. [SOYEON's consumption pattern Purchases  → loses  → purchases]
-I think I buy things often because I lose things a lot.
-Yeah. [The non-preachy team is done calculating]
-I'm done, 914,360 won
-You're wrong~ [Startled]
Eh? It's wrong? It's okay, we're good. [The preachy team's results]
-1,472,900 won.
-That's right. [Correct] [Uhm / Uhm2]
We won! [Convinced that they won] [Expressing victory with her whole body] [The preachy team finally earns 1 point] [The only thing to believe in is the boss' choice]
The boss is gonna decide our fate. We should be good to him. [I have a bad feeling...]
I have no idea which one he's gonna choose. [He's back]
-Wow!
-Right? Right? [Neat]
Wow! Wow! Wow! [Reviewing Wang Kkondae Team's document organization]
It's not bad! Not bad. Ah good job. [Screaming out of joy] It got done quickly and well because there was an ubervisor in the team. [Oh my god pictures file]
-Now, the non-preachy team!
-Look at it one by one. [No stamp]
-This one doesn't have a stamp
-We're screwed! We lost millions of money because of this. We were telling them that we didn't wanna sign the contract. [That's not possible]
You can't just decide by yourself like that. This was a contract worth 10 billion won. No way! [The slave of capitalism]
You guys got a lot of points off for not stamping here. Then the non-preachy team -Oh my!
-It's such a mess. [Messy / tattling]
-Oh my this.... oh?
-We did it on the bottom! [All different / Some documents aren't there..]
What is going on here? This one isn't even done. This is what ubervisor is. [Translation: Why do we only have to print it on top?]
Why do we have to do it that way? Ah for me, I wanna give them some creativity points. [Is it a design company?]
What kind of creations did we make? Today's winning team is! [1R document organization]
[One line review: Neat and good organization / The preachy team wins!!]
Wow wow wow! It's not bad! Not bad. [2R Imprinting contracts]
[One line review: The importance of a 10 billion worth contract / The preachy team wins!!]
-This was a contract worth 10 billion won.
-No way! [3R Organizing receipts]
[One line review: They are the masters of calculating]
1,472,900 won. [The preachy team wins!]
We won! The preachy team won! Ah we're so embarrassed! And for the team that lost [Is there a punishment?]
What is it? Let's do some more work together~ [I wanted to go home..] The winning team can leave! [Left work early / working till night]
Bye! x2 Take care! We have to live like this. Right. [Watching you]
-Doing it quickly with no effort is not how we do it.
-Mhm. Please give lots of love to us, (G)I-DLE [Working at night]
Shall we sing 'Oh my god'? Sounds good~ Bye~ Ah good job! [Good luck with night work]
-We all worked hard!
-Ah good luck! Let's cheer for our leftover work. Fighting~! -YUQI
-Hm? How are you so bad at calculating? [That's not it]
-There's a calculator.
-I didn't know we could use the calculator. [Don't make up excuses / the behavior is more important than the calculator]
You can do it with your heart. I'm actually worse at this when I use those stuff. -So the calculator wasn't good enough?
-Yeah. Guys? How about you guys be quiet and do your work? Let's work hard. [Behind cuts]
Oh no! Are you okay? Uhm ubervisor MINNIE? Please help. Ah good job~ -Did I do well?
-Yeah. We're gonna switch already! What do you want me to do? Do that side! Do it in a funny way! Okay good!
