hello everyone in today's video I really want to go deep into the things I did wrong in college and the mistakes that I feel that contributors for lower grades less productivity and overall a lack of success in my learning process besides being a learning commitment college is also a social experiment and even if you are an introvert like I am you'll probably end up feeling like you need to talk to people and it's cool to sit in the back of the classroom and I did that in my first year of college and now that I think back I think it was really stupid to do that because I was really not paying attention in class I was on my computer scrolling through Instagram or Facebook at a time and since I have a really low attention span I always benefit from sitting in the front of the classroom which is what I do now and I did in my late years of law school so if I could change one thing I would probably change that first hand the second thing I did wrong with skipping reading materials altogether and only sticking with class notes I always defend that in case you're cramming for an exam or test class notes should be your foundational materials to study since it's a very condensed and summarized version of everything you need to study for a test however if you are trying to achieve a high mark especially in college those class notes will probably not be enough for you to get that high mark you are trying to achieve every time your professor or teacher sends you reading materials you are expected to read them and overall include that information in your answers if that topic is approached during the exam so what I do now is besides studying my class notes with tons of focus and attention I always read my study materials those kind of articles and pdfs our professor sent us and I read them as I would read a book and I found out that when I do that and a couple that information I have a really good overarching experience and I feel like I can get the most out of all of those study materials and since we are talking listed down below in the description box my third mistake in law school / College was focusing way too much on the aesthetic of my notes when I started this YouTube channel I was right in the middle of the time where the planet community gained a lot of relevance on the internet so most of the videos that were published on YouTube or about how to decorate planners how to decorate note how to use stickers washi tape the types of colored pen that were the best and looked nice on your notes and so on since I've always been a stationery lover I fell in love with the concept and I started spending way too much money on highlighters collared pants and all that kind of stuff and using it in college however I feel like that focus was not well directed because I spent way too much time having fun with the aesthetic part of my notes and I feel like I forgot that notes are supposed to be efficient to be simple and to allow you to memorize and retain information better that's why I had to oversimplify my note-taking system to the note-taking system it is now and which I've talked about in a previous video and I feel that now that I'm taking my second college course in history I feel like adopting this new simple note-taking system really improves my grades it improved how I memorize information and how I retain information in class and if I could go back I would completely change my note-taking system in law school and refocus my attention on what was essential during class the fourth mistake I think I made was not taking language lessons for the entirety of college I started studying German in my third year of college only on the second semester and I was actually taking classes in the German Institute in Lisbon I really enjoyed taking those classes I was really enjoying learning the language but on my fourth year of college I can find any compatible schedules with my college schedule so I had to abandon German classes and although I started studying German on my own because of that I think that not having a teacher support not having classmates not having that pressure associated with homework exams tests and so on really made my progress slower so if I could take that back I definitely would I would start taking language lessons as soon as I got into college because it's much easier to manage the workload if you're taking classes and four years of college is more than enough for you to have at least some comprehension on the language you're trying to learn and as soon as you go into self-taught mode at least you already have all of your foundations and you have an easier time learning the language through textbooks through novels music video games movies and so on finally mistake number five was not approaching professors and teachers when I needed you as a very shy person I always felt that I could not approach my teachers and talk to them when I had doubts I had questions or I wanted any sort of recommendation I feel like this mainly started because I'm an introverted person but I also had a high degree of insecurity about my grades and about my knowledge when I was in law school and I feel like that prevented me from speaking out loud and talking to my teachers emailing them saying I was having trouble with some kind of topics and themes that were being discussed in class asking for book recommendations and so on I feel like currently that's something I can do better since I start to my history major I feel like I have no trouble approaching teachers and talk to them and asking them questions and so on but I also feel like I do that now because I've already finished my first degree so in a certain way I feel like I'm not in the same position as a first-time student and I can now pave my way around how to interact with teachers if I could change this in law school I would definitely would and I definitely recommend all of you to try to step out of your comfort zone and approach teachers so this is all for today's video don't forget to subscribe to the channel click the bell button to be notified whenever a new video comes out and that's
