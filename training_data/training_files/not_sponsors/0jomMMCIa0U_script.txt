bang what does it mean what does it mean to be happy in a world where the whole every country everywhere is kind of go after your internet that's basically what the news is this week we've got European Wikipedia sites go dark to protest copyright reform we've got that the EU internet copyright bill was rejected hooray I think I don't know what ton about it completely we got kids trapped in caves Thailand and Elon must try to save them all so ganda has a new social Uganda has a new social media tax which is like actually incredibly expensive compared to how much people make in general over there this is not the way roll the intro good it's good ouchy ouchy ouchy someone sent me a message on the forum and they thought that lasted wearing a tunnel better shirt here and actually really looks like it no I asked that and he showed me it's like it's a box no white the white bar and Heath is like says unboxing yeah yeah yeah if you need to get around certain social taxes in Uganda and yeah LTX you don't need a VPN there because you'll be doing interactive stuff in in like real life and things because it's fun good public Internet access yeah so let's let's start at the top Wikipedia did a little bit of a protest in the EU to protest copyright reform and how they did that was they basically turned off to different sites within Wikipedia so when you go to Wikipedia you pick your language and each one of those is essentially kind of its own thing so I believe they turned off France and Spain Italy banished an Italian the Spanish and Italian editions while in Europe were were off essentially so if you went to the site you just saw this giant block of text that was like by the way that was posted by mains on the forum thank you very much I appreciate it my main user yeah you just saw a bunch of text that was like hey you're not seeing information you're seeing a description of what they're trying to do in the ways that it will affect look at this night yeah you said we got going on right now there we go slow I don't think those n gadgets fault I think that's us but yeah yeah so that that sucks for anyone who had to research anything at that point oh man I guess you could probably just go to a different version of Wikipedia and like translate the page or whatever but yeah so this happened ahead of the European Parliament's final vote on the controversial EU copyright directive which is the first time the region is updating its copyright laws since 2001 the boss tentatively trying to modernize them but it kind of looks like it's it's a war between content creators like like movie studios and the record business business business the giant decentralized Internet of people who just want to remix and create an upload like memes that's been at the center of this for a little while that's how a lot of people have actually heard about this is the mean problem but it's it has to do with a lot of other things as well and the link tax yeah so there's two articles within the the big thing which we have linked in the wine dock here so if you are watching this later on you can check the wine dock in the link below the YouTube video or SoundCloud yes there is an audio or only only version of this actually and you'll be able to find it there the first article is article 11 which will require is also posted websites to pay a fee to link to news publications or to use snippets from their articles so if you're on Facebook and you see an embedded snippet or an embedded link to another article where you've got a little thumbnail image part of the title and maybe a description of the content Facebook wouldn't be able to show that unless they paid some kind of license fee to the owner of that content I think yeah it's pretty like it's ridiculous as if as if difficult as if Facebook is just gonna spend all day every day licensing all the different pieces of content that get uploaded to Internet that day it doesn't make any sense look at this one quick thing I just wanted to show how wonderful this is we're able to stream but I can't even like load web page priorities baby yeah we got this though yeah this is dream is working but I can't see the chat so you know I'm actually not a hundred percent convinced that it's working but it might be I'm gonna go shake pre-recorded yeah I'm gonna go with yes well this unintentional load currently there's an exception in there people were concerned about link tax where if you've got some text and part of that text is highlighted because it's a hyperlink like check out our last review on this here that you wouldn't be able to have that here hyperlink without paying the tax but I think there's a for that okay yeah because I would just break me that's what the Internet's based on that's what Google is based on yeah and and there is another exemption that allows search engines to to use you input stick around yeah you want to be found cuz that's good for your bottom line yeah but you don't want to be linked to and then you don't want to lift up other platforms that are aggregators basically because they're just profiting off your content you know paying you enough or like be used as an image sharing host when that's not we're supposed to be make cetera et cetera yeah a big part of it is like the amount of money that a lot of music artists are not making from YouTube that they are making from Spotify so okay we're good opponents want these these musicians just to renegotiate with YouTube and not kind of stained the whole internet with a shotgun blast yeah okay so my my webpage finally loaded so twitch tap people there's the link there you go sorry about the delay yeah so there's another article that's article 11 now then there's also article 13 which requires websites to filter user submissions and check them against copyrighted work that is so brutal and would just like crush the forum and everyone's yeah yes yes any online platform that allowed users to post text images sounds or code reddit would need to assess and filter that content which has a bunch of brutal implications which are nicely summarized by this like party this pirate party every serial UGC site user-generated content site would just be this is exactly why this is exactly why Wikipedia was protesting ah because they are yeah okay exactly they're even pretty good about like exactly making sure that everything's all okay but like policing everything would be so here's a listing can I send this to you so I can you click on this one which will source for so I don't know you might call this bias because this is definitely one side of the argument here this is Julia Retta who represents the pirate party the pirate pact you can still find good information from knowing is always better go down you can find good information from zero down consequences list freedom of expression limited obviously yeah number one independent creators harmed yeah and then there's all this like stifling of innovation and stuff because if okay let's say you want to have a platform that gets user generated content if you need to police that then that either takes a ton of staff or it takes an algorithm both those things cost resources so something like this just solidifies incumbents and then Boggs Boggs small businesses down in regulation that they just can't handle yeah it's it's really interesting when putting a law into place is is getting people to legitimately go to a pirate party website and be like yeah that makes sense like like button but they don't necessarily agree with piracy that's that's an interesting check out this point surveillance risk due to high development costs for monitoring technology this will likely end up like the technology would be outsourced to some major players who make that kind of thing so that there would be a few large players who are the gatekeepers so everything that's being uploaded so they have this data of what a large segment of the population is uploading yeah that seems to go OK it doesn't go against GD P R RG d RP I always forget which way that goes but it isn't going like it I think it's a crappy I also had the same thing yeah I always remember the GD but after that my guess it doesn't go against it but I think it goes against the point almost because they I think I think the point is to try to reduce the amount that your your monitored online if you don't want to be on a certain website anymore you can ask them to remove all your stuff if you your those sites aren't allowed to keep your stuff for way too long and now it's just like filter everything monitor everything make sure everything is ok which again it doesn't technically go against it this would be allowed as long as it was disclosed and everything was okay and you could delete it if you wanted couple bla but yeah it's just weird so we didn't go through for now yeah the the Wikipedia protesting was a few days ago I think it was on Thursday that they had their first vote but it's not over there they're gonna they're basically going back to the drawing board we're gonna rework the proposal and then all of the members of European Parliament to get to vote again and September 10 to 13 this is a nice long weekend yeah it's a cabin together although your bong and vote on their disaster for posting that on the forum yeah that guys would yeah yeah a lot of people in the chatter saying that we look super saturated we are super sad or not though what I've been told by the people who set it up it's not actually oversaturated it's what the colored light on the back wall looks like oh I mean that's pretty that actually does look pretty realistic too this is a blue light shining on this blue wall that's a reddish pinkish light shining on that red wall and then there's pink LEDs behind that red wall so the walls just look crazy cuz they're they're blue and red and then has blue and red being shines Luke is just full of vitality is rosy cheeks are actually just full of rose or yeah rose blood how do you remember being outside yeah but you drink your milk yes yeah yeah yeah I'm getting through various nodding and thumbs up from it we think it's because the independent colors of lights on okay well I can't tell because we have a gaming monitor that is not helical abraded at all so what it looks like okay cool we're going with it yeah it's fine Best Buy is gonna have this on their monitors on their showroom floor on all the TVs look at this it pops baby oh that sells TVs speaking of look at this the best segue ever Elon Musk apparently for whatever reason saves the world and your children a cave that got flooded so if you guys haven't heard of it there's like I believe it's a soccer team and their coach yeah was just kind of exploring around for what I don't know how this ended up happening but they were in Thailand yeah it's a soccer team of 12 Thai boys yeah and their coach yeah I don't know why they were doing this but they were exploring a cave that's cool outside extracurricular activities kind of situation I hung out too long they hung or too long in the cave it flooded and they kept on getting pushed back further into the cave because as it flooded more and more and more they tried to keep getting higher ground and getting to more air and all that kind of stuff so they got stuck god that's way oh yeah all right they like 2.5 kilometres in there now really yeah I don't know yes well someone else I was talking to you told me Jake said they were like six miles in there but the thing I read said two and a half K which is a big discrepancy but regardless that's scary as man like yeah just having to retreat deeper into this thing so it sounds like at the very least the flooded sections is 2.5 k because it says it it takes even the most experienced divers up to five hours that's right to swim through the 2.5 kilometres of jagged narrow channels from where the how what I guess you're not that many atmospheres down because you're like just barely under the water okay it's gnarly apparently so they were reported missing on the 23rd of June they were discovered 9 days later by a pair days later by a pair of British divers yeah could do nothing yeah you just showed up and like no you can't come with us because it's too crazy of a dive like they have explored a possibility of getting the boys to swim out but none of the boys can even swim they don't know how to swim let alone dive well even if they were to dive there trying to get them a special like full face diving mask because normal respirators would probably just get ripped off because it's like super tight so to explain the super tightness to these guys have to be well their master divers for sure but they they like would at a base level have to have the tech certificate because there's certain points where you can't have your air tank strapped to your back okay so like I couldn't find if they had to like run them sat by their side or if they had to just like go off air for a second throw the tank through swim through and then hook back up I don't know what the situation is but this is not at all a simple dock its advanced enough that tragically a either an ex-navy seal or current Navy SEAL from Thailand actually did die diving I think on his way back yeah so and there's a ticking clock it's not like they can just hang out and keep bringing them food there's a ticking clock because they're in the middle of the rainy season which goes for like another three or four months until the end of October I think and there's rain forecasted for the weekend up until now there hasn't been much rain so the water is gonna keep coming and they're running out of places to go in fact they might have beat they might be out of places to go yeah wait wait there's more they're running out of oxygen the oxygen in the chamber that they're in is down to dangerous levels like 15% or something like that so they had 10 rescuers with the boys who delivered food and stuff and heard their doctors and nurses and boys the boys and they got five of those rescuers just to leave because they're just sucking up too much talk too much oxygen and they're like bringing oxygen tanks in to the chamber just so they can breathe that's pretty wild by the way guys I can't share screen right now because I have I have no internet I'm gonna try to go on what I can't believe this is happening look Oh God okay we're still alive apparently I can see it on my phone I connected the LTE on my phone whoops you look so natural that's not saturated at all yeah whatever so so if they can't walk out so they can't swim out so then be thinking maybe they could walk out so they've been pumping water out of there yeah but like freaking tons of it right like millions of gallons yeah and they've also been trying to dig down to them they've dug over a hundred holes some of them are 400 meters deep and this is where Elon Musk comes in for - brought you two of those things one he thinks he can pump water faster using some like Tesla battery-operated thing yeah and - he's sending boring company engineers who thinks they can dig better or at least help out in some way so like on Twitter he's like this is nuts yes someone messaged him like oh can you help with this Elan help and he's like I'll help in any way I can and everyone just thinks that's like oh well there's there's no way he can help he's saying he'll help in any way he can maybe he'll donate a bit and move on and every like I have access to the most talented digging engineers there are I'm just gonna you know ship a team over well we'll try to pump water out faster and then this was my favorite one he also discussed the possibility of inserting a nylon tube into the cave to fill it with air like a bouncy cap that's a long tube so that is very long tube it's 2.5 kilometres presumably and then make it just hang out boys yeah hang out what you know that this still doesn't solve the water problem if they're at the end of it if they're at there like the deepest chamber they can get to yeah maybe we can help out can we get some hardware in there have a leg if they can have a lamb and make a video yeah yeah you can dive in there yeah hosted by Lou I would die that made me feel bad I'm screwed oh my god I'm also a fairly large person so these confined spaces sounds like you kids are in there for nine days like before they even had contact having no idea if they're gonna yak it out that's insane just drinking the brain water and not eating they're like all super weak when they get you found holy cow so prayers and thoughts and all that to those kids at least I didn't I'm each other I'm pretty no that sounds insane but that's like happened yeah wasn't there like a rugby team that got lost in the mountains or something yeah yeah as a movie I think it's called alive or there's like a plane crash something like that yeah they referenced it in The Simpsons I saw it one's a kid that's all I know but that's like that was a thing anyways yeah more rain is expected there's a bunch of a rescue team all over trying to help and this has been quite documented so if you want to learn more about it you can check it out but yeah apparently Elon is getting involved because that's the world right now that's how that works something crazy happens so you wanna show I think I think they're gonna make it I'm pretty helped pretty old pretty optimistic you I'm really sad that that Navy SEAL died you can actually see footage from inside the cave with the original divers who found them took a video when they're speaking to them and I think they even like we're like facetiming their families and stuff check it out maybe they're above the ground there are places where water runs uphill right into the next topic all right yeah ganda social media is now a taxable activity let me take you on a Internet spiral journey that I went on this afternoon when I was reading about this so first I went to like well this was posted by duck Dodgers which is where I started on the forum yes duck Dodgers and I get to learn about this social media is now taxable what so so it turns out that what the government has done there has told the ISPs that they must block users from going to certain sites namely Twitter Facebook whatsapp tinder a dozens of others crucially tinder yeah and a ton of others they're blocked unless they pay this it's not really a subscription fee it's a per day fee yeah about five cents us which is 200 shillings I didn't know there are multiple African nations whose currency is called a shilling that's pirates the Caribbean stuff kind of cool maybe they have doubloons somewhere so it's five US cents a day I don't mean to belittle being sensitive I just I never get to hear the word shilling anyway I've already I'm digging the hole I'm gonna reach those deep I'm diggin look this is getting worse so it sounds like an insignificant amount of money to us but keep in mind that there are how many is it millions of Ugandan s-- who survive on less than a dollar per day so for this to be five cents or like the the per capita income is $600 so a year this would be $1,900 have you paid the five cents for every year there's also an incentive to sign up for a month in advance rather than paying per day okay okay so so that sucks and you think okay that's just the government trying to make some money in the chat which I have to read off my phone because what the heck is going on it says that Portugal is doing a similar thing right now I hope not but back on track there's it seems like it's like a like a money-grubbing like the government's just gonna yeah it's just a new tax and maybe they'll use it for a better internet infrastructure or whatever but then I thought wait a second countries like this usually have a high amount of disparity right so when you see like the average per capita income it's probably the case that that average actually doesn't represent that many people there's probably a lot of people in the high-end that boosts the average and a lot of people on the low end so I thought those poorest people who live on a less than a dollar a day they're actually probably not affected by this they're probably not the Internet users or they certainly won't be after they are affected by this because they won't be Internet users after this so then I thought is this like a system of control is this like a way for people to not be able to go on Twitter not communicate not organize themselves not have protests because they can't go on what's up they can't communicate with each other right for it so then I thought oh this is kind of chin hatty let's Google Uganda dictator tyrant censorship buzzwords and so I went of course I went to like their Wikipedia and there is a huge laundry list of things they've done in the past including arresting opposition members hiring gangs of young unemployed men to harass and oppressed opposition supporters and politicians and critically in February of 2016 the government ordered the mobile service providers to block social media platforms the government claims that platforms such as Twitter Facebook and whatsapp spread rumors and create unnecessary chaos the opposition has argued that the ruling was put in place to prevent the public from reporting irregularities in the election process and and to note the the opposition thing Uganda's president is serving his 7th term right now yeah so apparently like the the elections that they have are kind of fishy yeah so okay then I learned anytime you hire a gang of people to harass well possibly they were they were hired to keep the peace oh yeah okay ostensibly so then I found out that actually Uganda put this in place after neighboring Cannes Ania put in similar things which is the next topic here yes they did a little bit differently what did they do oh yeah socially dubbed the electronic and postal communications regulations 2018 not act or anything there was even a parenthetical thing that I took out of there what's a huge name but this basically requires online content creators which includes traditional media websites online TV radio channels but also individual bloggers and bloggers and like regular people podcasters to pay roughly 2 million Tanzanian shillings which is 930 US dollars in registration and licensing fees so if you want to create content you have to like get essentially like a lot of money business license but yeah that's a ton of money man I wouldn't do that even for for like a a more wealthy nation where like your average person has more wealth per capita that's still a lot of if you were like an American with a thousand subscribers which is hard to get you might be like screw this oh yeah yeah so creators must not only pay these things creators must store their contributors details so let's say you started like a little news network whoever contributes your site you have to store that authors details for 12 months and have the means to identify their sources and disclose financial sponsors which is like super Orwellian like transparency sweet but it's also kind of like who are the detractors who are supporting them cafes must install surveillance no sponsors I don't really mind that too much but well what's what's involved in this I was just saying if there's details no that part I'd like their address and stuff that part I absolutely like that but the like disclosing financial sponsors I guess it would come down to what details they want about the financial sponsors and how they have to disclose it I guess well being like hey were paid by whoever to do whatever I don't want to see a problem with that all right but the rest of it yeah computers details for 12 months of course that that's not great cyber cafes must install surveillance cameras yeah and then there's all this vague language like failure to comply with the regulations which also forbid online content that is indecent or annoying or that leads to public disorder which is just can be anything if you don't like me yeah failure to comply with that is going to result in a five million shilling or twenty two hundred dollar fine a jail term a jail term of not less than a year or both so you're screwed so there's already content creators youtubers and stuff in Tanzania who have given up yeah so Tanzania's GDP per capita like I'm saying earlier eight hundred seventy nine US dollars so you wouldn't be able to afford like the average person there in may not be able to a year a year's license alone let alone if you ever screwed up that's over two years worth of income yeah with no other expenses at all one of their famous youtubers called the idea that this is like a tax the idea of using this is just like another form of Taxation a flimsy explains excuse is he just screwed then promoted by the government to restrict free speech and wait it gets even interesting earlier you're a one blog or not necessarily a Tanzanian blogger I know I think and I think it actually was yeah I think I wrote one blogger but in the story it actually is this particular woman well I'm worried about that person so it gets even crazier because they have there like WikiLeaks they're the Swahili Swahili Swahili WikiLeaks site called jammy forums how do you say a word that ends in two eyes jammy I don't know but they have this history of of course people upload to their whistleblowing site and you don't disclose who uploaded it it's just like people who know like they're protected right well now this site has to disclose the details of the content creators who contribute definitely one of the reasons why they did that yeah sure yeah so now it's either well tell us who posted it or get shut down that's scary man and another thing that while you can tell that it's the calling it attacks it's just ridiculous is that the blogosphere there is pretty small oh yeah so they wouldn't be getting a significant amount of money from it no it's just a just a means of control yeah scary stuff totally it's kind of similar to the European copyright directive but just completely different motivations but the end result is well that's like I'm learnin way I'm not gonna delve on this for too long because it's not technology and stuff but have you looked into the things that were in addition in the so Canada recently passed a law is it 100 Senate I don't think it's will harm sit in for a little while but essentially marijuana is like legal and stuff and you can grow your own and bubble of a button most of the population up here seem to be fairly happy about that but also in that bill there was a bunch of other things like you're being you're now allowed to be pulled over without any form of cause or suspicion and like all this other oh I didn't know that yeah you should looking to it's pretty nuts people are pretty upset about that and they just got passed through because everyone was just like oh yes a bill to make the weeds now legal yes I will sign and there's a bunch of you must clean James's booms a kid like you write a note not that you get someone to sign on the back it's like you must be my slave yeah I you just sold me or so not at anyways we should we should we should take a little intermission from the everyone's trying to be evil and show you our sponsors sponsors but fresh we have to talk about cuz it's pretty big many of you may know that earlier this week Facebook's hate speech algorithms yeah erroneously or maybe not erroneously they took down a post that contained a excerpt from the American Declaration of Independence so yeah leading up to the 4th of July I forget who it was there's a Facebook page in Texas that was posting snippets from the Declaration so they broke it up into twelve different parts and every day there they're uploading a part I think it was like old days of Independence basically and then on day nine or something like that they got a message saying that your content has been taken down so the message didn't specifically say which content okay so it could have been any excerpt but they believe that it's this excerpt that contains their individual posts wouldn't they know cuz one of them just wouldn't be there it sounds like the easiest thing to figure out never true you are a critical thinker they did eventually a like apologized and put it back so but the post that got flagged was this little part that refers Native Americans as merciless Indian savages so you could you can check out the full quote by googling it or like looking on our dock my question to you Luke is should Facebook put it back Wow okay that's okay one all right technically I am American some people know this I have passwords for both countries I was born in Canada I've spent every single residential Day in Canada I've never had a residence in America but I technically have both citizens and technically I'm like sort of more American than I am Canadian because I'm technically a second-class Canadian citizen I mean the government can deport me at any time for any reason without a trial yes we watch it buddy great yeah yeah I have to watch it because I can be kicked out at any time but I have a full bag in citizenship not like a second class one or anything so I technically like more stable there even though I've never lived there it's weird um at but I didn't know that was in there that's uh it's pretty aggro yes it's really interesting because I've very I grew it's not like the like we've got another story that we'll talk about in a second we're an algorithm kind of flagged something and it was obviously just not programmed well whereas this you could argue maybe should have flagged this but then because of the status of the document that's like well like this racism is allowed because it's an important document well certain historical things right like it's like I this is weird we're going down a weird path for the land show this is not technology but I don't think history should be changed personally like I don't think a book should be edited that was published in the past because I don't think it's a because I think knowing mistakes that happened in the past is a valuable thing I think knowledge is more important than other things generally so then like I don't know the content isn't a bridge does that mean that it should be allowed to be broadcast just because it isn't a bridge like they don't post it and have part blurred out they don't change of Independence is still like is that that's still an important document right it's not an important government document yeah so I don't really think it should no I think should be left alone so they should be a lot but there's not the same as like leaving it alone is that the same as broadcasting it I don't know all right so here's I so personally I think I think they should be allowed I think it should depend on the in the context personally if I given the weight so Facebook is its own private entity it's not a government thing so they can do whatever they want they could they could be they could be like you know what no one's ever allowed posting that on this website and then people that believe in that strongly would does not use the website it's a private thing but with their stance on things in general I think it would depend on so this is again I just have to give an opinion based on what I think they would do because I think they're allowed to do whatever they want given their stance on things it would depend on the context if this person was like screw these people because it says this and the Declaration of Independence mmm then that I think Facebook would then step in and want it taken down well if if they're just posting like this is the 12 days until Independence Day we're gonna slowly walk people through the Declaration of Independence because it's fairly long and no one's gonna read this whole post in one little digestion thing but they might like it and share it every day as we go through and then they just happen to get to that part I personally think Facebook would be fine with that because I don't think the intent is there I don't think there was malice cool bill thing to it I'm not even sure if there was malice in that you're at it maybe oh so here's an easier more cut-and-dry one I think that up yet same week Google and set Adsense on Suns Google odd Suns decided that a web page about a decade's old bill about sexual abuse was adult content so and it decided that this web page therefore should not be able to show ads anymore so the page which has been up for six years contains strictly legislative information it's just all legal stuff about a bill called the child sexual abuse and pornography Act of 1980 so that's a lot of hot words and the algorithm was like this is bad blocked so then the the person who runs this website which was a gov tracked us which is like a legislative research and tracking website that person reached out to Google and tried to make an appeal to like get the site back up and right away got a response saying no denied denied the request to unplug the page was denied and therefore they still can't run at the the site gets like 37 grand a year from running ads it's a important site this particular page because the bill is so old doesn't get visited that much so it's kind of a drop in the bucket for them but if it wasn't so it's just funny because you can tell because the site's been up for so long that they just made a tweak to the algorithm yeah which made this get flagged I think it's not really a manual thing right now it's all machine learning but still the machine learning algorithm was like you know what I hate it child porn jaysus yeah I'm not surprised it got picked up by something to be completely honest was just funny how they you can design an automated system make these little tweaks and it just propagates and affects so many people and affects their bottom line it affects their like their livelihood but it's necessary because you just can't have humans going through all these things this is too much confident yeah yeah we should have less content on the internet wait a second these Tanzanians are onto something we're making content right now man don't kill her own jobs speaking of nothing because there's no segue for this we're finally some some some news that you guys are probably like very directly interested in AMD be for 50 boards are coming out speaking of yeah but anyways ambi has still not formally announced the B 450 chipset but pre-orders and listings for B 450 boards from three major motherboard manufacturers have already appeared in Austria and Germany some stores lists some of these motherboards as in stock but also note that the product will be ordered from their warehouse or distributor after an order is placed which is essentially like they're saying that they they have that store is confirming that they have availability it's not in that stores own warehouse but their distributor has some and they can get it from them but still implies that you're gonna be able to get it in a few days so that makes it seem like this announcements gonna be it really yeah the AC prime B 450 M - a seems to be available immediately and many of the boards don't appear on the manufacturers websites yet which is weird it could be a retail leak which happens sometimes but it seems fairly unlike my question is why do these kinds of things always seem to happen in Germany in Austria yeah that happened not that long ago - always Germany it always like these German sites are I'm always translating webpages yeah I don't know I mean it wasn't it like Walmart Canada that leaked all of Bethesda's III stuff I don't remember what it like I can't read the name post-apocalyptic follow no huh that makes sense but no rut rage rage rage - is rich the rage carry - do you remember yeah it was a movie was the sequel to carry oh no like the late 90s a 2000 yeah rage - was a no Mike it's just one person spamming no Mike but everyone seems to be hearing what I'm saying he's right you're Luke and I'm James there's no mics here yeah none there is absolutely no not a single like Mike but yeah Bethesda's rage - was leaked by Walmart somewhere I'm not absolutely sure where oh we're on the wrong banner whatever it's not like that sponsors gonna be too mad at us yeah so I don't know that's that's cool more more AMD boards I mean Sonos files for initial public offering they filed with an offering size of one hundred million dollars a placeholder amount used to calculate the that is likely to change I don't know would you buy so no stock off the bat I because of that thing I mentioned earlier I can't really invest in stock market because both countries want to tax me so would you who knows if I could I would want to do way more research into them because I don't know enough about them right now I would not feel comfortable right now but I would want to do more research it seems like Apple and Google are trying to very aggressively take over that space and neither of them seems to be buying Sonos right now so I would be concerned well that's the interesting part about it is they are going public almost because of that because of the competition in the space they need money and remember having a public offering is a fundraising activity essentially so I don't know I don't think I would yeah they're they're in a weird spot right now but what's cool about their stuff though is later this year on their so knows beam which just came out which is a soundbar it has the it has Alexa right now soon it's gonna have Alexa and Google assistant on the same device which I've never seen anything I don't think there's a device out there that has that be pretty cool there's two Hale one assistant for one task and then just hail that hail a different except there is quite a few things that the overlap isn't very good yeah like there's there's there's in the Venn diagram there is definitely the outer circles yeah they're also gonna be supporting a serie but I I didn't read specifically that series gonna be on the same device as these other assistants okay and I wouldn't be surprised if there was like the Apple model and then the everyone else model cuz I don't see Apple wanting Siri to be on the same devices google assistant it's just too much room for people to be like hey you answer this question hey you fail at answering the same question right side by side yeah speaking of I'm just gonna go hey you Seagate I don't know Seagate announces a mainstream SSD drive that's pretty neat the smallest model is going for $74 which I believe is 250 gigs and the 1 terabyte model is on sale for $2.99 how about them steam leaks you gotta click the link though you got you got to see ok you get to see all right which games have the most players but it only works for people that have achievements outside of games that have developer achievements so yeah so that's about half I think it's actually over how 13,000 out of 23,000 yeah yeah well half the games on there so you can see a list I think you went to the wrong link actually did I the order the arse go to the arse one garnet medium you guys gonna see the doc for a second oh like don't look at my doc scrolls girls ah get it it's leaking steam that's pretty pretty dang good actually oh that pleases me what is it not here either oh my I have failed you a scheme fortress 2 is in the lead oh hey gonna work yeah oh no man it's on your go farther where farther down there it is oh hey t borders to counter-strike pub G player estimate more people playing tf2 what's really it's all time though ok yeah ok I don't really care I am kind of surprised by some of this stuff like Robocraft I've never even heard of that apparently I just downloaded this CSV suite I needed it for sure whereas what is that hi Wow paladin's I thought they were super dead they have a lot of players did they go free or something well what if it was just from the time period that it was popular was paladin's ever pop I've never heard of it I've heard of it but I didn't think it ever did very well maybe it's an it's big in a different market or something it's steam like a global thing of people use steam in India and Brazil and so-so pretty sure can we let these people go on their lives now I think we can yeah thanks for tuning into the show hopefully we didn't make you hate
