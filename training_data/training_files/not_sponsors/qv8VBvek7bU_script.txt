hi guys he goes I'm obsidian aunt and welcome back to elite dangerous today here to flee carriers are right at the center of the galaxy and Sagittarius ie of course getting there is a very hefty undertaking however these two carriers made it there in great time the first to arrive was the spirit of bitter mercy piloted by Commander space me now very shortly afterwards second Kerry arrived earth when I was on myself this one is owned by commander civilian who was accompanied as well by commander valoran so good work for both of these fleet carriers congratulations on my kidney there for details on the spirit bit of mercy that's the first carrier to avoid to have a look at the link in the video description where you can find a reddit post explaining everything that went down as for the other carrier of the fran map which you can see right here i was on border so i was able to capture a bunch of footage and there's also a load of details available for this particular journey specifically it took a fifty a three-year jumps to get here the last jump was just 64 light years must all the rest were around at the 499 mark the carrier left home with twenty two thousand nine hundred and sixteen tons of tritium and arrived with nine thousand to 765 so in total it used a little over 13 2010 of fuel no my name for tritium was done along the way as everything was purchased back within the bubble it made for a very expensive trip has all the fuel used cost a total of around about 570 million credits it's also the maintenance costs free teacher which is around about 750,000 credits per jump what we've been assured that isn't accurate and my understanding is the correct total should be around a 100 thousand credits at any rate here we are in the sagittarius i [Music] so many short-term too long time players will know down know why Sagittarius are years this is the massive black hole that exists at the center of our galaxy the Milky Way if the years it's been a very popular tourist destination for players in fact years ago it took a very very long time to get here but over time it slowly got that much easier but getting the flick carry here is a still a very hefty task but as we're about to see people have managed it and nonetheless an interesting thing about flea carriers this is perhaps a positive thing as well as a negative thing really depended on how you look at it is that they are going to change the galaxy one of the brothels of elite dangerous after all there is the fact that you can travel was so far out into space and be completely isolated from all of humanity many thousands of light-years away from the nearest space station sometimes tens of thousands of light-years away from the nearest inhabited planets so what's going to happen now is ant likely space will start feeling a little less isolated and a little more populated as the fleet carriers butt out across the stars bringing a civilization to the entirety of the Milky Way it could perhaps be considered as a form of pseudo colonization now let's be honest here there are millions of stars are for hundreds of billions in fact 400 billion star systems and you can see a so many of them as we're here in the center of the galaxy which is very very densely populated with stars it means that no matter how hard the plants push it there's always going to be more empty systems than there are full systems so if you want to find a nice empty system that no one else has seen before it shouldn't be too hard in fact this can to be a very easy that said conversely it also means that no matter where you go no matter how far you traveled it's very likely that you're never going to be that far away from the nearest fleet carrier and this ultimately is a pretty significant change for the game it means things will never be quite the same as they once were if you're interested in taking a fleet carrier out to a popular destination or perhaps even a remote destination I'd love to hear where that's likely to be do let me know in the comment section below obvious choices would be big 0.1 absolute the California nebula and many other such places there's also uh some more remote locations summer that have far less visited which will nonetheless still likely be a popular destinations for now although a great work to commanders of space me now on come on a civilian and command of Lori enough it gets in there fleet carrier out here at Sagittarius a as a ways of thanks for watching now and I catch you guys and girls next time
