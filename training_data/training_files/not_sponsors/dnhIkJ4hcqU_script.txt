this video is sponsored by CleanMyMac ex before Apple versus Samsung I phone versus Android there was the og Tech fight as Mac versus PC and bash didn't hate it just leopard is just better than leopard is is better than iTunes for Windows is probably the best Windows app ever written I used Vista as well I found it to be clunky awkward unreliable and very crash prone we've got cards and letters from lots of people that say that iTunes is the their favorite app on Windows even a glass of ice water to somebody in hell so we're gonna back up the clock about 10 years who you are as a person and as a tech enthusiasts was somehow wrapped up and what desktop OS you used I guess in that aspect some things haven't haven't really changed hello everybody my name is John today so prior to 2007 for me I had always used a PC but come 2007 when I wanted to start my youtube career that's I started to look at OS is different I never really thought about ever getting a Mac at a time but I needed to create video and edit video and I had zero point zero experience doing any of that something that I wanted to do I saw YouTube kind of becoming a theme there was Google video at the time and I wanted to make content I had no grand vision of launching a YouTube channel or brand I was just a geek who wanted to talk about it and hopefully meet other geeks like me online the Apple ecosystem as we know it now didn't exists back then there wasn't you know the iMessage is in continuity stuff so you know back then the iLife suite of software was amazing in particular iMovie I didn't have the time or even probably the skill set to learn the old school final cut but iMovie was an amazing way to easily edit video or somebody with no experience there was and this stuff maybe you've never heard of there was a chat and it was made video conferencing really easy made instant messaging something that was awesome though iLife suite made things like publishing websites really easy and simple to do fast forward to now and it's a very different space than it was back then we've gotten Mac OS Catalina which is changing a lot of what a Mac OS can do and I look back on that first computer and that first switched to Mac and realize that none of this would have happened if it wasn't for that first machine its Mac OS Catalina and so now the the current OS its Mac Catalina and Apple is bridging that gap between desktop and mobile even more - what's the inevitability of them combining and merging and for a lot of folks they haven't been that eager to have those two worlds merge but I think it represents a huge opportunity and brings a lot of new things to the table and that you felt like sidecar the ability to use your iPad as a secondary display and if you've got the penciler kinda gives you a touchscreen experience of Mac OS which is relatively new and then you've got project catalyst that's bringing those iOS apps to the Mac so the Twitter app is back my mom can have the same experience in the same app on her phone that she has on my super old iMac that she's still using so assuming you're not gonna buy a new computer and you want to install Catalina it's gonna take 30 gigs of space to download and install that is precious precious hard drive space so a tool like CleanMyMac X is gonna make that process just way easier for you it's gonna get rid of all that garbage space on your computer you'd be surprised how much like junk you have in your computer just by using it got dozens of cleanup and tune-up tools all in one app also should speed up your Mac to little help remove malware and adware agents and build an interactive map of your Mac storage you can see where all those precious gigabytes are going if you want your upgrade to Catalina to go super smooth give CleanMyMac ex a shot I'll link to it down below there's a free trial going on right now so no risk to you and make sure things go up so now 12 years later why am I still using Mac and I honestly don't have that much of an allegiance to Mac or PC there was like a solid two years or I was using a combination of surface book a surface pro I was using a razor laptop for a while I tend to hop back and forth every seems whatever Hardware it looks nicest to me is what I'll go with but for now I'm often to go back to the Mac side and the real reason that I've chosen to come back to the Mac side is really the same reason I think a lot of folks choose any Apple products the ecosystem is so good I'm generally on a Mac my wife is on Apple's ecosystem my parents my grandparents it makes everything just work easily I can airdrop files back and forth I got my shared photo galleries my grandparents and see pictures of my kids it's sort of the same reason that people keep coming back to Apple II just to ecosystem really well and I don't want to misrepresent that it's been a magical like unicorn riding you know trail here with the Macs have plenty of problems they've been far from perfect I had to return a MacBook Air because it was dual core and seems way too underpowered what I was looking to do with it I've had issues with keyboards on MacBook Pros I thought my original 15-inch MacBook Pro had a bad battery this battery life was so bad I've had trackpad issues I've had logic boards fail this has not been a smooth ride almost like with what's kept me on the Mac and usually what's keeping me carrying at least an iPhone with me in my pocket is ecosystem they just do it really well and that's not a knock on what Google does it the Android or Microsoft with Windows it just what makes my life easier and I'm going to use what makes my life simpler easier and for right now hassle free gaming don't don't game on a Mac
