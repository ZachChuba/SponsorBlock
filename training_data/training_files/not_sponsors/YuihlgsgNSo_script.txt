H O W S I T G O I N G A M E R S ? iT's gAmiNg wEeK sUpReme That's right, We're continuing Minecraft And Joergen is back I had to make some adjustments- but the sheep is back too Hello Sheep *Wolf bark* epiC Joergen, I swear to God Stop escaping! WHY DOEs he dO thiS? So a lot of you were saying that I can make like a lasso or leash or something? I will! But apparently I need a Slime So, we're gonna go find some epic Slime No- We're gonna go back to the pirate ship We have a lot of epic stuff to do today, But everyone kept saying: "Uh, thErE miGhT bE aNoTheR tREasUre mAp iN thE piRaTe shiP!" Okay, I'll go back. I'll go back gamers. Gamers speak - 
I listen. Vote PewDiePie. *Applause* 2020 gamer-
 imagine a society run by gamers! Alright, Joergen I swear to God I'm gonna go off. Why is it white there? Oh God damn it, it keeps happening Alright, so if I save and I go back, he should be there. Yeah. Okay-
So it was a glitch! *Angel choir* And that was a glitch too! Everyone was like: "oH, hOw cAn u nOt uNdErstAnD iT wAs a gliTcH??" Oh, I'm sorry the game that has been out for nine years, still has basic glitches in it..? Oh god, it's getting dark! No, I can't do this! *Pitched voice*   AHHH! Hey, sugar! *Quietly* I'll take it. *Normal voice*   We're gonna make cake bros Oh-
Sorry. I think if we goooo along sea shore we should find the ship. Oh God, CREEPERS! It's fine gamers. I'm not afraid. God this is a terrible idea Oh God... There's monsters everywhere, Joergen. but as long as you're close to me, We'll be okay, Joergen Okay, there it is. Found it. Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god Oh perfect, we'll put Joergen on uhh... the plateau. Stay! Stay! Thank you. So apparently it's really rare to find a pirate ship In like Above the water ...Someone said? I don't know. People can tell me anything. But I'm supposed to look for a treasure map. Oh God, I'm drowning! God damn, I'm bad at this game! *laughs* *Pitched voice*   WHAT!? WHAAAT? NANI DESUKA?! WHAAAT *Ad voice*    W H A T? *Normal voice*   If there's a treasure map on this boat I'll find it So why can't I not breathe under water? The easiest way to find it is maybe going down....? I CAN'T BREATHE THAT LONG! >:( I'm not a fish! Where is- That- I bet you guys are trolling me again. God, this is taking forever. Come on, It's so obvious that that was it. It's the only part that goes down, too. Alright, after mining uh, the whole thing all night I have deduced that there is no... ...treasure map. ThAnKs gAmErS -For nothing!- It's fine we have other stuff to do. It doesn't matter. It wasn't even important. Let's get out of this place, Joergen. Whoa! Dolphins, that's EPIC! Hey sheep, we're back. Wow. What an adventure. Go in Joergen. Go in. Thank you. ♫ I got the horses in the back ♫ Dark wood. How- Where did he?! Oh God it happened again. Alright. We may not have gotten a treasure map, But at least we got a dark door *Laughs* Yeah, look at that beautiful carpet. It looks so nice now, I know, I know I know. Well, well, well, okay. Step 2. Get Gucci pants 👖 Alright, who's the Gucci man? You're the Gucci man? Why? By the way, I might steal that. Looking for a Gucci guy. WHERE'S THE GUCCI GUY??

Let's go, good night. Okay, Joergen; Wish me good luck. We're going to the Nether. Cuz everyone said there's a... secret achievement if you sleep in the Nether. Why would anyone do that? Oh god, this place is so creepy dude. Why on earth would I sleep here? This is awful. Alright, fine. We'll make a lil' Nether-Realm house. How about that?
