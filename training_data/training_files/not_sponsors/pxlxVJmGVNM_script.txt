[GFriend choosing the props for Christmas]
First come first serve, say "deep"!! What is this? Yey, looks fun. Should I choose the same one with Yuju? Who slapped our girl? Who dare to slap our girl... Do I look like a Christmas tree? You are letting me wear a headband because you wore it, right? You get it~ You wear it~ Sowon, do I look like a Christmas tree? Let's go~ Isn't it so disrespectful to shoot wearing this? I was thinking of wearing a hat, but SinB told me to wear this so I'm wearing this one. Can I actually talk to the camera later, like this? You look like a really good dancer. We're starting~ [Behind the scene of the Christmas message video]
Let's start~ Two three~ Hello! Let's do it properly. Are we starting now? [Contagious laughing virus] [Shooting again!]
Two three~ Hello, wer're GFriend~ Buddies, what day is it tomorrow? I told you to say Christmas all together! No~no~ What did it say? Guess what it said on it~! It said~ You directly say 'It's Christmas,' okay? No, you just say it directly.
