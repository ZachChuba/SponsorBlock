oh sweet timmy nipple sauce okay i feel like we knew what was mostly going to happen at apple's october keynote and yet there is still so much to talk about so let's not waste any time and get straight through to the main part of the event the new fully redesigned apple silicon macbook pro okay i'll talk about the actual chips in a minute but i just need to spend some time talking about the new form factor of these machines because i think these things look this marks the first substantial redesign since well the 2016 macbook pro which in the eyes of many certainly my own was a regression and i think that apple admitted as much today by backtracking on nearly everything that those laptops had set out to do namely eliminate ports and introduce the touch bar that's right instead of four thunderbolt 3 ports we now have three thunderbolt 4 ports now thunderbolt version 3 and 4 are very similar but they are indeed different now both share a type c connector and have a throughput of 40 gigabits per second however thunderbolt 4 strictly requires pcie bandwidth to be doubled to 32 gigabits per second good for say egpus maybe not on apple silicon but anyway it also requires two 4k displays to be supported at 60 hertz instead of just one as thunderbolt 3 required now it's also worth noting that thunderbolt 4 is backwards compatible with usb4 but that they're not the same it's all well it's all kind of confusing but i'm not going to get hung up on one single port because well some of our favorites from the macbook pros of your have returned namely hdmi though sadly it seems to not be hdmi 2.1 as it only supports 4k at 60 hertz there's also sdxc which is still ubiquitous today but a bit awkward considering that sd express is on its way and four times faster than the outgoing sd now with that said most pro cameras have moved away from sd as primary storage like years ago and that hasn't really diminished the handiness of having a built-in sd card reader even if it's kind of used more occasionally than it used to be before last we have the return of her majesty the queen magsafe now it appears to be the skinniest magsafe connector yet but it's functionally pretty much the same as magsafe from ancient times status led and all really the only difference and it's an excellent one i might add is that it's just a usbc connector on the other end it's not permanently attached to a charger so you can plug it into fancy aftermarket gallium nitride chargers that rock a smaller footprint than apples especially smaller than that monstrous new 140 watt power supply for the 16-inch macbook pro models oh and yes you still can suck power over any of the remaining three usb-c ports using pd charging so that's nice now fast charging has also arrived and you can now charge to 50 in just 30 minutes which i think is great and now we get to the touch bar or the lack thereof finally look i know lots of you guys liked the touch bar and if you did i'm i'm sorry suck it up because we now have a full height function row which to my knowledge is the first foreign apple laptop ever and holy smokes it looks glorious now sadly the arrow clusters still stinks they're those half heights but what do you do other than that it looks great the all black keyboard i've seen has been a little controversial on twitter but i think it looks awesome and the entire design gives me major mid-2000s apple vibes with the squared top the rounded bottom and those chunky feet i love the look of these things now the next and kind of surprisingly maybe one of the most massive updates is the screen which is jumped to a variable high frame rate mini led excuse me excuse me a liquid retina xdr with promotion now the pixel density has increased to 254 ppi which is greater than both the outgoing macbook pro and even the 6k pro display xdr more important than resolution however is the 10 000 mini led backlights that allow for far better zoned lighting control higher contrast ratios and substantially higher brightness levels we've seen this on the ipad pro now the old 16-inch macbook pro that thing topped out at 500 nits and the new displays on these new laptops can push 1 000 nits sustained full screen which is amazing with 1600 nits peak brightness that is going to make a colossal difference for pros working in hdr workflows now also promotion it's going to make a difference because unlike a lot of pc competition it's not fixed at a given frame rate it's variable just like the new iphone so if you're mastering for a 24 frames per second export you can view content at its native target which is amazing as for regular plugs well it'll just make for very smooth cursoring around and well oh i guess there's apple arcade so you can play doodle jump or crossy road or whatever games they have it 120 frames per second okay i have avoided it long enough it is time to talk about the notch it's it's it's fine yeah like sure putting it in the menu bar it's the most scrupulous area to hide such an eyesore and it's it's not likely to interfere with content though menu bar icons can get really crowded on smaller laptop displays like the 14-inch so i presume that there are software contingencies in place for those edge cases but i guess we'll find out maybe the menu bar becomes horizontally scrollable i don't know also what if you change display scaling does the size of that menu bar get smaller or larger than the notch that would be kind of ugly look i guess what really matters is that the bezels are the same dimensions on the top and the sides which provides a more cohesive look they weren't previously and they've also rounded out the tops of the display corners which i think is a nice touch considering that it doesn't interfere with any of the content because again that's where your menu bar resides as for the bottom corners those are left squared and that's great because that's where content actually is so yeah look um i don't know there's so much new about these laptops that i'm not going to dwell on the notch but just do let's do it just close your eyes really quickly okay close them for real close them okay now open them this looks like a freaking image you'd find on the onion admit it unfortunately this notch well you know it doesn't include face id which kind of sucks i really wish it did but it does house an improved 1080p front-facing camera sadly that new camera doesn't seem to have the center stage feature which was found on the ipads and i think that's a really awesome software feature especially for people that will be doing a bunch of presumably conference calls on these things ah okay last small thing and that's audio apple mentioned in passing that the headphone jack now supports high impedance headphones which are very common in professional sound applications and i'm really interested to see what that actually means because it could potentially mean it's a replacement for cheaper desktop headphone amps and audio interfaces which would be awesome doubtful but awesome so we'll see additionally there is a new speaker system with six drivers there are two tweeters and then four opposed woofers which seem to be passively radiated now macbook pro laptops have always sounded amongst the best in the industry the best in their class and it's more than likely that these new systems will sound even better than their predecessors with that said this line i mean you get a theater-like experience okay dude cool your jets they're laptop speakers all in all the design feels really cohesive and almost perfectly complete but your new macbook pro isn't complete without luminar an app from today's sponsor skylum software now if you don't know about luminar ai it is an insanely easy way to drastically modify images with just a few clicks like replacing the sky and spatial reflections automatically or adding a light flare through a window that affects the entire image it's almost spooky how powerful it is but apparently that wasn't enough because even though luminar ai is amazing skylim has announced the new luminar neo coming this winter it has a completely new engine with features like ai masking so that you don't have to do things by hand it supports layers the relight ai permits independent adjustment of foreground and background lighting super cool and then the background removal ai does well just that it removes objects with a click now luminor neo isn't quite available yet but you can pre-order it today for both mac os and windows at a discounted rate and you can even bundle it with a discounted version of luminar ai to start modifying your images today it is a one-time purchase there is no subscriptions and there's a 30-day money-back guarantee so for pros and amateur photographers alike you've got to check out luminar it's genuinely amazing the link is down below okay time for the good stuff the actual silicon now in a surprise to i think almost everyone we did not get the m1x nor m2 we got the m1 pro and the m1 max which hot take those are actually great names because they're more easily understood and they match the iphone naming convention i know a lot of people don't like them but haters come at me i think they're good also not to put a damper on anything that was announced but well the new chips they're exactly what i reported and postulated on back in june a 10 core cpu and a 32 core gpu in a single package with a shared memory pool dubbed jade c die that is the m1 max and then there's the jade c chop that i reported on that well is dubbed as such because it literally chops off half of those gpu cores that's the m1 pro except there was a slightly unexpected surprise too in fact the two lowest end configurations on the 14 inch macbook pro offer a 14 core gpu instead of a 16 core and they also in the case of the very very base model offer only an 8 core cpu instead of a 10 core cpu this almost certainly comes down to binning where in chips that have manufacturing defects well they just get a few of their cores disabled and sold at a lower cost in lower end machines this is common practice in the entire industry and almost certainly what is happening here apple isn't setting out to make a low-end m1 pro it's the byproduct of dealing with the realities of icy fabrication okay so let's now talk about what these chips are actually going to be capable of well frankly we have no idea because apple's keynote charts are awful and they can go take a long walk off of a short dock one thing that we do know well apparently they're fast fast two times faster faster two times faster than seven times faster even faster two and a half times faster is over three times faster faster faster as fast as faster faster faster super super super fast faster now faster faster is faster it's faster faster than ever faster faster faster faster faster fast charge now somewhere quick to point out hey hey hey be nice this time they're now naming the laptops that they're comparing against and uh yeah that's true but but in what relative performance in what applications under what conditions oh wow the m1 pro and m1 max have more than 150 uh performance units oh that's incredible look really the only thing that this demonstrates is something we pretty much already know apple silicon is incredibly efficient relative to its power consumption we also see that the m1 pro and m1 max's 10 core cpu rocks about a 30 watt tdp which makes sense given that we know the m1 cpu is about 12 watts now are there laptop chips out there that are more powerful than the m1 pro and m1 max it's quite possible likely even given that the comparison apple used was for an intel 11th gen i7 11800 h no slouch but there are better and apple only ever stated that m1 pro and m1 max have higher performance at every power level not period however one can successfully argue and apple did that performance per watt is significantly more important in a laptop than total compute power heat fan noise and battery tend to matter more now onto the gpu apple shows that the m1 pro's 16 core graphics cores push about a 25 to 30 watt tdp and consequently the m1 max's 32 cores are pushing against 60 watts now look i suspect there are very few scenarios in which the cpu and gpu in the m1 max will be at full tilt pegged at 100 simultaneously but if they are that pushes the chip's tdp to around 90 watts which is similar to the combined tdp of the outgoing 2019 16 inch i9 macbook pro with the radeon d gpu now again m1 max is going to be a lot more efficient a lot more of the time but these are going to be bigger hotter more fan hungry chips than i think a lot of people think and good i am glad that apple isn't emaciating their chips in the name of silence or thinness i don't want six 2016 to happen all over again and i don't think that they have now back to the gpu apple gives higher relative performance to the m1 max over something like the razer blade 15 advanced a 3080d gpu computer that's fairly thermally constrained however they also show and frankly good for apple that it loses out to a properly cooled 3080 and an msi ge76 raider now there's so many questions like what was the test and what graphics apis were used under what environments and conditions and in what app suites look we've already wasted too much time with this stupid nonsense but one thing we do know is this the m1 pro and m1 max are the most performant chips in their power envelope period using battery power and it's not even close now we'll do some real head-to-head testing next week against the outgoing 16-inch macbook pro a top-of-the-line pc laptop our 10 000 mac pro and an even higher-end threadripper pc so be sure to get subscribed and enable notifications one last side note the m1 pro and m1 max have on-board media engines kind of similar to what intel's quick sync offered for h.265 video encoding however apple's chips take it a step further not only is there hardware accelerated support for h.264 or h.265 hevc for both encoding and decoding but there's also now a dedicated prores encode and decode engine now the m1 max doubles the number of hardware accelerators and is capable of playing back 24k prores streams or seven 8k prores 422 streams now if you're not familiar with this type of video workload and nles and video handling that is like insanity it's more powerful than the 2019 mac pro's dedicated afterburner fpga card that's specifically designed for prores hardware acceleration and that card for the mac pro cost the same price as the new base model macbook pro rocking that uh you know base model m1 pro freaking amazing now we get to price no these computers are not cheap and yes the price has increased marginally however considering the number of improvements that they have brought year over year i mean look a significantly faster silicon chip a class leading mini led variable high refresh rate display improved speakers and microphones and a camera that doesn't totally suck a better keyboard real i o faster pcie ssds max save and more this is not only the best upgrade to macbook pro in i don't know well over a decade but it might be the most fairly priced macbook pro ever i have drained my wallet my financial stability is out the window and uh that was louder than i expected and i have done it to bring you the best macbook pro coverage on youtube i've got three different models coming in uh two 14s and a 16 or i don't remember but anyway i also have the new airpods yay so be sure to get subscribed enable notifications and before i part i shall leave you with one more fun fact okay so you know how the m1 max is that jade c die that i showed you earlier well the upcoming mac pro is supposed to have literally four of those glued together jade 4c die one freaking mega chip the future sounds fun thank you so much for watching and as always stay snazzy [Music] you
