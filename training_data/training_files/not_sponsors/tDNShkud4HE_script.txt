the original g502 proteus core from 2014 was RGB if I'd in 2016 and then got an upgrade to Logitech's hero sensor in 2018 but through all that time and certainly since the debut of the G 903 Lightspeed in 2017 g502 fans have been wondering when logitech would finally cut the cord on their favorite Mouse and now that it's here there's really only one question has Logitech left us any reason not to go wireless the link below [Music] traditionally there have been three main reasons not to get a wireless mouse so let's start with the big one latency does the new wireless g502 introduce any extra delay between moving the mouse and seeing the response on the screen that is beyond what you'd get with the wired version because even a wire does have some latency now answering this question is a little tough for us because we don't have a warehouse full of the necessary scientific equipment to quantitatively measure Mouse latency to the degree that we'd like what we can test however is whether or not the average gamer will be able to tell the difference so we unleashed our fiercest keyboard warriors on a high performance gaming rig outfitted with one wired g502 hero and one wireless g502 light speed that had been mocked up to appear wired both of our mice were configured to the same DPI and our subjects were instructed to focus on just one variable latency oh god that was embarrassing blame the mouse mouse is the mouse okay so we have it here on a Lightspeed oh they're all here over this one for sure no I wouldn't be able to tell the difference if you told me they were the same Mouse I would believe you and I'm pretty sure even if we had like a 240 Hertz display I would not be able to tell the difference all right just for some reason just something about it just shows nicer to me if you had to guess which ones which would you we're just guess like flipping a coin yeah what if they would have been paired guess I don't I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference if I was gonna make a call I guess it would have to be this one so that's the wireless mouse oh that's a wireless mouse and this is the wired one so then considering these test results the tournament winning pro gamers who use logitech wireless mice and the more quantitative demos that we've seen from logitech themselves in the past we're convinced that there is in fact merit to Logitech's claims that light speeds end-to-end optimized 2.4 gigahertz connection is indistinguishable from a wired connection so let's move on because latency isn't everything another demerit against most wireless mice is weight a wireless mouse is required to carry an onboard battery making it heavier than its wired counterpart it's sort of by definition so if the g502 hero a mouse with the same shape size buttons and sensor tips the scales at 121 grams already then how much would we expect the Lightspeed version to a now you might think that that's a trick question and you're expecting me to tell you haha it's the same weight but no Logitech has actually done us one better managing to make the wireless version seven grams lighter than its wired predecessors and this is while still managing up to sixty hours of gameplay on a single charge of its quick charging lithium-ion battery furthermore its power play compatible so if you get the wireless charging mousepad you'll never have to think about charging at all so then how did they do that turns out with great difficulty seakeeping the exact same exterior while redesigning all of the internals is likely the main reason that fans had to wait this long for this mouse because despite their near identical look apparently the only component that wasn't altered in some way was actually the slippy skates on the bottom of the mouse so while a typical Mouse gets its structural integrity from the outer shell this ones walls had to be cut down to just one point two millimeters thick so then to maintain its rigidity logitech used a lightweight internal endoskeleton this is a similar design to what they use on the g pro Wireless then again borrowing from the G Pro Wireless they added very subtle but appreciated mechanical spring button tensioning to the left and right clicks removing pre-travel and helping the button recover from a click faster and with more precision and even like this is crazy even the scroll wheel was altered it's lighter but it's manages to feel the same so like yeah there's a there's a gap there's a cap in the middle so alright wait and latency aren't on issues but what about the third and final Wireless woh price well unfortunately this is the g502 light speeds gotcha moment because like the ji 903 and the G Pro Wireless this puppy is a hundred and fifty US dollars nearly double the price of its wired cousin which raises an important question if you're going to spend that much then is this the mouse that you want and that really depends because the thing is for many gamers even the new g502 with its seven grams of weight shed is still way too heavy popular gaming mice from competitors like final mouse are much lighter along with being much cheaper and Logitech themselves has the G Pro Wireless which is the same price but only 80 grams with that said if you love the shape of the g502 you need eleven programmable buttons and you can't live without a hyper fast scroll wheel then this could be the last Mouse that you ever buy and who knows maybe you can recoup some of the cost by selling the wired version that you're probably already using in ting credit towards your bill or a new device so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it was awesome get subscribed hit that like button or check out the link to where to buy the stuff we
