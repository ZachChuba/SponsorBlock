there are alchemical curiosities in Noida other than draft of Midas and lively concoction they've been in game for a while now and it's time to finally take a look at them we'll also be looking at a few other magical substances including one that is unobtainable at least we think it's unobtainable let's begin this first one I showed back in my Moon ending video void liquid as in that video can acquire it by bringing the essences of air fire earth and water to the moon which will then turn entirely into void liquid there is however also an alchemical recipe to make this stuff that recipe is toxic sludge warm blood and solid fungus or fungus powder this only produces a very small amount though and there doesn't seem to be any real use for void liquid not yet anyway next we have mystery fungus which is definitely a very interesting phenomenon to make this we need toxic sludge sand and fungus blood or the quickly evaporating liquid that can be extracted from fungus the large mushrooms on the surface forest biome can also be used to obtain this once all three ingredients are brought together the sands will quickly be overtaken by the mysterious brightly glowing fungus can easily turn the entire surface of the desert into fungus and yes this stuff counts in the creation of void liquid does this have a use not really not that we know of I suppose it can be used to quickly get through parts of the temple of the art if don't have the dissolved powders perk or any explosives or digging spells anyway up next we have an alchemical curiosity that does have a use purifying powder the recipe for this substance is diamond and brass so it is pretty difficult to make what I'm actually doing right now is using a teleport spell on a pile of diamonds because a little-known fact the teleport spell actually creates a single pixel of brass one cast as soon as the diamond than brass touch they create a bit of purifying powder however as we know there's currently no way to transport or hold powders so it's almost impossible to actually make use of this stuff that is unless find an extremely rare flask of it in a chest or on a pedestal then can use it to purify almost every potentially harmful liquid such as oil toxic sludge whiskey acid poison blood and the magical liquids like teleport Adium flah maxium and everyone's favorite polly morphine unfortunately it just floats on top of lava that could have been a very good use for it and also unfortunately like I said it's just very rare that you're gonna be able to get this stuff so hopefully they make it a little easier to obtain at some point so those were the three alchemical curiosities now in the last major update they added several magical liquids the most powerful of which is ambrosia which protects against all damage as long as you're stained with it so can even hang out in holy mountains after triggering the collapse but probably the most important use for this is crossing cursed Rock without taking any damage for easy access to parallel worlds or the top of the tower as long as continuously spray it at your feet as move should be safe another extremely rare flask might be able to find is healthy um which is similar to lively concoction and that it heals but it doesn't do so over time instead it heals as touch and absorb the each individual pixel of it so a pool of it won't evaporate like LC but LC is way more powerful and could get way more use out of one flask of it and finally the most interesting of the substances I'm covering in this video we think it's entirely unobtainable in the game through normal means creepy liquid which definitely lives up to its name and we're just gonna have a bit of fun with it don't need much just one pixel of this stuff will convert any air next to it into more creepy liquid and it happens fast if released on the surface this means it can and will flood the entire world let's take things one step further and experiment a bit here I have a brick wall flask otherwise known as creepy liquid emitter totally unobtainable then a fungus flask but this is an ordinary fungus it's secret creeping fungus and then some fire now let me just clear some of the snow out of the way [Music] okay I'm just gonna smash this and now we have a pillar of brick wall let me spread some of the fungus now if the brick wall comes into contact with fire it'll start emitting creepy liquid however now we see the special property of secret creeping fungus it actually converts any nearby liquids into more of itself including creepy liquid so what's happening in years the burning brick wall is emitting creepy liquid which then is converted into creeping fungus and fungus is highly flammable so it creates more fire which creates more creepy liquid which creates more fungus and we have a continuous loop which ends up producing a lot of smoke anyway this is just an interesting and I'd say very beautiful reaction I found when experimenting and I felt like I had to share it if ever happen to find any material labeled brick wall that looks like this please comment down below and let us all know I'd love for creepy liquid to actually be in the game someplace there could be even just one pixel of this stuff in the middle of nowhere and that would be enough to spawn creepy liquid so who knows maybe it is in the game someplace possibly even in the center of a bunch of extremely dense rock or something anyway I hope enjoyed today's video there's much more on the way have a great day and I'll see next time
