do you get that reference he says yes okay spaghetti yes no i just didn't want to mess it up i just didn't want to mess it up i was afraid i might take like spaghetti and ice cream or something because i'm nervous okay yeah is that it no that's not it i'm just nervous right now you have to understand donkey is the first guest you've had on that i think is worth anything right all the rest of them are pretty much here like every single other guest you've gotten on including me but dunky a-lisp a-list all the way okay i mean i mean i would say yes yeah he's he's eight here too yeah um no but honestly i've been watching i've been watching donkey since like no no bits like seven years it's okay this is gonna be kind of well i have a couple weird stories for him anyway i think about the dream smash 4 roster video daily because any time any time someone asks me a question at all i go ah let me think let me think and it's a problem it's ruined a couple relationships for me because uh sometimes when they ask me an important question that doesn't need that response but i can't help it at this point it's ingrained into my brain um so i'm sorry it's true donkey you're ruining my relationship right now how would you rate my show donkey well you know after what all the stuff that has transpired i'll bump it up two i'll give it a seven seven point two yeah really i'm in the seventh now that's a new record oh my god you rarely give game sevens so donkey i have i have dug far and deep and i've i found some stuff no no don't do that yeah i found some stuff oh yeah yeah on that one and on that one which which one's your proudest yoshi this the the this one right is it this one that's a good one that this is a great one that was pretty good what was your inspiration yeah i'm pretty good animator i should maybe i could be on your show work on your show maybe i think you would be successful as a youtuber i think you should take talents and and transfer it to youtube and not stay on this website what was this website new rounds yeah i think you should definitely move on to youtube all right break down that video for me why is there a hanging mario well that it came in like a peck it was like all pre-made animations and i just that was in there so i just threw that in there oh i see can you give me a moment i want to kill myself in the video game all right okay just i just don't like having a big head i need to fix that stop donkey break down that video and what inspired to make your first video well that was you know that was inspired by the godfather trilogy really not lord of the rings oh my god i wanted yeah that was my take on it tell me more and if yoshi i put him big you did why well he was very scary he's much scarier when he's big like that daddy that is very true but why i wanted to evoke uh it was a comedy piece and you were laughing i was laughing everyone was finding it so funny connected bigger means funny yep that's always true so bigger everything makes you laugh yeah you know for me awkwardness is my thing okay i'm just awkward and it makes people laugh sure sure so donkey what what guts what actually got you into animation and all that like what giveaway drove your you know little donkey heart to beat repeatedly fast when you saw animated characters and we're not talking about hentai okay um thank god i saw my new grounds saw people making funny mario videos on there i was like all right i'll do that how does your soul feel do you feel dead inside no after 10 years of making videos you still feel rejuvenated i would my life by by passion by your videos by you know no so what is what what what keeps you going what's like your biggest inspiration what do you want in life what do you want donkey where do you see yourself in five years what do you ultimately want to see when you're in your deathbed girl big yoshi yoshi see you see when you're drying yourself back big you know what i'm talking about i know what you're talking about tell me where do you see yourself in five years i'll probably be uh probably making movies i'll be a movie star agreed what kind of movies do you want to be in uh doing like karate karate stuff leading man in the ocean's 55 for whatever how many there are yeah yeah yeah i'll be smoking cigars without pacino oh i can imagine you doing that for sure i can actually legitimately imagine you as like a sidekick character no you know like those games don't you know those movies where they always have the smart hacker no i'm not no hacker guy no that's not the role that's not the role that i want okay okay okay okay you're right wait you're right you're right are you into fantasies like lord of the rings oh sure sure you know amazon is making lower the rings oh yeah it could be in there you can be aragorn oh yeah it could be that you can what would you rather be aragorn or legolas or frodo or gollum gone give me the golem room and why that's really the meat road you know that's the role that actors really want i can really show my range that's true that's the oscar world yeah when he's making a video he starts thinking really hard and he walks around the house and he paces and thinks it's really cute he starts pacing all around the house and thinking and walking and thinking and talking to himself that's what that's what technician does legit that's what she does too she paces around thinking but she also talks to herself yeah do you do that too kind of right it works yeah it does work yeah it does and then and then when you get when you have that aha moment what happens do you run to your notepad yeah i go platformers suck what platformer sucks all you do is jump around that's it i hate jumping i can't even jump why can't you jump because jumping sucks no no no this is no this is extremely false information okay prove why i'm gonna i'm actually going to have the stream removed wait what okay you have then tell me why platform why i'm wrong it's just it's the best game it's the best camera why is jumping more superior than just walking and shooting things because that sucks jumping is much better much better why it's just got that is that visceral that visceral feel you know you hit the button it's just like you hit the butt it's like wow it's not like this i like this no i thought this is [ __ ] no that's that's [ __ ] now that's the real game see what i'm saying yeah i know i see it no i see it now i'm starting to understand see that's how you're supposed to describe it you know when you describe it like that i feel the soul of the platformer you know what i mean yeah it's the it's all in the back yep you've converted me mr donkey you've converted me all right that was pretty easy snack sucks what the [ __ ] is this kind of show that sucks oh it's so hard to talk to non-gamers like this oh my god tell me tell me why knack is not sucky how can you say neck sucks do you even look at the graphics it's like i'm talking to a different to a different species when you say that you seen knack 2 yeah my knack 2 is amazing do you jump in that or does it go yes cutscene no you jump you can jump sometimes the jumps are on cut scenes but you can also jump out of a cutscene and what exactly is knack anyway what is that character he is uh like a bunch of little bricks and he turns into a little troll man troll man he was created by a scientist of course that's part of an experiment the story of knack is sucking sucks and is two-dimensional how can you say this i come on this show and out of the decent sea of my heart you say these horrible things here look you convinced me wrong tell me why it isn't it's such a deep something it's such a deep story in mind and i can't even even begin to explain how deep it is how deep it truly is it's just beyond anything what's your favorite movie lord of the rings it's way better than that it's a hundred times better than that no yeah lord what is lord what is lord of the rings about the hobbits went to destroy the ring and they formed friendship okay between races okay it's very twinkling relevant it's got deep meaning behind the ring the relationship between florida and sam is the greatest romance known to man yeah but what is it about uh it's about the journey of the ring to the fires of mount doom the destroyer what is it about you know and this is why knack 2 is a much better movie why what is not 2 about and that's and that's and it's over but what is what is it about and and i walk and that's it but what what what is the worst game you've ever played that is popular that everybody likes but you're just like i don't get why everybody likes this game fortnite fortnite does not have the blah what could it be no that's not mine that's not mine
