make your next move with Squarespace hey guys real quick before we start the video if you have thought in the past about you know supporting us on patreon now is the time to do it I can't really tell you why but just it's gonna be good okay so go there I don't know what that we'd apply me Galvis this used to be my favorite channel don't you dude it was the only place now it's up to look but never just judgmental clothes like the hypocrites so why do they even make this show have we never told you guys why we make this show well I guess now's as good a time as any guys if you can even believe it this is the 300th episode of messy Monday let me put it to you this way kids who had just become teenagers when we started the show are now a year into college hello darkness cut these poor hypothetical children all through their teenage years they're watching this show every single week and they have no clue why we make it they try to explain messy Monday to their friends but it's impossible it's like some weeks he's sarcastic in some weeks he's not it's really old school YouTube like it's got like the black backdrop in and then you just stands there and talks about things and I think oh no I'm not doing so just explaining and so maybe we should have done this sooner maybe we should have explained our intentions with this show from the outset but we won't hold you in suspense any longer two thousand seven hundred episodes late dad dad you can't even believe it this is our three thousandth episode of missing Mondays and it's finally time for me to tell you why we make this show you're getting kids I will never die this is unbelievable clearly they are stalling because this show has no direction not only that nobody going downhill for about three years now there's a change I used to love the show but now I say I think it's time to unsub you know I think it's funny when people say this because I really feel like this show has it kind of always been about the same thing I don't think we've changed have we you can boil pretty much everything we talked about down into the golden rule do you want others as you would have them do unto you every single video is basically about that what you don't believe me okay here's a 10 second episode of messy mondays right now oh boy don't you hate when people do such and such a thing I certainly don't do it different form of that same thing maybe maybe I do oh well I'll just remain ignorant oh there I gave away our secret formula now you can just rip off this YouTube channel and do the same thing there you go no no no you guys have changed you you're different now you used to say things I agreed with a now not so much yeah I think when people say that we've changed what they mean is sometimes we give an opinion on a topic and maybe for a while they agree with our opinions but at some point we hit an opinion that they didn't like so now we exchanged because they don't agree with us but here's the thing guys okay just because we have an opinion it doesn't even mean we're right we all have different thoughts and ways of seeing the world because we were all different people and we all have different brains right that makes sense so who cares if we disagree I mean as long as no one is hurting anyone or a problem don't hurt me please good to hear things you don't agree with from time to time and now the boy who never heard anything he ever disagreed with in his entire life once there was a boy who never heard anything that he disagreed with this world is so right everything is peaceful then one day a stranger walked by and said something that the boy did not agree with because the boy had never had to evaluate his belief system his brain exploded and he died and this brings us back to why we make this show we don't care if you agree or disagree with what we say I mean that doesn't be really boring if you did agree with everything we said right we don't want to tell you how to think we just want you to think I mean look if you want to watch something that's going to tell you how you need to see the world you can go basically anywhere else the world is filled with people who are more than happy to tell you how you need to think but that that's not what this space is ok but if you don't think the way that I think you're stupid and probably a terrible person this is a place where you can question things okay things that you never thought about thinking you we just try to find things that it seems like people don't think about and then we try to think about those things and that's what we've always tried to do with this show from the very beginning so if you've actually stuck with us over these last 300 episodes thank you so much and if you don't like us that's okay too we like you anyways well I do Josh doesn't Josh cries every day we lose a subscriber I remember the day that Josh realized that we actually lost subscribers he it was a bad conversation on the phone guys we're just getting started okay the world is getting scarier by the week we can all agree on this so we'll just keep being here every single Monday trying to make the world a little less messy stay tuned for a scene purchase that squarespace.com slash cow next week on messy Monday's some haters just can't let that go they say it's okay I mean they're different now what you see them change so different I keep telling you this if you don't like their videos anymore then why don't you just leave I say bye baby go I unsub from these jerk okay so then it's over then go so I keep searching them know okay when you want so be still a related video I still find um just say okay just leave this world is so right everything is peaceful until one day he's double cider
