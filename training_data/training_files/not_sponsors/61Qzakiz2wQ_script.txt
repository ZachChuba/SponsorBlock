we need to reprogram your system before your internal hard drive self combust into a ball of flames take my blood brothers take my blood [Music] [Music] it appears that the professor has discovered the virus we planted into his robot this video is proudly sponsored by when I logged on to runescape today I wanted to continue healing the players of my community so I went down to the falador mo lair where I found countless players who were risking their lives just to save the city of falador from this massive massive mole my gosh that was a close one boys it looked like he only had one HP left but luckily we were able to save his life just in time along with many other brave warriors who nearly got ate alive by the gigantic mole that's underneath falador bra you healing me yes brother it's the least I can do for brave warriors like yourself who are willing to risk their lives to protect a city that we all know and love like falador but falador isn't as good of a city as you boys think in fact it's much like Sodom and Gomorrah which were cities that were riddled with so much sin that they eventually were destroyed by God's wrath and believe me when I tell you that this city is a nest full of sin and unfortunately for some of these brave warriors they did lose their life trying to defeat this gigantic man but they did not die in vain because these men were sent straight to the gates of heaven because these men made the ultimate sacrifice just like how God made the ultimate sacrifice when he gave His only begotten Son for the sake of humanity for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life unlike the goblins in Lumbridge who will be burning in the lake of fire Wow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if Jesus is the Son of God then tell these rocks to become bread it's not just bread that keeps you alive their lives also depend on what God says and I also have a full inventory of water skins so nice try lizards but I don't need to eat any of your useless bread I have a twisted wall in my bank and it can be yours if you bow down and worship Me get lost you lizard for it is written worship the Lord your God and serve him only jump off the cliff if God really loves you then his angels will catch you do not put the Lord your God to the test [Music] [Music] recently there has been a huge influx of pyramid plunder BOTS who have been making their way into the game and with jagex being understaffed and underpaid I wanted to show you all a quick way to stop these BOTS dead in their tracks you see boys these bots are brainwashed to follow a specific script and when you implement something that interrupts that script then it can cause the bottom malfunction and sometimes completely self-destruct and in this case casting any teleport other spell on these BOTS caused them to completely freeze almost as if they had been turned to stone not so fast young man sorry buddy boy but putting on runescape is against the rules and is strictly forbidden this bot tried its best to pretend like it was a human but sure enough it was just another robot who had been programmed by the goat so [Music] what's up my boys I really hope you're enjoying the new series and if you would like to support my channel please do so by hitting that subscribe button and if you're really feeling generous then hit that join button much love brothers and God bless [Music] [Music]
