as a girl on stream how do you deal with it mentally when it's like it's like they judge you like they like most my chats are nice most of my chat you guys are great but there's you know there's occasionally trolls that come in and they just judge you based on your looks like they don't look at anything else they just they categorize you as something like how do you deal with that stuff like mentally um i reckon i try to recognize and understand where that behavior comes from yeah and i know that that's not a personal attack on me i know if anything that's them almost attacking themselves in the chat because they're really just out here putting all their [ __ ] personal problems for all of us to see it again when they say stuff like that it's you know it's it's always very obvious whether they hate women they hate themselves they hated their mom like i mean you could almost tell by the words that they're projecting at you that they just got some serious issues going on to say some of this nasty [ __ ] um so the way that i deal with it mentally is i just remember that if i really wanted to i could call up his dad and [ __ ] his dad right now and ruin his whole parents you know divorce if they're even still together and that brings me a lot of peace and joy i'm like you know you tried to attack me but i'm going to be the bigger person and not ruin your whole childhood right now dang it go i like you
