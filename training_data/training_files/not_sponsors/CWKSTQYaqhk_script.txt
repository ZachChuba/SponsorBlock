rust rust yeah i actually stopped playing for the past couple days and i don't think i'm playing today either but mostly rust uh but then the drop stops so i can't farm as many viewers anymore damn it so what are you gonna do now well probably still a bit of rust but uh some other stuff i don't know i haven't really figured it out yet i'm just kind of doing it as it goes how useful are you in the house on a scale what do you do in the house trash you take out the trash yes yes yes do you do the dishes dishwasher i empty that ooh okay do you feed the dog feed the cat do you cook make bagels in the morning oh do you make coffee too buy coffee from starbucks a nice do you make your bed young man yes why do you look so stoned i'm not stoned that was a stone face make that face one more time okay yeah yeah that's definitely a stone face yeah well that's my am i looking into the distance face oh were you thinking just now yeah i was making a face as if to say that i don't make my bed but then my words contradicted it your words contradicted the fact that you don't like your bed does that mean that you do make your bed yeah also i want to take your wife cutie that on the other hand would be a little different right so can you give me advice on how to take your wife from you that doesn't feel like i'm the one who should be fruit from that endeavor but i'm your friend but she's my girlfriend i'm your friend bros before hoes bro okay you know what i actually just watched promising young women last night turn a new leaf really what was that movie about maybe sometimes the hoes should come first oh you're going against broca i'm i am not saying that necessarily i'm just saying that we should consider who's your best streamer friend that that was my friend before streaming or does it have to be after streaming like like who is your best twitch streamer friend right right so just twitch streamer right so so that would probably be like uh like connor connor eats pants connor i think so yeah probably but maybe i'm forgetting someone die i love that guy yeah connor's great have you have you talked to connor no who is he you too mega lol connor my friend who is he he's a

you were gonna do it yeah yeah you missed that you told you were so late like so late impressively late in a way i would say the fact that you still think that it hasn't happened this happened so long ago this is like you saying hey i was going to count down the new year's ball drop like yeah go for it so the boss 2022 drops it's dropped so long ago his balls dropped so long ago to his knees by now

years going on three in may wow you've been on twitch for a long time that good amount yeah when did you brill up when did i grow up no when did you blow up oh oh i don't know what's considered blowing up have i blown up didn't you just skyrocket i've had good months i suppose but you know i'll also have bad months give me your advice for me oh uh okay uh it's uh it's a it's a it's a quote from a different streamer but at a certain point uh growth becomes more about consistency than creativity so you know yeah like you have a very creative interview show but now it's not about coming up with new ideas it's about finding new people and doing more interviews more interviews and then eventually you'll have to find a new thing as a whole because you'll have interviewed everyone or the interviews will get a bit stale so you'll just start doing that and then you keep doing that thing that people like and then you'll find a new thing and yada yada yada yada ah i see you're very intelligent mr ludwig that wasn't me but it's a good it's a good piece of advice you're very much of a five head well i just take good advice you don't have to be a five head if you take good thank you are you proud of your hair not particularly how can you be proud of your hair i mean i guess it's something you work on a bit i use a bit of product but i didn't it's like genetics it's like genetically perfect yeah but i didn't choose that i mean that's just my my mom and pops they just did it good do you ever wake up and look into the mirror and i go and go wow what a chad no no not at once i would say really yeah probably not you never looked into yourself in the mirror what i'll do is i'll look into my obs finder right here and i'll be like oh [ __ ] my hair's out of place and then i'll fiddle with my hair a bit oh and then i'll go okay money we'll just leave it there for a while oh what game are you the best at ludwig i'm the best at super smash brothers melee or mario party really wouldn't be close to either of those hmm who are you for your sponsors like what brands do i work with yeah nord vpn uh i should remember more other ones ah i don't have them here they're not paying for this they don't need to have an ad spot on your thing do you know would you like to be sponsored by this brazilian nut company like brazil nuts no it's called these nuts yeah yeah no what's the pay what's the pay miko um they will pay you 30 grand for what what are the deliverables okay the deliverables are you have to be dressed up as a nut what kind of nut these nuts you show me these nuts [Laughter] yeah i like i have a gym i have a gym in my in my um garage is this sarcasm no this is i have a gym in my garage you just made your sarcastic face i have a gym that's sarcastic face i know i have a disappointed face no this is my earnest face you're sarcastically disappointed that you have a gym but you've never used it so you're circumcisedly disappointed you put those faces together let me see that i have a gym what is this face i have a gym this is your ernest face this is i i don't even i don't have a name for it yet but i have a gym okay so that is your earnest face i have a gym so you're earnestly sarcastically disappointed that you have a gym that's right oh could that make sense now what's your favorite okay if you have a gym what is your favorite thing to do at the gym um bench press let me see your guns no show me your guns no it's not it's not i'm not gonna show you a gun come on flex your no i'm not going to flex my arms because i'm like you actually don't go to the gym oh that's stupid this is stupid are you calling me stupid no i was being you said it here i have a few graded cards this is a blastoise and piplup full art a holographic nidoking from bayset this is a psa 10 three birds this is my first edition fossil holographic psa nine haunter first edition jungle pikachu and then my first edition base set one charmander psa 10 is my best card okay who did you steal these from who kid whose kid did you spill this from you stole him from miz didn't you no i didn't steal them for mischief misgive owes me cards he just hasn't paid up yet you're supposed to collect pokemons but by doing the box opening okay mikko do you know how much this would cost if i bought the box how much guess two bucks was it how much how much would one box to get this card cost uh five bucks five bucks yeah a sub this box costs about four hundred thousand dollars why because there aren't that many why because they were printed on a limited release in 1999. why because they were meant to be more valuable until wizards of the coast creates value in a market where everything is just cardboard why at the end of the day man to make money why because that's what capitalism's about why i don't know that's a mark's question or some [ __ ] so you stole mess gifts cards i didn't steal miss gif's cards misgive owes me cards how does he owe you cards because i won them from him and he never paid me out wait really should we call him i know we shouldn't call him why not because i think he's gonna send them so we call him and ask him why we can if you would like if you would like i'm down we can start drama he's not even live yet hold on hold on hold on hold on how many money how much money have you spent on pokemon cards i've i haven't added it up i don't do you want me to yeah do i have to yeah the thing about it is can we use the correct nomenclature what's the nomenclature the word the verbiage you use to explain certain things so you said how much money have you spent sure let's change that let's twist that how much money have you invested yes we're together now we're thinking we're symbiotic i've invested a fair bit into physical assets understanding that you know market crashes can happen at any time physical aspect assets they don't suffer the same big losses because the value's always there because it's a limited resource so considering that i've put a lot of my portfolio into that i would say i've spent about a hundred thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars oh that's it yeah oh it's not bad hey pocket change sure yeah pocket change hey it's not bad at all that's what i was thinking too yup you're right same page because it's an investment at the end of the day so it isn't bad it's actually kind of like smart i should probably put more in maybe i mean compared to like three million dollars that you owe to the irs such a weird word to use oh you know cause like whose money is it this is what our forefathers fought for true true can you do your best trumpet impression no go back no go back to your disappointed face it's like donald give me a different celebrity um to you yeah i'll do it obama um michelle come over here with that bomb ass [ __ ] let me get a sniff of it okay that sound try to do it that's what bunter's taught me tips on what how do i become as successful as you in what in every life what do you consider success you well what about me specifically because you could think it's successful that i have a large stream or you could think it's successful that i have some skill in a certain game or you could think it's just successful that it's because of my age or you could find success in other things like i don't i don't even fold my clothes really well i fold them bad they're all wrinkly and i can't really cook and stuff how old is blood week 25 oh what ah what for [ __ ] sakes know what what are you [ __ ] five okay me a lot of people 25 is like an average age for people to be live awake uh-huh tell me what to do with my money well i would do a mixture of investments into different portfolios and then try to take the gains and put them into safer investments long term and probably buy some physical goods pokemon cards are not a bad investment here's what you do with ten dollars can i buy cutie with ten dollars no jesus you think cutie's worth ten she's a dime well that is ten you that is fair wait no that means she's 10 cents can i buy it can i buy cutie no you cannot buy cutie for 10 cents okay put her on a price no she's a dime i'm a dime a dozen all right i just gotta i got to take what i have i can't i can't i can't be losing that to 10 cents it doesn't make sense financially but you just said that she's a dime so it's like a phrase phrase that people use i know english is a phrase english is use your 10 cents towards buying among us play that and just get millions of dollars easy oh so if i just play among us i get millions of dollars that's how it works really that's that simple it's really that easy wow can i call cutie if she's available i don't know what she's doing i want to call cutie into this call you can call cutie feel free cutie cute [Applause] hi mikko susie does that mean i can leave him no it doesn't yes whoa what is that scam right there you know what how about we give mikko 15 seconds and if she says right here that she
