he's walking in the right direction away from us and this is going into a coned area all my days well this white Peugeot here what is he doing what do you do welcome back everybody to tears the driver I hope you're doing very well today I have come all the way out here to hemel hempstead to look at this which is apparently the Magic Roundabout but another version so in Swindon we have this roundabout that basically you can go the wrong way round the big roundabout in the centre and then you go over the right way round the little roundabouts on the outside so it's really really strange because there's so many roundabouts in one place and what I want to do is I'm just going the wrong way around the whole roundabout here to show you we've got little roundabouts like this like this and then we've got this big roundabout here on the left and this is something that somehow some day a self-driving car is gonna have to figure out its gonna know or it's gonna have to be able to know to go the wrong way round a roundabout like this which is what I'm doing right now and I've got to say it feels very very strange and then it's also got a no to come off on the right places and go the right way around the other roundabouts if that makes sense so there we go we've just completed a whole lap there of the roundabout I'm not sure who's going so I'm gonna commit and yeah it's it's pretty it's pretty hectic it's pretty scary but I've got to say that around about there is actually a little bit nicer than the Swindon magic roundabout which I will be trying at a different time and I will be actually trying all to pile up on it there was no way back there the autopilot would have done anything on those roundabouts so it just it really wasn't worth me trying or doing anything but what we're gonna be looking at today is how it works here in Hamel Hempstead we're gonna do it a little bit of city driving this is 16.2 so 20 2016 2 . 1 which is the newer software update and I'm hoping you guys are gonna be able to see some humans with their legs walking on the screen because that's that's come out in this new update so currently it seems to be following the Tesco delivery truck into this left oh sorry - the right lane which is fine we are going straight on but obviously we should be really in the left lane the lights here are being picked up nicely again it did oh it is showing those orange lights which was good so it is showing orange lights and I think I actually think it showed the arrow there within the light if you can zoom in and have a look at that again it might have actually shown that which is pretty cool so this is saying to get into the left lane now even though this is a closed off dual carriageway it's sadly still not doing the lane changes in this update so I have to pull it off myself and do the lane change like that which is annoying cuz you can see that it knows that it's a it knows that it's a dual carriageway and there's two roads here but hey ho and then as we come up here to this is this a roundabout yes it is let's see how it does it wasn't it was just going it was just going that way which off see we don't want it to do because we want to flow up here okay so this is going to turn on navigate on autopilot and we've got some pretty interesting roads up ahead let's put it onto the speed limit and let the car do its thing Oh a little bit wonky there it wasn't sure I think because of the width of the lane it actually fought back there was a line in the middle confirmed lane change to follow route confirmed lane change but it's got it just forced itself over oh it's swang out a little bit there but that actually did that pretty well let's go up to the speed limit and it's asking us to change lanes so those change lanes and it's doing that really nicely sorry if I'm a little bit nasally I've got bad hay fever so yeah that's the problem and here we go on our way so yet the roundabout situation here in the UK Ilan said that the roundabouts are easy it's unpredictable cars or other other drivers basically that aren't easy to read but I'm sorry Ilan I don't think it's gonna be able to figure out either the magic roundabout or that roundabout there when there's six roundabouts a wrap no sorry because if it's five roundabouts around one big roundabout going the wrong way so so confusing but it works you know the system does work and the roundabouts do work so if the car can figure out that will be absolutely great so on my drive up here I didn't just come to see this roundabout by the way I dropped my brother off who is buying a new car sadly it's not electric sadly it's not Tesla but it was a nice car so on the drive up here we did have a couple of issues and the issues mainly work with lorries again it was trying to get into the lane with lorries it really struggled with and didn't like God that looks at wonky trailer I'm hoping that's just like whoa well what is that doing that doesn't look too safe highway maintenance yeah that doesn't look too safe at all interestingly again there's no trailers on here being shown yet that would be a really nice update to have so it shows like the trailers or I don't know something else on the back because sometimes I'm worried that it doesn't see it at all and it might you know go closer thinking there's not actually a trailer there so again we'll do another lane change here shouldn't be any problems I did that really nice and smoothly now we should be in the right-hand lane but I'm waiting for the car to slow us down and move lanes but so far it's not it is asking us to so I will move it over but even though we're on the slowing down strips the car is still going at full 70 miles an hour here oh there we go it did start actually pulling itself down and now it's come off navigating on autopilot still slowing itself down still slowing itself down really hard braking there and yeah I'm gonna have to also pull it off so it wasn't actually coming that's awesome that is really cool it obviously wasn't pulling itself all the way down it was intact reacting to the traffic lights or anything like that yet but it was slowing itself down a little bit okay back on Oh is this still around about let's see if it changes our lane here I'm assuming it will follow the lane round yet yep still following it still following the lane round this is really good they're doing it really well doing it really well go on car go on car okay it's decided to take this Lane I guess we're going for the overtake and I'll bring it up to the full speed limit well that worked really well I'm not sure why it's not accelerating very quickly here but it's not accelerating very quickly at all you can see we're going like 40 miles an hour for some reason I think it was slightly worried because of this lorry in front of us yeah and as you can see as we go past the lorry it's starting to bring us up to speed quite a lot quicker which is which is a good thing so here we go back onto the motorway and we'll see what the car ask us to do it's not asking me to change the lane or anything like that and now I'm changing lanes for it it's completely safe but wow it really flings you it flings you into the lane on those kind of junctions still it doesn't do it smoothly at all and it needs to it definitely needs to saw that out because it's just flinging us across the lane which I'm not not too happy about it doesn't it doesn't feel very good at all we're gonna be coming off in a mile now and I try to apologize it's so bright that it's sometimes quite hard to see this screen is quite hard to get it to film and be able to see the outside in the screen so yeah I'm gonna try and get the car tinted as soon as possible and then obviously once I get it tinted you'll hope you'll be able to see the screen a lot better so we need to get into this left lane like pretty soon if I'm being totally honest we've got half a mile so we'd really need to start getting into this Lane but it's not actually asking us to so I'm a little bit worried it says now upcoming lane change so actually let's see if it'll slow down behind this pickup truck and will it go over no look at it actually it didn't do it then let's try it again there we go now is do it it fitting into that space very nice that you're going to thank the car behind us yeah so weirdly there it left it quite late until the point four of a mile then it actually nagged us to say hey you're in the wrong lane so that was a little bit a little bit later than I would have liked it to be now let's see how it deals with this I think we come off here and it splits into two lanes and you can see that's followed this this Lane rather than going over to the left which is fine because this is the actual correct lane that we need to be in and then as it comes off here you can see it's slowing us down to 55 interesting as we came into a 50 but I don't think it was because of the speed limit and yeah it's in the correct lane here again going Brown slowing us down now 245 now personally 45 is a little bit too slow for this corner you can see everyone else is kind of pulling away bringing us back up to 50 now it's that work quite well and by the way if you see a speed limit like that that's not a real speed limit that's just advice I've seen people commenting if you see that it's not that you don't have to follow that speed than it just so you know okay right again slowing down but 45 yeah slowing us right down here for this corner which it really isn't a tight corner Wow fourth yeah this is way too slow way way way too slow and now it's bringing us back up again oh he's got flat oh that was bad okay let's see how it's going to deal with this then again I'm not touching anything to do with the controls I'm not going to speed it up I'm just gonna let it do it itself starting to speed us up here to 55 and then audience wants me to go into the left lane but I definitely want to go into this right lane here so we're in the right lane now which worked well and now we are stuck in the traffic so I need to bring it down now apparently I did read somewhere that it's now got speeds sign recognition built in or at least it's got it there in the manual to mention it but trust me it's it's definitely not working it's definitely not doing it so it might say that it's there or something but it's definitely not it's not working yet which is a shame because again that's something big that would change and make a lot of difference for us so this is a construction zone and obviously we're going fifty in the construction zone asking us to go left to go into the left lane but the left lane is actually diverting us off to the a4 so we definitely don't want to follow what it's asking us to do to go into that left lane there you can see it's picking up all the cones here on the right hand side nicely not picking any up on the left there over the back barrier let's see if we do a lane change here so the right car goes to fill in the gap nicely and that was actually a fairly tight gap that was a fairly tight gap and we're gonna go into the third lane here because we're going very slow and now we're at our own own lane which is nice so the cars are seeking us to go into the left lane even though it knows that we can't because of the lorry - like behind the left of us it's saying we can but again if I actually tried now to go into that left lane it would 100% fail and it'd be very embarrassing so I'm not gonna do it it 100% fail because it just will not it will not go next to that lorry if you try and do it it won't go because you've got to get so close because the lanes are so tight it will try and go to it and then it will start swinging out again however now we're in the gap of two lorries I have some confidence that it might actually work here so let's give it a quick whirl and there you go so the gap between the two lorries no problem at all but yeah definitely still a problem navigating into a lane when there's a lorry in an adjacent Lane some people say don't do it for safety reasons and stuff but you know some sometimes you do and yeah it should it should at least be able to do it so we've got this lorry here who is coming out no matter what and the card kind of slowed down for it and actually indicated and change lanes a lot quicker than sometimes it normally does yeah we're tight up here to the lorry but the cars cars doing it really well and all we're breaking breaking what's going on here what is going on here whoa whoa okay I have not a clue at what is going on we've all slowed right down whoa whoa whoa what is that car doing oh my gosh what's going on he I swear he was just gonna go to the side of in what is I don't know I think there's something wrong with this car in front of us guys I think they're saying wrong with him oh I don't know that was very strange very very very strange he's like all over the place look he's in like two lanes gopher lane change this van has just come up front this this white Peugeot here what is he doing what are you doing me what is that person do it not a clue but he is causing problems I'm thinking he's on his phone he's all over the place I'm looking in my mirror and he's held up all those people back there and he's all over the place whoa look at this so the car oh wow the car was braking from here so you can see this lorry is just stopped in our lane and the car reacted to that so early on that was actually really really good to see I wasn't 100% sure if that if that lorry was moving or what it was doing but these guys all obviously moved over and as the lane opened up the car saw from I don't know the good hundred meters away that that car was stopped and he actually slammed on it brakes very very hard there which was which was really good to see so I'm gonna try and navigate into this lane behind this lorry and that worked really nicely it's only because we've got some BMWs kind of racing past us in a second so I thought I'd get out the way in case they were undercover Popo but they're not it's just someone that wants to get a speed ticket yes it is let's see how I react to this so the lines have disappeared and they've gone to these kind of like green Bob Lee lines and the car has followed them really really nicely we've got some cones here pushing us across the lines disappear so let's see how the car deals with this you can see all the cones appearing it's asking us to change lanes but we don't need to we'll just stay in this Lane and look at that even though all the lines disappeared and we had some kind of semi visible green dots on the road to guide us the car did it really smoothly with no problems at all it is asking us to move lanes to get away from the cones but there that's not a problem now okay so how's it going to deal with this lorry here whether it's going to push past it or just sit behind it it's getting very close to our line you'll see as soon as it touches out our line the car will brake here we go look oh my god yeah okay we're still going past we still go past and this is going into a cold area all my days this is very tight Jesus I'm pulling off but he's coming over to my lane they get into the first lane why are you even over in this Lane isn't that there's no one in the first Lane I don't get why he's satting that's the thinner Lane interestingly did you see that Wow okay so that cone back there was actually falling over and it showed it in here falling over it like switched it to up and down but it officially shows cones that have fallen over that is so so cool so so simple like like you know so simple but it's such a such a cool thing to actually see so we're actually coming off in 1.2 miles so we need to start getting ourselves over to that left lane I'm gonna indicate the cross now and see how this moves us across very nice and smoothly there and it's not asking us to get in the left lane okay now it's asking us to get in the left lane but it seemed that being q Laurie so I think it's saying that we should be able to get past the being Q Laurie and then we'll go back into that Lane so yeah it's still not buggin now it's saying that there is a change coming so it's a point seven miles away it starts to say hey you should really start getting into that Lane and that worked really well following this fan as well so we're gonna let it do as much as it can going into here as we get to the supercharger and I'm also going to perch up just in front of some people where they're walking so that I can show you guys the walking animation on here a little bit clearer because it's actually really cool to see when it works sometimes it doesn't and they're walking backwards and moonwalking and doing some funny funny stuff but when it works really well it looks absolutely great so we're turning off here looking out the cars doing it really nicely or a little bit choppy little bit choppy bringing us down to 40 35 back up to 40 back down to 35 and then the services are off here to the left so we'll let the can't do as much of it as it can keeping it down to 20 miles an hour through here and we'll see where the car wants to take us and straight on it looks like I'm not actually sure where the superchargers are oh they're over there to the right so the car is just gonna probably drive us straight until the end of this road I'm gonna see if it will turn us because it should be able to take us actually the whole way around here let's see it navigate around this yeah it's going around it nicely oh it's aborting it's aborting interesting I don't know why it decided to abort there because it had good lines there was good visibility no problems about but it decided for some reason it needed to abort there which is a shame okay so we're gonna be going across here this lady didn't didn't look but you know it's fine there you go look the walking animation it showed her walking the correct way which was really really cool and now I need to turn up here and charge the car I'm just gonna take this around the car park one more time in the hope that people like this are gonna walk in front and look at that clear as day walking in the right direction it's so cool to see again so simple but so so cool to see I just pulled up behind this guy here and I'm gonna see if the car will pick him up there we go look at that he's walking in the right direction away from us and as I Drive past him look at that he is walking correctly away so so cool it's also picked up the arrow on the road there and it's picked up the line for us to go up to and then stop at and it sadly again he won't stop just yet by itself but at least it's showing that it knows the lines there now this is also really exciting guys here in the UK we hardly have any stop signs or any Syrian will try we have none but there's one here really really happy to see it is it gonna pick it up yes it has picked it up it's got to stop on the road as well and it's got the line so I better come to a complete stop there we go and we can continue again I really shouldn't get excited about a stop sign but I am so so there's that okay we're not going up that way we're heading down this way just wait to see if autopilot will turn on for this bit yep there we go and it's keeping us at 21 and how is it gonna do here the lines go a little bit strange here but it should it should be fine a little bit left but then it rethought about it and carried on straight which is good keeping it low at 20 here and then I need to actually put something in my navigation so then the navigation should turn on another stop sign they're not for us but it didn't pick it up sadly and we are now going onto the motorway gonna set that up to the 70 miles an hour and let's see how well this joins it's asking me to hold the steering wheel but I've got my hand on the steering wheel the whole time here and I'm going to navigate across now and the car has joined the motorway really really nicely no problems at all that was really good okay let's fast-forward to the next Junction we're coming off in a mile now and we've just entered another construction zone so I'm gonna see how it reacts here to some more of these kind of like tighter lanes that it seems to give us it's actually moving slight so right here to get out of the way from that lorry and then as you'll see it tucked us back in afterwards let's go into this first lane here on the left we're going to be taking the junction here off to Swindon and that will be the end of our video once we've done this so I hope you enjoyed it I hope you enjoyed our trip down the m25 checking out that roundabout and then down the m4 as well or look at this I wasn't gonna deal with this yeah no problem it is asking us to change lanes it doesn't like being close to the cones but no we're not gonna change lanes and the car even it doesn't have a bother with that little line in the middle there it's following these green green dotted lines on either side which is actually really good so yeah if haven't already and turn on the notification Bell gonna have loads of loads of content coming now that we're out to go out and drive again so I'm gonna be able to get some more cards some more content going let me know what you want to see in the comments section as well I'm continuing our city tour for sure but I will also hopefully be doing some other bits and bobs okay so looks like they're building a new road or no I think that's just a new layer actually yeah just new lay-by we're coming up behind this guy here we're coming off in half a mile let's see how it deals with it so again yeah even though again this was Bart's a second ago now it's cones it is asking me to move over so it doesn't like seeing cones it seems and here we come out of the construction zone but I'm not gonna speed up because we are coming off here on the left anyway in a second so it's interesting enough it's asking me to get into the hard shoulder which you can't do so obviously don't do that but it got a bit confused they're asking us to go the hard shoulder it's bringing us off now you can use to pick the left lane yeah it has picked the left lane and let's see what Lane it's gonna pick here is it gonna take us across and further over into the left lane or whether just keep us in this one no it's just kept us in this one which will be going straight on I think let's see how slowly it will slow us down to we're coming up here to some lights anyway and yeah not stopping so again it does it doesn't stop for the lights it doesn't stop for the lights yet here in the UK even though it shows them and it's even picking up some of the bollards here as well which is pretty cool and then we've got the green light orange green good it showed orange then green on here which was nice to see it's gonna pick this arrow up on the road yeah of course it is showing all the lights and everything I know the car set to go left there but I'm gonna go straight on for some reason and is it showing these arrows guys in the lights or I'm not Henderson sure because it's showing us a top-down view for some reason wow that were really quick light straight to orange and then I'll put autopilot back on here and just I want to see how it deals with this like merging area really well look at that merge straight in nicely between two cars no problems at all there and again so it says that the speed limit is 60 here it's not the speed limit is 40 here and it's 60 there because they've just changed it so again that's showing that it definitely hasn't updated the system it definitely isn't taking the speed limits off sides or anything like that so I don't know when they're gonna activate that but apparently according to the user manual it is now there it is just ready to be turned on thank you all for watching don't forget drive safe
