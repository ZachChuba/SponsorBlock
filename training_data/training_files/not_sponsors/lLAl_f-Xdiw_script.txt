this week rag myself will spin the randomizer 100 times to get the best pk setup we can with one catch all the items we spin on the randomizer must be dropped made or bought in a two-hour time limit we are iron men who start with nothing but a rune axe room pickaxe and 250 gp let's see who will get the best pk set up together in the two hours then we fight animals are you kidding me bees and geez i'm super satisfied but before we go any expressvpn.com links ocarina okay so i'm gonna go ahead and use my hundred spins and then we will see what gear setup i can get obviously we need to be able to complete it in the two hours so i can't like if i get an acb that's not going to happen you know seeing as we're only starting with a runex room pick and 250 gp so we've got to go for some fairly basic stuff but try and be as deadly as possible with that basic stuff um obviously gonna go ahead and go for the weapon first let's see what we can get dragon simmy ah [Music] i could either because i could buy it i could buy it from a shop for 100k so it'd be a case of can i make 100k in two hours from scratch probably yes oh that's 15 rolls by the way 15 spins there um we'll stick with it for now and i'll come back to it in a bit addy plate body not a bad one i'll stick with that for now addy plate legs as well 20 rolls in not bad addy kite okay we've got the whole adi setup going on which is which is okay because we could just go into smith and mine that um let's go ahead and go with helm warrior helm oh again i have to make money i have to make money i'll come back to i'm gonna see how much money that would be all together i think it's about 150 k i'd have to make which is quite a lot of money obviously we're iron man as well so i can't just like use the ge to make money unfortunately otherwise 150k would be pretty easy to make let's go with gloves let's try and get some um color manchester gloves uh we'll stick with black gloves yeah they're pretty in the middle and they're proper cheap to get um so we've got 26 rolls left gonna try and get like a strength ami or a glory would be quite hard to get hold of so we'll see what we can get oh defense amulet very nice very very nice indeed 23 left okay i just had a look the warrior helm is 78k so i'm not going to bother with that we're going to keep spinning 23 rolls left come on [ __ ] sake that is a rune full helm uh do i want that i could buy one in pristineness for 35k uh but i'd have to get to pristinas no i don't think it's worth it okay that's an adi full helm it's uh one of the decorated ones um but yeah that's an addie full helm so we're looking at full addy defense yeah yeah i think that i think we can do it we're just gonna work out how i'm gonna make 100k for the uh for the dragon scimitar but i think we can do this i've got three spins left so i think i'm gonna go with cape boots a ring archer's ring okay so yeah i'm not gonna get any of those to be honest because they're all bollocks all right guys very backwards compared to all the other randomizer videos we've done of course we have to randomize the gear and that's the gear we have to try to get we have a hundred rolls there's a nice counter on the bottom which is why the screen is you know expanded a bit more thank you robin for adding that a great touch great touch um so a hundred we're going for a hundred rolls um and of course as always we are going to start with weapon weapons gonna be huge bone dagger that'd be very easy to get we're only allowed one weapon though so it's gonna have to be a little bit better than that see like this is a great example of a weapon that's really good but i'd have to get that and that's not easy to get in two hours time so we'll have to skip past that unfortunately oh whoa that's really good that's really good we're gonna stick with that the bolts are pretty easy to get as well um which we don't have to roll for guys we can always just get the best bolts that we can unenchanted and the long cabinet bolts are actually really not that bad to get yeah and d height's pretty easy to get as well so maybe we can get some black d hide or something oh already 16 rolls [ __ ] come on it is trimmed lincoln i did discuss any trim stuff we could use the normal version of it so we could easily get black d hide easily get rune plate legs technically it's armadillo but under the same premise oh do you want to go tank range is that roon steel steel helm no no oh what okay let's go to shields dude what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] oh my okay let's get a nice cape i mean all this stuff we got it's it's not that hard to get i don't think maybe legs might be a bit and i mean roon full helm a bit and maybe i should get a skill cape in case we have some extra funds at the yet the best skill cape that we could get with this setup seriously what the heck all right 15 more rolls i kind of want to rock this but also i mean i i can't i can't just mine roon which is the issue guys i think i'm gonna spin for another shield i don't think a room kite is gonna be that easy to get i'd have to get lucky with drops if i were to get that i can get the hunter crossbow really really fast right get it fast i can get the ammunition decently fast um or i could just make an msb to just use during the challenge as well just to kill things to get money um and whatnot but okay yeah we're gonna respin the shields that is a that is a room kite shield as well that's funny that's an addie kite addie kite yeah we're going to stick with the addy kite because we can easily easily mine and smith that okay can we get nice gloves steel gloves very very very easily obtainable but you can get so much better something like a glory would be kind of hard to get wouldn't it we only have two hours boots are just overall pretty hard i'll just do a ring a ring spin um ah glory glory is a bit hard [ __ ] it we'll risk it we'll risk it we'll risk it because i don't think like this will probably be the last slot i actually try to go for ruby amulet pointless okay guys i'm actually i'm actually quite happy with this so we have steel gloves black dehyde body room plate legs roon full helm adamant kite shields and a ranging cape i'm actually really dumb it's 100 spins not 50. not 50. i'm really stupid so we're gonna go back to the amulet slot try to get one that i know i can get in the time limit without spending too long on it wow is that a glory um yeah that it's it's possible dragon stones aren't the most i shouldn't say they're definitely not the easiest thing in the world to get let's try to get better gloves um gloves are actually huge red okay i'm pretty happy with that i don't even know what else to spin if i'm being completely honest don't want to risk getting a better weapon maybe some recoils do i really want to waste a lot of spins on recoils let's go for gloves again let's go for gloves again iron no [ __ ] am i gonna regret this hard leather gloves no oh no i'll never get ancient i'll never get that come on let's do this mystic gloves oh we tried guys we tried i was going for gold it's fine though it's fine but i'm very happy with the hunter's crossbow very very happy with it it's the solid weapon uh getting something like a room crossbow would actually be quite annoying because we can't mine roon link and i can't mine runes so we'd actually have to get the limbs for a drop and we need to get the gear to that kill either avianzie's or kill the crazy ark it's just too much stress in two hours so yeah this is our setup still pretty happy with it guys to be honest so let's fire into the progression and two hours on the clock let's do this okay i've got my plan what i'm gonna go ahead and do is start the clock and we are gonna tele home is what we're gonna do um because i need to make money and i think the most reliable way i know the agility pyramid makes over 100k an hour so if i go and do the agility pyramid for an hour i'll be able to buy my dragon simi and the black gloves as well which would be a nice start to the setup and then i can go ahead and make sure that i get all the ali together um luckily we do have the 250 gp so i can buy the desert outfit and i can also buy some water skins as well which is gonna really really help it would be great if we've got enough money that i don't have to go back and buy more water skins because obviously that will really eat into my time we will see that we will see okay let's trade with shanti and we'll get that that and that um how much are water skins 30 coins [ __ ] i spent all my money and i don't have a shanty pass oh that's so annoying um we're gonna have to pickpocket can we pickpocket these guys yeah we can beautiful um yeah we'll pickpocket them a little bit i might actually pickpocket them a little bit longer just so i can get a few more water skins um so that i definitely don't have to uh you know go back and buy more water skins later on so i think we're just wow really really i'm on a timer i don't have time for this [ __ ] uh yeah i'm gonna get a little bit of gp together and we'll just uh and we'll just get enough maybe like 10 water skins something like that surely this is enough water skins we will see we'll see okay we got here one hour 53 i think i don't know if i've ever done it on this account before and i think you have to talk to him first to initiate it looks like i have but um yeah let's go ahead and do this um i've also thought i need to get over to the grand tree and i need to do i need to do so much running around i'm not gonna have teles which is gonna be really annoying i'm sort of contemplating whether i should try and get some law runes together um i'm not sure we will see we will see all right guys i have a pretty solid plan and it's going to start by getting a little bit of money together so let's actually start the timer as i begin to walk and talk about what i am going to do we are first heading to arty i'm gonna get there by pulling the lever and we're gonna just thieve some already knights get like five to 10k then we're probably gonna buy the hunter crossbow but we're also going to buy a bone crossbow and bone bolts to use that to kill things like the black dragon maybe even kill a few more black dragons um gonna have to kill something that drops a ruined full helm there's a lot we can do with a bone crossbow and it's gonna really help me progress during the two hours okay that's a decent amount pickpocketed let's go to where is it we want to go to the nightmare zone uh we want to hit that hunter shop hit that hunter shop buy the crossbow the hunter crossbow then we're gonna home telly gets a lumbridge by the bow by the bone bolts then head way north into the wilderness and kill the black dragons in the rev cave because they have some nice drops uh we can get an addie plate body which should be a great alcohol if i'm killing them really quick i might even stay there just so i can get a lot of hides to then just you know elk get coins but of course i don't know how efficient the bone crossbow will be against a black dragon so you know be happy you have that to look forward to so we'll see how that goes if not i'm not gonna be stressed there's a lot of ways to make money i mean we just made 9.2 k in less than seven minutes here we go let's trade and buy 100's crossbow and yes it should have been 1.3 k the ammo yeah no we need to get those ourselves of course okay cool i don't want to have to come back no i think we're good i think we're good okay cool yep let's now home telly legit just had a telly to edgeville i'm on the ancient spell book and then take the waka canoe over to long bridge i can't believe i did that um cool we need to light the torch somehow we can buy it in a box super easily cool so we're gonna buy a dinner box and then go in the lumbridge underground there we go this is gonna be the first top boom yeah we're easily gonna make easily gonna make 100k in maybe even like half an hour or something we're gonna have a lot of time but obviously the running around and trying to get to places is gonna take the time i think i might make a little bit more than 100k and i'll buy like the addie plate legs the adi full helm um just so i don't have to spend time mining coal and things um but we'll see we'll see what the time is looking like when we're when we're done i think i'm gonna do another one possibly two um so let's talk to him and let's hand these in as quickly as possible boom so 100k now i'm probably gonna do two more if i come across like a magic shop or something i'll probably buy some runes so i can teleport around and stuff regretting not taking that room full helm now i think i could have easily have got it but you know that's what the time limit is there for to make a second guess what we uh what we were going to get on the randomizer so i guess i've been beaten by the randomizer to start with but um you know what i think i think we're doing quite well the dragon scimitar's gonna be a huge weapon okay one hour 19 left and i'm going to trade this in and that is going to give us 120k i'm gonna go ahead and hit up uh where am i gonna go probably go to clan war castle wars actually yeah we'll go to castle wars um thanks mate appreciate it teleport to class of wars and then i'm going to run up to the grand tree fire on over to a patol buy the dragon scimitar i might mine actually might use the grand tree mine because it's there anyway and then we'll go and get the dragon scimitar okay here we are nardoc nardoc hook me up with the goods one of these buy like five of these they're super cheap yes 500 we'll even buy a little bit more because i don't know actually screw it screw it screw it we're gonna need it coins don't seem too bad to come by let's hope i don't regret that um [ __ ] now i'm at a telly's and everything so you have to walk back to the cellar we gotta go to deep wildy fastest way would be a burning amulet um or obelisk telly from the house but of you know all off limits and whatnot we can't use a poh so it's gonna have to be a walk maybe so we're gonna grab the knife and then i'll catch you guys when i'm in deep wildy and hopefully we can get there relatively quick edgeville isn't the fastest way how about just going straight to the wilderness wow sometimes i gotta use my brain guys but this this is this is gonna be it this is the move it's it's gonna be a little bit of a walk but it's still gonna be so much quicker than doing the other method just can't get pk'd oh no oh i'm just gonna hop you don't look like you'll kill me but you know you like guys we just don't risk these sort of things when we're doing pvp challenges here we go cool okay please hit please hit please hit please hit let's get some flicks in okay at least we can hit it it has been over 10 minutes to kill three in fact i still haven't killed the third one yet so we're gonna kill this one and we're gonna dip i think it was worth going for the addie plate body and we still might get it um but this is brutal brutal brutal brutal beyond brutal so here we go anything good gotta watch out for that dragon right there um definitely don't want to get hit by it coins and then down here underneath the trapdoor we have the mine that we can use and there is addy in here i think i'm just going to make a plate body pretty sure i've got enough money to buy a full helm and the legs so i think i'm just gonna need five alley bars here okay trade with dagger and it's gonna be 100k beautiful 20k left over i'm gonna actually trade with two tab here and i think they sell lauren said they do beautiful um what teles do i want i'm gonna want varrock for sure let's buy that uh do i want phalli am i gonna need to go to valley okay we're gonna buy ourselves the addy fullhelm from pexa and i think i'm gonna home telly now yeah i'm gonna home telly um i just remembered i need a kite shield don't i and i can't really buy that anywhere i don't think so i'm gonna need to mine a little bit more addy i'll probably do that in our career while we're there anyway um but yeah [ __ ] up a little bit there gonna get myself the black gloves while i'm here as well there we go beautiful and we'll bank so we can make a plate body and we can make a kite shield i'm gonna also buy myself plate legs in our grid we've got that 15k or so um that we had in the bank as well so we'll be able to buy them then i need to think about food probably gonna go down the shark route um for food let's go for it i don't want to get roasted just no dragon fire what are you not aggressive okay that's weird anyways first i want to make the body of course i can get the ranged attack bonus then i want to actually get my adamant kite shield and then after that what i really want to do is kill gargoyles i can get a lot of money from them they drop a rune full helm they drop room plate legs it's really rare okay room plate legs are pretty rare but if i don't get the room plate legs all the other alcohols that i get gonna throw right into the champion skill to buy myself a rune or a pair of room plate legs decided it's actually smartest to mine right now i'll mine the addy and the coal here just so i at least have the bars because i can also smelt it and operate as well so saving some time um yeah it looks like we have everything we need let's get the addi first which should be over here yup two of them sweet one needle let's buy like five threads actually we definitely didn't need to do that but here we go coming up on three adamant bars then we're gonna fly on over to varrock using the rat pits teleport uh we could buy a hammer from the general store really quickly smith the armor there the kite shields um and then we'll have to walk to cannafest which will be fun but our gear is coming together which is always good to see finally we're looking like something of a unit if you could even use that word for this gonna get myself a hammer there so that we can actually make these bars into things and then i'm also gonna buy the ali legs from louie now boom thank you mate okay beautiful we've got ourselves the ali plate and the kite shield now uh what do i want to do i need to get a defense amulet and i need to make a little bit of money as well so i think i'm gonna go back to lumbridge and we're gonna do some ham chests yeah that's what we're gonna do okay so we're gonna pick pocket these guys and they drop the keys and every time they drop a key it means we can open a chest up and those chests can have emerald amulets in them which is obviously what we need to make a defense amulet and on top of that we can sell all of the jewelry we get from the chests in port sarum and then i'll be able to buy some sharks with that i mean we've got about 4k so i think i've probably got enough already but um you know i'd like to get a bit more money together and i can passively get that defense amulet as well so this makes a lot of sense please emerald ambula uh okay some sapphire stuff uh some gp i think that's all i've got for this chest okay not what we're looking for but we can sell it off that would be a bit of money that's too expensive i guess i'll try to stand next to it then i don't have any food okay um let's sell my battle axe to the general store and try to buy some food from rufus i guess we can get her sharks now as well i kind of wanted to save my sharks by opening up the um the wildy chests to try to get a dragonstone as well but it's you know we're so tight on time as it is that unless we get incredibly lucky on the drops here i can't see us really doing that how much is it going to buy this for 416 each not not too crazy about that um yeah let's see if we can get some food yes guys 10k that's exactly what you want to see that's exactly what you want to see anything that's not a root full helm or a pair of room plate legs is going to get chucked at a general store or high out to get the maximum amount of money so we can buy a pair of room plate legs if we didn't get them and the dream of having the 99 raged cape in the fight which will also act as an avez which would be really cool to have um because i don't know how many bolts i'm gonna get of course i want to try to stay here as long as possible to maximize how much i make um but yeah we're gonna see how this works so far doing really really really well some super fast kills oh okay and i mean not the best drop but it definitely can be made into a room full of if we get another one don't think i'll get three so i'm going to scratch room plate legs off the table but even if that fails we can make that into like a rune sword an elk it for 14k not a bad drop at all we just need the coal to go along with it but that shouldn't be too bad man it's all just sapphire stuff coming out we got a couple of diving things actually which is super rare to get uh we don't have the right key for that one what have i got silver silver key okay okay all right well i'm gonna go ahead and sell all of this off and then i'll definitely have enough money for sharks and stuff and then i'm just gonna force myself to get an emerald uh amulet from these guys i'm just gonna drop all the uh jewelry i get after this uh sale because i don't need any more money in the challenge so it will just be a case of dropping dropping dropping until we finally get an emerald amulet out of one of them not even going to bother hopping i really don't need to we've got so much money that's going to be just so a ridiculous amount i don't need anywhere near that amount of money 16k this probably wouldn't have been too bad to do instead of the uh agility pyramid to be fair but we can go to port piscourius from here just gonna go ahead and sell these off as well for nothing did that i swear that diamond sold for nothing or did i just miss did i just not see it i don't know um and then we're gonna buy sharks from here and then we'll cook them over here okay so they sell 25 buy all of those and i'll go and cook them because i'm sure i'll burn one or two and then we will go ahead and buy the rest that we need oh my gosh 54 kills i am in the one i'm killing right now i said was gonna be my last one so i was getting really nervous right really nervous had no had no legs had no helm i'm like nervous even talking right now that that this just popped up but wow okay i oh man i was about to complain to you guys but i can't now um what i'm going to do finish off this kill pick up the helm go to cannafist sell some of the stuff to the general store there just to clear my inventory buy sharks that i need get my bolts and then thieve the rest of the time i'm actually pretty close to getting the roon plate legs because i have 40k cash let's do this let's be quick about this i have 40k cash i can make that into a runite bar so i mean that's probably gonna be like 14k assuming i have enough time to actually make it into a bar and then make it into a short sword 55 kills though i mean we were past the drop rate we were past the drop wait i was really hoping for like a room to wait wager room battle axe as well which combined well past the drop rate as well and only i think we only had two 10k drops really early on the rest is just from like 500 600 coin drops that we got along the way but it doesn't even matter let's sell the stuff by the sharks and then get the bolts let's do it doesn't even matter i'm not going to try to squeeze every last penny out of this nine coins won't even bother with that maybe we shouldn't have sold the death rooms then crap but that's okay let's just bank everything pretty much um if we really really need coins we can probably just smelt these into like plate bodies and sell them at gold's or we probably should have chucked in there as well but uh yeah let's just focus on the food first food food before anything right now okay so we need four five six more i'll probably just buy like 10 just to be absolutely sure nice now it's 35 minutes to focus on getting an emerald amulet then we will have to go and buy cosmics as well um which i'll have to do in the wildy so 35 minutes is it going to happen we will see back to port sarum um and then we will uh go on down oh we got it emerald amulet awesome okay so we need to get over to edgeville now i'll probably just walk it we're not too far away oh i'm over the moon the ring i'm not gonna get the boots i don't even know what were the boots cow shoes like i'm not gonna get cow shoes i don't even know i didn't even know cow shoes existed um the team cape i guess i could try and get the team cape we're gonna have so much time left over the team cape's the only viable one so uh we'll see where i can get this from okay brought the dragon scimitar so i could slash the web i've got no food with me or anything and i only bought half the cash stack just in case you know i have some freak pka come and uh you know barrage me or something and i lose the money so i don't want to lose all of my money um so but you know that was being completely over the top cautious i think it was at least we'll see um let's go ahead and buy nice we did not get caught and let's trade 30 sharks were bought did not cook them yet bought a few extra just in case i burn like always can't really stick around any longer i noted my hammer by mistake crap here we go varrock teleport we are going to use the anvil we are going to why'd i note these i don't even know what the heck i'm doing um right let's unnote the stuff go to the anvil and we're going to make plate bodies and sell to horovik are going right and i mean right to get uh oh my hammer oh man and then we're gonna go make the bolts because we absolutely have to do those i need to be there with like 12 maybe 15 minutes left anything less than that i think i'll be really really cutting it close all right guys mining coal a coal hit valley back to varrock tree make bolts we got to do this incredibly quick oh my gosh and actually buy the rune legs but this is going pretty quick it's going pretty quick okay make the ruinet bar swing right to varrock no time wasted it's probably quicker this way yup boom make it sell it buy the legs rush to get bolts we need to also cook the food [ __ ] dude i'm gonna have like i'm gonna have like eight minutes to [ __ ] get bulls if i have like 30 bolts i'll make it work time to go get the legs guys i also have to cook my foods i guess i'll do that on my way back oh man this is so so so tight on time trade sell 66k buy rune legs boom we got it we got it we got it now we just need bolts and cooked food horrible news guys we burnt three sharks we only had 30. so if we cook these two we'll only have 27 sharks in the fight uh banked everything just so i could regenerate run faster i don't know why i didn't do that earlier we can get there kind of quick we're going to take the tree in the grand exchange which will get us relatively close i'm actually gonna grab out 2k from the bank so i can get there quicker use the boat system use that on there and that is going to give us the amulet of defense beautiful okay i gotta be fairly quick on this because i do get attacked while i do this so buy one boom we got it team 9k there we go that's everything i'm gonna be able to get the cowl shoes i looked into their holiday item which i guessed anyway um and the archer's ring obviously i'm not gonna go and get an archer's ring with the setup we have in 24 minutes so i've got everything i possibly could have got i don't know i probably undershot a little bit i'm a little bit fuming i didn't stick with like the room full helm because i easily could have got that um etc etc we probably could have pushed a bit harder so this is the setup uh very happy with it the only only worry i have is if he went magic then i'm going to get slaughtered slaughtered um but if he goes range i think we've got you know 156 range defenses it's just massive um and the dragon simi will just out out dps if he has a if he has an rcb i think we still out dps it um with the dragon sim um and then obviously the 28 food as well we've got the sharks which is just unreal stuff i think i've done really well as i said a little bit fuming i didn't push myself a little bit further but it's the way it goes we had about 25 minutes left i think um so we did have a bit of time but um yeah okay guys here we are we have to inspect the burrow and apparently it's only coins going the other way i'm actually quite a master at this from season two so i'm very confident my abilities of how much i can get of course i searched the wrong [ __ ] bush maybe i'm not super confident literally just got a curry from a gourd in my employing which heals 19. it's exactly what you want to see in a moment of struggle guys being spoon fed curry 1 hp less than a shark i'll take it i'll take it sets of spikes into bolts 42 there's no way we're gonna do another one in 17 seconds so let's telly home to edgeville let's get our gear together oh man hunter's crossbow is not the best weapon there is out there but it's a decent one you can get a hundred spins that you can 100 rely on getting for the final fights bit nervous he could pull up with like a dragon simmy but that means he's also making 100k for it and we only have two hours uh so it's it's a huge time management process this bow was 1.3 k uh these bolts were i guess free and took what eight minutes to get i guess the walk there about eight nine minutes horrible horrible anxiety the whole time but we did it for the most part i'm happy i will see you guys in the final fight kiddos linky boy [ __ ] different one i really enjoyed that everything was so backwards yeah getting [ __ ] i was like i can't even use it but i can maybe sell it to get the item i want it it was such a weird way of thinking yeah yeah yeah yeah and uh and it was it was it was cool because as you say there was times where i was like oh i could get that maybe and then even when i was on the randomizer i was like do i have enough time to get that and you know a little bit few of myself on a couple of decisions but it's the way it goes it's the way it goes weapon helm legs body shield you definitely want to bring something to the fight correct so you're always like is it worth going for and that was the struggle we're gonna find out though we're gonna find out now but i'll let you choose you choose what you want fire right into it okay all right i'm gonna go with helm okay i'm gonna go with hell so this is actually the slot i was fuming with myself about um really yeah i i was not gonna be that good i had better than this and i and i thought now i don't have enough time and i ended up getting this instead that's what i got i got a room full helm as well i mean you can't buy a room full of helm yeah you can oh my god you can yeah that was the reason i decided against it i was like no i won't make enough money in time well now you know i got it as a drop yeah all right so my mindset was you can't get this um from a shop so i i almost skipped over it also but where did you get some gargoyles wow i'll i'll give you a brief little you know secret of my plan um this was the drop i wanted from gargoyles and figured make money ranging gargoyles wow okay interesting oh and i got the drop interesting drop okay all right um i'll go shield mate here's where i think i really slacked okay um did get a room kite but decided to skip over it settle for a daddy i actually didn't gonna be a quick one get anything better than the adi oh so uh you've matched me there so okay all right feeling okay feeling okay i mean does something sell a room kite that i now not know about is there i don't know i don't think you can buy a ring kind though right let's go let's go legs let's go legs dude [ __ ] sake the addy warrior what's he [Applause] made the money from gargoyles and put up everything i can to general stores wow i actually to top myself over the 64k needed i got a rooney or drop it i had a mine eight coal made it into a ruined sword right ran to the the champions guild you could sell a rune store there for like i guess it's like high oct price or close to high price like 14k got the legs [ __ ] of course all the other drops i had like three 10k drops yeah and it just started adding up and dude they were so tight to get that though i was stressing the entire episode dude entirely so i'm concerned you spent all your time getting money for like a dragon long sword and dragon simmy maybe he got a room crossbow somehow that would have been hard to get mine ruined the rcb um i think it's your pick uh let's go let's go body go body in case of the magic yeah let's just say yeah okay he surely doesn't have a crossbow surely not i don't know if they have knives maybe i think maybe i have poisoned black knives oh [ __ ] sake um right let's go necklace you don't have a necklace okay all right that that makes sense i rolled the glory roll the glory but could not grab my hands on one i got a uh defense amulet right did you make that or did you get it as a drop i did ham chests and then enchanted okay okay dude i had this master plan of getting the gems from the wieldy chests and get my sharks do that but bro two hours yeah not possible no jobs the glory's not worth the sacrificing legs i'll be honest all i have is a weapon okay all right cool i've got um i'm gonna have a [ __ ] normal keep i just put it on i had to go i had to get to the world he had to go help my boy simon in the world like for me that's not even worth the walk up there link like i i i'm just so dead against it kill clan wars telling five minutes to kill fair enough but dude my plan i was working to the last second okay i will tell you i finished with 25 minutes left what the [ __ ] yeah well i just i had addy i just give mine daddy so i um i have these but you also didn't have chests i have these i wasted a lot of spins on there i think here here's my guess here's my guess here's my actually i actually [ __ ] up on that i had red dehyde vams but i spun it for forgot what it was but i couldn't get it in the time okay i can't even remember what i got but um i'm gonna guess you just you know mined the adi and then did ham chests you probably did hand chips chests not for the the necklace specifically but you probably mainly did it for money he's got he's got a dragon weapon he's got a dragon weapon i can feel it you fill in your fingers mate i'm a bit wonder what you've got i'm feeling well you have to know that my weapon can't be that expensive yes on everything else um but i would say i'm quite i'm i'm i'm happy i'm happy all right i'm happy um i think i think we're going down the route of kings wants me to share it first so i'll do it yes here we go right i knew it i i i had this i had this funny gut feeling um which i'm happy with but what the [ __ ] has he got like what would you say if i told you season two vibes see i don't know what that mean oh i don't know with with kevit bolts yup the long ones all right mate let's have a little trade i think this should be pretty straightforward but we'll see um i mean for me that's that oh what the [ __ ] has he got so i got 30 sharks burnt three right leaves me with 27 right which is what you see here i'm thinking like [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] hate my life don't have time

] chocolate slice or some [ __ ] [ __ ] cause i still would have taken it if i'm honest so it's pretty much a shark almost not quite but close enough close enough so i'm very content with it oh yeah all right all right let's go let's see who's gonna win this one i gotta and as always guys there is another episode over on raag's channel um we were locked in the fremnik area from scratch we had

cabinet balls did you get 42. i mean i would have wanted more but oh yes the it's just the max hits gonna let you down here mate i think your maxim must be what like a 16 17 oh no it's higher than
