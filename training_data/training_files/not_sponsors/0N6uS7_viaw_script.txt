hi it's me and today I'm gonna be talking about this wall painting this all in one place with Squarespace I've spoken about motivation before because I get lots of questions about it for the Q&A at the end of my studio vlogs namely how do I find motivation and how do I stay motivated last night I didn't feel motivated to paint at all but I wanted to make this video and I thought I should practice what I preach I've said this before when you're creative for a living it can be really difficult to be motivated all of the time and so you need to find discipline waiting to be motivated isn't enough you need to be able to learn how you can work even when you don't feel like doing it when you feel unmotivated it could be easy to assume that you have creative block and that other creative people are getting stuff done because they have some sort of untapped source of inspiration this isn't true at all dudes it's a really tempting thought to believe because it makes it easy to throw in the towel we all have ups and downs I have days where I feel terrible and then I have days where I feel really really motivated but I think it's the more experienced people that can find ways to work without initially feeling motivated so if you're feeling lazy or complacent you might find yourself wanting to procrastinate or do other things because you don't have a clear idea of what you want to achieve I found it really useful to figure that out even before picking up a paintbrush one way of doing this for me is to sketch in other context this made me creating you to-do lists with major to do's as well as bite-sized subtasks to make jumping into work as easy as possible so for example if your to-do is cleaning your studio or cleaning your space your subtasks could be clean your desk vacuum sort out paint brushes etc so you feel accomplished every time you finish a task and you feel like subtasks by subtlety and goal is becoming more and more clear and more and more achievable once the ball is rolling things should flow more easily and I repeat starting is the hardest part especially for me I guess what I mean is that it this is less about working when you feel unmotivated and more about not waiting for motivation to hear you sitting around and waiting to feel inspired is I'm sure something we've all experienced but unfortunately it's extremely inefficient it's about trying to manage a lack of motivation and finding the small things that will coach you into feeling motivated to start so that your tract later I'm not super happy with his pace there are definitely things I would have changed but it's these quick no-brainer paintings that remind me that if I will myself to work when I don't feel like it the work will still get done if you're on YouTube procrastinating right now I see I hold you accountable this is my way of saying just go do it do it I'll see you at the end of the video feel free to use this time to write a little to-do list so that you can get onto it with this video ends see you soon [Music] I hope he knows life as big as a little bit different to what I usually do but let me know what you think I'd like to do this on more topics so if you also have any suggestions for other topics please leave them below that would be cool usually it's G R bugs I kind of asked people if they have any questions for me that I can answer at the end but since this time I've already kind of said all I need to say on motivation I think it would be nice to hear from you guys so I tweeted out yesterday making your video on motivation instead of you asking me questions for the end I would love to hear from you what are your thoughts on the topic of motivation some pretty interesting answers actually so let's hear what some of you had to say about motivation I think the easiest way for me to become motivated is what I am motivated by fear and it works but I think there should be better ways um surprisingly I totally know what you mean I actually wrote a article about the fear of regret and how that kind of drives me forward I think that's a similar thing and I think it does work I think use whatever makes you motivated everyone is different so if that's how you work as long as it's not really destructive I think that's fine this one's great so my friend Jess basically she's like a letter I heard of house would be like one of my favorite couples to hang out with work and I love going to that place and hanging out so she says sometimes it's okay not to be motivated to that is so true like I think you need to I think being relaxed and taking time off is a Susu super super super super important part of the process so definitely make time to do nothing I totally get where jess is coming from like don't beat yourself up to the point where it's self-destructive because that's gonna be worse than forcing yourself to work so what else said I find it always hard to find motivation but I have a few tips wanna be ready make it easy have everything set up your motivation should be used to do stuff create not tidy your desk or setting things up otherwise you're tired and do motivating for you but start to make small steps but do something don't everything can make a prototype a first version it won't be perfect but in addition to give give a first feedback it will give you motivation because you've achieved something you were rewarded get extra motivation to continue yeah I definitely agree with those things especially the first one I think as soon as you feel motivated works right away I need to be better at having a tidy workspace with the reason that that's good is so that you can get straight into it you don't have to clear a space first another thing is not feeling like you have to have a final piece produced first I would start with sketches because of reason why I do that is because it's the fastest way to get my ideas down onto paper and once you do that it kind of like keeps the creativity flowing I agree with both of those things I think motivation comes to a place of passion and setting goals that are big but achievable for you and your state of mind at that moment that's definitely true to understanding what you're capable of if that day you have PMS you're craps you don't have any time you have family obligations don't make your to-do list so large that it becomes so overwhelming and you feel like you can't finish it because that's gonna make you feel defeated even before you start I would suggest having a large to-do list where you write everything you could possibly think of that you need to get done and then have a smaller to-do list where you have like your top three most important things to get done so that you're not overwhelmed by the amount of tasks that you have at hand writing down your goals for the future but also reflecting back on your achievements sort of help keep the motivation alive and allows you to see that you are too stagnant in processes you think you are that is so true I think but I need to do better at this too like as soon as I take off a project or goal and on to the next thing next next thing like I don't even feel like I fully understand that I've published a book and it's in bookstores across Australia and some in New Zealand like I need to be more reflective of minor successes so you need to be is supportive and positive to yourself as you are with other people because I think we forget to do that all the time and that can be really too motivating too real forget motivation inspiration there fo are the friends just make work even if you don't feel like it if you'll put in eight hours a day for a bus but not for your own work that are only cheating yourself take away the mysticism log the hours anyone can do it it's so true even if like you have zero tiny and you put like one or two hours a week and you eventually will have a hundred hours of work into place and then 1,000 hours of work into place and you will have improved you will see an improvement for sure this one I like making a comfortable environment tea favorite podcast on either good hearty breakfast helps to set me in the right mindset for concentration and focus it's hard to find motivation when my house is messy there's a ton of other things on my mind but I totally agreed that I can still work on my house is messy Rockets the opposite he could not work when there's something that's messy in the house whatever you creature comforts are a nice smelling candle cover tea a coffee a podcast music anything that makes you feel comfortable I think it will help you work I have a studio playlist that's filled with like guilty pleasures and things that really really pumped me out no matter what like it really really helps me get in the mood to work so it's about creating the right environment so that when you're ready to work you can get straight into it no excuses I like that one person said I guess the usual is that sometimes we all think we're not good enough but lately I've been thinking about like do does my work even have meaning or doesn't matter and it's messing me up I think that's another another example of not putting too much pressure on yourself I see a lot of people on YouTube especially they do fully-fledged artworks in their sketchbook do that my sketchbooks are like the most raw gross like messy thing you've ever seen so I think that you need to to make sure you know that that's not what schedules originally for I feel like they were for working through ideas and kind of getting initial ideas down not worry too much about who's gonna see it because I feel like the sketchbook at least for me is a very private thing I don't feel like what I'm drawing at them anyone will see them so I think you need to take the pressure off yourself and realize that you don't need to show anyone anything unless you want to so that you have a safe space for yourself to feel completely free to make the work that you want to make an experiment and not be so afraid to fail my website motivates me to do work I enjoy displaying my work on there so much that it motivates me to do more work purely so I can put it on there um can I have some of whatever you're eating website stuff scares me sometimes it's not that it's hard to put up it's that it's hard for me to be happy with my work enough to share it especially after a week but I'm really happy that that's like that for you I think what I agree with is that it's about finding the thing that motivates you so whether it be the fact that you can share it Instagram share it online whether it be you're sharing in your portfolio building your skillset Bonior but follow whether it be the therapy that it gives you making the stuff find whatever you find most important keep that goal in mind for when you're making something it should really push you through the motivation is discipline there will definitely be days maybe even weeks and months well you have no motivation to work who knows getting into gear producing results might actually result in your best work it's true a good example of this for me as I was doing this painting I'll put it here basically halfway through I was kind of like oh I don't think this is gonna be good I was about to literally tear it up and throw it away but I thought no I'll push through it and even if it doesn't work out I don't have to show it to anyone and I finished it put it online because I was happy with it and it completely blew up on top law on Instagram like maybe you judge yourself could be completely different to how everyone else sees your work so while you have to be happy with the work that you're putting out and make sure that you have like a level of consistency it helps not to be so strict with yourself and not to be so down on the stuff that you create a quick to-do list before work always helps me I bread everything into small achievable tasks and draw a box next to each item when I drew the thing I get to check the box and I like ticking boxes I can also see everything I've done and I have a clear plan for what to do next to be honest I mostly do this one are about 3/4 away through a project I often lose some motivation at this point a two-minute brainstorm of remaining tasks and a written to-do list is my roadmap to finishing the project and knowing that it actually is finished mm-hm this is exactly what I do for me it's more like halfway I get really down I'm just like this is not gonna end well I'm just like I hate this but it's exactly right it gives you kind of an idea where you need to go and show you everything that you actually have achieved even if you sometimes I write things on to do this that I've already done just so I can cross them off it's just so satisfying this one's good too I think it's a good mentality to understand that all living things have on and off periods flowers diagram back animals hibernate etc humans are expected to be go-go-go all year round and it's not fair on your body and my motivation will come back naturally I definitely agree that you have to take down time but I also believe in the importance of like not waiting for motivation as I said before really just depends on what works for you I wanted to focus on like more than my perspective because I'd like these based videos to be kind of a discussion and my opinion will never be the only right way to do stuff everyone's different so I think it was really important for me to reach out to you guys um I hope you liked this video please let me know what you think wherever you want to I just wanted to so it's a win-win like no strings attached jeffers give it a go thanks for watching up into this point I just didn't know if anyone would watch it all the way but if you did thank you um yeah I'll see you soon with another studio blah blah [Music]
