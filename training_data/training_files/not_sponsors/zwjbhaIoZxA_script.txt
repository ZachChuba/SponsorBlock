so here to show he's welcome back to another episode of Minecraft but all the crafting recipes are randomized because we thought we'd get a little variety loop drops are randomized so this time let's beat the ender dragon with random drops so very very important very important look at your upper right when you get new blocks because you never know when the eye of ender is gonna show up and if you missed that and it's from like a crafting table or and sorry if it's in like a stone cutter or something you may never see it again and it will be forever lost weight so when you pick up a new item it says oh look you have new things new recipes right so new recipes unlocked this makes prismarine stairs I just unlocked a lot of things from this boy right here views from that boy from the old grave from from getting wool nice nice what you get what you get a lot of new recipes unlocked and it seems to be like several different types of stairs so the thing is about random recipes is there is a chance that we need to go to a village in order to be able to craft anything ever it's the only downside yeah is it is it like different woods do different things or is that not know actually I got great recipes so you just want to make sure that you're always looking and you're in your upper corner cow yeah you you asked for that okay stop get it is tipping in my way always be looking and also very useful items dyes dyes are very useful because they have a lot of Associated recipes so it will enable you so if you have the ability to make a die make I do basically so pink die alright - pink if you tip so you want to get more birch and then you be able to make the other kind there is you're like birds please yes and then it will do that and then do it do I need my my notepad open no you actually don't on this because of the fact that you have your crafting guide so magenta died there we go that unlocks is it eye of ender like eventually your hope is that you're able to craft I have ender because obviously it doesn't matter here if we find blaze men Enderman when we combine blade blaze and ender pearl it's not gonna give us an eye of ender so we we have to be mindful of that but I kind of goal number one should be to find a village cuz the odds of us actually unlocking the crafting table recipe early on are kind of small so yeah you just want to we want to keep walking around punch anything that unlocks new recipes like that can't Expo keep paying attention to the upper right while you do it and then yeah just that's that's the idea is you want to hopefully find that recipe into that recipe and punch and grass will do nothing for you because it's not random loot drops it gave me seeds okay cool I'm so the wait do I not do know what no why are you that was okay he's he's gone now folks kick Hayes he's in trouble it's fine don't worry about it the dogs are bad dogs are mad the dogs seem mad so you don't punch the dogs is that what you're saying no dogs are dogs or one that's not gonna help you out mmm-hmm okay well good to know yeah I will my help yeah they're still they're still upset they're okay I have exceed you and then the thing is if you can craft something that leads to other things of the die is one but any other like basic resource that you can craft correctly turns out the pumpkin turns into diorite which then turns into many other things okay and the other thing is even if you find what get oh wait hey dude we gotta get apply here I've got some cake nice I could use some food because I'm down to like two hearts lily-of-the-valley boys okay I mean the thing is like you can also just punch but the problem is you can't get cooked food very easily because we need something in a furnace it yields not that so what are you doing bro I walked off an edge okay don't worry about it Oh plays one says a thing you still do you ask him for a friend do you still have more cake nobody's Lea there you go lily of the valley so it's not the most common thing okay it's coming after you eat it it's coming after you yields she died in a smoker let's see who else would that'll be a thing dude that would be a thing yeah you got gravel you said yes I don't think you can punch sands don't can you what is this I literally just went up the dirt and was like what is this but it turns out a sister what are dirt good I mean it actually does have a crash or else be a sociopathic bad dog pond soul is an Associated crafty recipe so you would unlock something for it we can make a boat though apparently okay that's good which would be a great I though we do not have access to grade I I don't think nobody don't [Music] berries though are a thing nighttime yeah we don't did you did you get some spruce or oh oh if we if we hit a I did get spruce if we get a squid then we can make beds okay so let's see well there was there was a fair amount of ocean just over the way yeah I'm going back to the ocean area barracks worthless and yet so useful wait at the moment nothing acting table yellow a nice car oh it's a hole underwater ravine over here that's wild that's wild no squid spell really not exist much hello what this is things are looking grim for our hero okay i certain mistakes have been made okay Oh get me black dye that's a good point shoot but it will get me an insect which yields another recipe so oh you you got something with your fist okay it's very impressive what you've managed to accomplish here I am in a cave that is spawning zombies and they're coming at me one at a time and I'm able to kill them and then have to immediately start killing the next one I have two hearts okay number 2 is here all right now I'm doing with two zombies the wolf is outside and I have no food and it's fine it's fine sounds like a situation I can't help with too terribly so I am gonna go near the spawn again and I'll meet me there when you get rekt wow wow the faith wait a minute turtle master dude turtle man oh shoot dude I think I need a uh-oh hey sugar cane gives just straight-up cooked chicken that's pretty good and also that's actually really nice I think the payment sounds nice about now paper recipe that gives us the turtle master helmet so we can breathe underwater that's that's that's exciting Dawg forgave me alright bud give me give me all your money right that black wolf that's I was saying give me all your money from rifle out okay see you alive I did not die I've killed multiple zombies survive the dog horde made my way out of the cave and I'm at the ocean by where we fell in okay I'll head back there it's very impressive tale of survival my man I know I mean I worked at it you know it didn't come easy there you are I I survived off berries and rotten flesh I've been very mountaineer yo oh oh that sounds nice hey and I've got more than two hearts now so the problem is we can't replant sugarcane I guess we could just not break it all the way why can't you revive sugar because you don't get sugarcane bro maybe you do you're in the wrong mindset it's hot I know it's really it's really I'm having a hard time adjusting to that this is your you're much more adept at me and I'm still figuring this out okay so Sam's making me break in place anything not a big deal here it's the cracking recipes that are messed all right right I need it I need to try and get it it's I'm really having a hard time with this I'm sorry it's my first time you know be gentle huh oh it's spider boy no no no no Spidey boy I have what it takes for that I have what it takes I'm gonna try to hammer wood okay I want to try to get this spider because string actually unlocks a fair amount of stuff okay spider really you're gonna you're gonna do that that's what you're gonna do careful over there there's a cave you compelled it hold on there we go yeah he didn't drop string what a day Wow Oh Frick dude Wow I've killed multiple of those and never took a hit and you got hit wait you never took a hit what I love a dude I never got hit by the zombies no liar yeah yes simultaneously slaying spiders and zombies mr. arrogant face who almost died but didn't the key point there is we need to keep going try to find a village that I'm following you okay okay bye zombie that's cuz I was eatin though umm I'm right behind you right behind good good we are finding a village it's gotta be the goal the villages are the saving grace of random crafting also beds are the saving grace but we don't have that yet I mean I have a couple of beds I don't know they're heavy you can make a make can't make them we got the wool but we don't have the dye it's the way that it chooses to like reveal the crafting recipes is kind of strange like sometimes it shows it even if you've not actually gotten everything that's required and sometimes it won't show it unless you've got everything required you good at the following oh but that's okay I'm getting shot at by a skeleton in the creeper so is the creeper is shooting at me it's it's a very intense thing I'm assuming you're going in the general direction you've been going I am headed sort of northeast currently at 3:18 negative 127 I am as a gray sheep just parallel love you down to the side because I am three to find the side sick okay 350 negative 60 and I'm gonna negative 80 I'm moving in that direction okay so I'm at 360 heading for negative 120 I don't the same all right I see you okay you can't punch coal- I don't actually see you - no you're a pair gotcha tools would be great they would they would that's why we need to find a village because it unlocks a great deal more crafting recipes um that's a creepy mmm that's a spider skele bro whoa in the water that's cool that was fortuitous Wow such luck ow skeletons freaking Legolas yeah they can it be like it do sometimes hey there's a pig we haven't killed a pig right no we haven't just waiting sanitized out wait a second oh I killed him hey hey Pig goat me some bacon take a swig swig swig swig got it that allows us to furnace a furnace in case you were curious did you know that if you puts pig in a furnace you'll get a furnace interesting yeah how um would you die already shall we Friday night okay just two other results fine you need some more chicken if you have more chicken than absolutely okay I can help you with this Oh creepy boy nice care that zombie you'll kill me if he hits me do it hey it's a squiddy boy over here dude let's let's get him I'd be super savvy yes I have to like swim through the ocean to find a village seems like there's oceans a lot of lot of places here we're seeing a lot of ocean going on right now several squids out here in this ocean red carpet dope I'm going I'm moseying along towards the sugar cane over there in the other it's to the north-northeast if you just follow the sandy coastline yeah see ya see ya north-northeast - that sugar cane oh that's way over there if there's a lot of it but there is a lot of it and that's it that's that the chicken that's how you get the chicken yep which is very important in my survival actually mm-hmm I live it because of chicken all right spider bro I need you to chill frick frick get the Frick back dude oh dude he can't touch this he can't okay you touch this he touched it oh that's good that's good I've got many different things um can you pass them to me yeah I don't know if you got diorite you got an eating sec oh there's the string wow that's a lot of stuff holy crab you probably didn't think of a mushroom I did actually okay there was no eye of ender anywhere there how do you get the dye right uh the diorite was crafted out of something oh god was I pick up a pumpkin and the pumpkin turned into a dye right okay let's see are there any resources that we can currently make that would unlock a great deal more resources upon creation is the question polished granite that could be a thing dynamo boots so you said can you can you get a furnace we then put like wood into it or make charge if you get a furnace yes you can put stuff in it oh you guys all right you needed a furnace with the pig in order to get the honest did you know that if you combine light gray wool with white wool you get white wool okay all right make sense mm-hmm it's pretty good I think I still had the wrong mindset so I broke some sugar cane and I was like I thought this made chicken all I got was sugar cane out of it and do anything but I get it I get it I'm learning birch stairs and like things and break a lot of things I don't think much would unlock anything there Dimond ho I think required a workbench everybody where have you gone - I'm just continuing East I am along the shore but some ways east of you okay god there's so much ocean hmm looking over you I am seeing you you want a little man below me yeah whatever that's my life sorry man I did you know I wasn't trying to imply anything but sensitivities being with you know sensitivities not to high dude um they're probably more inland than outlet yeah Outland Outland huh hey you know what's the opposite of inland right uh oh Lily LaValley with a cake okay Oh brah brah we got pillager raid party I don't think we're equipped even though I were a DB but I don't think I was like yeah I'll be right oh no Kane I'm not coming over there where are you at where have you gone I'm on a tree I went slightly inland from where you were okay there's just no I see a pillager an imager villagers no it has no chillage er I see you okay yeah we should we should just could we run like we're on a big island basically it was like hey hey I don't know right so far we've been having great luck with this role I would I mean after the after the wither in in an episode it was it was bound to take a little work this is a different ballgame though random crafting I think is more difficult apparently you need a shovel to get snow just remind yourself yes you double checking we got llama boys over here do it okay I see the llamas I don't see ya wow you like bolted on through I went over the mountain and you oh yeah I was a shorter area it's gonna be alright well give me one sec I'm gonna do a little quick mute ski-doo to lover Trevor the land you know alright alright hey what is everything thank you for the sub as well as AC Duke thank you for the sub also if you are new if you happen to be new and invested in figuring out what we need to get in order to craft eye on eye of ender feel free to follow the stream that way you'll be notified when I stream again and you'll because this is probably not going to finish with us getting the Enderdragon in one episode so you'll definitely want to keep following and also if you're watching on YouTube twitch TV slash CaptainSparklez where these are streamed live if you do want to catch it live in real time and participate in the chat and do all that good stuff as we hopefully find a village somewhere along this place that doesn't seem to have much villages so yeah anyway and now back to our regularly scheduled programming sup dog then he makes it to where I did all the things are different crafting and I just died my brain out hi how you doing my brain l my brain oh there's uh there's some sugarcane down here just gonna snag that real quick yeah sugarcane is a good boy what is force and make I have to sand okay there's a creeper over there be careful yah yah yah yah yah yah yah yah all right I went down a ravine just to the side looking kind of in that same the same ravine of you adjust the upper ways hmm I don't know where the same ravine just up aways is but it's okay so you realize you oh you didn't mean ravine you meant that riverbed okay fine it's still a ravine technically you know yeah but a ravine is a Minecraft it's very specific I was not thinking about Minecraft I was just giving you the lay of the land uh-huh no I get it let's get more inks wow this thing just bolted dude this thing just bolted like revenge didn't something okay I get another quartz and TNT yeah he did not give me that oh good scaffolding yeah yeah oh I had that for a little bit maybe we should punch a fish I did punch fish that's what I got oh that's we got skeleton from huh yeah no no I got scaffolding from the force and but I got another quartz from punching the fish oh okay okay I see it I see it oh my god dude we need a village it's ridiculous you know villages were around for a long time before I ever saw my first one like it I remember like having to go and traverse the world it's a great length to try and find my very very first village ever really um yeah and then then I proceeded to take and and haul a villager back to my place or two of them and stick them in little 2x3 huts like mass housing and try and get them all to really to look at each other in that special sort of way so he is the deep end the first time you encountered villagers no no no this is long okay it just sounds a lot like the deep end I mean oh this is the first time I've run into one of these in the wild dude oh yeah you never seen this boy I found one of these on okay but it's badly they're upset at us already there yeah no no nope nope Wow and they have enchanted stuff - that's yeah okay we're gonna have a lot of things that we can go do there but you're still being chased okay get the pumpkin gonna do that that gets us a crossbow which you've discovered earlier but that would be quite quite nice if we can and that's all right you know which we could then try and make boat it's it's a it's an alive alright okay okay well that's cool but I'm gonna take this sugar cane and oh wait wait wait I thought this man's oh he is chasing you why is he still here like don't know he's got some aggro range boys oh shoot I forgot to track the coordinates 501 363 ish and then head and then head north this day yeah he really wants you super badly he's like he's like give a Shh please okay I'm really I'm impressed by the fact that we were able to find a pillager outpost which I've actually never found in just a regular survival world before we found a village and we also found ice dude look at that that's a pretty cool leg little ice tunnel right over there you see that you sound unamused Wow okay I just impersonating year doesn't nice can't you break ice with punchy's yeah with a silk touch nuts yeah I don't I mean a silk touch punch doesn't seem right no it's not a thing it's definitely not nuts indeed okay it took me a long time in the Skybound series for me to comprehend the lava flowing onto water makes stone versus water flowing on the lava makes cobblestone that was that was a tough one for me what do you mean lava flowing onto water makes stone where water flowing on the lava makes cobblestone are the lava makes stone water flowing onto lava makes cobblestone lava flowing onto water if lava flows down onto water then it makes regular stone not cobblestone if water flows on to lava then it makes cobblestone okay I realize that I thought it was just obsidian no that's okay the first offer time out flows so we're not talking outsource blocks oh okay got it this is all flowy blows and and that's that's how our stone generator in sky bounds were it's okay it's lava flowing under water source blocks oh is that yeah yeah okay okay I was like you're saying the same thing this is we know I'm saying it different just not right oh you're new flowers boys this is good this is it and another nighttime this is bad Oh Stone sword Oh that'd be good cornflower two stone sword you know how we do owe some amount of Defense yep that's good times as many times a day how this that's not at that I thought was a sugar cane this is a sure the game that was don't worry you check it out I creepy creepy on the left okay we got more flower boys that gets us some orange wool wowie Bo actually is good it's just you I'm locking all the fences there's more ice on the right as well as the left we're surrounded by ice so and water if I do that paper coming out yeah yep I can unlock it up a dye dyes are the key to success ow no no no out you know I'm along another die cool that's that's RI skeleton don't drop neither a bone nor a bone or anything else they're kind of bad rabbit okay not a great deal it's not a significant significant that I had a zombie villager spawned by me is it no it's not I mean I was hopeful but I didn't think so but I also would you add all this stuff in and then I realized I don't know how minecraft works that's fine dude it's just whatever is gonna do a new drop that actually yields like new recipes that's what we care about and also a gunpowder would do that so I recommend if we can get a creeper stop being an idiot creeper whoa yeah hey okay what you get whoa dude so creeper a gunpowder is what I don't know I think you gunpowder oh it's a poet it's bone a bone oh nice bone goes to helmet that's sick dude I'm getting to do horses have specific drops I just leather I think sometimes so no not really good right there that's a good discovery I killed the skeleton and I got a helmet mm-hm there's a skeleton over here I gotta say it's a one time cool thing because after that it's can't do much with that okay but you can the cool thing is if we can find a source of emeralds then trading with villagers is a very very good way to gear up where'd you get to I am on the beach by where we were fighting the Horde or near the horses heading I believe West there you are okay well um everything is an island can we make any boats right now I can make a boat okay well that significantly increases our ability to travel and I can make another boat there you are you get a boat and you get about what thank you good times good times well let's hope that maybe this is land and not just this looks like it might actually be another landmass not just an island I'm gonna go snag myself some of this what should we call it oh yeah and also we should see we can get a gunpowder because that is another crafter recipe okay all right there's a guy right there if he's ready for you oh I see this boys there's two of them I see the man's what an idiot what this stupid boat this stupid boat though dude freaking boat it's always the boats fault never was in this case yes never the boat E is that like a new kind of goatee yeah your goatee and tie into a bow you might you know want to keep your boat yeah yeah yeah okay just making sure that's this I was checking I was checking in I was seeing surveilling and I don't know if you have peonies yet or whatever oh yes I did at all pink with the dip toppings are here you go if you want it I hadn't look I've unlocked things there's these ones over here do the other pink ones that's blaze powder what have been really cool if blaze powder was worth anything you never know I mean actually blaze powder I think can contribute to other recipes so blaze powder goes to rabbits and grab a yellow car you does it just wait no that must be another recipe that cooked rabbit yeah well even the recipe ayah vendor recipe is graphic tracks that's viable that's viable fair well it was fun while it lasted well I have no chill did you remember your boat of course I remembered my boat it was about yay high by yay high I left it back there cool um good okay all right good dude I was about to say that's that's a lack of a preciate right there for the thing that I created just for you yeah i pre she ate it and so I kept it with me forever never never so if you want to get the Gunpowder though you're gonna need to get the gunpowder heaven treats and anti sights lab it's not very exciting unfortunately oh yeah uh yep it's nope we don't have to do that we don't have to do that oh look it's more ocean welcome to the world of Islands dude it's Waterworld Kevin Costner he's gonna show up at any moment Waterworld had no land okay Waterworld in development he had the gills and he could swim down and get landed land was really valuable uh-huh okay I don't like this lunch yeah we should I should just keep on keep on rolling eventually we will find a village it will be though yeah it has to happen the doubts are increasing so you ever think about how skeletons just naturally have infinity on anybody pick up yeah I do it's not fair yeah but then again I guess that's small consolation prize for being a skeleton Skippy not being able to walk around in the daylight daytime is usually a nice time there's a drought here uh you could unof live it but I don't think it'll yield any new recipes what if it dropped a gold nugget sir and could have it's true that is true it didn't it didn't happen he didn't do that mm sometimes it'd be like that but it do no okay nice dude you go for the big jump and then you land on that corner and then you hurt your ankle you hurt your linkle he tripped over the tongue a little bit there and I was like he didn't notice he didn't notice he didn't notice oh he noticed he knows ways viruses all right very good Mr Bond uh we can look to see if there's any eggs that have dropped from these chickens that's a point get that cake recipe they do not see any I just don't understand how there's such a lack of villages man there are a lack of villages the only other biome that would have new things is like dark oak and because otherwise like even if we get into a Mesa which is very helpful for random crafting we don't have pickaxe so kind of need that kinda need that if we could find an emerald supply it would be great you still following me I in the generalist direction ish I don't know where you Irish I went I was going to the west I'm negative 279 1308 I I see another pillar tower make it to 79 13:03 where are you hold on I am coming to you there you go there you gar I see [Music] pillager to the weave oh my god we have found two pillager towers before a village what the heck I do have a sword I was punching with my fist I'm a smart boy don't worry about it I just figured I'd have a challenge everybody I just realized because I'm in the bad line client I have the emotes I will not be able to see that sadly it'll be a rare and this out you're missing out on the infinite dab uh-huh break the planks in the outpost I would totally do that if also we wouldn't just get rekt okay a cake plant I mean you run around in circles okay and gather them all up and I'll run in and grab the planks um except they keep spawning yeah I mean that's why you have to keep running around uh-huh I mean you know I evaded them before and it's not my fault you didn't grab planks while you were there oh six apples from trees that's a good call actually if we can just get a get all the wood removed oh yeah that sounds like fun punching down a tree yeah do you want splinters that's it sticks are actually the source of many many recipes so I think that's worth doing it's true true or just punch leaves that is another option we won't get apples from this one but we could get a stick there we go stick what do you get what do you get there you go stick for you um a lot actually not nearly as much as I thought whoa and crystal comes from a stick what yeah we just need a dated crafting table wise ways my not I don't know it should have cycled in the upper right hand corner hmm hmm Yello oh hey how do I get that now I can't I can't but stone axe would have been nice this isn't Oh interesting this is not showing everything this help with anything right now purple stained glass doesn't help with anything cool all right well village quest continues okay you're over here I'm only seeing two by two oh yeah that's the problem is if it shows up in the upper right as crafting table but you don't have access it means it needs a three by three boxes I have never seen boxes before it now I really yeah there's boxes they're pretty cool bro I don't even understand how we can come across two pillagers and still no village and we're at the ocean now oh my god I can't even it has to do with the spawn percentages and chances does it now yep maybe on the feather from a chicken no no okay yes yes I see a feather it's it's I have a feather in my all right got it well let's go for another boat ride wait does getting a different color wool change things yes it does cause they okay which color oh I've gotten black okay oh it's a village and to think I was about ready to go for a boat ride I told you there's one right over here you know you didn't it's true I didn't all right fingers crossed we got beds which we can't sleep in until nighttime and we have engines fire and I have a workbench over here oh we got a workbench so wait can i I can pick it up right and there's nothing a problem with that mm-hmm okay carry a work lunch with you it's good time sometimes all around hey pillager boy if we can figure out how to make a lectern then that is real big plays real big plays there's au iron pickaxes dire right diamond hoe is polish granite and crystals are a wooden sword okay oh look at all the extra stuffs in here now oh yeah it's a lot it's a lot brighter so there's a lot Oh turtle master helmet bro easy hey good for the swimming in Ross pose of pumpkin pie yeah so we need an iron pickaxe so how did you get hold of the diorite is the question we need to get we need to lure a creeper in try some guy right tulips oh is it or that goes to polished diorite how did I get the original oh it's by a pumpkin to die a pumpkin and I'm literally standing okay these are Jacqueline who's actually think I don't know if I can hang with him okay so yeah don't mind us don't mind us don't mind I write within crystal we don't have access to any regular wood is the problem oh wait we do oh yeah I can just I just get the regular oh my god dude stupid iron golem keeps uh oh my god bro okay why didn't I mind would be free that was dumb all right there we go he just unlocks a whole bunch of new stuff I would need to mine it what what are you doing oooh hey you can make a stick with an inverse stick the stick recipe is just sideways wait crafting table is available is it let's see whoa you make a crafting a crafting table is for dark oak flat wait crafting tables just wood oh right that is no no no no I forgot this is actually a thing for some reason the random crafting recipe thing it always makes it so that the crafting table recipe is just wood and I don't know why that is there's something about stealing hard how the screaming yeah it might be but anyway and cristal yeah I think so there's pumpkin right yeah okay anyway so yeah let me do this let me do this okay iron pickaxe boyos that's how we do that's how we do right how did you get the iron pickaxe guy right stairs diorite stairs then I have pumpkins that I can turn into by right I don't have that many pumpkins though stairs is what 500 something just unlocked diamond pickaxe and diamond sword what was it I it was cobblestone but something made from cobblestone I it was cycling through really quickly well here's the crafting table right here okay let me see oh oh my god it seats so good oh it's so good oh it's so good oh my goodness get you get you some cobblestone get you some savile stone dude this poor guys like my house my house oh that's what I'm talking about the strangers showed up and that was my house yeah we're terrible people oh right spruce let's get a couple more useful anchor all right nice okay so diamond pickaxe is easy enough and then the diamond sword is a lot of cobblestone alright only we could make an axe it would be a lot easier to you know break the crafting table and stuff there we go but we didn't we just don't have the purple by Stone sword makes you a diamond pickaxe very nice what yeah Stone sword makes it damage shaking X dude oh I got you that is a gold chest plates and other dies rosebush makes a book and quill which doesn't get you anything oh yeah I've had that for a little while golden chest plate is from Moss stone that's a little ways away I mean there's milestone in the village no no no it's the crafting recipe for mossy cobble oh yeah what else Oh is there a stone cutter cuz stone cutter would be big couples there's a grain stone I don't know there's a stone the stone cutter is slightly more significant yes there is a stone there is I think is that a stone cutter yes oh it didn't reveal anything for me though stone cutter yeah yeah the stone Kyle self doesn't you can put stone into the stone cutter and it has a bunch of different recipes that is sick that was like the first village that I went into or it took like a bunch of villages for me to get a stone cutter the first time I did this so yeah nice nice dude diamond I think you can do we can do diamond hoe though as well light blue Oh interesting an observer block purpura pillar so yeah if you can make anything that I want super crafting recipes then you should do that so yeah I don't necessarily know what does and doesn't unlock recipes you're better at that than me so yellow wool would be a thing coal yellow dye is good yellow dye is good that's gonna unlock a lot of stuff beacon okay makeup you've always wanted one yeah it is yellow dye with glass panes last panes we don't know how to make though so that won't help us but basically if we go into the end of the world and just mine different blocks now then those will be helpful to us all right that will increase our knowledge of things yeah so I'd say let's mine like more but okay yeah cold skull is a good one coals are good you went to the water yeah yeah apparently I had coal Oh what I don't know what they'd unlock anything hmm oh right this is oh god this is 114 or 113 mechanics I like I like briefly surface then dope back down and that's not how that works anymore alright here's some iron yeah what the site a stone cutter is gold it's a lot of stuff okay hmm okay fine wait iron ore itself I probably doesn't unlock anything I'd unlock cobblestone stairs so it's not a big deal but andesite unlocks gold and gold will unlock mini crafting recipes gold unlock to bow it's too bad we didn't find a blacksmith here for a furnace oh yeah but there is a blast furnace baby hmm okay so gold Oh what you get what you get hmm interesting oh ah we can you bows we don't get can't get arrows though shoot I guess we you just do monetize skeletons what else would unlock a recipe I swear to God my recipes aren't working right I'm picking up stuff and I'm like that should unlock things than it doesn't like I've never held a potato before oh there it goes I'm just gonna do that and I'm gonna make a bow even though I can't do anything with it for now cool cool yeah it's very cool it's the coolest of cools out like a hopper minecart there's also if you want to be able to breathe underwater you can make a turtle helmet with a paper recipe it's very easy good how you might find it good and good no I just me over here without my stone trying to find granite perhaps somewhere I found emeralds which you can craft with wheat redstone redstone would unlock a lot right yeah pretty smell yeah they scream but I need a lot of spruce planks for it so your your your house oh diamond pantaloons you got diamond panel loans dude good what is it what is it give me give me the solution it's not part of the solution it's part of the precipitate oh there we go easy I don't even know what recipe that is but it gives us diamond pants we need six Granite's and we will be out here oh that unlock a lot of stuff when you get ender what did we need the eye of ender uh what is it what is it is the eye of ender oh that's pretty much impossible it's any planks with redstone in the middle what any planks with redstone in the middle Vegas is oh it's a freakin no clock bro it's a note block oh my god it's so easy we just need to mine villages them it's friggin good oh my god poor villager unless there's any wood that we can't currently craft a wood but as far as I know there's no I mean it's um pantaloons and we just mined villages with our fists because we don't actually have access to anything else will you get me pants yes I will thank you we don't actually have access to making any wood but you know it's gonna be fine holy crap that is insane that we've managed to get that ace Apple a Vegas first try is that the first try yeah it is I thought to myself I said self it might be good to get that redstone yeah wow that's easy Wow I mean actually wait what turtle I'll make turtle master you're supposed to hold my breath for a long time you idiot I mean it's not like indefinite turtle master let me down dude oh yeah I'm just it's tearing I'm just to the side of you steel tearing apart this poor dude's house just just tearing apart this poor dude's house that's actually some stack do they you're facing me now you're looking to the left turn around turn around right now you're looking at me so here's the thing yeah you're invisible no I'm right oh oh there Oh way over there I see okay gotcha I thought like when you were saying you're looking at me I was like oh really am I just am i next to him alright so let's get into some of that let's get some of that woody it's a portrait these portentous wood so we need to make um you know ideally like fourteen of these which means that we need to get about a hundred and thirty one that's a lot of no no no no hundred wait no no no no no no no no no we don't need to do that fourteen times eight not not nine if we found lapiz we'd be in a good shape when we heard his lap he's not crafting to die no yeah that lap ease is its own dice so no lap ease crafts into blue die it's different no man hey do we have an axe recipe let me just see if we have it that's what I was looking forward cuz an axe needs purple dye Oh does it does it does it let me see and isn't that isn't that good old wooden axe yeah I haven't had a craft purple dye oh no we don't we've made magenta dye in pink dye that's it been down that road I bend it I've felt this disappointment what it's done accents don't cut it bro I don't know accent stone cutter could be a whole plethora of different options that unfortunately you can't track because stone cutter doesn't give a grid doesn't give recipes yeah it's the worst that's dire right that's gravel andesite oh it's dire right is it died right okay all right all right andesite one lock some stuff if you hadn't done andesite I had done an insight in the stone cutter yeah it does gold dodges do gold thank you everyone for having fantastic memories hey stone axe wait with die right in there getting mm-hmm and we got died right to the pumpkins I knew you he just mine died right oh yeah yeah it's true you can just mine it yeah you see units go get find a pumpkin oh that unlocked a lot of stuff too what's that I'm gonna pick out that backup uh sandstone oh cool Psalm stump a stone axe okay the stone axe is will will be helpful in yeah I think so I would agree yes don't ask pretty cool dude in in the treetop äj-- mmm-hmm or the plank chop which I guess because we're only taking planks right yeah just feels that much worse because it's like we don't tear down your house we just put it just got incident every in every spot possible you know it's no big deal is no big deal NBD this guy's like hey that was my stage and I was like yeah though it is like hmm all right bread iron nuggets might be a thing yeah you get anything new they're a large firm as opposed to those small friends hey we got a wandering traitor if only we had any emeralds to trade him with actually - but I do have three emeralds now we don't there's no need there's no need no always don't waste your emerald brah this is quite the setup this villagers set up pick up sandstone for diamonds are we're sandstone part of diamond yeah yeah Oh true but I didn't get around to converting it to diamonds but I did get chisel or Sam stones for diamonds and then I was like that's not gonna be useful cuz no the grass the peas will make sense but now I think about iron chestplate in a stone cutter as well as diamonds is whole thing wait at least it died so diamond is just for Sam stone huh okay well that unlocks a whole bunch of new recipes that are worth yeah that's gone out that's what I was thinking so and also get that really easy oh wait now oh no a year now boys okay so sandstone you just got it in the ocean I'm assuming yeah I just got some so here is a diamond it haven't marked many things Diamond unlocked diamond but what I just saw a diamond flip up Liz hey did you want diamond because you can get diamond from a diamond that's good yes four diamonds will give you nine diamonds diamond boots will give you nine diamonds so it's a diamond block diamond boots haha that's convenient that's amazing if only we if only we could trade diamonds with villagers man oh I've been great dude oh yeah comes the sand I've been avoiding that oh gosh darn it it's okay I've got you you know I play enough on the older version so you it's just hard to get used to the wow the whole no instant rebirth situation yeah no I I know what you mean how many diamonds have you got I mean once you have four I've infinite so yeah I have three I didn't know how many you have oh I have one okay but I have ten sandstone but yeah if you've got three then you know that's all we need Oh wrote here we go boys let's download nice into all the diamonds yeah dude do you got nine we got another nine and we got another nine let's make more all the diamond boots in the world more diamonds we're down a bit more diamond boots this is uh this is good this is good this is definitely good alright it's um it's going exponential very quickly here yeah yeah did you I mean can we you what else can we use those to make though I don't know hopefully something hopefully something we can get beetroot soup out of that sandstone as well so keep that in mind all right what do we got hey never mind that was already done I got excited over nothing Gold knives are those worth anything I don't know I don't think so I mean yeah because you can make you can turn that and I guess you can't turn it into a Oh green dye green dyes a big boy Green Day's a big boy we didn't end so offenses diamond axe melons can make some stuff oh my god a melon is a piston carpet we don't have village but that's unfortunate mutton a lot of stuff this big pink waiter we already done pink dye yeah we've done definitely done pink that's just another way sometimes you've one of the very way nice of crafting the same thing slabs don't ever build into other things neither do stairs we can make emeralds with wheat we knew hey you know how diamonds are called ice sometimes you know yeah you make diamonds of ice ice boys Ice Ice Baby gonna make some ice there you go ice right there dude Ice Ice Baby thanks you're welcome thanks mmm these guys are very homey right now I know we got we all uh who's going on around us block a red stones cook fish I think I'll stick to the sugar cane an actual literal red stone well you know I think we're winding down here perhaps you know yep yep definitely winding down here uh so we I have no idea how we're progressing this is all very strange and weird and new and exciting also I definitely did I did I forget to shout out our sponsors earlier I might have yeah I know we got we got a little excited but allow us to on your first month help support what we do also in that same description will be a link to playlists of other random craft episodes you can catch up on all the different ways that we've been confused and finally we do stream these live twitch.tv slash CaptainSparklez and twitch.tv slash zine so we'd love to see you and you guys want me to pick up a chest cuz that would unlock a lot of stuff I did then it didn't unlock anything it doesn't make any sense chests unlocked like you can
