dear james cameron i have i have a pitch for you i know you've been struggling to get the next avatar movies out but i think found a solution let me introduce you to your new virtual whoops well you know i think you're gonna love it most of all it's gonna help you get your movie done fast to prove to you that this works we're gonna film an entire scene from avatar 2 and trust me we i know we don't have the script but i'm pretty sure we can write it welcome to our studio now you've seen it plenty of times on camera before but today i have something very special to show you we've got a lot of big changes here take a look what you might think is oh i don't see anything sam i just see a big old studio space that's empty you're right we've moved all the desks up into another unit so we have vfx workstations up there and we have studio space down here but what you can't see is behind these walls is the mystical world of pandora that's right the world from avatar why are we talking about avatar well let me explain as you guys have seen i've been messing around with a lot of unreal engine over the last few months here so i made a very big promise recently on our website corridor digital.com there's an exclusive show called local xero done in virtual production all done in real time what you've been watching is me my performance my face my body etc it's pretty crazy and that's what makes virtual production so special and it's not greenlit yet which is a good thing because i'm not ready to shoot it i kind of over promised a little bit we can utilize real-time game engines to create stories you've never seen before we don't have the tools available to create it yet i thought we kind of did but in further consideration i'm realized how under prepared we are to make something of that scale using virtual production tools when i did the video game characters react video i shot that in quarantine all by myself so in order to film that i had to do every process one step at a time what's another large-scale virtual production project that's been completed the first that came to mind was avatar avatar is the perfect benchmark for us to hit they have virtual cameras virtual actors and best of all they're all combined in one thing so you can actually frame up your actors in your virtual scene so before we go into making local zero we have to make avatar two we're talking about multiple actors we're talking about a cameraman and somehow this all just works we're talking about multiple face captures multiple body captures we're doing camera captures not to mention we have to freaking design the whole scene and the characters and the models and like i just hope my computer can handle it because this is gonna be a lot of data spitting at it so let's walk through everything i'm going to need to put together for this to work let's start with the actors the actors well we need to capture their body and their face performance in the past we use the xn's suits and i love them they are super high quality the data's great only challenge they're a little bit pricey can't afford a second one right now so because of that we're going to use the rococo suits we have two cocoa suits at the studio now each with a pair of smart gloves for doing two actors this will be our solution the only issue is they don't track where you are in world space and if you have multiple actors that's a huge challenge you need actors to be able to look at each other and have the models actually line up so to do that and accomplish this we're going to use a vr headset is our intermediary we're going to attach vive trackers to their backs and so as they're using the suits the suits are calculating where their arms and body and legs are moving and these with the lighthouses up there are going to make sure that they are in the right space with each other and that's a very crucial step without this literally you'll have two actors in these suits but on your screen they'll be like facing completely different directions and it's gonna look super weird so this will solve that hashtag spatial continuity so we've got two actors boom they're facing each other wow cool they're interacting we still have to film it though i want to film these scenes as they are happening just like james cameron did we all saw he had a little computer monitor there that was tracking his movements and he could actually frame up a shot that could be used in the final piece and i love that ability so we have our vive wands here and these are tracked in the same space that the suits are all i have to do is somehow turn this into a screen and i think i know how i'm gonna do that basically i'm going to attach a camera to it in the engine so as i move this around the camera will match this movement but i'm going to need more than that how am i going to see it how do i put it i have to put a screen on here somehow for this we're going to kind of go back to a slightly more traditional camera rig i got to put this all together somehow so what we got a thing here screw a handle on it got a clamp so i can clamp my handset onto it this is working and then i want a screen so i'm going to put a it's a really nice monitor look at this thing aperture monitor it's huge this is going to be my window into our virtual universe i need to power it all like a battery on here like i'm not concerned with how this looks because in in unreal engine it's all going to look really cool tape that on there i got to do wireless video from my pc to here so i'm going to use like a nerius plug this in here oh yeah i got to power this all right cool done look at this it's so professional like you could see me on a big budget set like this and like yeah blend right in we have a virtual camera rig now too now all we have to do is somehow combine all this and get it to start working [Music] this is just simply getting the camera working all i'm trying to do here is hold that camera rig i built and i want to see on that screen basically what i would see through the lens of my virtual camera wireless video is working check it out i got my own little mini pc in here dang look at that so there's my little pc on here so this is great my vive controller is turned on i'm gonna just fire this up and see if it's tracking anything whoa okay it's tracking on this screen so i'm gonna launch this in a new window okay and i'm gonna drag this new window over here we go it's working hey this is a piece of cake i can just frame shots up i'm like oh let's get a nice shot of this table okay currently i can't pull focus that's where mapping all these buttons is going to come to play so i can use this and go click click click click and i want to be able to have my controls for the camera here so i don't have to walk back to the computer each time i need to make an adjustment but check that out this is working look at that oh and there's someone coming down the stairs it's so so fun dude i just built a portal into an imaginary universe like how crazy is this look at this it works you still doubting me done easy virtual cameras easy i don't know i don't they don't have like a million of these on set come on jimmy don't break it so wow this is literally exactly the same as what they used on avatar so what's next well peter has already set up the rococo suits with vive trackers so i'm going to leave that to the very end instead i'm going to get this camera working 100 get some controls just like the most basic control features i need and then we're going to combine it with the suits the last thing that's needed for this beast function is a cool environment and really cool looking well rigged characters so for the environments i'm just going to be compiling assets from the unreal marketplace but for the characters sam lazarus who's actually the creative director of rococo volunteered to create some navi aliens fully rigged using daz 3d they have great materials the blend shapes for the facial expressions are really good it looks like these are ready to plug and play your tubes are showing dude my tubes the cubes are dude don't look at my tubes never look at another man's tubes today is a big day today is a day where we will hopefully reach a milestone where the virtual camera rig and the actor can intersect in order to do this we have peter here in a rococo suit a piece of technology that he is an expert at and i am not what we have to do today is get the suit just simply working in rococo studio then we have to take the rococo studio data and get that over to unreal where we'll have a little test character it's very important that we put peter's head on this model because it's the only way he'll be able to know it's him in the computer and won't be afraid and think it's like some sort of demon so yeah okay so i just got off the phone great one i think sam's absolutely going to love it are you are you free jake's script was pretty good ai script generator it's working great all we got to do is feed it prompts to keep writing the script from the end of avatar one and i just wonder if you want to maybe hop in throw in a few prompts with me i'm in let's do it i want to see my expectations defied maybe before we even get into this what's avatar 2 gonna probably be about so avatar 1 is just pocahontas in space so what's a good generic story that just needs some aliens in it oh my name is julia romeo juliet and juliet i'm down for romeo and juliet okay i think we should just get right to scripting this it seems like this could be really easy so what we have in front of us is the entire script for the first avatar and txt document all right copy man so the first movie just ended with he becomes an alien and then cuts to black okay all right so the next movie is going to start probably with like a oh where are we exterior pandora's jungle two alien uh creatures walk through the dense jungle on the hunt for a a new unobtanium a new element that's even more powerful than fun obtainium what's what's the alien's name jake and nathery no no no no i'm walking through the dense jungle it's a sequel we have to introduce new characters jake is not jake it's jorbot we don't want to get sued jorbot and willis jorbon willis walk through the dense jungle when suddenly a spaceship flies overhead and lands they discuss what to do next okay so this is what we have to shoot yeah you discuss what to do next here you be you be jorbot i'll be willis take cover and fire when you see the ship uh not unless you're ready to fight us sir an unarmed nurura is not a threat to us how will we know when he's ready just keep going i'm on the edge of my seat how long we know he's ready asking the question i suppose you could say we'll know when it starts getting hot long pause or is it hot all right we're already in the next scene exterior spaceship there's a small cooking fire in the center of the ship something from the gentroni it seems so it's bigger than their spaceship a perfect square it's the mirror image of the navi ship jake inspects it now they've ever seen anything like that what do you suppose it is it's definitely not human no lights a black block a gray box with a door in it the word not sulu is stenciled in it in navi characters this is getting good this is mysterious nathiri goes to open the hatch new character apparently named ali she burst out hey girl where are you going hey terry there's no way to get in that way come on come on nick theory closes the hatch this is great jake and deteri rush [Laughter] and then he pulls out a gun hey back off jake get out of the way hey out of breath oh [Laughter] uh-oh uh-oh now introducing the star brian what where's it going this gets us off to a pretty good start what's crazy it really has the feeling of the original film it feels like this is the sequel you want to see that's that's the uh the power of ai today's the big day after weeks of work i have gotten things about like 80 good that's enough okay you are my motion capture actors emotion capture i think you came to the right two bros to do that here is the script and i'm gonna tell you guys your characters uh jake sullivan or whatever his name is all right i will you're jake all right all right you are uh you're nakiri so am i wait am i sigourney weaver no the the main lady alien make sure you deliver all this with a very feminine undertone that'll be easy for me the question is who's going to be the better improv artist can peter do this can peter do this give me something give me anything crab crab peter toaster that was pretty good that was pretty good a little bit of the plan here today first i think we should do a quick read through here like a table read it's a nine page script and that's a little intimidating considering we're gonna shoot this in a few hours my relationship with with peter's character are we friends it seems like you're lovers kind of dude are we lovers we probably are there are multiple times in the scene where we look deeply into each other's eyes do you get a little jealous when this when um holly gives me her heart dude honestly are you like that like in my heart i know i have nothing to worry about because you'll love me till the end of time yeah still like my primitive brain is like yo that other alien is kind of sexy and i don't know i yeah it's that that personally made me a little jealous just a little bit once we're done with that and we're familiar with the scenes we'll put our suits on and we're going to do the scenes and hopefully this won't take all day i don't think it will because unlike a normal film set i'm only gonna be like capturing one angle of each scene and i'll add the rest in later because of that i think things will go a little faster than your traditional nine page script i'm hoping to have a super super sweet avatar two scene that makes people satisfied after watching it people been waiting for years to take a peek at avatar 2. so he's going to put a rocket ship on the moon and everyone's going to go like wow great work but someone did it first you know and those guys are people who are truly rooted in history [Music] so i thought things were going well psych actually things haven't been going well this is that part in the video okay you know the part in the video where ren like slams his head on a table and is silent you get the wide shot of him like being really depressed that's where i am right now i'm at my lowest low we did our mocap session clinton peter we're doing mocap everything that could go wrong went wrong the data every single screw and bolt that could go loose on it went loose the rococo suits are great but right now with where they're at they don't seem like they're the best fit for doing this style of motion capture once you have two actors in your scene and you're doing this virtual camera and all the space data and the smart gloves that live link process where you're streaming data into unreal is dependent on the frame rate that your computer is running at and when i have a full scene open with characters and the frame rate's inconsistent the motion capture data sucks right now i have all the scenes set up but they look like absolute garbage because the rococo application can't stream the data at a high enough frame rate for it to look even like remotely smooth i don't even want to show you guys what it looks like right now because it's it's so far from where i'm hoping it can be like i'm okay with some jank here i'm i'm okay with some goofs but it's it's at a point where if you looked at it you would just see pure incompetence and i feel like we can do a little bit better than that at the end of the day i was just like i i give up guys let's put the camera down let's just record you guys doing your performance let me watch you as a director should not worrying about all this stuff get what we need from you guys and go with that let's call it that's a that's a wrap avatar 2 sam's best learning experience actually what did i learn well when i went into this project i thought having a virtual camera with these virtual actors would be something that would help unlock more creativity but in doing this i realized it's actually the opposite it it hinders it i mean well if you're working with a small crew it's a bunch of extra technical stuff big productions have multiple crew members and technicians and all this stuff and i'm trying to like still find that nice streamlined process like what can three people make two actors and a director the beauty about this whole thing is that i can always add the camera in later sure it's cool it's novel being able to see a person in a mocap suit as their digital self but that doesn't actually go towards making a better piece that's what it comes down to i can move the characters wherever i want afterwards what i did build for the camera is still gonna pay off but the whole process of directing and capturing a virtual production performance it just doesn't seem like the camera is a necessary part of it did you hear is it time [Music] now i'm gonna be judged by the honey tear community don't like this whatever you're doing it's time it's time it's time it's time it's done i can't wait to see my favorite characters jake sully and nathiri those two characters that i can definitely name i don't have enough dimensions to describe my expectations right now i'm good it's a lot of people i didn't need everyone to watch it so uh welcome to the screening of avatar 2. we we did it we beat james cameron it's taken 10 years to produce nothing it took me three weeks to produce this we basically had an ai read through the original avatar script and then it gave us this masterpiece what yes sam i wrote the script and i gave it to you like last week there's too much we didn't have the resources to produce your vision so who cares here we go three two one world premiere go what created the most anxiety for me over this project was releasing this so close to another virtual production thing that is on our website that people have put their producer points towards you know it's not a free product and i want to make sure it's really really good so i am anxious about how this looks and how that potentially shines a negative light on what this next project is going to be like but trust me that when i say i'm aware of the problems we ran into and am going to fix them well i'm going to i actually i honestly think that after this any uh chance of ever speaking to james cameron ever are completely gone get down what kind of thing is that something from the ginger honey i don't think i've ever seen anything like that what do you suppose it is it's definitely not human i don't want to scare it but if there's anything to not be in this dimension it's probably a passenger why would they need a passenger they could just dump it inside the ship the pods no bigger than a hatchback jake well let's just go back and ask them hey girl where are you going there's no way to get in this way hey come on come on come on what if it's a girl it's probably just a bunch of uplanders by the color of their skin maybe but maybe it's not something's not right come on come on i'd sure like to know what that was about hey get out of the way hey get back what the hell was that about hey what is this [Music] hey hey wait we're not just gonna leave you here jake come on hey hey come on [Music] hey [Music] oh [Music] he thinks he knows and he's not afraid anymore yeah maybe so [Music] pandora brought me here from within its planet and the tree gave me life it protected us here and now we are ready to take back pandora this mineral may look strange but it has an even more powerful magic inside of it even more powerful than unobtanium it changes everything we touch if we touch the fire and it touches our hands if it touches our feet we will burn we are a weapon that can destroy but only if we stay in touch when we touch it we lose our magic it can't be in both our hands it has to stay in one i guess that means you're gonna show us how to get out of here with one hand i carry a gift with the other i hold the power of destruction [Applause] just like uh i'm giving you my heart oh can i have it no yeah okay i only have a short time left every moment is precious i'm giving this to you please use it to protect the tree uh [Music] and so the celia tells him he will never wear a mask again and will never fight to protect the [Music] planet it's a beautifully flawed piece twist at the end i couldn't have possibly seen coming i could just so it felt nice to finally have people see the video i've been working on for so long and we got some good laughs in there most of the laughs were just the text i put on screen and not the actual video itself but uh yeah the piece is flawed but i'm happy i went through this experience figuring this stuff out trying out some new hardware here really testing it with a workflow because regardless there's a lot of really good learning experiences that i was able to go through the rococo suits are really cool but you know they're still very much untested in a production environment and that's what we finally created here today you know everyone including the manufacturers of these suits are trying to figure out what are the best practices and what are the best ways for people to do this because the real potential here is you know we are on the verge of being able to make animated films with human actors and human animators and human cameramen the technology is almost there that's what's still very exciting about it in the future here for like local zero or other virtual production pieces we're going to have to find another way to get there thankfully there's a million paths forward still in the meantime we're gonna figure out which one's the next best one if
