that was totally illegal you just lived up to the stereotype I did it turned me into a monster that person definitely thinks like that being builded that dude that's all it takes I think they must pipe something into the car it just like make you it turns you into a tool they pipe in obnoxygen [Music] right a I'm sure my heart looks okay hey everybody we're back with another one a bmw m3 here's this this is a 2018 oh yes 2018 for you believe and thirteen excellent this is no ordinary m3 this is a fancy boy m3 because the price of this base is 66 thousand right so okay base price of the BMW m3 is 66 500 yeah that's what the manual transmission if you get an automatic that upset 269 400 and this s tested is 80 $4,100 Wow so expensive that is expensive for sports today on yeah but this is a fun sports sedan so they opted for all the options right yes so let's pretty much all the options including the competition package that include turn signals oh man that BMW drivers okay [Music] three two one there it goes man that it quick yeah that picked up there and when it started it was like yeah yeah then pretty soon after thanks go away yeah that really throws you back man that feels good yeah that thirsty back really well and it's smooth and comfortable too exactly it's well behaved compared to other things we've done I think that feels most similar to the Tesla because so just how smooth it is that's fast it doesn't have that immediate torque that electric cars have especially they've got under D good god yeah this yeah this feels more refined than something like the Corvette yes the Corvette was just like no that brutal this is like it's loud and angry yeah it's all so comfy and smooth I like it that's a nice middle ground I think yeah between the raw power and the precision so okay the bass all I know that it really does like the bass horsepower of this if you get the base model is 425 horsepower with 460 pound-feet of torque he's pretty solid already those are solid numbers if you hit the competition package that ups it to 444 horsepower spike which this one has nice so that's pretty good amount but I just floored it there and yeah it's um it has a really high red line seven and a half thousand yes and that thousand is the red line on the RPM and this is called coming out of a twin-turbo three litre inline-six engine I've always I've always had trouble discerning BMW telling really yeah and I feel like it's pretty easy just because of the grill I know if you know from the side profile or the back profile yeah it does look kind of generic but the front of UW's always are very iconic with their grill yeah I'd agree with that and this has that yeah I do like the looks of this car I really like the there's like a bulge in the hood yeah it looks really a grill to mean it looks like a muscle car yeah it looks it shares that look kind of with the charger yeah we just yeah I think it adds a lot honestly however I think the real special part of the scar is the interior it is killer okay I freaking love it this is so nice it's comfortable it's it's got I don't know what this is some kind of polymer I'm Connie I don't want to say plastic it's because that sounds cheap it feels a little more upscale than PLAs yes fancy plastic an expensive plastic yeah Oh expensive all in all it feels quite upscale and nice in here it's luxurious if you would expect that yeah when you're paying like somewhere between six and six thousand to eighty four thousand or even above prices do go up from there yeah this can approach the six-figure mark for a BMW sedan that's pretty high quite high yeah I love these bucket seats these are my favorite bucket seats we have ever sat in I think just based on how they look and how they feel however there's one critical flaw yeah as we experienced earlier oh yeah our holes they're a harassment hole there are harassment hole this passive the people in the back and reach through and tickle the driver I genuinely mean a fatal flaw yes that'll kill you in Iowa if somebody JT was tickling me earlier through the hole I'm gonna stick your hands and poke whoever's driving and caused them to kill you yeah when you're driving if you forget about that you're screwed most everything is soft touch here but it's like a firm soft touch so you know it's luxurious yes I I do I really love how the steering wheel feels this is the most comfortable steering wheel in any car I've ever felt wow that sounds weird because it's not something I've ever really mentioned or talked about in a video before but yes you don't notice this I notice it but this wheel is comfortable like it's good to grip and hold on to have you got this thing in manual I don't know there you go now try the paddle shifters I think quick they're very oh wow yeah I can feel that there's like zero delay it's pretty yeah okay so shifts are good I guess probably I would expect that I was yeah I mean if you're if you're opting for a performance car with paddle shifters with a competition package yeah stuff that should be really quick and it is this is precise good I like that that's a good plus ya know knocks there alright there are a couple things I noticed looking around the cabin this little cubby thing it's really weird like you have to really wedge your hand back there - oh I guess that's where your cigarette lighter is that yeah and it's hard to close because it's just kind of shoved way back there I don't know what you could put in there really I mean some coins maybe yeah and then this thing that's pretty fun this thing is weird the center console it does it just falls over like most of the time it it'll bounce down but if you put it all the way up it latches in place so it's not gonna fall ever okay so walkie your infotainment is rather interesting I do feel like this is a little dated actually surprisingly yeah some things even look a little bit off center like this is higher than that one yeah like it just I don't know it's hard to explain why I feel this way but it just feels a little old-school there's it's not a bad thing but now it's just a little different a little dated I like like like for example Howdy's are probably the closest rival to these yeah and Audi's have what's called the virtual cockpit system on the - yeah but it's where everything is digital and it gives you like a good heads-up display and you have like them all the data you need is there like a map and everything else this is all very analog still which is potentially a cool thing if you yeah it's just personal preference really if you prefer analog styles or digital styles this is probably what you would want to get over an Audi because Audi's gonna pull digital and this is still fairly analog for the most part yeah all your gauges here are all you do have some little display of some displays underneath you have a small digital display it shows you all your settings like your sport Yoda and stuff which I'm trying to figure out how to get to the giant GoPro in my way speaking of some modes like efficient mode and such this reminds me of mpg which I don't know if anybody getting this is never going to really care yeah this is fairly about mpg but it does get 17 mpg in the city and 25 on the highway which is not super great law recent expect super-great MPG with a performance sports sedan but there you go areare there you've got your stats if you want them you've got that I put it back in sport suspension and steering I think that's where you're gonna want to live most of the time yeah in this car because it strikes a good balance between really crazy let's go fast and not being too unpleasant to live with it's still very comfortable it's not overly stiff and turning radius is so can she do it yes yes not bad pretty good turning radius actually definitely a lot better than the Alfa Romeo Giulietta for sure we tested which is probably the closest competitor that we've reviewed I think so far just like in terms of sports sedans yeah I'd say so I can already say I would definitely take this over an Alfa Romeo Giulia yeah for me there's another on tests this is just so much better every way the steering is really and I love the steering is a really stiff yeah when you put it in Sport+ well yeah I was gonna say that figures if you could put the performance from one of these from the M series in an i8 perfect car perfect car yeah but the i8 is like a weird hybrid thing LS not possible yeah however yeah I don't know the performance on this is great that speed was really raw really good really throws you back in your seat so you never feel like you're gonna die yeah but it feels refined yeah that all things being said I will say the Sport Plus steering is almost too much it's like almost overbearing and you really got a it wants to pull back to to centerline always it was gonna ask me what you thought about the handling cuz I know like lots of people say that the BMW M series cars have some of the best handling I would totally agree from just what we've done here bless you by the way at you but I'm gonna go into comfort and see what that's like ok how much more chill does again not much really it's still really stiff now maybe if I messed with some of my other settings here like my suspension let's go comfort and efficient drive mode it's a little bit more Wiggly but not by much and that's probably a good thing yeah I don't think you wanted you don't want it to be super loose yeah I think it's reasonable it doesn't feel you don't feel the difference nearly as much as in something like a Tesla yeah whereas when you when you press the button on the test that's happened like you can feel it lower you can feel it shuts up this one is much more subtle [Music] how would you how do you feel about this compared to the Evora I definitely via force more fun multiple reasons I totally agree the áfourá is like the manual is just so much fun I don't know what the manual and this would be like but the shifting and that is so good it's so fun and it being mid-engined it looks crazy and it gets like way more attention and way more looks it's a proper sports car experience it's way louder than the sim note has a v6 and it actually has less horsepower than this yeah it still sounds way louder yeah because that's what it was designed to do is designed to be flashy and loud and fast and write fun whereas this one was designed to be fast and it also clutch but also comfortable yet the Lotus is not comfortable not really you have plenty of space in the back here yeah I have zero space in the back in the Lotus yeah so this is all-around far more practical it has a trunk you know which I can fit in which you can actually fit in I mean the Lotus kinda has a trunk that you could fit like maybe a small duffel bag in maybe yeah and that's about it I mean as far as rivals go this isn't competing with the Lotus it's just like the price point it's similar but this is really competing with the likes of Audi Lexus probably pick two Mercedes Audi Lexus Mercedes and arguably Alfa Romeo yeah it's a truly insane Jaguar a little bit maybe a little bit of jazz yeah the set thing there is a lot of competition in the sports sedan market right now yeah and here's the thing Lexus cars and Mercedes cars I believe make cars sports sedans about as well spur like about a similarily priced as this to go faster so if you're going for speed this is not I don't know necessarily what you want to go with because I know Lexus and Audi make sedans that are about as price as this to go faster just slightly I like a 3.9 seconds or 3.7 seconds or so which is a much yeah at that point so you've got to pick the one you prefer because how do you feel like yeah a lot of it is personal preference here at this point they're all very very good cars they're all very comfortable they were fine they're quiet and they're fast so yeah I mean it's a competitive market for good reasons because a lot of automakers are really good at it and they're puppy it's a popular market - yeah super popular and I would say my personal preferences BMW yeah I don't know I'd have to drive more of them I love this car I think it's a blast I want to see what Audi comes out without because they're coming out with their each Ron GT yeah this looks fantastic yeah and they're they've also talked about doing a sport an electric sports car that's yeah a Tron GT right so we'll see what they can do I think they could make a big splash as like the electric sports car maker yes but we'll see this this is the type of car that I would look forward to getting into at the end of the day like if I were working in an office or something that right there what you just said is I think why this car is so popular yeah because you can get in this you look forward to driving at home and like getting in this and it's having a comfortable chill ride but also you can be fast and aggressive at the flip of a switch whenever you want you can just stop people if they get in your way and trap ya which is the ideal Road rate that's why these are so popular lately if you're working at the office and you just want like a but chill day coming back you want to enjoy your ride you look forward to just getting in this and just driving home yeah and it's perfect for that I think it's being a driving monster when you want I guess that really is the ultimate driving machine BMW logo pops up on screen it is rating time all right go ahead and get into this starting us out his performance which is high it is I think it's quite good zero to 60 time four seconds that's fast as a speedy car and handling is good it's very good very sharp I'm gonna go with a seven and a half I think it's I think it's that good Wow I'm gonna go a little bit lower than that well it's really good that's the thing it's really really good so I need to give it what it deserves for performance and then I'll knock it for some other stuff I'm gonna also give it a seven and a half seven and a half yeah okay so we got for that next up practicality which is reasonably well I may be able actually usable back seats that are actually pretty spacious and comfortable for us being average-sized adults yeah it's good for us tenacious back seat especially education the gear on from that does have a emergency release also so you can get out in if you get kidnapped in a BMW practical yep that being said though it does get knocked for using premium gas and forgetting 17 mpg city and 25 Highway that's not that great yeah and there's more practical things in the world in this overall X I'm gonna give it a five and a half next up is value which is a hard one because okay again as an 84 thousand dollar car I think the value is kind of yeah yeah has 66 thousand dollars I think the value is good especially just considering the quality of the components and how fun the ride is I think it's a decent value but I do know being Belize dude appreciate yeah so if you get one of these I use that probably would be a really good value I think I'm gonna I don't know I values that always the toughest thing for me to quantify yeah I feel like but it's I suspect that the lower cost one the 66,000 base model with the manual transmission might be a better value for me than something like this I agree with that I think I would give that a better value than this however we were driving it as is as tested at 84,000 for that I have to give this probably no more than a five I was thinking that too I can't imagine stomach like spending almost six figures on on this basically yeah I think I'm gonna agree with that actually lets me a five five cool factor many I mean the I think V M those are cool I think this is a cool car no one's gonna really notice the end badge though is being cool except for car geeks yeah the only ones are gonna notice the general public isn't gonna look at that oh wow an M badge and think like this is something yeah really special BMW or anything I'd say five and a half for the cool factor because that's cooler than a lot of average cars and I think I'm gonna go with the five a little lower than that it's like yeah like it's cool but it's not uncool yeah and slide a boring car's not cool so I think if five is fair it's right there in the middle next up is quality which i think is actually pretty high the only thing I'm a little worried about is the long term kind of reliability issues here yeah you're inevitably going to get I really like the interior of this car except for some weird things like this is weird the little coin holder thing yeah and the center console could be a little bit nicer I'm gonna give it a 7 that's yeah I was I was actually thinking that exact same point and then the following and final is fun factor which i think is quite respectable it is respect white high in this this is gonna be contentious this is gonna be contentious I do think because it can be chill and you can Cruise in it and we've definitely turn more fun cars than that yeah I believe but this is still pretty fun like you can still the engine sounds so good it does sound so so fast and it throws you back and the seats are so cool I'm gonna give this a fun factor just for how fun it is to drive around a six I'm gonna go with a six and a half okay cool it wasn't as contentious as I thought not as contentious I think it's a little better than a six but I think I think it's fun like this is a fun card it's fast and all that however like it's not quite the same as the Corvette and so I don't know we should throw that in along with the Lotus the Corvette is like very similar aged like a Corvette zo6 is about the same price as this and I would definitely take the Corvette I would too a personal preference I'm a 25 year old dude yeah I'd rather have the Corvette zo6 I don't have a family I don't really care about practicality none of that really matters to me yeah the Corvettes definitely more fun oh absolutely it's just more raw 36.7 5 respectable the average score is thirty six point seven five of the 2018 BMW m3 which is quite respectable that is about two points higher than we rated the Alfa Romeo Giulia yeah not to portfolio Giulia mind you just the base Julia may be other Quadrifoglio we'd rate it a little higher probably but still higher than the Giulia which I think this deserves it's also more expensive than the Giulia like significantly more yeah like $20,000 boys so it should be yeah better be better it better be better and it is and interestingly we rated this just a little lower than the Tesla Model 3 Wow that's us the model three we did thirty-seven point two five half a point higher than this and the model three it's actually cheaper than this yeah I think that's a fair score for this it's pretty high yep considering its shortcomings and the fact that it's not super cool compared to some other exotic cars yeah so thank you guys for tuning in for this episode of the Bavarian motor works m3 we've enjoyed it ultimate
