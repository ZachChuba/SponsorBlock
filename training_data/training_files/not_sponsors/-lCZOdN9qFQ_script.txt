foodwishes.com with pulled pork pancakes that's right it really is too bad that father's day brunch isn't a thing because if it was this would be an amazing thing to serve and while i don't know your dad i do know he would like this what's that he's a vegetarian okay but i still stand by my statement so with that let's go ahead and get started by mixing up the spices for our maple braised pork shoulder which of course is always going to begin with some salt and then to that we will add some freshly ground black pepper some smoked paprika some chipotle pepper as well as some garlic powder and then last but not least a little bit of crushed fennel seed and then we'll take a spoon to give that a quick mix before we use it to season about a three pound boneless pork shoulder roast and if your pork shoulder also known as a pork butt was sort of butterflied in the middle to take out the bone we are definitely going to want to open that up and season the inside as well and if it wasn't don't worry it's still going to be fine and like i said we're going to go ahead and season this all over with our spice rub but we're only going to use about three quarters of it and we will save about 25 percent to season at the end if we need to and the reason we chose these particular spices is because this is going to be braised with some maple syrup and then eventually serve with pancakes so the spices here are inspired by the breakfast meats that go with pancakes right so we got the sweetness and smokiness from the paprika and the chipotle which is going to hopefully remind us of bacon and then we also have the black pepper garlic and fennel which are commonly used to flavor sausage which is another delicious meat product served with pancakes so what i'm trying to say is we really thought this one through and that's it once we've applied about 75 of those spices and we finished with the fat side up we will set the rest of our seasonings aside for later at which point we're going to place this into the center of a very hot 450 degree oven for 30 minutes to sear on and achieve a really nice dark brown crust on the outside on the outside on the outside and then what we'll do as soon as that comes out is reduce our oven temp down to 300 and then add our braising liquids and now we'll start with a quarter cup of maple syrup which according to my research is really good with pancakes so we'll go ahead and drizzle that around and over followed by the same amount of apple cider vinegar which is going to be very important to balance the sweetness as well as cut that fatty richness of the pork and then we'll finish up with a cup of cold fresh water and once all that's in there let's go ahead and grab our tongs and very carefully grab our pork and use it to give those braising liquids a little stir at which point we're going to take some heavy duty foil and wrap this very very tightly and of course as usual we always want the shiny side down otherwise this could burst into flames and please be careful when you wrap this since that pan is probably still going to be pretty hot but we do want to get it nice and tight so if you have to use some towels and that's it once we have that all wrapped we'll place it back into the center of our now 300 degree oven where we will let it cook for about three more hours or until it is very very tender and positively pullable which is not something we want to guess at so what we'll do is pull off the foil and make sure it's literally fork tender where they slide in with virtually no effort and then what we'll do is let that rest for about 20 minutes or so before we take a couple forks and pull it apart and how fine you want to shred this is going to be up to you right some people like to leave it in larger size pieces while others prefer to shred this down very very fine and if you're keeping score at home i prefer it somewhere in the middle and then once shredded of course we're going to want to give it a taste not only to check for seasoning but the smell of this cooking is just insanely good and after about three hours you are really going to want to bite and then you remember that little bit of spice mix we saved from earlier if you need to adjust you can go ahead and use that now which mine really didn't need so i just sprinkled on a little bit to make the point and in case you're wondering that was just unbelievably delicious and one of the best pulled porks i've had since i can't remember when and yes you can make this well ahead of time and then just reheat it when you're doing your pancakes speaking of which let's go ahead and mix up ours now and that's going to start with some all-purpose flour plus some cornmeal okay since we're serving these with pulled pork i thought sort of a cornbread approach would work nicely and then to that we will toss in some white sugar as well as a little bit of salt and then we'll finish our dry ingredients up with a little bit of baking powder and a little touch of baking soda and once all that's in there we'll go ahead and take a whisk and mix this for about 30 seconds or so or until we think everything is combined at which point we can add our wet ingredients which will be one large egg some buttermilk or if you want regular milk but if you use regular milk you don't need the baking soda which is there to react with the acid and the buttermilk and then last but not least a little bit of melted butter and that's it we'll simply take our whisk and we'll mix this until it's just combined but no more okay so we're basically just going to stir this until that flour disappears so as not to over mix it and once that's just barely combined we will stop and we'll let that rest for about 10 minutes or so before we start making our pancakes which i like to do in some melted butter over between medium and medium-high heat and i'm going to do like three relatively small pancakes per serving which we'll then go ahead and stack up with two layers of our pulled pork and just in case you've never made pancakes before what you're going to want to do is wait until you see little bubbles popping up through the surface which are how pancakes tell you they're ready to turn and when we do see those bubbles breaking through we'll go ahead and take a spatula and give these a flip which must be done confidently okay with borderline arrogance alright a pancake can sense fear so flip those like you know what you're doing and then once turned we'll go ahead and let those cook for another minute or two at which point we're ready to move on to final assembly so we'll go ahead and place one pancake down and then top that with as much pulled pork as we see fit along with of course some of those accumulated juices and if you want to add a little bit of butter and maple syrup to each layer go ahead i mean you are after all the calvin kleins of designing these pulled pork pancake shrines but personally i think adding a little bit in there is not a bad idea and as i mentioned i'm going to go ahead and do three pancakes with two layers of pork for a total of five layers which i think is a good amount of layers but if you want to make your pancakes a little smaller and build this up a little bit higher that would be fine all right that's between you and gravity and that's it once we have that last pancake placed over i'm going to go ahead and finish the top of some fresh maple syrup and then for one final final touch since the bowl was sitting right next to me i sprinkled over a little bit of our spice blend and if i'm being objective from a food styling aspect this plate probably could have used a big red strawberry but i didn't have one and besides dads don't care about fruit and that's it our pulled pork pancakes are ready to enjoy and as you may know i'm a huge fan of the sweet and savory combo and this my friends was just about as good as that approach can get okay the aggressively spiced maple braised pork is just perfect with these pancakes and as we touched on earlier since we use spices reminiscent of breakfast meats i think everything just pairs together seamlessly and while this certainly would work wonderfully with whatever your favorite pancake recipe is the fact that these pancakes were a little bit cornbredish really did take this over the top and i think next time just for fun i might try some minced up jalapeno in the pancakes to turn up that savoriness even a little bit higher and as good as they were even if you have no plans for making pancakes like ever the next time you're wanting pulled pork i highly recommend using this recipe since pancakes are not it was spectacular especially for a relatively fast oven version but officially i do hope you eat them both together as this was one of the most delicious breakfasts i've had in a long time which is why i really do hope you give this a try soon so please follow the links below
