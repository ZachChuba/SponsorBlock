howdy how's it going my name is Davy chappy and do you know what I hate they you know I love crushing Fae by dropping a house on them that's why the Wizard of Oz is a household classic for me telling the tale of a brave human amassing followers to defeat the evil Fae hag that has been plaguing her every move but for some people it's not enough to carry with them the lessons of a beautiful murder story for their own home is plagued by the Wicked Witch of war sister Shire and they needed a positive information to aid them in these trying times so let's talk about hacks from birth to death and all of the terrible little nightmares in between nerds so hags are strange and Eggman creatures that have the outward appearance of old crones living in a strange house on the edge of town but are in fact horrid monsters that twist and pervert the image of the loving grandmother so that they can snatch up any strangers that try to touch their cookies they steal a neat baby so that once enough babies have been devoured to gain the ultimate baby power they can spit out a new baby that'll grow up into a hag by the age of 13 and they often stay in places that unnaturally merge the Material Plane and the fate wild where they can both wreak havoc on the unsuspecting town folk while also studying practicing and experimenting on their magical arts with the intention of growing their power greater and greater until they're able to craft the ultimate cookie their usual mo is to roll in on a cow sell a bunch of snake oil that'll have unintended consequences and also cost an arm a leg or a baby and then peace out on a flying cauldron while cackling into the night and unfortunately for us hacks don't seem to have an expiration date so they'll live longer than anything Dragons elves my especially the wizard joke while they remain their relationship with any surrounding settlements borders between unsettling creepy and downright repugnant see despite looking like the dark side of Betty White hags have an overt sense of humor taking delight in grossing out any stuck-up and prissy posh body that puts too much emphasis on sanitation to clean smells and sexual reaction to anything other than these sweet husky gams their gross Ness is only emphasized by their homes often layered with filth and adorned with nothing but oatmeal raisin cookies but the raisins are spiders and the oatmeal is oatmeal and their magic which while operating similarly to normal spells have creepy methods of applying their magics such as cure wounds being a swarm of bugs stitching your injury's back together magic missile being heat-seeking new dyes that splatter all over you when they strike and a poison cloud being well I'll let you use your imagination the common wisdom for dealing with hags besides don't is that talking will only hurt marginally less than fighting and you'll still come out covered and bodily fluid anyway however when dealing with hags there are five main flavors of senior-citizen that you'll have to watch out for and these are the anise hags that live in the mountains and hills bur hags that live in Tundras green hags that live in swamps Moors forests and Greenland's night hags that are often found in the lower Plains to haunt the dreams of children and sea hags that rise out from the ocean under the guise of mermaids just to turn around and reveal their wrinkly pruney bodies while each egg is a specific type of terrain that it models itself after it isn't unknown for them to mix things up and go to a completely incompatible terrain so if your swamp loons start to freeze over and you get buried under a blizzard that's how you know you've got hags as for the hags themselves their only goal is to gain more power and rise up the ranks of the hag hierarchy have you seen my failed guide then you understand the understandable nature of the Fae and how their court system works but hags operate almost completely outside of that system instead hags form of very close-knit trio of sisters called a coven and this magical power of threes allows them to access the magics inaccessible for one hag alone most cousins communicate with each other trading secrets and baking recipes so that the elderly sorority will grow and prosper all the while keeping those same hags at an arm's reach away from their actual stomping grounds and only meeting up with foreign hags on bingo nights to discuss new ways of being old and creepy in this way when an adventurer deals with a hack they're not just dealing with one hag or even three hags they're dealing with the entire sisterhood one dead hag attracts the ire of a dozen living hags or if the hag was a bit of a hag then perhaps her sisters will be happy to see her go and thank the adventurer for their help it all comes down to the hierarchy of the hag like I said before hags operate in covens but beyond that a hag status is dictated by how old powerful and influential they are with the rest of the populace a particularly strong hag might be awarded the title of auntie while hags that have baking skills that would rival even chef buddy our revered as grandmothers signifying them as being even as powerful as an arch Fae and being able to walk into their course despite disgusting because these grannies are packing more than pastries the Power Balance generally doesn't allow for infiltration by a non hag but if a coven is short one member any magical mortal that can handle being flirted with by Mother Gothel could find a way to bargain themselves into a vacant slot although like all Fae you have to be very careful in making such a deal which brings us to the most important detail that separates hags from their faith familiars while it doesn't excuse their crimes of being faith oak and I still don't recommend it to any mortal wanting to keep their teeth dealing with hags is a marginally better experience than dealing with most faithful where the plans of most Fay are very undefined and so provide absolutely no context for what is and isn't a good deal plus the added problem of a constantly redefining the rules based on their version of what is and isn't a proper interpretation of semantics  eggs are much more simple in that a hag wants power you have power you give power to hag in return of thing and hag gives you thing it's a symbiotic relationship of course hags being faiths a still try to sneak one over on you by  around with whatever they're giving you before the fact so that it blows up in your face or creates a giant Beanstalk so big that a giant from the city in the clouds descends from it and eats the narrator but at least it's something to work with this means that if a hag is too powerful to deal with the old-fashioned way you can still try bartering with it to see if she'll leave you alone for a while and then you can call in the Inquisition but that'll about do it I hope you enjoyed this video be sure to leave a like comment
