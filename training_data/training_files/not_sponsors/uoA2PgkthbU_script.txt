online store make your next move with Squarespace so I'm going to show you how I process through a big batch of headshots say I've been with a company for the day and I've shot a hundred people generated over two thousand images this is my little process for bringing the images into Lightroom making sure that I make the correct select for those images and then just make little tweaks and get them into a folder on my desktop so that I can start bringing them into Photoshop one at a time for a custom retouch on the Photoshop side the rule for myself when I got a big batch like this is that I spend no longer than 10 minutes per image on a retouch and that is just to take out obvious distractions to make sure that the color and contrast is good and to insure that my white background is actually pure white the whole way around this is actually part two of this video so if you want to see the first part in my channel I'll show you the lighting setup I use for these how I coach people through positioning and looks all the settings in my camera and that kind of stuff but if you just want to stick to the retouch stick with this video and let's dive right in so we've got all that images in Lightroom you can see this is where we said start out testing light so I was showing you a flash sync here setting up our lights making sure we clean edges and building the lights up as we went and two black cars to check that ambient light wasn't affecting an exposure and a great card shot and then we're into the shoot as we go down so you can imagine here there's just five people this was just an example but you can imagine if you shoot 70 people sort of 20 images each then you're gonna wind up with a lot on the day so the first thing I want to do is to get my white balance of everything correct make sure everything's fine so I find my gray card shot and I want to open him up go to develop and the first thing I'm going to do is just take my little eyedropper tool here and just click on this great card target and that should snap everything in you didn't see it changed that much because it was pretty much in the ballpark of where it needed to be so everything's fine so now what I want to do is apply this white balance setting to all of the photographs in this shoot so here's a little thumbnail at the bottom with our gray card and if i dial all the way along to the right to the very last shot and I hold down shift and click on the last image I'm gonna select everything in between those and what I'm gonna do is come down here to sync and it gives me a dialog like this so already you could have a load of different things if I've made a lot of changes to this one I could sync all the settings across but all I want selected is white balance because that's anything I'm changing and then I just need to go down here to process version and make sure that that's ticked on so basically going to take the white balance setting of this image and apply it to all of the rest to go synchronize and you should see across all of these that little icon appears and we know that then we're in the right place so the next thing I'm going to do is to make sure I get the correct selects so I can see I was shooting here this is the first person I shot with and if I move along to the last shot I took with her I can find her holding the piece of paper so here we can see she chose to 8 4 3 so now all I want to do is if I mouse over the thumbnails you can see look over here the number actually changes and that's the number of the image so I'm just need to mouse over until it's 2 8 4 3 so if I just select 2 8 4 3 that's the one she chose and I'm gonna just hit three the number three and that's just going to put three stars on it and I'm going to scroll along to the next person go to the last shot with him and Matt once to eight six zero so again I'm just mouthing along until that number changes to two eight six zero there it is hit three and that puts three stars on it so you can see you can move quite quickly with this which when you've got a lot of people from shoot is very very useful so Tonya wants to eight nine zero so I'm scrolling back to eight nine zero there we go I'm going to select and hit three but three stars and then I'm going to select them next one the last image that I shot with her Andrea once to nine one four so I'm scrolling back along till I get to nine one four select it and hit three put three stars on that one scroll all the way along to the last one here and been once to nine four zero so he wants this one so hit three there now all I need to do is go to filters go to rated and I've only rated them with three stars but if you wanted to get specific there's your three stars and these are my five selects so you can see that if I've got a lot of people's of you know 100-plus people it's not going to take me too long to make the selects for this and I can just plow through and get it all done now in Lightroom I'm not going to do too much most the work will be in Photoshop but I do just want to make sure that I've got all the detail that I want because this is a raw file I might have blown this to white on the back of my screen but it won't be white now because it's obviously trying to rescue detail and I'm not gonna worry about this here in Lightroom I'm gonna do that later in Photoshop but here usually what I do is just to make sure that I'm not blowing and I'm looking at the skin I'm not paying attention to the background I'm pulling some of the whites back because it's looking a little bit hot and I might just bring the exposure back this will mean that I'm affecting this background and I'm taking it away from white but like I said we'll we'll fix that later in in Photoshop and I really just am looking for my exposure and making sure skin tones are looking good and the only other thing I'll do is to just hit lens correction just to take it any distortion from the lens so again very very quickly this one's slightly hot bringing it back a touch and maybe just pulling the whites back on that skin a little bit coming down and making sure my profile correction is good again this one's slightly hot so I'm dialing it back just to smudge somewhere there and I'm just gonna pull the whites down a touch for that skin making sure it's not too hot again coming down and hitting lens correction two more to go and you can just say you don't want to spend a lot of time in this because most of the time you're going to spend with this technique is going to be in Photoshop so this is just literally making sure I've got all the detail that I need and all the dynamic range that I need and I'm not losing anything so each one just lens correction and just just tweaking the exposure just a little bit and that looks good okay so we're in Photoshop I've pulled in one of the images this is all ready to work on the whole thing with headshots like this is you're just not going to have the time to do high-end retouches so I'm going to crack through this as fast as possible if there are things you don't understand the technique you'll just have to google them because I just want to show you the speed at which you should be moving to get through these and obviously I've been doing this for a little bit so I might move faster than you but just to show you the kind of things I cover and the sort of pace and time I'll do it so say we start the clock right about now okay first thing I'm going to do is to create a new layer solid color layer and I'm going to make sure that it's pure white 6fs is what its gonna be to make sure that your pure white the whole way through and then I'm going to duplicate my bottom layer and just drag it above this is gonna be the way that I'm going to make sure that the whole background is pure white because this might look pure white at the moment but it's actually not and I'll show you that in a minute so let's sort out the the white first what I'm gonna do is just hit my mask button to create a mask and then I'm going to zoom out a little bit and make sure that my brush is on a hundred percent and X changes me to black so now what I'm doing just to turn these off so I can see through on the back layer I just want to delete just sort of around this is a very quick and dirty way like I said I had just haven't got the time to you know be creating individual masks for each and this is just a very very simple way to be able to make sure that everything around is going to be pure white all right so I've just very loosely and you've got sort of a fade in there because I'm using a very soft brush now I can turn my white layer on the background now this won't be this will be pure white over here but where it starts to bleed and it'll actually be a grey so what I'm gonna do is create a levels layer I'm gonna hold down alt and I'm gonna drag from the from the right hand side can you see there if I hold down alt you can see what is actually blown to wider what isn't so you can see where is becoming a problem then I want to drag just to the left until I get a nice clean silhouette so that is good there so now I know that everything surrounding that is going to be pure white but it's made my skin a bit hot so all I'm gonna do is come back and just with that mask selected and a black brush I'm just gonna paint back that those highlights on the face so now I have I know that I've got pure white all the way around there got a nice clean outline on him and I've painted back those highlights okay next thing I'm gonna do is healing brush a new layer I'm gonna go to healing brush very very quickly this is not a beauty retouch at all I'm just going to alt select and just take out anything in my general rule for retouching like this is anything that won't be there in two weeks on the skin comes out so I'm not you knows of making someone look perfect I'm not working at a poor level or anything like that I'm just taking out anything on the skin that won't be there in two weeks that's that's my sort of rule for myself so I'm not changing the face I'm not taking out moles I'm just taking out blemishes and distractions so let me do a bit of a better job on that one and that for the level we are working is looking pretty good maybe just this one as well and then then you can see as we're going so the skin looks super natural as is but just taking out those little blemishes next thing I want to do is I don't like to skin smooth but what I do instead is I selectively sharpen the features so that when I sharpen the features in comparison to the rest of the skin the skin will feel smoother but I'm actually working backwards so what I'm going to do is hit command alt shift and E which is going to stamp visible take everything that I've done and put it above easiest way to sharpen is to come here to filter go down to other and high-pass and basically what I'm gonna do here is with this gray layer I'm just dialing in until I can see nice clean edges around things but before you push it too far like this and you start to get haloing so if i dial this to around 2.1 that's looking pretty good I'm going to just come here to adjustments and desaturate that layer because there is some color information in this layer I'm going to come down here to overlay okay and that is going to sharpen everything up if you look here if I turn this layer on and off now you can see that it's sharpened it but it's also sharpen the skin so all I'm gonna do is put a mask on that layer hit command-i to turn it all black grab my brush and just with it on 100% in a soft brush I'm just gonna paint in the features on these some sharpening I'm selectively sharpening features I want I'm gonna do it the mouth just the nostrils on the nose maybe a little bit on the stubble and I'm gonna bring the hair back in as well so now I haven't softened the skin but I have sharpened in the features in comparison to the skin which is going to give that sort of effect of of making the features pop in comparison okay next thing I'm gonna do is hit a curves layer and this is just for the eyes now without adjusting the actual curve I'm going to change the blending mode of the curves layer to screen and that's going to turn everything to bright I'm and hit command I to invert the mask I'm gonna grab my brush and I'm going to come into the iris on the I bring this down and would bring my flow to three percent just very very light so I can layer this on and just so that it's slightly smaller than this this iris here I'm just going to paint in a touch here this is a very very quick and dirty I edit if I turn this on and off you can see what that's done it's just brightened it now this is something that you can absolutely overdo you should never be able to see that I can see I've overcooked it so all I'm gonna do is bring this here and I'm gonna dial it up just sort of about 40% there make sure you can never see this it just starts look incredibly fake and you can give people cat's eyes and it looks bizarre so now what I'm going to do quickly is dodge and burn for shape so I'm gonna grab look another curves layer I'm gonna do exactly the same again screen which is gonna brighten everything up this is just another way to dodge and burn when I hit command-i to get rid of all that grab my brush and bring it right up and now I'm just bring some shape to the face so I'm going to just brighten this forehead a little bit it's on three percent flow so I can paint it in as I go again less is more with this on the bridge of the nose on the triangle of the cheeks as well just to bring out some of that shape just on the chin here and then just on this bottom lip here and maybe just on that top piece there as well I'm just writing this highlight on the back okay now you can see it's too much to knit on and off but you can see what that's doing I'm gonna bring this back down and dial it up to 15 maybe and I really do just feel these out as I go curves this is my burn layer multiply and command I to get rid of it and I'm gonna do exactly the same again just paint this in I'm just gonna paint in the shadows on the face so just down this bridge of the nose here underneath the nose this just creates a little more shape in the light as well just on the opposite side and I'm gonna darken down the shirt a bit I don't want this neck distracting the skin I don't want this shirt distracting so if I turn this on and off you can see it's just sort of tucked everything in a little bit in terms of the tones so that looks good taking it to about 60% next thing I want to do is grab my color balance layer and this is just to add a bit of color contrast so if I go to shadows and you can use this little formula if you do 3 and then minus 3 so I'm adding 3 on the Blues and minus 3 on the scions into the shadows and then for my midterms I'm doing the opposite I'm adding minus 3 for yellow and 3 for red now what that's done is it's pushed warmer tones into the mid-tones and cooler turns into the shadows and if I turn this layer on and off you can see it's just added a bit of contrast to that layer which isn't actually contrast it's lost detail it's color contrast it's just like a visual trick of the eye next thing gonna do is grab a curves layer and this is where I'll actually edit like a normal curves layer just a slight shallow s-curve and I'm being very very careful here not to blow my skin tones so just a shallow curve just to bring a little contrast in I want to also add some edge contrast and the way that I do that is to again command alt shift and E and I'm going to go to image that's just stamped a visible layer above and on that layer I'm going to turn it to black and white I'm going to bring my red to the left and you watch what this does in terms of contrast in the skin and my yellows to the right just creates a nice sort of contrast through the image you can't play with others but to be honest there were very little colors in here anyway so I'm gonna go okay and I'm gonna change this blending mode to soft light okay it's way too strong so I'm just bringing this back but just watch what this does is I dial this up you can see it just brings a bit of crunch to the image and makes it pop in terms of sort of edge contrast so I probably only want about 10% of that but if I turn that on and off you can see it's just brought a nice bit of contrast in there it's looking a touch saturated for me so I'll probably go saturation and -5 just to dab at that saturation a touch and I'm going to at this stage just before I finish off I'm gonna make sure my crop is good and I'm just giving I usually just put this sort of just below the eyebrows this third here just below the eyebrows and there we go something something like that maybe actually I'm gonna bring it up a touch I'll put this actually on the eyebrows when I give it a little bit of headroom and I will give the client this as is then they could square crop and do whatever else they want with it but I know that that will work and the last thing I want to check is just to create a levels layer above and exactly the same again hold down alt grab my right node here for my highlights and just make sure that everything outside you can see there's a little bit of fringing in here so all I'm gonna do is just dial it till that disappears Bank gone and now I know that everything outside is white he's got good skin tone I haven't blown anything out and that's looking pretty good the last thing that's bugging me and I've just noticed this now normally I'd do a little bit more cleanup on the clothes perhaps he's got some death spots but I'm gonna leave that for times sake and I'm gonna go command alt shift II another stamp visible layer above and the last thing I'm gonna do is come up here to filter and liquify just because there's this odd bulge and the back of his shirt here which is just the way the material was lying and just making sure it's on nudge and making sure that brush is about the size of the actual balls I'm correcting I'm just going to tuck this in a little bit it's very very key when you're doing stuff like this to not get into too much of a flow that you miss the detail that are unique to each person so just with those little tweaks there that looks pretty good to me so we've basically gone from let's have a look here from this to this nice subtle edit just cleaned everything up and tweet it you could take out this here he could take out a bunch of other little stuff you could sort of clean this up a little bit but to be honest for a headshot edit this is probably good and I'm done so I would just go save as and I would have remembered the name from our Lightroom because he held this piece of paper up I can't remember surname right now but I know it was Ben so let's call this Ben final and JPEG full quality save and 12:00 maximum quality and okay and that is our headshot retouch thanks again to Squarespace com forward slash Sean Tucker to get 10% of your first purchase [Music] [Music]
