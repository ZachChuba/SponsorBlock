[Applause] joss whedon was going to give us a gift and that gift was superman with a mustache and none of us get to see it unless we put it back on him we could make a little trailer to pitch warner brothers on this idea this video is sponsored by razer nvidia studio we are giving away a free razer blade pro 17 so stay tuned to find out how you can win it i couldn't sleep last night i was thinking about how there's footage of superman with a mustache that we never got to see that footage does exist it exists somewhere in wp's archives the pickup shots they did for joss whedon's original vision of superman with a mustache somebody at wb was like you know what i'm just gonna meddle in the movie and take his mustache out these producers are always messing with the director's vision it's a it's a classic tale i think it's a disservice to the world that wb decided to take his mustache out joss whedon was going to give us a gift and that gift was superman with a mustache and now none of us get to see it unless we put it back on him that's a lot of responsibility well like they say with great responsibility um [Music] great power great power great power that's from the original batman when his parents get shot and they're bleeding out of the opera yeah the joke returns somebody goes with great responsibility comes great power and then batman's like i'm batman there were moments where i was suited booted and mustachioed yes i want to show the world the beauty of having a mustache particularly the beauty of having a mustache on such a beautiful person as henry cavill what a beautiful world we could be in we will visualize that world for you in this video we're gonna delve into some technology here we're gonna show you guys how to put a mustache on people and with this video i think we can create enough demand for wb to release the mustache cut it's the right thing to do they've already they've already did the whole snyder cut so what's one more cut guys come on it's easy it just takes a few minutes you just bring in the footage in premiere and you just export i love deep faking stuff i love ai it's such a crazy new world of visual effects i'm going to use it in this video if you saw our luke skywalker deep fake i mean you have an idea of where we can get these days with the fidelity of these things that's like a military-grade industrial quality deep fakes and you can't really do that at least on a puny computer i need to grab a bunch of elements of superman without the mustache i need to grab a bunch of elements of handkerchief with the mustache and then i'm going to start training it over this weekend for my house all right so it is the weekend i'm having ivy record this and i have fired up this deep fake on this laptop and it's looking really good so this is right now back to the mustaches so i've been uh training this computer on how to make mustaches all weekend so this is uh remember that really janky shot they opened justice league with back in the day i deep faked the mustache version of henry cavill trained it on regular superman version of henry cavill oh my god at all everything you see here is train from his look in mission impossible which is interesting because in mission impossible he's doing certain facial expressions as his character he's always going like this he's always furthering his down a little bit so even like like right here he's still scaling just a little bit the janky smiles and things like that in justice league he never moves his mouth like that like you can really see his mouth structure when you're looking at a deep pig remember how janky the smile is here the deep thing is doing its best here's the original look at the difference in how his lips are structured like his bottom lip doesn't go over his teeth who smiles like that this one looks really good this dude's great that looks really good it just needs a little contrast bump and it's there with a little masking that's totally usable but that looks i mean this is fantastic i kind of love superman with a mustache i wouldn't be mad if in a future movie he had a mustache so yeah there it is wow this stuff is always so cool i'm like yeah whatever and then we do it i'm like this is kind of crazy so peter and myself have devised a pipeline that is developed exclusively for putting mustaches onto henry cavill it's actually first of its kind yep so we figured we'd do an interactive demonstration of our new mustache technology where people could join us art is fun when everybody gets to participate so we're going to demonstrate interactive mustache visual effects what the heck what the heck i don't have a mustache dude friend i know you can't grow one [Music] this is how it is this is how it's supposed to be mission impossible is just one type of mustache but we don't need to stop there what if you could have any mustache you wanted on intercapital so this is the uh the station where you build the mustache i guess i guess i'll demonstrate here i mean somebody shouted out pencil mustache it's a very sloppy pencil mustache it's supposed to be like riding you on a yosemite sam wait nika with the nose [Laughter] [Music] we need to take this seriously yeah we're trying to we're trying to demonstrate to warner brothers that if they want to put the mustache back in we have a pipeline developed for it [Music] that was terrifying what are you doing three tiny mustaches i'm gonna give him a disguise i mean this is basically clark kent's actual disguise griffin if you can give me a handle bar i need like a little bar real looking handle really can handle all the way down the handlebar mustache is not the one that goes down your face like lily hogan yeah the handlebar mustache is the one that's on your forehead oh no kidding yeah so wait what is the whole hogan stash what is the biker stash horseshoe the horses yeah i want that hulk hogan horseshoe stash that's what i'm looking for is that wizard hulk hogan right there oh my god you shall not pass brother i got it fitting pretty good here bro oh my god dude oh my god did you just give him the limp biscuit he's so rad dude the reason we gather everybody here so we could actually check the actual mission possible mustache make sure that's the right one peter i do have one in there called [Music] impossible that's like a 910 stash right there i feel like this is the right call that's definitely the right call it's the best looking one out of all of them he is working it like there's no tomorrow all right case closed captioning not [Applause] realistic what available you wanted henry kevin to have a long waving mustache you can't do that with a deep fake yet so i wanted to bring some of these shots into blender and see if i could push the limits of these mustache shots we got stroopwafel's fist coming through here trying to punch henry cavill and missing there's an opportunity for a mustache here some flowing mustache coming out the fist going through it he's trying to punch superman's mustache off but superman's mustache is not having it so how could we put a mustache in this shot well first we have to have something to put the mustache on and so i went on trustyolcgtrader.com and i downloaded a 10 3d model of henry cavill's head unfortunately the model didn't have a mustache so we're gonna have to put that on later what a beautiful man honestly even in grayscale just the curvature of his head so i just took this head model and i crappily went frame by frame tracking it onto henry cavill's head just so it's in the right position so we can simulate the mustache and it'll follow along with his head from there we take our hair tools and blender and we grow some hairs out of henry kevin's face and then we take our little blender scissors and cut over the lip we do not want a walrus or a horse shoe or anything animal related we want this to be a strictly bar mustache so after we groom the hair it's time to simulate it thankfully this computer is super freaking fast this is simulating as i'm playing this right here lightning fast it's simulating a thousand hairs right now which is not a small amount of hairs we need that fist coming through and kind of causing some air to be displaced moving the hair out of the way so we have our mustache floating amongst the cg stars but we want it to look like it's stuck to henry cavill's face what we're going to do is we're going to take that henry cavill 3d model and set it to be a shadow catcher so you can't actually see the model but it's receiving the shadows from things around it to make it look like the mustache is casting a shadow onto mark hamill henry cavill hairy cattle my god oh that is silly and with that we are ready to render freaking rendered this shot when i went out to launch rendered in like 20 minutes at like 300 samples 1080p yeah i'm super happy with how this turned out especially given that i turned the shot around in like an hour ridiculous on a laptop pretty sweet so i finished my deep fake i've done all the compositing i've done the masking this is the best i can get right now with this deep fake all right let's take a look i know you oh damn that looks good the lighting this i think it is in like 400 000 iterations training for about four days and also i used a pre-trained model that we had done for luke skywalker so that helps me get a little boost in time otherwise i'd be looking at probably about eight days if i did in four and it's interesting flipping back and forth look at his nose see how his nose shifts in position and also look at his teeth see how his teeth like stick down more in the cg face and the lip shape is a little bit different that works pretty well it doesn't look like a real mustache like i don't see any individual hairs but the shading of it in the placement like it works i would love to see a shot of superman with his natural mustache we can only truly tell if we're active or not if warner brothers releases the mustache cut now that we have all these shots we could make a little trailer to pitch warner brothers on this idea and maybe kind of get everybody excited about it hashtag release the mustache cut imagine you this could be your superman right here look look how handsome we've proven with the power of unity and community that we can get them to remake a movie once let's do it again release the mustache cut release the mustache cut superman can we ask you some questions what's the best thing about planet [Music] or earth it a dream or was it something more than what it seemed the enemy is here clark [Music] we don't have time [Music] team needs clark and what is clark need bruce no you have no idea what kind of power you're dealing with but this is science beyond our limits the way we're gonna stop him is by using his power this power against him i agree this is crazy oh what now it's crazy your goatee is okay but i'm a big fan of [Music] mustache all right so we're going to upload just the mustache cut to instagram at quarter digital you guys can take it you can post it you copy paste it everywhere you know please give us a shout out hashtag release the mustache cut riled the troops the foot soldiers you want to see it in front of the eyes the warner brothers executives and henry cavill himself that was definitely a funny looking superman
