Georgia judging it yeah psyche yeah this is tips yeah if I could make my iconic it looks like this it's boss done all empty [Music] can actually prioritize making these vlogs if you guys want ask a question for the end of another blog hash tag add to me pages where I look up on Twitter whenever I do these Q&A and there are any places in the northern hemisphere us where I can purchase zoom since I missed out on pre-orders there aren't any that I know of at the moment I think my publishers focusing mainly on Australian stores I know there's some in New Zealand as well however you are able to get them online and Ozzy retailers but the shipping is still really expensive for some reason that's just super expensive to send books you can maybe ask your local bookstore if they can order it in because they do have that option but other than that you either have to kind of do with the costs or wait until I find like a random book that I can put online or wait till is maybe hopefully successful and is in American bookstore so I'm really sorry if that's disappointing I just don't know where to get it globally I lost my publisher and let you know if it changes do we have favorite artists to follow on in to Graham okay I've got like a bazillion let's put them on the screen now did you study Fine Arts do you think it's an S it's necessary in order to begin an art career can you explain the odd industry you're in in another video okay did I study finance i studied visual art and design and i made you to graphics i can print and then I went into digital my degree was kind of really basic art design like they taught you everything you need to know to get started I guess having said that I think you need a degree to be an artist I think the most valuable thing in terms of going in to an institutional setting to love that kind of stuff is resources and networking networking being meeting people along the way that later in life may help you so say you need something like if you get kicked out of your studio does anyone know if any studios are going for rent they may be able to help you you know I mean in terms of the institutional setting being a great resource some practices and art require a lot of space first of all so the studio would be great for that that they have at art colleges and also things like the kilns the like clay things that you wouldn't necessarily have it harm but that's what I would say is necessary on top of that art does not history for me was one of my favorite subjects at the time I did really like writing essays but it really helped my writing skills and critical thinking skills I really loved now having studied the history and theory of art the art world and the design world those kinds of things that you may not be a know where to look for or where to find that's what I think art school is valuable for but it's definitely not necessary most skills that I use in my business in my practice I taught myself or I learned online but these those taught some basic stuff you need that I do use but it's the majority of it was a lot of self education and self motivate learning if you're passionate you work really hard and you go to shows and you meet people I think that's good enough what's your advice for someone trying to find their life purpose how did you find yours that is a really intense quest and I don't even know if I'm qualified to tell you how to do that because I was really lucky in that from a young age I knew where I wanted to go and what industry I wanted to be in before I can even remember I loved drawing everything like that I always said I wanted to be an artist I've always been interested in art I'm still very interested in design so I would go back into that industry but I was lucky early on that I was interested in what would turn out to be my career path whatever brings you joy you should aim to be able to do it as much as possible think about what you like and think about how that can then translate into something that you can make a lifelong journey and purpose I'm sorry if I was a we danced up how do you stay organized with all your projects and deadlines I write to-do lists I go crazy with the lists I've got a chalkboard with lists I've got a big journal that I take to Chris's and my weekly meetings I also have like a daily planner that I used to write daily to-do list scraps of paper that have to do list anything that I can get everything that I'm thinking in my head into a checklist I would do that because it just makes me feel more calm and less stressed and it also helps me create a hierarchy what's the most important to at least important and what what is bite-size and what will take longer and where I can fit that into my schedule is there any possibility of zoom much any new kid pants or other shop Ivan's all away for the holidays I wanted to do stickers but is it too late to do that now I don't know I really want to do some stickers I want to do other stickers I want to make more Kim pins it's just a matter of when I have time and I really don't think I'll be able to do it before the holidays I'm so sorry I'm always really nervous about releasing things near the holidays too because shipping them takes a really long time and I don't want people to be mad at me for standard shipping time so I'm just gonna say no I got nothing planned for the holidays but I will have lots planned for next year so stay excited and remind me too because it's sometimes I just get lost in my projects I'll slash where did you find my motivation when you're not right I think I've mentioned this before but up just after finishing the final wallow at the zoom I was in a massive creative block I was just burnt out I had post-show blue and I haven't had any feedback for the book because it wasn't gonna be released for another ten months or something so I've no I just felt really sure he I couldn't make anything I was I wanted to so badly make things i sat down but I didn't have anything to draw and I think when it's when you're in that kind of state the best thing to do is remove yourself from the studio and kind of absorb inspiration whether that be reminding yourself and there's other things outside of your work going to galleries and seeing other people will be passionate about what they do also perceive this question as being when you're not right in that you don't know what to do but you still have the means to draw and if you don't know what to draw you can always use like little word generator you can play mr. squiggle which is something I kept I do sometimes and if someone draws a squiggle and then you make something out of it this is crooked I'm really sorry Sherrill with friends you can do some life dry which is that way you don't have to think about what you're drawing you just have to draw what you see you could set up as still life or you go draw naked people that's always fun I could read a book we'll listen to me too can draw from that at that project where I drew was into audiobooks that was really fun and that's something I will definitely adopted to my practice too I think it's important just to stay busy and to get started because once you are on a roll I think that's when it's easy to to keep working and then start drawing something more purposefully now that you've completed a lot to zoom what's your next big dream project either personal or client ways that is such an interesting question I am very not a goal driven in that way like in turn so I want to achieve this I want to work with this brand but the next things that I want to do next year is have another solo show I haven't had one for a year or two now it's been too long I think it's important to do those things that are completely separate from everything else that you're doing so I have a solo show I want to create another book next year I've already talks with my publisher on that what I'm really excited about the concepts so I hope they love it too it seems positive so far we'll see so I'm gonna do some home and ceramics but those are just kind of on the back burner if I get an opportunity to if I find someone to collaborate with et cetera but mainly I want to have do it on the book and I want to have a solo show those are my main goals for next year hey so what are some tips on managing an online store for your art such merchandise is about to start one of myself I think you need to know most importantly what you were capable of because I think I went through a time when I had a job and an online store where it was really hard for me to keep up with orders and I kind of disappointed people not a lot of people but still I got complaints about late shipments and stuff like that really stressed me out I don't talk about I was disappointing people which sucks start small and see like what the demand is for your work I would also say well taneous lee try to build an audience on other platforms just so that when you release something there is demand for it and I think the main thing is to focus on loving what you're selling look like loving making what you're selling so that if it doesn't sell straightaway and want to disappoint it because the journey there was freaking awesome but yeah I may not be the best maybe we should ask Christmas should we do a Kris Q&A because he had those most of my store stuff now so he's probably a better person to ask we should do a crisp QA comment below if you want a crisp you add a that's how you book lunch went from your point of view of things well you guys saw it what did you how did you think it went if you came let me know what you thought it was really nice to talk to everyone actually there's quite a few people that watch my vlogs there so it was really really fun but I was really stoked it was a whirlwind does getting tossed around I don't think I had a full conversation with any one person even like all of my friends which was insane it was kind of just like I'm over here I'm over here I'm here okay I'm gonna leave it there I think that's a lot of question I hope you guys love this studio vlog let me know what you think however you want to and if you have any more questions let me know I hope you have an awesome day and thank you much for watching bye also is it really late that I'm wearing a shirt that I designed for like a bet the bed that I like it was an actual bunch but I don't know if it's like maybe I'm coming outside no no it's fine [Music] Oh
