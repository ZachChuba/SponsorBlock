today we're going to make a classic british comfort food dish bangers and mash [Music] now in case you don't know bangers and mash is just sausages with mashed potato and usually some gravy and maybe peas bangers and mash is a classic british comfort dish it's really really simple there's nothing elaborate about what we're doing today but it's a fantastic pub favorite and classic comfort food so the sausages i've got today are these heck sausages which are 97 pork they're a mixture of fatty and lean pork and i find them to be quite a good sausage the remaining three percent is things like rice flour salt spices and of course the casing so first thing to do is to get these into the pan we're going to cook these really slowly so that they go tender and so that they brown all over and produce some nice browning in the pan so i would place these sausages kind of midway between the really cheap sausages that are just like a pork and rusk paste in a skin and the best sausages you can get from the butcher these are kind of mid-range sausages and i like them so i'm just going to put those on the back burner there and i just want them to sizzle away gently we're going to cook them really slow next i've got some potatoes this is a variety called estima it's a yellow potato that's got a smooth flesh and is ideal for mashing potatoes come in different varieties ranging from flowery at one end to waxy at the other these are somewhere in the middle now you might be wondering why i'm doing sausages and mash why am i doing bangs and mash it's such a straightforward and almost no recipe dish that why am i making a video about it well this is going to be a collab again with my friend babatunde in nigeria he's very keen to try another british favorite recipe and a lot of the british recipes i would like to do with him require an oven which he hasn't got so we picked this one really because it can be done in pans on top of a burner perhaps one day i think he's thinking about getting a charcoal oven so perhaps we might be able to do some baking and other types of dishes that require oven cooking later on but at the moment we've got to kind of pick the things that fit the methods that are available to us really any variety of potato will do actually here and even sweet potatoes will be fine and this mashed sweet potato is really nice and goes very well with sausages so don't worry if you can't get the right kind of potatoes i believe that these kind of potatoes are called irish potatoes in nigeria as opposed to potatoes which are what we would call sweet potatoes the only thing that's probably not likely to work all that well for mashing is if you've got salad potatoes they might not mash up very well this little potato peeler i like it a lot actually it's takes very nice thin peelings off of the potatoes if i was just going to boil these potatoes and have them whole i would probably leave the skins on because a lot of the nutrition is in the skin but for mash we do need peeled potatoes okay now because we're mashing these we can cut them into fairly small pieces and they'll cook a bit quicker because of that but the important thing here is to try and keep the pieces a consistent size so that they will cook fairly evenly across the whole across the whole batch and then potatoes into a pan of cold water we'll have a tiny bit of salt in there because i won't be adding salt to the mash in fact the butter i've got to add to the mash later is unsalted butter and then the third component of what we're making today is going to be onion gravy so i've just got a medium sized onion and i'm going to cut that into thin slices and then these onions are just going to be fried ever so gently again i'm going to cook them really slowly in a pan just with a tiny bit of vegetable oil there i'm going to cook that slowly so that they soften and caramelise without going crispy if you've only got a single burner this part could be done ahead of time cooking the onions down until they're caramelized and soft could easily be done ahead of time now if you're going to find this dish a little bit under spiced this is the part where you could toss in a scotch bonnet into the onions here chop that up mix that in with the onions and fry that down and give it a little bit of extra pepper so you can see these onions are starting to caramelize now and just to help them along i'm just going to put a little bit of sugar in the pan not necessary at all but i find that that helps the onions to really brown and caramelize so we'll just move those around let them pick up that sugar the juices from the onions will dissolve the sugar and then the heat will turn that into a nice dark brown tasty sweet caramel keeping things nice and slow in this pan here i think we're probably about ready to put the potatoes on so potatoes we're just going to put on the front burner here you can see that there's fat and juices starting to come out the sausages now and that's great we're not going to throw any of that away because the fat and pan drippings from these sausages is going to form the basis of our gravy and you see what's happening to these onions now they've softened right down and they've started to turn brown but they're not brown and crispy they're sort of brown and gooey we're almost making a kind of onion jam here these sausages have still got a little way to go but i just want to show you what's happening here because we're cooking these really slow instead of the skins just going crispy they're these sticky bits appearing and that's where the juices from the meat are coming out and reducing and browning on the pan and so we're creating a quite different experience here for eating these sausages than we would if we just cook them really quick or cook them in an oven even all of these sticky bits basically a flavor and we're just trying to encourage as much of that as we can in these sausages right so these sausages are getting pretty close to done now they've got a really nice golden brown color on them and they're looking pretty even potatoes yeah they're breaking apart now you can see that when i try and pick them up with a knife they just fall off which means they're done now this might be different for sweet potatoes you just got to judge when you think they're going to be soft enough to mash but these potatoes are definitely done now so this might seem like the strangest thing ever but i'm going to save the water i'm going to save the water from these potatoes because this we're going to use to make our gravy so i will set that starchy potato water aside this pan of potatoes now completely drained but we're going to leave it open like that so that some of the steam can leave it and that'll give us a fluffier mashed potato i'm going to add in a good chunk of butter put that in on top and the warmth of the potatoes can melt that down you might add a bit more in a minute and while those are steaming a little bit there and that butter's melting we'll go over and make the gravy sausages are cooked completely to my satisfaction here some people might like them a little bit more crisp than that i tend to like them as brown as that i find if i cook them any further than that they start to dry out so we've got this pan that's got you can see the brown juices from the sausages have caramelized in the bottom of the pan there and we've got what looks like about a tablespoon and a half of fat from the sausages we're not going to waste any of that so i'm just going to add in to start with about a tablespoon full of plain flour i'm just going to mix that in and see how it goes we'll mix that into the fat i think we can probably go for a bit more about maybe another half tablespoon full so the amount of flour you use here is going to depend on the amount of fat you've got from your sausages but it's about the same in volume as fat so if there's about a tablespoon full of fat you want about a tablespoon full of flour and i'm just going to cook this now this is a bit like making a roux except we're using the lard from the sausages instead of butter so just going to fry that off to cook the flour and keep it on the move because we want to try and release some of that crusty stuff off the bottom of the pan there as well so now that the flour's had a nice little sizzle in the fat i'm going to add in some of that water from the potato and now we've got to keep it on the move well in fact i think i need to turn the heat down because this is where it's going to thicken and turn into a gravy so keep it on the move and we're just going to keep on stirring onto the bottom of the pan to release those bits of crusty stuff that we're on there from the sausages so yeah that's thickened up really well we're going to put some more of this liquid in here it's looking good now it's going to need a little bit more liquid and i've got some left but rather than putting that straight into there i'm going to put that in the onion pan there and deglaze this a bit as well because there's some caramel that's on the bottom of this pan from these onions so i don't want to lose that that's all flavor so we'll just deglaze the onion pan and then get those onions in there with the rest of the gravy you can see how that has added a bit more brown to the color of the gravy a little taste for gauging the seasoning level yeah definitely could handle a bit of salt in there so we could put a stock cube in there but i'm going to put some marmite in or off-brand marmite maybe about a level teaspoon full which again will contribute to the color as well as the flavor that's starting to look really good let's see what it tastes like oh that's good that's got a real deep umami sort of flavor now from that marmite and of course from all the bits of the pan drippings from the sausages that have come off the bottom so i'm going to turn that right down now and just let that simmer while we make the mash i've got a little bit more liquid from the potatoes if i need to loosen this up a bit more before we serve i can easily do that so mashed potatoes now i'll talk while i'm mashing these before any of the hate comments appear let me just say there are lots of different ways to mash potatoes and lots of different people like them the way they like them a lot of people will like their mashed potatoes to be very buttery and very creamy i personally like them to be a bit coarse and lumpy and a bit on the fluffy side because i find that they absorb gravy better that way the only people who are wrong about mashed potatoes is the people who say there's only one way to do them and it's their way there are a hundred different ways to do mashed potatoes if you like them smooth and creamy and buttery if you like to add cream and milk and maybe some people add an egg i think then do that have them the way you like them the only sense in which you're going to get it wrong is if you don't end up making what you intended to make okay that is actually about as far as i want to mash those potatoes i like them to have a few little lumps in there still that's my personal preference some people like to pass them through a sieve and end up with something that's very smooth and more power to you if that's what you like do it the way you like it so here it is so mashed potatoes is that enough for you yeah these lovely sausages jenny how did you want to yeah okay i'll start with two right now whoops oh looks like looks like i'm having three please help yourself to create there's a spoon there to make it easy okay and so all that just needs is some of that nice onion gravy and there we go classic bangers and mash and i think a little bit of whole grain mustard just my preference to have a bit of mustard with sausages okay let's get stuck in so nice what's the verdict jenny yeah very nice yep you could probably comfort food i think sausage mash so where we cook these sausages really slowly in the pan they've stayed really tender and juicy inside at the same time has been completely cooked and really nicely browned on the outside so there we go that's how i cook back as mash now having said all of that about my mashed potato and your mashed potato and so on i am really interested to know what your preferences are so by all means tell me how you like mashed potato just maybe don't say it's the only way to do it so thanks for watching i hope you'll join me in watching babatunde's version of this in nigeria i think that's going to be interesting actually because he's never had sausages and mash before so thanks for watching and i hope to see you again soon [Music] you
