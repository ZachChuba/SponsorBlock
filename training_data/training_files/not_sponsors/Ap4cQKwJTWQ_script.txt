during our secret shopper project we discovered that while some pre-built gaming systems offer a solid value in terms of their performance with Tier one providers like HP and Dell you can often run into proprietary parts limited upgrade ability and configurability and questionable software load outs that can affect the overall experience so the popularity of machines that are built from retail parts by smaller system integrators like iBUYPOWER or main gear is understandable boutique builders in particular don't always hit the best performance per dollar but what most of these shops offer is a high degree of customize ability and more transparency into the actual components you're buying now a lot of you watching our channel would look down on the idea of buying a pre-built computer but consider this what if a well-known and respected manufacturer came out offering the type of system that would be similar to what you would end up configuring for yourself and at a reasonable price offering a turnkey solution with a solid warranty well that is what Corsair tried to do with the Vengeance gaming PC 50 180 let's see if it's worth your hard-earned money Thursday boots comm /l tt we'll have that linked below [Music] so let us cover the four pillars of any gaming system price quality performance and support which together help us determine the value of this thing after spread shooting the components all together and checking non sale prices through both Amazon and Newegg it turned out that the prices of the parts came to just over $2,100 this means that Corsair is marking up this machine 12 to 13 percent or about $300 over regular Street pricing but it's not time to make a final judgment here just yet first let's dig a little deeper Corsairs markup also includes assembly and two years of warranty support on the completed system and check this out Corsair has multiple RMA centers for their machines so depending where you're located you might not end up having to ship the machine which is currently only available directly from Corsair all the way back to them if you run into an issue what's even better is they'll cover shipping both to and from the service depot and they'll even send you replacement packaging if you tossed out your original box that's pretty rad at least on paper when it comes to the next pillar quality well we'll start with that aforementioned packaging our array arrives protected with open celled foam and had this peered contraption to ensure that the graphics card wouldn't snap out of the slot you know it's kind of ghetto looking but hey if it works it isn't stupid so no complaints there cabling was neat on the front and tightly bundled on the back chamber and we didn't have really I mean any gripes with the machines construction quality overall we did wonder why they would use a 240 millimeter AIO to cool a non k processor in a B Series board but the answer here is most likely for the looks and a single 120 millimeter cooler would have made the system look kind of asymmetrical the only thing that really stood out here was Corsairs use of an 80 plus bronze 750 watt power supply now to be clear it's a decent 2nd gen unit from their CX series and five year warranty so I guess the logic here was that more people would care to have 750 watts than would care if it had higher efficiency which is a trade that they could have easily made moving on to the performance in a massive surprise - absolutely no one in games our machine performed exactly as a core i7 eighty seven hundred plus an RT X twenty eighty should turbo boost on our CPU worked correctly our GPU reached anywhere from 1935 to 1950 megahertz while gaming and we never heard more than a low hum from the direction of the tower no cooling issues and no weird fan ramping behavior or anything like that to report it's almost like Corsair has a lot of experience when it comes to PC cooling now as for storage our SSD uses a fine controller and it sits on an X two PCI Express laws so as expected that puts it somewhere in between a SATA SSD and an enthusiast class nvme one and while Corsair applied no performance optimizations to the UEFI BIOS no factory profile saved even everything worked out of the box without an issue now when it comes to pre-purchase and post-purchase support well we didn't have a chance to actually test the latter due to this being a review unit which was not secret shoppers so we couldn't stage a tech support scenario or anything like that maybe in the future let us know in the comments if you'd like to see that and as for pre-purchase support well disappointingly it actually does not exist at all you see Corsair presently has just four machines available on their site all of them none configurable with the other three being Corsair ones with the closest configuration their commanding a much higher price while using the same class of graphics card maybe ok conspiracy theory moment here maybe Corsair doesn't want to have a sales rep because that person would just spend all day down selling customers to the Vengeance I don't know that's pure speculation anyway let's get back to the value conversation because it's the most complicated part of this video compared to configuring a system over on iBUYPOWER trying to include as many of the same components as possible corks airs pricing actually looks really solid for our vengeance PC but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm happy with it before I can explain why we need a little bit of history now in spite of their wide portfolio covering the vast majority of PC components from cooling to cases to RAM and storage Corsair surprised everyone when they introduced the Corsair 1 a fully integrated ready to ship system like Windows pre-installed in everything for gamers not because anyone thought they weren't capable I mean obviously there are plenty of people at Corsair who know how to assemble a gaming tower but rather for business reasons by branching out into completed systems Corsair stood to alienate the same partners system integrators like main gear and ibuypower who I mentioned before that they rely on for a significant chunk of their business by effectively competing with them directly and potentially unfairly since Corsair obviously has more profit margin on a Corsair power supply than a reseller of Corsair power supplies could now Corsair story at the time was the one is unique it's too difficult to assemble to offer this chassis as a standalone case so it doesn't really compete with anyone elses offerings but like this one this is the Vengeance PC a fully built gaming PC from Corsair using all off-the-shelf components so is it a great value well it is if you were gonna buy exactly these parts anyway but it's not if you were the kind of person who was more likely to spend their hard-earned money on raw performance so Corsair was in kind of a unique position here to use some of the extra profit margin that they gained by being the manufacturer of both the components and the finished system to deliver great performance and flashy aftermarket looks but by choosing a non overclockable cpu and a B 360 motherboard at this price point I do feel like they fell a little short of that goal if that was their goal and you know I have to wonder if maybe this was on purpose to avoid disrupting the market whatever reason there was for it the good news is that we have no qualms about the quality of the system or Corsairs ongoing existence if you ever need support so as they continue to expand into this business I think vengeance gaming pcs are gonna get only more interesting to gamers as time go on that is the ones that don't feel like DIY either for themselves or for their friends because as it goes with pre-built you could get a faster computer if you built it yourself then again maybe of course they're doesn't care I'm sure they'd be happy to sell you their components -
