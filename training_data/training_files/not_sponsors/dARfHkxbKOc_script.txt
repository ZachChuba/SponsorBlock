[Music] today is a bittersweet day you know it's been fun doing tech linked but I think it's time for me to go away for two weeks yeah yeah did I not let's say that's two weeks leave now ah I'll be back guys look bro we get it you vape but you might not be able to blow six strawberry flavored clouds for much longer if the current vape pocalypse continues New York is set to join Michigan in banning flavored East cigarettes Governor Andrew Cuomo on Sunday called vaping dangerous and said that it is addicting young people to nicotine at a very early age so the state is issuing an emergency regulation banning all vape flavors except tobacco and menthol meanwhile a group of Democratic senators are calling for a nationwide ban on flavored East cigarette products and a crackdown on sites like eBay selling counterfeit and legitimate vaping products despite that being illegal this comes less than a week after President Trump announced his administration would seek a similar ban and all this comes after the CDC revised the National number of illnesses linked to vaping from 450 to 380 though the number of vaping related deaths hasn't changed at six those medical incidents are believed to have something to do with contaminants in counterfeit black market or home mixed vape liquids so if you're gonna vape buy the good stuff or do what I do just stick your head in the freezer to see your breath it's basically that's so crazy other things like the same why do you mean another just meant banning flavors of it yeah no those are fine yeah yeah yeah yeah those are yeah it's the dista strawberry in a Wall Street Journal report Amazon has been accused of manipulating search results to favor more profitable products rather than more relevant or best-selling listings the shopping giant reportedly optimized their search algorithm in this way last year so that Jeff Bezos could buy more colossal yachts which are to be fair very nice do they ooh but Amazon tried to be sneaky about it rather than just assigning a profitability value to certain products then boosting the most profitable products they made the algorithm prioritize factors that correlate with profitability that way the feds won't be none the wiser indeed The Wall Street Journal says Amazon's lawyers vetoed a proposal to add profitability directly to the algorithm because it would create trouble with antitrust regulators now companies change things to maximize profit all the time but this is lame because I could be looking for one of those cool travel mugs that looks like a camera lids you know but instead of sending me to the the one that's high quality and reasonably priced they sent me to the chief knockoff one and then I'm spilling coffee all over my shirt you know and and everyone knows it's not actually a lens but it's a coffee mug I don't want to find myself in such an embarrassing situation plus I'll have to buy new shirts but that won't be so bad because LTE LTE store.com and I hope this is the last time we have to report on pixel for leaks but there are more so we know we're getting a pixel four and pixel four XL soon but a new Geekbench listing describes a Google pixel 4 XL 5g which is presumably a third different model well maybe the regular pixel for Excel has 5g I hear you say I knew it but that's not true because the pixel for Excel has been shown to have six gigs of ram in the torrential downpour of leaks we've already seen while this model has eight gigabytes and guess what else code found in the new camera app for Android contains references to another device codenamed needlefish which is rumored to be the cheaper pixel for a now it seems a bit soon for Google to release a foray just a few months after we got the pixel 3a but who knows we'll have to wait until October 15th because that is the official date now for Google to put an end to all these leaks because they're really taking the jive out of my lock you know really taking the pep out of my step I used to I used to be like just like that's me walking you're more spider-man so true now it's time for quick bits brought to you by the mass drop X Sennheiser open-back HD 58 x jubilee headphones

about this morning as gizmo docena the verge and more got a hands-on look at the games available and gadget said arcades best selling point is that it has games you'll actually want to play yeah stop playing games you don't want to play guys like that does it make sense I play for tonight for work apparently some users on the iOS 13 beta already have access so if you have it let us know what it's like to play games that are actually good for once they're not quite at pixel for levels but leaks have revealed the rumored specifications for Microsoft Surface pro 7 with configurations ranging from an Intel Core i3 with 4 gigs of ram to an intel core i7 with 16 gigs of ram that's not super interesting but what might be is a 15 inch surface laptop powered by a AMD processor we're also expecting to see a snapdragon powered notebook and a dual screen device at microsoft's event on October 2nd so hold on to your butt's until then or grab on to a your mustache half-life is not dead no matter what you say to me I will believe that especially considering recent evidence publicized by valve news network valve developer Carrie Davis gave a talk recently and disclosed that Valve is working on a flagship VR title and signs point to it being released this coming year even James could be could be cool though we are Borderlands 3 launched this weekend and despite the enormous backlash the game received for signing up as an epic game store exclusive gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford claimed that on PC the peak concurrent number of players on launch day was twice that of Borderlands 2 now of course the epic game store doesn't publicize player numbers so there's no way to verify this and there being more players doesn't really diminish the fact that people are experiencing performance issues with the game and its DRM might have a keylogger in it but hey that's good nice job Randy and vivo has fully unveiled the next three a smartphone that is chock full of cool stuff including a bezel-less waterfall screen a pop-up camera a 5g support and a 64 megapixel main camera that's a part of a three camera array yeah China gets all the good phones wait alright that's quite enough come back on Wednesday for more tech news and I'll see you guys I think it's October 7th and I will have an accent you may not even notice me goodbye that's not how the French people talk
