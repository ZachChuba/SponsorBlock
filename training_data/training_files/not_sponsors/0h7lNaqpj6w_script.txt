[Music] the official release date of Microsoft Flight Simulator is still very much an unknown quantity and with that in mind many people are very eager to try this simulator out and also of course to help where they can with development and this is where alpha excess comes in now alpha access is a naturally covered by a very strict NDA you once you're in there you can't talk about it and you can't show footage or pretty much anything at all relating to what you're seeing on what you do in there but nonetheless people have still want in now many people are in we don't know the numbers is tightly in the hundreds quite possibly in the thousands and the Sobo are accepting a new applicants over time and over the past few weeks what I've noticed are some comments in my videos as well as on dy/du internet asking precisely hell you can get into the alpha so I thought I'd put together this video to help help with that particular question the first place you want to head then is the official website - flight simulator dot-com it's a fairly simple process but it has thrown a few people out especially when it doesn't always work now in it - I click on the login at the top regardless of whether you've actually got a login or not this is your Microsoft account if you haven't got one laying that you can create one here now once you're logged in you'll be sent to the insider page this is a little bit different to the front page you've got an O bit of extra information here such as the development roadmap as well as are some other bits and bobs at the top you'll find what you want is the flightiness sign up and there's one a really important thing you should keep in mind here this will not be available at all times it's only available during the periods where Microsoft they're accepting applications it just so happens that they are accepting applications right now so click the links below and head on in there and sign up if you haven't done so already the first thing you will come to is the NDA you will need to read this and then agree to it it's only a short in do you but you know if you're not sure you don't agree with it then don't proceed and of course if you intend to break it then don't proceed either because you're just going to get yourself in trouble now once you decide to accept this if you decide to accept it you'll lend the find yourself presented with a survey I'm not going to go through this every step because of what you'll need to do is choose your own answers don't follow what other people say don't follow what I say this one here I'm just going through it randomly here with a completely different email address because I've already signed up and I've already been accepted but I just want you to see what to expect so basically be as truthful as you can there's no right or wrong answers here probably the question that's given people most pause is when the survey asks you how many hours you've had in flight simulators now some of you have watched my videos I've seen haven't played flight simulators before others of you are experts and hardcore simulators have probably got more than 500 hours now here's the thing this doesn't seem to have a huge impact on whether or not you actually get invited I've seen people who have said that they've got no flight simulator experience whatsoever get accepted and I've also seen people with a $500 plus get accepted and of course people who have put in that the same answers still awaiting acceptance they're not in yet so yeah be honest here it's just a case of Microsoft looking for a broad spectrum of users versus the survey is pretty much the same it asks how often you play fly simulators and that then goes on to your preferences what type of gameplay you prefer and what type of gameplay you intend to try out again be honest eventually you'll come to the question about the speed of your internet now I'm sure most people were bound to answer this a few and may not if you're not sure what the speed of your internet connection is then head to the website speedtest.net from here you'll be able to get all the information you need now in case you're wondering why Microsoft want to know the speed of your internet connection well that's quite simply because a flight simulator 2020 has some pretty hefty internet requirements now wisely graphics are processed locally what's going on here is that the geometry and some of the terrain of the calculations for that are being processed on the azure servers and then are streamed to the end-user so essentially the better your internet connection the better your final results now I want to recommend the line here about your internet connection however do keep in mind that obviously if you've got slow speeds and your game performance may suffer from it and you may a stand better chances of getting in better internet requirements or better internet connections finally a Microsoft will want to know about your PC specifications to send them this you can use your DirectX diagnostic stolen send them the report which will include all the information they in need to know there's instructions on the screen on the website how to load this up once you've got the Dex tool open then just save all information and to save the file somewhere you'll need to save it as an XML format don't upload the text version because that's not what they're asking for so at that point you've essentially have your alpha application complete you may have to wait the world before you hear back from Microsoft that they are taking a while to get people in but in some cases people are getting in very quick so there's pretty much an unknown quantity there now if you're still a bit curious and you want to know the types of pcs that have been accepted into the Alpha then there's a very good spreadsheet I linked over on the reddit sub-forum there's a link also below to this fridge you can see on screen right here but essentially what you can do is say check out your chances of getting invited by checking out the hardware that other people have and whether or not they actually got in so then that pretty much brings us to the end of this video nobody hope it helps out those who still had questions about the whole process as a way as our thanks for watching and I guess you guys and girls next time
