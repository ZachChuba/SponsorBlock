[Music] [Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel today I'm going to be showing you how to make three home decor DIYs for your home I really enjoy making glam DIYs because it's definitely my style these are super easy and affordable to make I hope you find any of these ideas helpful and inspiring to create them for your home give this video a thumbs up if you love glam just as much as I do and want to see more if you're new here welcome or loved to have you part of our YouTube family so don't forget to subscribe in video now let's go ahead and get started with these DIYs for the first DIY you will need a hot glue gun round mirror acrylic gems and bling wrap taking my hot glue gun I'm adding the glue around the mirror frame to attach the bling wrap for this project if you don't want the frame block you can spray paint the frame whatever color you want but I love the way black and silver looks [Music] you will have leftover bling wrap on the top so I'm going to take my hot glue gun and apply glue right under the wrap then I'm gonna press it down with the scissors next I'm gluing the gemstone and they will cover the bling wrap I added a short line of glue and put the gems on then did another short line and so on I don't want the glue to dry so that's why I do it this way [Music] they have different colors you can use instead of the clear gems this is just an idea to help you get started now that the outer frame is covered in the gems I'm going to cover the inside of the frame here's how the tray looks and I really like the jumps covering the frame but I'm going to try something new I had some extra gems that I decided to add to the bottom of the frame here's how it all turned out when you add the extra jumps on the bottom or leave it like it was without it I just had this in mind and decided to go ahead and add them and gives it a different look was still very pretty this can be an entryway table tray bathroom tray to hold many towels makeup jewelry or perfume bottles the ideas go on and on for the next DIY you will need a hot glue gun ice puck it from the Dollar Tree party section rhinestone wrap from Hobby Lobby and two bags of the acrylic gems taking the rhinestone wrap I'm wrapping it around the ice bucket to give it an extra glam look stretch it out while doing so because otherwise it will look crooked since the ice bucket is in a solid shape next I'm adding a line of hot glue to put the gems on top after I made a row with the gems I'm adding another row below it skipping two gems I wanted a little bit of a cluster look here and here's the final result I really like the way it turned out what do you guys think I styled it with some hydrangeas that I like keeping out year long because they're so pretty you can add whatever color flowers you want or you can just use it as an ice bucket what it was actually made for another idea on how you can style this piece is adding some mini washcloths put in your bathroom to glam it up let me know if you guys would make this and where do you put it I put it here on my entryway table but it would also look beautiful on a nightstand in your bedroom [Music] [Music] for the last DIY you will need a flower glass face silver napkin rings around glass candle holder and bling wrap in a previous key oh I used the rhinestone wrap to wrap it around the round candle holder you can do this too or use the bling wrap from Dollar Tree I like the rhinestone wrap better because it makes it look like you bought it in a store taking my hot glue gun I'm adding a little bit of glue to stack the napkin rings up I want to make a candle holder and put this inside to give it a different glam look you don't have to do this step if you don't want to but I'm going to show you at the end how it looks like so you can see which one you like better then I'm adding more glue to the bottom of the vase so I can put the round candle holder on top and here's the final result I simply added the napkin ring stack in and if you want a permanent look with them you can hot glue it to the inside of the candle holder I love candle holders they're one of my favorite DIYs to make as well because there are so many ways that they can all be different and beautiful I like the clear glass look of the candle holder and it would be very pretty to have as a set you can make a set of three or one like I did let
