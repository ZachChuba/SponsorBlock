protectors protect your screen like really really well before that though check out this so razor is updating the blade advanced as you might expect it is now going to be available with an art CX 2060 that is a non max Q that is a full-fledged r-tx 2060 or an RT X 2070 or 2080 even both of those ones with max Q design as in video says also known as with the clock speeds throttled a little bit but that's not even the most important thing they changed about this kit and get in here get in here to check this out okay so first of all that right there yes my friends we've got windows hello with the IR camera so finally Alex can stop complaining about Razer laptops not having that feature and come check this out oh and you're probably like whoa what was the big deal there I don't really get it hold on a second where's my where's mine here okay okay now we look at it side by side the secondary functions of the keys are illuminated I have been complaining about this yes this is a huge bummer for me actually being that backlighting on the secondary functions of the F keys and the number row is no longer backlit which sucks because these are the things that I'm most likely to have trouble remembering in the dark three years they traded having all the functions illuminated for chroma and I was like really guys really we're killing functionality over RGB well now we can have both and the best thing is they didn't have to change the key switches so these are still the same ones that both Alex and I liked from the original blade advanced there's a couple of other tweaks it can now accept up to 64 gigs of RAM though Razer doesn't currently have any plans to offer a configurator on their site so you could actually have it shipped with that so they're all 16 gig configurations out of the box they have tuned the speakers a little bit and I think that's much the majority of it still 144 Hertz display but on the display front there's some other interesting news they've got a prototype here with a 240 Hertz display silky-smooth it's only 1080p but if I was an eSports player a 240 Hertz display with an r/t X 2060 would be a pretty nice place to be in terms of a cost to performance and experience ratio and this one right here is the one that really grabbed our attention when we walked in the room this has a prototype OLED display and they haven't really well they don't have anything to really tell us about when we could expect to see something like this or even if the OLED manufacturers are gonna figure out the burnin issues that have plagued them up until this point but Wow does it ever look good it looks exactly like you'd expect as good as OLED but on a laptop razer also has a monitor it's up to 144 Hertz it's got Razer chroma RGB in the bass free sync and ah yes right this is going to be their claim to fame on this guy the forged aluminum stand that still manages to have height adjust so that's pretty nice and built-in cable management so these are USB so you can plug in your peripherals and then it's got a single type see that it uses as an uplink and then also HDMI and yep yeah this one's tethered to a power brick down here $6.99 for that guy so that's all pretty good stuff but the coolest thing we saw was actually on the peripheral side for a change I don't even think we've made a video about razors peripherals in their suite in at least a couple of years but this is something that once again I thought I was going to think that it was stupid but then it was far less stupid than I thought I would think it would be so this is razors vibrating headphones which we reviewed recently and said well actually not that stupid now now we see maybe not the end game but certainly the next step in the game because everything that I am touching right now that is to do with my gaming experience has haptic feedback so this wrist rest has a haptic motor over here on the left exactly where you'd rest your hand on WASD and it's strong enough that you can actually kind of feel it throughout the keyboard but subtle enough that it's not just like well you know old haptics or you're holding the controller and it's like like it's not like that the mouse has a haptic motor in the palm and then the chair actually has haptic feedback in this this rear cushion here and the way that this works is just like the headphones where depending on the direction that sound is coming from so it uses surround sound data it gives you a haptic response so as you're stepping around you can actually feel it in the keyboard as you use your jetpack you can actually feel the rumble behind you and if you fire a rocket for example and turn around you feel it in the back and if you fire a rocket and it's in the front you feel it more in your keyboard and in your mouse even though overwatch doesn't have any specific tuning for these peripherals it works shockingly well now razors vision for the future is that they would actually be able to get this technology integrated into games and I'm sure they'd love to see a wide variety of different peripherals and wearables to enhance the gaming experience and I don't think they really envision it as something that's for competitive players but if you're just looking for immersion it is shocking how not dumb the whole thing feels even in these very early stages so I think that solution on their hands and you can check it out at the link below so thanks for watching guys don't miss any of our CES 2019 coverage by making sure you're subscribed to the channel on the front of the shirt
