so destroy one block with one click at this point I found it I actually found a base what's gonna yes my name is CPT welcome back to another video on my channel today guys this video is this video where there will be some gameplay from IM fish what's giving you guys my name is CP k welcome back to another video on my channel today i'm back with a new episode of Kingdom crafts where we are going to be taking on the new challenge this one right here next event mid November well guess what it's mid November and we're being dealt with the headhunter who's right here look at all of these heads that are available instructions I did briefly read them in last video but in case you didn't see it I'll read them to you very quickly now scavenger hunt from November 16th to November 30th to collect unique heads for the headhunter prizes are awarded for the number of heads collected please redeem them from the chest when you have handed in the head quests duplicates don't count towards so this guy has a total of 50 heads there's 49 left because I already handed one in and we need to get them so we can get these rewards so I've already taken this reward because I had the correct thing so we have a sharpen a 6 book now which I might just err that's already got shrapnel 7 I might swipe it on the sword but I guess not but there's a whole bunch of other ones that we can also collect so today we're gonna be head hunting it's basically this heads from mobs now you guys don't remember probably in the last episode that I got a head from a pig and I just put it on my wall because I was like why don't we go hose from a pig now I know why I got one so no more shenanigans Scott's got to stop leaving these things behind a diamond diamond diamond on the topic of Scott um so it turns out it was Scott who Scott rated me which is not it's not great is it it's not great so I didn't know that obviously at the time when I went to the end I found out afterwards so mean Scott recorded go into the end and then his video came out about two hours later so I was none the wiser so for everyone who left comments thinking of funny saying early got baited then he went to the end with I didn't know okay I didn't know I have a plan I have a recording setup tomorrow with a couple of people where we will be we'll be fixing the problem that is Scott that's what we'll be doing we'll be getting some retaliation some much-deserved retaliation let's do our quick run into the back portrait and out and then that'll be it for us peg now I definitely want TNT I don't think that stuff can stay I don't need it I don't need it but the good news here is guys it is nighttime so we can actually just go and head hunt which is what I wanted to do anyway first things first I'm just gonna go quickly see if I can get a new Godric quest I don't believe I have one right now unless I do know just I only have Fisher player which I forgot to do with Scott wait a minute look it's Halloween it's that mask people Halloween master zombie skeleton zombie Duncan skeleton girl are they up there how do we get up there let me in hey kill 50 zombies well I'll probably to kill a bunch of zombies to uh to actually get the stuff I need so luckily he only got into these random chests that I have left over this must really upset you watching this I'm so sorry I promise I'll clean these up my fingers were crossed haha so I do actually have the pig head on me already so we're gonna right click confirm to start the pig head hunt and then was gonna hand him in the pig head there we go so head collected so that's only the second one we've done now so running on two so we got a lot more to get so we are gonna warp to Amity and then we're gonna go into the deserts which is where there's a lot of mobs hanging around and we'll be able to hopefully pick up some kills and grab us some extra heads because this is a very fun challenge and I want to make sure I actually get all the stuff from this you know the last couple of challenges we've had I wasn't able to play so now I am I want to ensure that we're getting everything we can out of this and also we'll get good XP from Lunas - so that's nice oh look at that look at that on the floor it's a creeper head oh and it's a husk head creeper and husk so okay so now we can stop I mean we can't stop killing them because there are be still gonna come try and kill us but we can focus on things like spiders now this looting for sword is so unreal again so many rewards it's crazy ooh a witch um be kind just rub your head nope what's that zombie villager Oh too fair I want to get my zombie villager things out you guys told me how I can cure a zombie villager and I could have a little army of my own villagers just in my house that would be sick why's it so dark what has happened why did it get so dark what what has happened what on earth just happened why did my game get so dark I am so lost that has to be like a shader error or something right alright I'm looking back in oh it's a storm I don't think it should have got that dark that was unreal how dark I got is that just tears in the desert I'm I'm so confused that was absolutely terrifying honestly I really thought like my game had broken honestly all I won is a skeleton and a spider head I mean that's definitely more as well but I mean primarily right now that's what I'm after maybe I should kill him with a sword to ensure I get looting I went after looting even makes a difference in this it probably doesn't honestly I feel so bad when I have to kill the nice mobs I'm so sorry fun question can you put looting on a bow and arrow is that thing all the scarrans are dying now No if they die without me hitting them I definitely don't get the drop and pretty sure okay so I have two more heads which is a total of four heads I will have idea to six before I can take the next reward rabbit if you just drop your head I wouldn't have to kill you like this honestly all right let's go for things like chicken heads as well then while we're here I don't know what the percent drop chance is that you get ahead honestly I have no idea and the pig one we got pretty easily obviously because we have a pig spawner that was gonna be too tough I don't have an actual zombie one yet so I could definitely do that there's weather on this game is stressing me out but what should I get a head from this cow well I lied I'm so sorry I didn't mean to lie to you all it's just the game hates me and doesn't give me what I want and or need I'm assuming there's a head for every animal like that's what I'm guessing I mean I guess I could be wrong but I would assume there's one for every animal okay let me still check ways guy hit yeah is a chicken cow sheep they're all here so let's take creeper head and hand this one in give me a creeper head there you go sir and then I have a husk head for you as well give me a husk head I certainly will whilst I was just having a quick look there at the lists they're available I just found something very very interesting and I'd like to I'd like to show you guys I think you're gonna be very intrigued by this so I've decided to take a small chunk of my my TNT with me at eighty four to be exact very small chunk and we're actually going to do Bob spawn you may be thinking Callen why are you going to spawn with 84 TNT and well the answer is because of course it's nighttime and I'm gonna go back home because it to be daytime so that's the first thing but then once we've slept I'll tell you the real reason why instead of walking to spawn we're gonna walk to the volcano top which is very very neat now thanks to Lou what a legend but once we get up here I'm gonna show you what I've discovered I've discovered some very interesting info first things first killer skeleton hearts even get head from it no of course we don't why would we we did get a chicken head though I saw that there we go nice and sadly no sheep head so now that were on top of this we can look around and see oh so many beautiful things but the thing that I have my eye on that I'm focused on is the flower kingdom now you may be wondering cv/gate why have you all of a sudden care about the flower kingdom well that's because if we do a /f list which tells us about the power of each individual faction this is the amount of land that you have claimed so I have 42 pieces of land claimed I have 68 pieces of land available so I can claim another 26 pieces of land without getting any penalty if I die I lose to here so I'd go down to 66 then people can unclaimed land that I have claimed I was looking down everyone looks normal you know all good all good all good all good until I went to page two when I saw that yeah me only is allowed 15 pieces but she has 20 so we can now cruise in an unclaimed some of Yami's land I'm pretty sure and start looking to see if we can find her bass we have five chunks that we'll be able to unclaimed I have absolutely zero idea what chunk her bass is in so I'm going in completely blind I'm gonna use the map and I'm gonna try and work out whereabouts like she would probably put it based on where she's got her stuff claimed I was gonna kill his horse because I needed that horse hurt yes so we've got handed in for that's gonna take us to six which I think means we get a new reward she's very exciting so let's get to the flower kingdom and do some maybe some of the most tactical rating that's ever happened okay so it appears someone may have beat me to this but it says Jamie has 20 pieces of land claimed and I only see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 one bit of flour is over here for some reason that's got to be where the base is right this one that's like a way on its own this has to be where the base is all right we're doing a sealed fashion wait I want to watch every single individual piece explode so oh this shows the chunk border so you can see here like where this line is this is one chunk this is a different chunk so I could unclaimed this and just dig down in fact the maybe we'll do that why not so let me see if any /f unclaimed one you pillaged one chunk and turned flour back to wilderness so now this is all this is all wilderness now oh my things just got very interesting okay I'm gonna dig down and it mean a torch is anything this through I got too excited about the thought of trying to raid someone like does yeah me even have a base at this point okay we got torches if I do slash back is actually gonna work and take them out to where I shouldn't be it's gonna take me back to my place where I just landed perfect love that for me yeah I'm not sure how or why yeah me died so many times that she now doesn't have in a faction power but that's just the way it goes I suppose I mean I've always been really careful not to die more than I can because I knew it would lose with a faction power okay we're back and we're armed with torches this time right let's just uh honestly that's the most satisfying noise ever I think the question is how far down would ya me build her base if it is here you know the problem here is that obviously I burn through the usage on this diamond pickaxe real quick what is this what is this giant cave I'm so confused so I just drove one block with one click at this point I found it I actually found a base no way oh boy oh my goodness I'm actually guys I'm actually in it's our first ever successful read I can break it all it's all it's all mine like I took the claim there's literally nothing that is safer I can take absolutely everything there's an unfinished room I I can't believe this worked to the spider spawner it's still there this is from when Joel came I think but what did Joel take did y'all take all her good stuff let's take a look around I mean I wasn't sure why expected by expecting there to be some juicy loop what is this ah this is disappointing everything is just named there's nothing here I'm taking a painting at the very least I'm in there maybe this is like just the area that she has to spawn it in but there's more stuff around in other places I'm trying to help out here I'm scanning the spider spawner going it sounds me how Joel going up there oh god oh god here they come huh Oh doh huh let's get out myself easy ow myself Oh Carissa yeah oh that I didn't can oh god they can I'm poisoning myself I'm going to die ow how has this happened okay I mean honestly I'm not gonna not do it it's a raid after all let there be war let there be war fear me for I am wall I don't even know that means that's what I'm saying whoa dented enter so yeah I mean obviously now I can basically come and go as I please I guess I kind of went a little half-hearted because it's my first read and I feel kind of bad destroying everything you know what I'll break her home bed how's that for some drama I am a she was gonna leave all the stuff on the floor too I don't I don't want any of it but that's that's definitely one way to do it for me I'm gonna make my way back out now take away this stuff leave behind no evidence maybe she won't see that the way I got in pretty successful I managed to dig straight down into it unsure what the chances are that honestly but amazing work by me by accident guy this is where I'm gonna leave the episode I think this has been unbelievably successful but before I go actually I'm gonna go back to spawn I am going to hand these in because I have some more heads where's horse head there it is give you a horse head there you go sir and I have a chicken head for you to confirm quest give me one chicken head they go sir so that should be six now I think right 44 yes I've given them six so I can take reward number two now which is gift one do we know what gift one does okay I have no idea what gift one does I'm assuming it's custom enchantment but no idea actually no idea guys thank you so much watching this video hopefully you'd enjoy me completing my first successful you can grab them all and I'll see you guys in the next video peace [Music] you
