alright folks welcome back to another episode of eggs or eeeh as always fingertips check it out anywho you um how is your how's your thing that you wired up is it working it's good it's pretty cool I've got I've got a pouch that I can just put ash into and all the things happen in the ash ends up here and it gets converted to the blocks and the blocks get converted there so now we can get all this stuff and then because the dust is automatically filtering over here and going in then that's running automatically so that means that we're getting diamonds and and ender dust that's misty but we're getting all those pieces just Auto magically so question the the ender chest runs into the compacting drawer which then runs in here okay yes okay and so the ash compacting drawer automatically pumps into these always yes okay cool let me try something out I'm gonna I'm gonna try it out I'm gonna try it out it's gonna be really cool when I you need the pouch to set it into the energy or do you have it already negative I do not it's going you've already worked it out quite magical yes indeed I just needed it's magically delicious yeah something along those lines definitely lucky terms that's I pretty sure that is isn't it is it Lucky Charms I think it might be yeah that's what came to mind but then I was like that always happened to me lucky charms and then I didn't know what to go from there so I you know hey here we are pretty sure that that is in fact the old lucky charm Rooskies okay well they're great that's not Lucky Charms surprisingly that's a frosted flakes tony the tiger frosted flakes are more than good that was your lying oh my god oh my god I you were supposed to be Tony the Tiger there Jesus they're great thank you I didn't know what what I didn't know I don't know that particular jingles so I was like okay really yeah that's the classic frosted flakes dude I mean you know what a bunch of yeah what a bunch of yeah what a bunch eat well I was gonna like I was gonna play off process Blake for snowflake and then as going into a whole Millennial boomers and I was like I just don't want to go there right now I just just leave about oh wait let's just see how this works here like a so and we should I'll see you okay check your check your enderchest it's getting stuff a lot of stuff nice dude did you tie into an enderchest of yourself no your chunk mining I just all you have to do is bind the back so to that particular this is not what I want oh my god all right all right sleepytime Wow way to rain on our parade geez man oh what the oh how that was kind of that was lame actually it came at almost just the right time though because you were just about filled up the chest huh because you fill it up a lot faster Nick an empty perfect but but yeah that that was that definitely was working I was looking at it and things were happening and everybody was happy oh it empties very quickly though because I know it does it does cycle through pretty well so I set up as best as I could that's pretty cool that's pretty so yeah I mean there's a pre this stuff kind of going in it's working so you know again it was an entire episode for that so I spent a good long time with that automation but still we got it it's I think worthwhile definitely good good stuff for sure and I got to throw more F ones around so it's always fun more f1 f1 ZF Ln f1 yes f1 exactly caught the races past weekend did you did know I was asking you you know f1 no no I've gotten in a NASCAR I haven't ever gotten in f1 Oh see I like I like the twisties NASCAR is is too over for me I mean that's cool if you're into it and stuff that's on the track but yeah it's usually birdie ovular for the most part vacuumer it's it's kind of like ovaries for the most part they're just they're just cruising around those fallopian search turns yes this is I think this is what they mean by the on-brand thing I'm just it's like the egg shop yes it's the egg shop no we're appropriate here we're appropriate why are you friend agent right now no no that was my line because I was worried about offending Stacey like I was I was doing the callback with you bud got it got it got it now I get basic resources like water or stone much easier with these machines and I need an ignoble extruder and an aqua cumulative yeah speaking of speaking of things to do what do we do here and I think I'm gonna have to set up another windmill to avoid resource miner controller and void botanic miner controller that I'm supposed to make somehow I'm complicated yeah you've got botanic avoid the botanic okay igneous Oh rock good I need moral ether right in the order to make you yes block of glass machine frame which is a bunch of tin on a miniaturization that everything else should be easy but the intricate circuit board requires the circuit board that's it right so the miniaturization is nothing too big it's Tim ice and pipe and let's take a look at the aqueous to see could be to do to it let's see as the void minor gotten any literate um it has not but it has acquired pulverized obsidian zinc dust redstone glowstone crushed quartz pulverized silver niobium pulverized aluminum nickel coal lead Lonsdale light crystal iron a tin and cobalt oh yeah server was not running oh right out the check in on that one you're right we need that we do happen that offline time passage happen would probably be quite helpful quite helpful alright so there's one alright got down at K now I just need to make a the the tin one so I am I thought we had somebody guess not alright mean the old literate which I guess can be got from the void minor with the crystal laser lens would be more ideal and the rhodium is got do that okay so we need the rhodium and we don't have any negative negative sadly all right well guess I'm gonna be making some with or a the old-fashioned way which we may be old-fashioned um I have enough to night but we might not also at the same time I feeling like very conflicted on whether we do or not like we we might movie also might not it's possible so could go either way you're not wrong yeah yi yi so I just went under that wire and what I did is I didn't jump not a problem yeah but the problem is then you're not moving at light speed but what I did is I didn't jump and it was not a problem yeah then you're not moving a light speed so that is an actual that is problem that's the problem mm-hmm there's your problem right there when I do oh right the in didn't deem dim dumb and dumb dumb dumb is smelted and then yeah right and dumb dumb dumb and dumb dumb and didn't name them neom and did it I'm that I'm doing them right and that gets us either throw something in here to catalyze and Timmy yeah the topes NDM would be better but it's in dim mininum and there's no reason that needed that em in there it could just be anything hey Alexa downstairs 272 thank you [Music] so also I kind of went back and forth and you know how to get had to kind of pass through this area a few times and what I did is I didn't jump and didn't get shocked yeah you see the problem with that though is that you're not moving at super speed oh yeah and that's that's a that's a big problem it's a big problem right right it is all coming back now it's a big big big issue issue humongous did you say too much humongous dude big to mungus you've got this big to mungus energy over here headed Oh even more alloys Wow working on the inductions Valtor magma crucible and flu Transposer no I'm working on the igneous extruder and the aquatic quad is Osso gotcha okay do you want me to work on the even more alloy sure okay depending upon the physical t of the induction smelter oh you got to make those machine the frying masa it's what I just did and what I did win it okay I didn't jump I see macchina frames many much in the frames are required how many machine the frames you have oh it just made the one that I needed oh okay gotcha so you don't have like a lot so you wouldn't have three spares I would be willing to make them for you if you really needed me to I can do it like if you would prefer that I do it if you said pretty please I'd do it for you but I can do it if you prefer that I do it we are gonna need to sift more the gravel EO in here for the misty gravel yeah tiny pile of ender dust risky we need to go get the misty gravel right it does mean we need to go here the misty gravel which I'll do after I make these much in the frame nice do we have a ender we do have one spare Interpol's so you couldn't make one theoretically that does the same thing as the ash one and drops it into the nan ash one or the into the dust one you know what I mean you gave it up what I'm putting down I could auto okay I don't know if I trust myself with changing your automation system no no I mean I would set it up I'm just saying that's an option if you wanted it like I know all the pieces for it now so it wouldn't be quite as yeah I mean if you want to automate the gravel input then I would say that's what they'll be pretty dope with once I finished with the igneous I will do so okay sound segunda pained 18 glass and three blocks thank goodness for the Emmy system use as much of a pain in the butt as it is useful something what you're out yo day mind son yo dang mine you are out of your mind craft right let's see oh the redstone search that's not the dawn stone the dawn stone was used for the solid Springs but the redstone chipsets making a problem everyone's saying it's not an FM system it's not an any system it's an inferior system man yeah well what were you expressed out of this all right what do you expect out of this situation that we have at hand here okay what do you really I can expect I expects I have no expectations good okay I just tried to go down the elevator on top of the pressure plate for that door did not work I see because it was a pressure plate because it was a pressure plate and not an elevator yes strinden that'll get you yeah no that was definitely the problem that's da know is looking for there okay um oh shoot I forgot the catalysts we need the Topaz a don't pick what was that toxic yeah that's that I was just gonna say that's an obscure reference it is if that was that a togepi reference no I thought that you finally learned pokey man's out no you didn't even know the togepi wasn't pokey man I had no idea that togepi was a pokey man okay got it that's good but I've been disappointing you for like years now right yeah let's be honest with ourselves shoot I've been disappointing you since the day I first through my garbage down at your feet uh-huh that's accurate what talk what talk it also sounds like a Pokemon Piku what he could chew in my food I I don't think I don't think was with you I think it was just in one of my generals streams but I ended up asking someone what Nani or where that came from what the reference was and I got overwhelmingly overwhelmed on how well it altered I am simply from a lot of things Weiss in Japanese right yeah this is what was explained to me is you know just you if you would just weebo just a little bit more you'd understand yeah you would weebo it's just we've but that that's okay just we've yeah we bow or Weibo is a ten-cent product in China okay yeah so it's like the Twitter equivalent in China Tencent Weibo okay so I wasn't that far off no no no wiebe and Tencent Weibo are quite different oh I can I'll like in just take it has to be a dust I don't remember this I got stucked on this doing it the hard way you know 39 Luther right Chris if not then why not I cannot tell you answer two questions I seek I did make it pulverizer I can fix everything I can see clearly now missing all the seconds okay we're missing everything from here yeah all the things okay oh where did our sand to get to our sand we have a lot of sand over here and on it next to the glass I see we're gonna need some of that oh we're gonna need some of that red sand - doh we have no iron gears so I think it's time to be there a little iron oh no red sands just an option I see I see I see a couple gear though yes we mined lead the copper here that is an iron gear how many gears do we have with some there is five ion gears and I'm pretty sure there's copper in there too yes we are going oh no no no there's not I just really went and made copper for myself how many did you need we are going to need my guna no but we need some but you like to pour out aluminum it's it's four ingots per and I just used the Stamper for the ears for that oh right you bring up good points good plans good points keep forgetting now I turn to TiVo methodologies to do the thing that's just how I go oh that's where I put the Nuggets right been wondering where to put the neck weak brick what's wrong they didn't go onto the conveyor belt there we go alright so we are making induction magma crucible and alright so that's all the aluminum and I can go there alright so I needed brined it down I need two ingots I think we have nickel all comes to a hope if we don't have any a planet nickel alright so we need six copper gears so it's 24 copper ingots uh-huh glad I was able to help you with that I'm paying you as I look back upon my life and I think maybe he didn't need my hand there but I refused the assistance I was just humbling that stupid vacuum exactly oh I was like I need some charcoal there's there's a lot of charcoal right thinking of ordering pizza tonight yeah you'll deep-dish or any the deep dish or Unni I know what do you think what would you think about that I had steaks oh wow never a bad never bad fancy-pants do what kind of steak you get what kind of cut this was a top sirloin mmm how many ounces it's no I just grab a steak from the stores I made it for my so you made it yourself so you know I don't take credit from her but but yeah okay yeah but yeah it wasn't it wasn't like I don't have the 12 ounce prime rib or anything it was just like you know that looks like a hunk of meat does it look like a hunk of meat it better than not looking like a hunk of meat am i right I guess Lumia mhow das they'll make Lumia meeee Lu Miam wherefore art thou Lumia all right so six and three nickel wait how doth thou make it flu Miam have we made blue Miam before I don't know doesn't sound familiar to me but but that I do know I've looked at these augments several times and obviously there's something to it because every time I look at it I end up passing it luminescent that's probably me am is it if I recall is kind of a PITA no it's not that bad but I Lumia mingott though dad I didn't know how we get that I don't know how I got the lumen them it's Lu Miam blend I see liquid aluminum is made from a lowing energize glowstone tin and silver to intended silver yeah how dost thou acquire a--they now that might require a magma crucible you see that the catch-22 of that situated Transposer magma ball oh it doesn't need it oh nevermind what was I looking at their required aluminum gear oh I was on the wrong thing I was on the wrong thing it's there just a lot of machines that look identical we're good I see where you were clicking you were clicking on the machine that you needed and not the Machine you needed needed that's correct yeah I don't happen that's that's how they get you I made the boo-boo you made a boo-boo but this okay okay look I have boo-boo the redstone reception coil oh good luck the only the only difficult part there is the sword barriers and circuit boards but you're gonna need to make two redstone circuits using the the the lasers for that and then I need to get you some more acid I think and I don't have a bucket so I'm glad I didn't give car I'm glad I didn't go far without a bucket it all that make sense you follow I believe so I am going to oh there's already wait why isn't the assembly table making chipsets because it has no power oh why has it no gotta put put some lava in the Stirling engines where it's their buckets in the Stirling engines understood and there is lava right here I understood there you go now you're cooking with gas more like lava but you know it's chill alright so I needed to invert ingots right yeah possibly here's just the ingots that's fine and now I have eleven in varying good thank you inga bits you can get it's alright so there's that now the question becomes how do we set it up but we'll put them here for now we're not actually like struggling for water and or I think you later like just do though I don't think it equates accumulator just to do it just do okay hey quiesce would I'd go with aqua or me but aqueous it's aqueous is it really yeah I mean cuz I just think aqua like water so I don't know all throughout my science both high school and university stuff it was aqueous but I never been you're probably right because I don't have any educated information here I'm just I just like aqua and that's what I go with but aqueous how does one make hard into glass you take glass and then you harden it oh thank you mr. smartypants I got you boo I'm here to help [Music] which hardened glass do I want I needed a and your chest we need pyro theum for this what oh using quartz okay that's obsidian some wolves scream and pyro seems expensive I'd go with the quartz let's see are we out of ooh we're out of obsidian dude can't you know can I accidently dig obsidian yes no you know um I yes our axe pickle can dig obsidian but it's very slow how do I make this basic hardened let's just search hardened glass I can ideally now you can see what you guess you I don't have the wrench yes I do nice you guess you wait all right then wait you have the induction smelter setup I haven't made an induction smelters so no oh okay I guess I have to make the induction smelter first then there is not in fact and induction smelter no I'm working on that right now [Music] doodlee doodlee this chipset out of here what route oh I can it's been knowing what it was if the bar reset or alternatively you finished the one and it got pulled into the chest next to it oh he gets pulled into the chest okay and now it's lava gotcha alternatively cool yep hmm y-you know do there we go and we're off to the races again hello races yes sir what is oh it's to hurt oh I need six of them good lord um good lord that's where the the the redstone reception coils are a little problematic that way because they do require yeah they were really really easy in other mod packs yeah they're there there's a there's a cost to them you know yeah they're there they're quite quite expensive and I need to get many of them so that I can progress and make the induction so that I can make other things good Lord we need to generate power faster these Stirling engines ain't gonna cut it yeah yeah I know I tried to tap power into that but I got mocked severely for it so mr. wells what we got in the meantime then I suppose I will go fetch us some gravel it's a burn iam I don't then you into dust again all right Oh the condenser Oh we know you're doing you definitely don't need to put a full stack of Boerne em in there no no no no I only need I need four so once it gets four then we can pull that out okay I just grab the stack and threw it in and busy you get mad you will get four out of like half of a dust yeah I mean that's fine okay so that thing rolls the the steel rolled through the coal coke right so we want charcoal no god it's gonna be regular coal yeah I need to throw coal into it you want me to throw coal in here I'll throw a pole in there I have a stack on me I just might as might as well keep this stuff going right yeah yeah I definitely approve of your message and the redstone needs magma rack and I was I was throwing this coal dust into the thing right here so we can gosh I get more going so I'm at three I'm Bernie UM's so I'm almost done and it's all yours cool it's probably gonna make a few more off of that existing one but here you are hey hey hey there you go you're gonna get a few more I just wanted to put in col honestly because they're just trying to like actually I can stick it though there we go okay all right if I can get through that entire stack of coal that'll be like there that coal dust will be like five stacks of coal sitting go did you take the Obsidian I have no such thing you're obsidian your hallucination like I see what happened and it wasn't you I I don't blame you how quick you are to blame me I and then I said it was I don't blame you I know but you were quick to blame me it's true that's because I was thinking you were at fault I wish you wouldn't well that's reasonable so we have no trapdoors anywhere laying around no maybe in the ME system the first place I looked I just thought maybe you've forgotten because it seemed to put a bad taste in your mouth and I'm not sure why because it's terrible but it's fine all right so you are here out of your loins ingots you were out of your mind you're out of your mind out of your depth I'm gonna get brown okay I was trying to get it to where like we could literally none of it just happened okay I'll owe you Hey Oh you a-holes whoa this is actually a really good source of the freakin dust that we need oh my lord how's it going friggin ND boys all over the place yeah any boys I will nd boy you it's gonna be enough I'm not admin please help did you NOP me do you really unappealing I did it the day that I gave it to you like I think you you ran it and then I took it away wise how how can you be surprised you know me you just you just don't trust me that much there's nothing to trust as it's all about irritating you I've applied oh ok there you go huh yeah but why boom why do you we go back I'm having some why do I expect what wait you're not you weren't off you weren't offed already what I don't know were you trying to take my Opie away are you guys are like a little turnabout's fair yeah thanks or thing yes ok it opt you thank you yeah uh-huh wait I mean not listen you got me you got me good oh yeah I think I think everybody can agree you got me yes you have been got you know the got inist of God's got boy yeah I didn't do I need to find where that uh spot was that I got so much crowd dude I'm I I hope I'm not getting sick again is that as a classic sign that I'm getting sick ok we will do what is it f3g for a chunk boundary all that the must that goes up way too high I think chunk boundaries go all the way up no I see just how you Freight like I get that you were looking at something else but it was like alright check my laundry wow that goes high huh like yeah why do you know do things know don't bind to that chest you fool God dang it has everything gone wrong yeah it's gone very wrong I've gone very wrong all right so we have a pins but we made like a million of the pins I just need to figure out where thank you where that why is there a bunch of gravel on the floor over here I don't know where over here is the gravel just like went on the floor instead of the chest why did it do that you might you might have a you might have an issue with your automation system is there an issue a little bit did we cause we caused some issues just a little bit um here to see here we go you bound it to the wrong chest this isn't this go you bonehead either sit like that's why it's black black black it's trash I realize there was a different one what's the one that I should send to that's the one I'm working on me oh it doesn't exist I'm literally holding a trapdoor so I can make a chest so I can play chess so I can get it set up got it well I can throw to this one yeah yeah throw to that one that is that the the black black black is for ash I didn't realize that well now we have some gravel just kind of jammed in somebody somewhere just floating somewhere I mean it's in some pipes in the built-in inventory of the pipe so you know it's it's everything I don't I think it's awesome cuz I can't put him so I think it's actually no I've gotten less and less gravel every time that I've kept putting them into Jets so when it gets all clogged Joe out sometimes it's all clogged up you'll know why oh yeah yeah I'll take note of that mm-hmm thank you thank you oh it's it's no problem my pleasure all right let's get this bread let's get this bread that's what yeah do you know how we do we are doing random drops after this everybody and also sorry for my um I hope I'm not getting singing and that would be crazy to be back to back sick or maybe I never got over being sick in the first place I don't know do the gravels coming in the gravels flowing it's good all right there's chests I've made eight chests nice and then the ender chest actually looks like it might be right there I guess at least this one takes a little bit longer to fill up because the gravel doesn't split into four sub things it's still gravel do the gravel still going only the gravelly ystem gravels so good bomp bomp all right so that should be able to be set up over here right yeah oh did we fill it up I think we filled it up all right we uh we got it filled we out here mm-hmm okay let's see how many that's good oh yeah that is many girl god it's got a lot of rocks in there too though that's dumb you see you're saying I have to filter rocks out of my in my equations rocks will ya there there will be an incorporation of rocks and apparently don't corporation something yeah what's that it's gold nuggets in here I'm not sure if they were there from this or not or leftover from something else but they're there they're in there they're in the chest they're doing things probably maybe I don't know if they're doing things though but I can just in the meantime you wouldn't mind if I just manually place some gravel right like don't touch it nice nice nice noise noise noise it's you guys heard it here first snow ice very snowy it's not very snowy subview it I've had the most obnoxious phrase stuck in my head so I keep no it's it's a little I'd say it's worse in snows and I'm I just wanted out like I never want to say it I but I just I just I don't want to what do you do how do you get it out how do you get a phrase I don't know what's the phrase oh you don't want to say it it's bad phrase say it's not like look bad where it's that's not very cash money of you I was about to say that's not very casual it's the most stupidest phrase ever I was about to say oh man I wish I had said it ah yeah he was dead you almost had greatness you were this close but I hate it I hate it and yet it's just been stuck in I had why would you hate something because I because of pure dislike why what did what did cash-money ever do to you are you not a fan of Weezy them slimes bron-bron hat on was Aledo got to get a pair of dem hoes a sample Apogee's weight isn't easy or what isn't that Kanye Conway Connolly okay boomer I think you just lost of your moral authority or your generational Authority there Kanye is I don't know his label but it's it's Weezy who has cash money yes oh boy um I mean I I admit I'm out of touch but we say no it's Kanye not convoy Conway East yeah all right well uh I just need a couple more redstone things and we'll be good to go good and there is our green okay how am I now that you've presented all these alternative alternatives now I have to figure out how to say what are the alternative alternatives that I've presented that I'm not gonna have just gravel but I've got to deal with extra random stuff coming through - you always throw all of it into the chest and kind of worry about it the other stuff later I mean that'll jam up the pipes right that's what you do oh yeah that's true would jam up the pipes let's get a filter on the pipe and that's what I'm talking about is figuring out how to filter it and move the right stuff to the right place yeah I know I see your predicament that you have generated here that's quite the predicament that I have gender generated in torito's generated predict emitting rates from a hot way anyway is generated yes all right and being green I need to pipe some over there or one the more chips it and then we'll help with we need almost let me check out what we will be generated so far over in that void minor dog so how am i dropping this is this gravity horns just gravity it's just gravity fed that's not bad I can do that easy enough you can do that easy enough stop get help never Bridget can show you the way yeah that's her lion isn't it yeah get help I went to throw something hand it to be caught by the vacuum hopper and instead I found singularity uh what do you mean I think you've seen this before but you'd have to come over here okay give me one second I've got to pull the stuff into there and then make the things yes okay brilliant oh god I married more carpenter fluid uh acid I was gonna go get that for you then I got this track okay and I could go collect acid that's pretty easy it's it's literally just it's blowing around just literally everywhere it's just a bucket of that dumped in you good how to do it seems like potentially just sending it bye-bye yeah yeah I cut him down they should be growing more right yeah that's what happens when you use an axon right I figured out where your gravels going cool also there's a bunch of ash in here what the heck what happened there oh it's not good you'd have the wrong spot a bunch of ash right here in the wrong spot right here got you make sure where is my pouch there is good lord this is taking forever what are you trying to do the redstone chipsets oh yeah that takes favor definitely definitely so this would have been sucked up from up above that you do anything I have created an induction smelter haven't sucked anything up from above did you do anything to generate ash near the the farm area ah no no not at all um had to have come over from there um where should I put the induction smelter where are you putting these things oh I've just been throwing machines down in the machine room because the machine seems like the place where the machines would go got it dog got it dog it's maybe a lot of machine students a lot of machine days so these ones just aren't even powered a big ave yeah no no I haven't even hooked them up like it's just okay here's this machine for this quest and we'll figure it out when we get when we figured out cool cool upgrade here templates have to be a drawer can be a chest has to be a drawer oh and these weren't drawers wait I can't make that though no so I make drawers a tidge as my place oh this is MV God dang God dang it oh it must have a little lvy earn it uh we might but might not but it's easy to make yeah whatever okay well happy to help now whatever dude I got it sheesh I got it it's fine sheesh we should have plenty of sticks yeah my apples give me my apples back thank you all right now boom there's that and then for upgrade oh you finished yes you have thank goodness thank goodness it's a lot of gravel the last thing that I needed to put in here Wright's copper plate all right all right all right hey there's all your gravel pulled out and put where it goes no I sorted sorted noise but you're not attached this wire here Oh cuz relay got it there we go oh good good wonderful wonderful do you like it's wonderful oh you're the best d-link you've led you like yes I like very you are welcome yes the things you give me you should really shouldn't have we also have let's see RF conduits how would you could apparently be utilized for things like this I guess I could pipe it in D wait no what's filtering out of there where's that go I don't make getting out of there let's appraise the situation you say let's praise the situation I know I to think you should have a shrine to Mike the situation let's appraise this situation you should praise the situation praise the situation come Jersey Shore dude Jersey Shore I've never seen it but I hear things about it quality times quality quality quality so if I could possibly possibly take gravol like I can reuse this I just need to have a directed thing and then pull gravel out so I need a silver pipe I need to use the induction smelter to do oh I guess I could make you off the bat though god I think you owe me that fluid Transposer has been completed and the last thing I need to do is I need to make the magma crucible uh how do we magma brick no soul saying to magma rec in the induction smelter how in the induction smother won that thing baguettes the other oh wait here we have so we don't have soul sand you might have to go get some this whole sand actually exists in the core yes we've gotten it before I believe all right we might even have it in one of the Emmy systems oh the freezer that's how we get it right ha ha ha I have some in the fridge I keep my soul sand in the freezer duh who doesn't keep their soul sand in the freezer is the real question only weirdos dude only weirdos well I mean he'll if this is going there then this chest might as well not be here so it's not routing straight in all right I mean I guess I can do it's all right let's see if this works first test of the old induction smelters test number one of induction snow third this is a mess yeah because it's like this weird mix of BC and not BC I want to get everything into here we got it I went into their second thing you know Oh bring it up here stick it in right behind there because this is already handling it so I need cobblestone transports I need freaking awesome it's just quartz right it is just quartz yes it's better use the quartz dead or what if it's not what then beep sets you'd be so mad at me you're always mad at me it's that once once these Emmy systems get their dirty paws on your cursor man it's all over no I can't put a quartz in there yeah it course doesn't work what I don't know no I'm just wondering how I do this you use quartz lead and pulverized obsidian what's no no I hear a hardened glass they don't see where it is you don't see where it T's whatever Rock did not ask there's no regular hardened glass it all has crap in it has hardened glass merio hardened glass it's led and pulverized obsidian I see well we do have a pulverizer now so pulverize obsidian should be relatively easy and we do have a lot of lead so that should be relatively easy cool cool relatively speaking bong bong-bong-bong well good thing we already actually have pulverized obsidians that's easy yeah we've got some though um where is your polarizer it's up in the machine room buddy fool I mean you have machines down there what you all about brah are you gonna get upset when there's other stuff laying around how do I immediately run out a cobble with the that doesn't make any sense it's right that you've got cut what is wrong with y'all who me it will not take the land you absolute fool you absolute unit um what are you trying to do it won't take the lead it won't accept your lead what kind of wood Oh get rid of the shield ah

systems for you to check what no there's literally not a lot of any systems for me to check they all connected now no they're not you have to check each individual one did he did he really did he miss this did he miss this whole thing did you link him all together oh my lord cuz I've been going back and forth between all of them checking them all so if they're linked together that'd be great oh my god I literally showed it to you I remember you mentioning something about that at one point well that's the Boomer oh nice bra I showed it to you I was like look this is amazing they're all linked together you know I probably like it more if that's how that worked that's why I was like what are you talking about what this isn't useful no it makes so much more sense why you just yeah that's see
