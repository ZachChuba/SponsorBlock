hello this is chef john from
food wishes.com with easy crab tortellini
that's right i'm going to show you a super easy super simple method
for making stuffed pasta using wonton wrappers
which reminds me if you'd rather call these crab wontons or crab dumplings go
ahead these are really all the same thing but
i went with tortellini because it has a couple extra syllables
so i thought it would be easier to rhyme with but no matter what you call them
this is definitely something you want in your bag of culinary tricks
and to get started the first thing we'll need to do is mix up this very easy
filling which is going to start with exactly
seven saltine crackers which we will crush up nice and fine
with our fingers and if you want to use about the same
amount of bread crumbs with maybe a pinch of salt that would also work
but i just find for whatever reason the saltines work out a little better
and then to that we will add one large beaden egg as well as a couple spoons of
mascarpone cheese which is nothing more than an extra rich
italian cream cheese and if you can't find it regular cream
cheese will work we will also want to add a little touch of dijon mustard
along with a few dashes of worcestershire sauce and that's it once
everything's in there we'll go ahead and take a spoon and give this a mix
and as you might know i like to start stirring at one camera angle and then
i'll move the camera and finish the shot with a different angle
well for reasons i don't have time to get into that second shot didn't happen
but that's okay nothing a little flip over transition can't fix
oh yeah there we go and then once that's mixed we'll go ahead and let that sit
for five minutes just to give those crumbs a little head
start absorbing the moisture before we add in our very very
well-drained crab meat and i use two different kinds some very
affordable standard lump crab meat from the grocery store
plus the same amount of some much nicer much more expensive dungeness crab meat
in this way we can save a little money and still tell people the fillings made
out of dungeness oh yeah that's perfectly legal and
ethical and then we'll finish this up with a
little touch of old bay a pinch of salt a couple shakes of
cayenne and then if you have some and i did a
little bit of minced jalapeno pepper which is just a fantastic pairing with
crab then we'll grab our spoon and give this a mix until it's just combined
and we could use this right now if we had to but for some possibly better
results let's go ahead and wrap it up and pop it
in the fridge for about an hour before we try to stuff our tortellini
okay i think it's going to be easier to work with
plus we give it a little bit of time for those flavors to develop and who among
us does not enjoy develop flavors so that's what i did and then about an
hour later i moved into final production and for that we're going to need some of
these some ready to use wonton wrappers from the store
so soft so supple so thin and i find very easy to work with
and very important once you open the package you want to keep it just barely
damp towel over the top so they don't dry out
and what we'll do is go ahead and place one down and then we'll paint a tiny bit
of water with the tip of our finger on the two edges facing away from us
right not too much just enough to moisten
and then once that's been accomplished we'll go ahead and place down one
tablespoon of our filling right in the center and then we will
just spread it out a little bit and then the first maneuver here is to
fold this over so that our two points line up first
and then once that center spot is pressed together we can work our way
down the sides pressing ceiling and pushing out any air
to basically form a triangle and then once we've somehow managed that
we will use one of our fingers to push right into the center of that long flat
side or as our geometry teacher would call it
the hypotenuse and then once we have that basic shape
formed we'll go ahead and moisten each of those tips
referred to in the tortellini business's wings and with a finger placed and
slightly pushing in the middle we'll go ahead and seal those together
pressing them nice and tight and if everything goes according to plan
that dough on the opposite side will kind of fold up to form a collar
and that's it it's really not that hard except i'm never quite sure what to do
with that part once it's sealed i mean should i fold it down or fold it
up and tuck it in or just leave it as is i don't know and to be honest it
really doesn't matter since once these are boiled and sauced
they're gonna look amazing so let me go ahead and show you one more
while i also give you the extremely obvious info
that you could use this technique to stuff these with whatever you want
so please feel free to adapt these to your tastes i mean you are after all the
ray boom boom mancini of your easy cheater tortellini and
speaking of boxing these square wrappers work just fine but
if you can get the round ones those do produce a more traditional tortellini
shape but either way the folding is basically
the same so i went ahead and folded up seven of those
since i'm just filming one portion and then because these things are going to
cook so fast before we boil them we need to have
whatever sauce we're using ready which for me is going to be a very
simple but delicious cream sauce which is going to start with some creme
fraiche or some of you pronounce it cream fresh
and we'll place that over medium heat and then to that we will also add a
touch of paprika which is a little bit for flavor but
mostly to warm up the color of the sauce a little
we'll also do a little bit of freshly grated lemon zest
as well as a little pinch of salt and then i like to thin it out just a little
bit with a touch of our pasta water all right just a little splash and then
all we're going to do here is wait for that crumb fresh to melt
and for this mixture to heat through and then as soon as it does
and it's just about to start to simmer we can go ahead and turn it off
since it's now ready to accept our cooked tortellini which are only going
to take a minute literally so we'll go ahead and grab
those and carefully transfer them into some well-salted boiling water
and we'll give those a very gentle stir with our strainer to make sure they're
not sticking to the bottom and then like i said we're only going to
cook these for about 60 seconds which during that time they may or may
not float to the surface which is how some people will tell you
they're done but depending on the filling that doesn't always happen
so after just about a minute i'm going to go ahead and fish those out
and we'll transfer those into our sauce and we'll crank our heat to medium-high
and basically as soon as our sauce starts simmering and everything is
heated through these are pretty much ready to serve and
as this comes up to temple gently stir and baste
and the cooking time might seem too quick but those wonton wrappers are
super thin and cook really fast plus other than the
egg everything in the filling is cooked so really as soon as those are heated
through they're okay to serve and then what we'll do once that happens
and our sauce is simmering is turn off the heat
and we'll stir in some fresh dill or the crab friendly herb of your choice
okay terrigan would also be very nice and that's it once our fresh herb has
been stirred in and we of course have checked for
seasoning we can go ahead and plate that up
and like all cream sauces they definitely thicken up once they hit the
plate and start to cool so two things make sure your plate is
warm and your sauce is not overly reduced when you go ahead and plate it
oh and i should mention if you want to use regular cream instead of creme
fraiche go ahead it'll basically work exactly the same
except it won't have that delicious tangy flavor
although you could sneak in a few drops of lemon juice to increase the acidity
but anyway you'll figure it out and then once i had that plated and sauced
i finished up with a little more fresh dill as well as one last sprinkling of
cayenne to make these look a little crabbier and
that's it our super easy cheater method for crab tortellini are ready to enjoy
and not to insult your pasta or wonton dough making skills
but besides being a lot less work one of the great things about these wrappers
is that they're so nice and thin so it really does make for a beautifully
tender and delicate dumpling but that was just one part of why these
were so incredible right the other reason is i just love this crab filling
which by the way was based on our highly regarded crab cake recipe
so instead of being like 50 crab 50 cheese
this is or at least seems like almost all crab meat
or as the dj once said all killer no filler
i mean come on look at all that crab so i just absolutely loved how these came
out and sure if you're feeling less
adventurous and you'd rather just fold them over and cook them as triangles
that's okay but the magic of this tortellini shape
also known as wonton shape is that it does a great job of catching
and holding onto all that delicious sauce
so for a little extra work it really does elevate the experience
but whether you make these as shown or you do your own cheater method of the
cheater method either way i really do hope you give
these a try soon so please follow the links below for the

info as usual and as always enjoy you
