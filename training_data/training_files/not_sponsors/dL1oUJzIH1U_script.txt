this week raga myself can kill anything we want to get the best drops possible but as soon as an NPC drops you a wearable item you must move on to another NPC if an NPC drops a wearable in a slot you have already filled then you can continue killing that NPC you can only wear the first item dropped in each slot so you get room plate legs after getting a deep plate legs you have to stick with the a deep plate legs first meaning in this challenge we can guarantee ourselves certain drops if we kill monsters in the right order you think my knees are crusty thank you boy are you kidding me these queens of super okay so we've got to grind our monsters until they drop us a wearable taking a little risk here going with wool calf but I really do think if we can get like the dragon plate legs the skirt the dragon longsword the dragon battle axe if we can get any of those it will be a huge risk paid off now the problem is if we get the rune longsword or the battle staffs that that's where the issue will come so we we just hope mr. RNG here but again I just think it's worth taking that risk because it's so hard to get these sort of items you know the dragon ones anywhere else so we just really have to really have to hope that ball caps gonna sort us out and send us on the right path we keep killing him until we get a wearable so yeah we are gonna get some sort of weapon or some sort of armor what it will be we will see we will see ego first kill done let's have a look what we get drain so bug tips superior nope nothing there so we're gonna have to keep on grinding kill number two we get a rune eye bar we cannot make any materials or anything it has to be straight drops so that is not anything on to kill three it is lagged out I'm so fuming okay right brilliant there we go that is the kill what are we gonna get oh yes and underpaid I know you can make a serious mean with this now may I'm giving you all sorts of mean potential underpaid is the answer by the way there we go the dragon plate legs what are ones I'm very very happy to see to be honest and that's really really not bad at all I don't know where to go from it out of it all I really did want a dragon battle axe or the dragon longsword I thought they would have been you know just awesome but dragon plate legs Oh next up is gonna be brine rats now the reason is they drop one wearable item and it is of course the brine saber slightly better than the than the rune scimitar and I've been looking at other things I was looking at like abyssal demons get a whip maybe I'll forget the spider boss over in Isaiah but obviously the cudgel would be amazing but it has other drops like rune long swords and stuff and like don't want those with the brine rats I'm guaranteed a brine saber it's just how long it's gonna take as it is one in 512 so we're gonna be killing these for a while but it is a guaranteed drop which means it is gonna fill the weapon slot so I won't have to worry about accidentally getting a really bad weapon out one of the other monsters that I kill so it just makes sense to be honest I just realized I lost my soul repair boys guy is going on I've been treated obviously that's messed up orangey it doesn't really affect kins in any way cuz whether it took me a thousand kills or something look how many kills is that eleven eleven kills to get the bride saber whether it took me a thousand or eleven kills it really doesn't matter the outcome would have been the same that we get ourselves the brine saver but there we go another slot filled very very happy right next up are gonna be Taz Arquette this is gonna probably be a grind as well one in five twelve chance of getting the shield or the Aubie cape obviously we've already got a weapon so the tears are kept on even if it gets dropped we can't use that the final fight and the lower-level variants don't drop any of the obby armor so we're definitely gonna either get a shield or a cape from these guys I'm going to see how hard they hit me otherwise I will just safe spot behind to be honest I might as well just stay put behind the the self event and yeah there we go I need to get myself some raging potions but yeah this is gonna be my life for however long hopefully like the brine saber it takes 11 kills to get one we will see there we go guys the tox ket Xillia as I said would have preferred the Cape but this will give us a strength bonus and obviously it is definitely a decent decent shield it's not gonna be as good as a room kite I don't think defensive wise yeah not gonna be quite as good as a room kite but the range defense on it is huge if he goes range and as I say we do get a 5 Plus melee strength bonus from it so a pretty decent thing to get hey guys welcome to today's video so in this video the first drop that we get in any item slot will automatically get locked in for the final fight I've been trying to plan for this one it's a little weird though because all the good monsters they also have some bad loot that you can get so it's one of those things where you just get lucky or you don't and I'm finding problems with a bunch of plans so I think I'm just gonna send it and just start by killing the ones that drop dragon equipment whether it's weapons armor things like forecast probably follow up things like spiritual mages which just drop the boots ruin dragons which drop a bunch of rune equipment dragon equipment or just the dragon plate in lakes but that's kind of where my head's at right now and then depending on what pieces I get from then I'll have to kind of formulate my plan if I need a weapon there's special monsters that I'm about to kill that don't drop things like black swords you know that's why abyssal demons are probably not worth killing because the first drop you get and once it's locked in it's locked in so let's start by killing forecasts let's telly and hopefully we get like deal eggs or actually I honestly think a dragon battle axe would be the best thing to get from board cast so let's hope we get it okay and the first drop of the day and there is no equippable items so we we'll have to just keep healing for calf until it drops something we can equip and then we have to move on to the next monster all right come on drop me that dragon battle axe let's see it lets see it magic logs still nothing we could technically equip okay kill em number three at vork eighth man Therese no equippable is black dragon hide oh man this sucks and oh yes yes yes yes yes and it's a skirt yeah already guys I'm just gonna go into the fight like this so the next two monsters I want to kill where the brutal blacks as well as different dragons and I decided to go with the brutalist because they have a chance at a dragon longsword which is an amazing weapon to get and the rune dragons don't have that option so that's why I'm here first they also have you know a bunch of other drops we could get like a rune equiptment black dragon hide oh crap I am absolutely sucking right now my prey we're still down from four Kath but this should take like no time at all depending on what we get I I mean I hope it's not like a rune longsword but it very well could be but that is the beauty of this challenge oh no oh no is this good I know it's like a one-handed spear okay at least I could use a shield oh my gosh guys I I don't know if this is good or if this is just really really really really bad let me just take off everything I guess it could be worse guys look at the defense bonus is on this thing why is it so negative Oh No Oh No okay so there's some good things and some bad things that came up this it's not the absolute worst weapon that we could get the next monster we want to kill is rune dragons and they drop things like room aces ruin long swords which I've come to believe that this is you know probably pretty similar to that if anything it's a bit worse because of the whole negative staff that this gives but it is long surd speed but for the ruined dragons we can get a bunch of weapons and leg slot items and of course we already have the slots filled and the only equippable that it looks like I can now get from rune dragons is a rune play body which kind of forces it as that being the only item I could get so I do think there's a positive trade-off to not getting like a black D hide body here for example because I doubt he's going magic so why do think there is some flaws were having a rune hasta I do think it's better than getting like a rune mace and a black dragon high body for example so after second thought I definitely don't think it's as bad as I originally thought it was gonna be my first kill was a rune scimitar bit annoying bit annoying but again a room play body is legit the only wearable item that these guys drop that I can still use so having a rune plate and the fight is just so massive especially with a dragon plate skirt so I'm okay I'm okay bit annoying though that's actually quite annoying Who am I kidding fuming and then next kill rune longsword I swear it's just taunting me with these better weapons at this point taunting me but it's at least reassuring that if link comes here he'll probably get one of these items and not the room play body unless you did something very very similar to what I did no stop stop stop stop it doesn't matter but that's so funny so I normally don't have orangey this good in these challenges and that's just so funny we already have a skirt guys does it matter but that that's genuinely so funny and there it is guys my last kill room play body actually when I was thinking about it it also drops a dragon Med helm but it's one out of 127 and this is like one out of 14 so this is you know much much more common but getting a dragon Med home would've actually sucked because once I fill up all the slots put the helm slot I could pretty much easily force a roomful helm drop and a roomful helm is very similar to a dragon med and if I got the dragon bed then I wouldn't have a room play body you see where I'm going with this it would have been quite [ __ ] I just want to also say a quick disclaimer that the arrow does not count arrows and rings aren't counted as upgrade so if I got like a willow shortbow as a drop for example I'd be for spawned you could say mithril arrows to match the bow I'm using but of course I already have rune hosta so arrows are an issue I did clarify this with link I'm literally moving straight on to the Zil versions and because they drop the cape so I might as well go for it and there other than the cape they just drop weapons so we definitely get ourselves a cape by by doing this so yeah we are gonna grab it here there's just no other cape but we could get really get like the fire cape I couldn't get because we have to kill a load of monsters that don't drop any wearables in the fire caves and also jad doesn't drop the cape you get given the cave so I think this is gonna be the best cave we can possibly get unless I'm forgetting something but yeah I really think this is gonna be it yes I don't want to talk about how long that took that is thank [ __ ] thank [ __ ] is all I can say oh my god that it's actually a new day guys so I don't even have my loot tracker up I think it was like 600 700 kills that was a ridiculous amount of time spent on something that just will not help that much in the final [ __ ] we'll see job done happy okay next up is gonna be Zara and you guys know how much I love Zara my favorite boss in the game and yeah we're gonna go here because the only drop we can now get their two new wearable is a dragon Med helm and to be honest I don't think we're gonna get a bear I don't think we're gonna get better drop the map in terms of the head slot so I think yeah we'll just go ahead ankles alright I think it's a one in sixty five so this will be a little bit of a grind but hopefully we get a bit more lucky than we did on the on the second desires because that was not fun but you know I'm gonna be making some money in the process anyway which has nothing to do the challenge but the bank's looking a little bit dry so you know a bit of a Zora money grind isn't the worst thing in the world at the moment but what we're looking for is that dragon mid helm let's see if we can get it not a bad kill at all we're not gonna get it there are we no and it's gonna hit me course it is but we go and we gonna take another hit here as well that's very painful and we get ourselves nothing too crazy but we did do a 105 which is not far off my PB either and not a bad kill to start us off with keel number two and we know yet what we want we're probably gonna have to a jump cut to when I get the string med helm in like 11 hours and this is why we didn't come to Zara straightaway battlestar just got dropped and if we haven't got that brine saber earlier that would have been the drop that Zara gave us and that would be the weapon we would be going into the fight with so I yeah very happy that this strategy has come off let's keep going there we go it's another kill it's a dragon Halliburton again the same thing applies caveat use the dragon Holly because we already have the the brine saver I don't think I would want to anyway to be honest I think the brine saber would be better but obviously that has a spec on it but there we go I like I was gonna risk Sora and and go for Ally but then I thought there's such a good chance to get in the air the battle staffs cuz there's so much more common and we have them back-to-back so there we go but I was correct we would've got the battle stars for a few moments later you are [ __ ] with me you off I've just completed Zara I've just completed Zara I've just completed Zara no no I'm live on stream right now guys to a thousand people I want a D Med I want to do mad and I've just completed [ __ ] Zara what no no surely I get the D bed pass please can I just have the D bed [ __ ] pass please no [Laughter] the troll the [ __ ] troll oh dear that's a I've been very very very spoon-fed there under three kkc I'm so sorry to those of you who were watching a UH a PvP challenge and this has just turned into a link main progress update but [ __ ] there she is it's my [ __ ] second dragon halberd guys we are almost 100 kills in now you guys saw we can we got the Magna mutagen we completed Zora but the dragon med helm elusive as ever alright guys this is gonna be 100 Casey trying to get the trying to get the D med are we gonna get it slap bang on 100 Casey let's have a look come on Zora no I'm actually [ __ ] done like look at this look how good it is that we that we [ __ ] went and got a shield first because I'd be I mean I guess it's not a bad thing but it means we wouldn't have got our D med and we'd be rockin that in the final fight here we go guys 3,000 Casey 3,000 Casey did we get the dragon med no we don't wow that was that was a big anticlimax wasn't it thanks Sora yes oh my girl that took such a long dumb amount of time we finished Sora I'm a bit emotional guys I love this I love but I don't want to lose it oh I love this [ __ ] boss and I'm actually finished we've actually finished this boss so it's alright he's been a genuine pleasure when I'm next gonna be back here I don't know I don't know what I'll next be back here but I appreciate is our I guess it was it was a fitting end to make me wait for my dragon med home but it's time to leave now guys I want for sponsoring this PvP challenge yeah next up I want to kill spiritual mages cuz they'll only drop only equip about the really have is the dragon boots so it's kind of just like getting free dragon boots and I don't want to kill neck rolls for like I don't know a room full helm if I decide to do that and then get room boots instead and be like well [ __ ] I want to lock in those Dee boots so let's do that now and I'll see you guys there so I just got gloves from a spiritual warrior I was planning on actually saving these guys for the room kite shield but there are other monsters that drop it like jellies the superior gel or they're not called superior jellies warp jellies I think they also do drop a broom kite so I'm really not worried at all in fact now I have gloves I don't have to worry about I just need to make sure I get the full helm before I go to jellies so get the full helm from somewhere else then the only equip will drop I could get I believe from the warp jellies in the shield slot is the room kite so we're still okay we're still okay oh my gosh guys that took so much longer than you know it really should have 128 kills is the drop rate maybe three or four of those are warriors probably less probably - or warriors - 17 dragon boots out of all the spiritual creatures and guys and god words why does the magician drop the boots I don't know I you know that guys why am I trying to make sense of runescape it's just that when you kill so many your brain your brain starts to wander but dragon boots are locked in this now means we can kill gargoyles with ease not worry about locking in addy boots and the only upgrade we can actually get now that's available is the ruin full album from gargoyles and then after that it's jellies for the room kite and then we got to get necklace elsewhere but that is uh that's super easy to get right so let's go on over to gargoyles and get that rune full helm and there it is the rune full helm and that's exactly why we had to kill him now because I kept everything in my inventory that would have been replaced but of course I got the dragon skirt first to addy plate legs and room plate legs which honestly wouldn't have been that bad but the roomful helmet is locked in and now it's on to get the kite shield and the same exact principle where the only remaining drop we can get from jellies is the kite shield drop which is the room kite shield guys I have an amazing idea so I know I said I was gonna kill jellies but tzur guys actually are an amazing option I haven't gotten the shield yet haven't gotten the Cape yet which I was thinking about just killing a highwayman I guess maybe it still uh no I I think the Cape would be pretty good so I was thinking about maybe just killing a highwayman so I can force get the shield from these guys but if I had a room kite in a knobby cape I would still say that's pretty you know pretty simple I just lose out on the strength bonus of the Diaby shield but either one I will take with ease and yeah so I'm gonna camp here for a bit I'm a bit angry I didn't do this sooner cuz hot I say this is a really good thing to go for so we'll see you guys we'll see how this pans out Wow guys wow that actually wasn't even that bad and you know the moment I got it I realized I almost messed up because if I would have gotten the Cape from the 149 s it means that I could get absolutely nothing from the 133 s because all they drop is a cape and a weapon so then these guys would have been out so I should have killed these guys first got the Cape then forced the shield because I already have a weapon in a cape but it worked out okay it worked out okay and things are still coming together so we have to get the Cape from these guys essentially we can't get anything else which is pretty nice and I was a bit I was a bit annoyed that I didn't start with these guys because they dropped the AH be sword but if I would've gotten locked in with those avi Rings so if I would've gotten the IB knife I'm not sure how it felt about it but the hasta I'm sorry to realize isn't as bad as I might think and of course I could have just got the Cape to begin with from these guys and maybe it wouldn't have even been in question so who knows okay I'm really glad I didn't get the sword because that would have been so much better than what I currently have but then of course that would have not allowed me to get the cape upgrade and here we are let's get it on this chav city in Cape it's 700 at 1k and I got it you know relatively quick I got both items that I needed this is this is awesome I mean technically it's not lucky because again it was the only upgrade I could have got from these guys so it definitely would have gotten a knobby cape but just the fact that it was also so quick and I feel like my plan is coming together I'm so happy guys the last thing we need is an amulet and there's a few things I could do for an amulet I'm thinking about either killing the giant mole for a strength a me or the crazy Ark for power right next up is gonna be undead druids taking a little risk here they do also drop a magic hammy but I'm hoping that I'll get either the strength army or the defense a me first so what yeah that's why we're here and I'm rocking the new magma it does look sick it looks great I'm happy with it Zhora completed are we gonna get it straight away come on orange you come my way this time no we're not other than the magic kami they drop a amulet of defense and an amulet of strength either one would be absolutely fine for the fight so I was just hoping I don't get unlucky and get a magic one first a little strength a DeGraw VK beautiful I think I would have actually preferred the amulet of defense but we'll take the strength next up is gonna be rune dragons we're going for the room plate body just for those defensive bonuses I really think he's either gonna go range or melee I've really can't see him going maid so I think this is gonna be the West's best way of doing it I've just remembered I don't have my insulated boots so be I'll be there it is kill number two the RNG coming in that is rude dragons done we're gonna move on to dust devils now and try and get black d hype vamps they also drop red ones so we could get either one of those - so let's head on over there and give it a go so here we go we're just gonna IceBridge them until we get our either one of our van braces so this shouldn't take too long at all and we're gonna get some decent magic XP as well because I still need 99 magic so Oh mr. Costa brilliant 25k back what the [ __ ] mr. Kester what 50 K right there brilliant and 9 k GP bloody hell that wasn't bad red d hyb and braces there we go we don't get the black ones but we do get the red ones I'll take it I'll take it and now we just need boots and then we have done guys and the next thing we're gonna do is a bit more bursting with the neck rules here they drop room boots and there's gonna be guaranteed for me because they don't drop anything else in the foot slot so yonk room boots once once I get this all sorted getting close to being dry here coming up to a hundred kills on the neck rules but it is banging magic XP so what more could I want really rude Square shields very nice oh yes there we go oh that's the wrong one where are they room at home red boots there we go oh we are done we are done guys took about 150 156 that took but we're finally done we got there let's let's go ahead and show you my setup it's taking a long time to get here but surely we win this challenge surely here we go guys it's taken is days ago since I got the first item so it's actually quite nice to see those early ones this is the full set up and I am very very proud of it I'm very proud of that I think that's a setup and a half if he goes range I don't think he I don't think he out DPS is me 253 range defensive bonus if he goes melee I think we absolutely kill him and I don't think he's gonna go magic I really don't if he does then we're I guess we still have a plus for magic bonus which is quite nice but I've really Simca magic we look like a green dragon killer or something but in terms of the PvP challenges we look like an absolute beast let's see if this is gonna be enough guys that's good CK so I decided to go for the strength Amy it's the only upgrade I need as of now I've just been killing them all a lot lately and I feel like the mole is gonna bring me good luck so strength amulet it is again it is the only upgrade it could drop me so I pretty much will have my entire setup once I get the strength AME from the giant mole and then we are set guys and then it will be time it's a fight link it's like what an 18 I think roughly and the worlds are so like laggy right now it's super weird I just woke up because those IV drops took forever to get I couldn't do it in one filming session but yeah so let's get that drink Tammy and then I'll see you guys with my gear reveal oh my gosh that's for your drops Abel hold on hold on hold on Google giant mole wiki let's see how rare the rune to H is one at a 1.3 K I guess that's not so bad that's not so bad I'm just glad it's not like 1 in 3 K because I am actually going for the pet so that is why I'm 1800 kills not quite there yet that's one in 3 K we will get there imagine I got it during the PvP challenge that'd be hype and there it is guys the amulet of strength we know what this does +10 strength bonus and that's literally it with the necklace so we have our gear setup all ready to go so I'll meet you guys in Edgefield real quick we'll go over the gear we got every tattoo way to this [ __ ] will we hit hot no of course not of course we won't hit guys I cannot believe our gear setup we actually almost look like a proper player I would say if we lost this you know it's you know almost almost I would say this is also a PvP challenge with probably one of the most high level gear that we've ever had this is pretty awesome we have an IB shield IB cape dragon place here dragon boots I would say there's two little flaws or one little flaw one main fault the gloves again I [ __ ] up on those I don't think that's a crazy deal but the real problem is this [ __ ] thing guys look at the hose defense that's again the attack stats aren't that great 42 strength is not that great and this thing is long sword speed so I have to really pray that his weapon is just as bad or just pray that his gear is honestly so much worse I do think that my gear is some of the best it could be so I think at the very worst his gear kind of matches mine I'm sure he had a very similar plan thankfully though we have a shield that gives strength bonus boots that give strength bonus so we're still out of 61 even with a pretty [ __ ] weapon I mean he could've easily just not have gotten that maybe maybe he went for a power immune only has plus 6 I I don't know I don't know what the heck he's gonna do just super stressed that this gives negative defense bonuses like what the hell but yeah these are the stats we did not need to fill up the ammo or ring slot so we're ready to fight link and again I don't know what to think gear wise I think a plus weapon wise like a C so just messin about real quick before the fight and if he does have similar geared to me the move is going to be crushed look at this plus 220 versus + 235 and 237 and it's plus 36 an all attack for melee so it looks like crush is going to be the way unless he probably has like a chain body then it's probably gonna be stab or slash I'll have to just make an executive decision then oh boy hello hey it's a bit weird cuz I finished like three days ago dude and you like just finished and I'm where goes gossiper they got piss asleep to make sure I could get these drops like it's been ridiculous but it's been ridiculous I will say that when we started this challenge we didn't realize you know how much time it was gonna take we thought it's gonna take like three four hours yeah and then of course once we start we realized no actually there's many ways to like force a drop from a high-level monster I think it took me 22 hours an old dude you're a [ __ ] you know why well I did really it shouldn't have taken that long it should take I think it should have taken max 12 but I just got really really really dicta RG yeah I mean this could have been a challenge where it could be like you just cried the court for seven months and force lock like an L yeah you see we need to get two of these episodes out week so we weren't able to do things like that but yeah bit of a weird one but you know hopefully this is something you can kind of look towards in the future but yeah and then prove all [ __ ] exactly Ken's first time around your choice what would you like I'm gonna go with gloves because this is my first one that I kind of messed up on but I don't think it's that big of a deal so I want to get it out of the way okay all right so I didn't do that well on gloves actually ed so it's probably my worst lot miss BAM braces it is BAM braces and it's the red ones I didn't get the black ones I I kind of messed up I let's just say I kind of attacked it by mistake and it drop so to actually get these I attacked a monster by mistake I don't want to like go too much into it so give other stuff away but let's just say it really mean for this to happen right okay I'm glad it happened in the glove slot because I would say if I had to sacrifice something gloves is probably the least important yeah like there is a difference here but it's not gonna make a [ __ ] difference once all the gears on do you know yeah I guess you got lucky with that one okay Cape you know I like going Cape mate I'm gonna say you did not kill a highwayman no no in this challenge no this challenge you know I thought about it but that it was like wait a sec we could do better yeah okay I mean it's the obvious choice is it not yeah fire capes are obviously not allowed because it's not a drop this is the bestest lot I would say oh okay alright yeah I don't think it was possible to get anything better I'm gonna go with necklace okay I got a lip strength likewise on the dirt no I didn't want to risk that I went to the mole hell okay now I shout out to the live stream I don't know exactly what he's about to put on like a hundred and twenty [ __ ] solo kills okay well you finished off is all right yeah yeah okay Casey so finish Zara congrats on that by the thank you may appreciate it so yeah finish Laura got the Med helm at the end and I think I made about 15 mil from Zara trying to get this D met and a magma boots okay reboots rune from neck reels I barrage them and got some magic XP at the same time you get dragon oh yes I got dragon [ __ ] it was their only equippable drop oh I didn't even think about that so and it took me like almost 300 kills I think this was a bow like 288 or something like that I might be still be gassing it was over the drop rate but how did you get that yeah dude what the heck I'm height Wow white let's just fight right now I'll keep my spikes on my feet a girl eggs lady boys what would you say if I said that I don't have legs let's say you're talking absolute [ __ ] well it was he go light legs he got plate [ __ ] skirt yeah brilliant yeah yeah put on that dragon skirt D legs yeah Borka Volk ass but I actually wristed and Volk ass was the first thing I killed same Wow we wanted a dragon battle axe oh yeah drank bat like so long sword is what I was going for yeah yeah Wow at least I think if people are decked out in gear I think a dbx might be slightly better TPS but I'm not sure at all I'm gonna go shield oh did he get it as well oh my god of course why such an obvious approach it was no easy to lock these items in here I think again this is best in slot you can't get like a visi because that's an attachable game is untrainable yeah I need a bonus as well yeah five strengths yes so yeah I do believe it is here I don't think we could own better than that so GG on that one mate the body swap mate yes yes it does oh yes I see got what's he got yeah red dragon yep three dragon I made sure I force that one in there as well oh my god it's gonna come down to the weapons it's giving over I kept talking about a flaw in my plan it's not the leather gloves let's just say that the weapon it's the weapon I don't know if you're trolling me here I've really don't like okay so right now our gear is extremely similar yeah how we did I I put on the play body first oh I don't know if you're trolling man am i ah I don't know I can't oh yeah I shouldn't be but you know give me a countdown kids all right sorry from 100 three two one go oh my that is that's smart [ __ ] why didn't I think of that okay sounds like sounds like I'm sorry bad better but uh were you expecting more I was okay Wow okay Oh God oh wow rune hasta is that from miss dragon or dragon of sunset it's from a brutal Wow just I wanted I mean it was because the thing is I I didn't know what else was gonna drop me a pretty solid weapon and I wanted to save a rune dragon for the room play body yeah so I know the rune dragon also drops like a rune scimitar which is very comparable to what what you have there yeah yeah yeah but I really wanted to play body and I knew that I could potentially get a D long from a brutal yeah so you took the risk I took the risk and I got the hasta so honestly so similar yeah I feel very very hard done by that this took me like three times as long as it did the knew more than that in the game six seven hours I think yeah I think I'd 21 hours for me to do this yeah I feel very hard done by I'll tell you that right now hey that's that's beef with Jagex not with me dude
