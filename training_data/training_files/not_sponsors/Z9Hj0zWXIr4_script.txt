so there's no doubt that dual monitors increases your productivity dramatically whether you're in the office or on the go be it at the airport in a coffee shop or just you know hanging out at a friend's house but oh it's clear that when it comes to taking two monitors with you there are a couple of disadvantages one is that the typical desktop monitor is a little on the heavy side and two it's going to require access to an AC power outlet something that you won't necessarily have with you when you're at you know the average Airport unless you know the airport's for your from are better equipped than the ones around here so today's video then it's all about creating your own perfect productivity space that you can take with you and set up virtually anywhere yeah but not like that like this that doesn't better with glass where you can get 25% off glass wire at the link below [Music] so the thing about these portable monitors is they're not exactly a new concept which sort of raises the question why exactly are we featuring these ones especially with a portable monitor display terminal equipment I thought that was the company's name but it's not no it's just this is display terminal equipment inside the box and in case you were wondering what kind of resolving power it has they didn't even check one for us okay have you ever heard resolution called resolving power yes in the context of like a Space Telescope so for all its rudimentary enos assuming that that's a word the packaging is actually not bad I think it'd be very unlikely to be damaged in the box and they've got actually a pretty decent accessory package inside you've got a that's kind of a shame to see in 2019 but you've got a regular sort of DC yeah yeah I forget what they're called whatever cylinder a remote it actually looks kind of like the Nvidia shield TV one HDMI cable type C to type a and finally a type C to type C cable so this is pretty nice actually the first thing I'm noticing is the bezel yeah actually except the bottom but if you think about how its intended to be used next to a laptop where almost all of them have that that large bottom bezel then I it's not gonna stand out whatsoever and in fact it might even be better for synchronizing your mouse movements across the displays okay so it looks as cool as a tablet but how does it actually stand up no no I've seen yeah I've seen ones like this before so the mechanism honestly doesn't feel amazing in fact you can see a little bit of kind of flex in the back there I mean I don't think it's coming off or anything but I think a couple more screws right here and right here under the hinge would have gone a long way towards making that feel a little less flexi but the actual kickstand mechanism feels pretty good you can go all the way from quite vertical and it's pretty sturdy actually all the way down to about as low as I think you'd need to like my worst case scenario I think is like jammed onto like a plain assuming I can actually balance this on the dinner tray thing this is metal though right yeah yeah do you think that's a little scrape II do you think that was scratch a desk maybe honestly I'd be less concerned about scratching and I'd be more concerned about just slipping in general I'd want to rubberized foot or something along there just for that even what's up with that that looks like rough so here's the thing this is a Kickstarter project so these are pre-production samples but I guess this is our opportunity to give them feedback for when they do the finished ones I would rust on a product that has just been taken out of the box to be how you say it unacceptable that's it it's magnetic those are the rusty magnets oh and then here you've got some labels for the buttons rear labels why is this not there's not enough room on the bezel for them is that as bad an experience as I think it is though well I did play with it a little bit earlier and it's not yeah I didn't like just one of the things that's actually special about these guys is that they've got a built-in battery so you can use them without access to a wall plug just sort of part of the joke we were making at the beginning of the video where I was carrying around a full-size monitor it's a five thousand milliamp hour battery and they claim it'll last you five hours which is pretty sweet because you don't want to drain your laptop's battery that's already out of premium yeah and that's the way that most of these external laptop monitors have worked in the past it's just by plugging in via a couple of USB plugs so that they can take both display and power from your laptop's built-in battery okay cool well why don't we go ahead and set them up and take a look at the two different models so my understanding is this one is actually 4k correct and that one's 1080 yes so I'll take this one then yeah well joke's on you because this one's touchscreen and that one's not oh okay well that's actually kind of cool so there are a couple of things I immediately notice hooking this thing up one is that interestingly you can turn on HDR and wide color gamut so technically this appears to be an HDR display with the only problem being that if the out-of-the-box experience is anything to go by it is not nearly bright enough for me to consider it to be really truly HDR ready the spec says 300 nits so after trying to enable HDR a handful of times including disabling the built-in display here we've determined that it's not turning on and quite frankly given that it's really not much brighter even than the display built into my blade stealth which is not a particularly bright display I would say that you're not going to be having a true HDR experience on this thing anyway so I probably wouldn't stress out about that too much so the 4k one has got HDMI in and is 4k 60 Hertz by the way so that would be HDMI too it's got mini DisplayPort it's got USB type-c and then it's actually got a couple type-a ports so that USB type C is an uplink you can use the thing as a hub plug your keyboard and mouse into it which is a pretty useful feature in the age of the dongle given that you can't take for granted that your laptop will actually have a type-a port on it speaking of things you can't take for granted on modern devices I had phone jet so if you're using HDMI and you've got audio a overreach DMI then you can pass that through to yourself how's yours looking no DisplayPort mini or otherwise but we have HDMI we have two instead of one but they're the tiny tiny fine I hate mini HDMI why do you hate it it's a really flimsy connector so both the receptacle and the plug itself are prone to easy breakage because it's so thin and so wide and plate honestly it's just pretty poorly designed and what else do we have here well instead of having your full-size USB A's you have micros and then you've got a USB see again and again your headphone jack so this is all pretty cool so far but one of the key pieces of information that's missing up until this point is how exactly these stack up against other options available on the market because if you can get something like this for the same price from a brand that you've ever heard of maybe one with slightly better build quality obviously I would recommend going that route instead so we fired up bnh and it turns out the Zen screen go 15.6 inch IPS monitor from a soos is two hundred and eighty nine dollars so that's actually less than the MSRP but more than the Kickstarter pre-order price for the 1080p model here and it's got a 7800 milliamp hour battery and that is a significant increase yeah so these are 5000 however we haven't been making this video for nothing I swear there was a reason that we bothered and that's this the main difference here is that this has a touchscreen interface and that just isn't something that we've seen for as cheap as this in the past so that is pretty darn cool if you've ever tried to find a touchscreen monitor like not a replacement for your phone or anything like that but a touchscreen monitor for your computer you'd be shocked to find out how expensive they are so $300 for one like this that's honestly not the most amazing display I've ever seen in terms of the trails behind objects or the contrast but what it does have is something that's utterly unique right now at this price point and that is touch capability also a matte finish on the screen which is very unusual for a touchscreen as for the 4k model well this one's quite a lot more expensive at around $500 but it's a 4k portable monitor which again at the time that we requested these was not something that we had seen before it's definitely sharp but it is not the best-looking 4k display that I've seen how was the color accuracy on this guy I think the deltas are around 5 okay so that's that's acceptable if you're not a pro but we've kind of introduced this as being useful for those people doing remote work if you're a contract graphic designer or something you want to be at a coffee shop well how about gaming then yeah how about gave me let's go I've got a type C 2 HDMI and then I can go ahead and plug into we've got the 1080p touch model here and theoretically I should be able to fire up LeFort night all right you play some fortnight baby is this even gonna be worthwhile you're gonna tap the screen you're not holding a controller we completely could pull the controlling BRB is that you or me nice that's not bad that's pretty sweet that's pretty cool being able to just like unpack your 15 inch display you already have a phone pull out a controller dongle so now that we know with a little bit of searching for a controller that doesn't brick things we could have basically a mobile console experience just with this and a controller packed in our bag a couple cables but James wants to try something else so this one actually has a USB type-c input so we're gonna get rid of this crappy HDMI mini and try this and see what happens do you actually know what's going to happen nope oh I said well I looked at their Kickstarter page so we've got the aspect ratio difference here but that's possibly something we could adjust as well actually I want to know what this is Oh touch screens on no way yes it's working yes because it's USB see you can chill like this and then have it kind of out do this is like having a 70-inch TV whoo so we're gonna try an iPhone now but unfortunately because iPhones don't use USB type-c that lightning we can't just use our direct connection we're gonna have to go back to HDMI dude oh sure okay and a dog lock it picked it up right away interestingly we are piller boxed and letterboxed but we're getting audio over the display now why do we why didn't we get audio ever before maybe we just have a game volume turned down I might have had it off those speakers really are not amazing the latency is not terrible it's noticeable too see that yeah but it's usable like if you're used to gaming on a TV or something anyway I don't think you're gonna notice the difference that much I'm actually considering taking one of these on my trip that I'm going on today and it doesn't really add like a ton of weight especially if I truck it in my carry-on instead of carrying my backpack or something that feels very light it's definitely lighter than an iPad and all the new ones are pretty thin they're pretty light it's impressive I think this probably feels lighter just because it's bigger it's like lowering density well what about the iPad pro that's that size I can look it up damn it it's 1.57 pounds so conclusion here then portable displays are as cool as they've ever been even cooler now that they have built-in batteries and these ones while not amazing are certainly coming in at a price where I think that they look pretty compelling especially if you're after that touchscreen functionality ok lines but the people wanted a definitive answer so can you give us one of those like emperor gladiator thumb things he lives okay so here's the thing if money's no object I like the 4k one I'm gonna take this one on my trip however money is a concern so base n test these but if you're actually buying one this one looks like the more compelling option it does have some significant shortcomings I don't like the limited brightness and I don't like the inaccurate colors out of the box but at anywhere from 240 to 300 depending on whether you pre-order it or whether you wait wait it looks like a pretty compelling value if you have any use of the touchscreen that is absolutely the killer half of this display right here the coves drive over fifty percent for a limited time at the link in the video description so
