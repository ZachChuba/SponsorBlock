♪ Jordan's Messyges ♪ Well guys, (LAUGHS) I'm back! Sooner than you hoped. - You love me. I love you. (LAUGHING)
- JOSH: (LAUGHS) Sooner than you hoped. JOSH: That makes it sound like they didn't want you to come back. - You know what? It hurts. The truth hurts, Josh.
- (JOSH LAUGHING) 'Kay, these people ... I'm dishing out so much truth it hurts them. - JOSH: They don't want to see you as often as they do.
- No, they don't, 'cause it's getting too real - (JOSH LAUGHING)
- up in Messyges land. 'Kay? Let's get to the questions. JOSH: How big is this youth group? - Do you go to a mega-church?
- (JOSH LAUGHING) Okay? Because you've known this guy for three years, yet you've never introduced yourself. Okay, my suggestion ... uh ... If this guy literally has never seen you before because you go to such a massive church ... JOSH: Maybe he's that much of an introvert. He can't—he can't even see - what's going on.
- You can't—he can't even see straight because he's so much of an introvert. - So you know what? I don't know about this guy.
- (JOSH LAUGHING) Honestly. Um, sometimes, uh ... Stuff can be a handicap. At some point, okay? Messyges ... it hurts. - (JOSH LAUGHING)
- Messyges hurts. JOSH: Are you saying—what? - Are you saying introverted people are handicapped?
- No! No. The same way you can say an extrovert might have a handicap 'cause they're too loud. - JOSH: Oh.
- And they just say whatever the crap they're thinking 24/7. It's like, you don't need to do that. - 'Kay?
- JOSH: So what should—what should an extroverted person do to to, uh, introduce themselves to an introverted person without scaring them away? There's no hope! (BOTH LAUGHING) Okay, you know what, I thought about it and maybe there is a little bit of hope. Okay? What I would suggest for you to do, if I had to suggest one thing— I'm trying to think of this off the top of my head— Um. Just ... go shake the guy's hand. And then test the waters. If he freaks out and runs away, there's no hope. - If he doesn't, there's hope. Go from there.
- (JOSH LAUGHING) This ... is an interesting messyge because it's very, uh ... it's—it's ... very ... what is the word I'm looking for, Josh? Uh ... specific! - JOSH: Specific?
- Very specific! But it's very vague. Because ... your specific problem is that you—you like too many guys and they don't like you back. But I don't know if ... how you're going about anything. Okay? For all I know, you could just be like amazingly in love with this one guy that you've never really talked to and then once he kind of starts picking up on the fact that you like him, you're off—boom—to the next guy. And so he's like, "Whoa! Oh ... okay." And then you're playing Minecraft with your friend! So that's something else to think about. I don't know. If that is you, I would say just stick with one guy for as long as you possibly can until, you know, maybe he comes along and then you can see how—how it goes. Maybe you're just going too fast. That's—that's what I'm saying. - All right, this guy is, uh, quite the young lad
- (JOSH LAUGHING) as I'm understanding from just how many girls are just—they can't believe it. So ... what I would say ... If this guy ... 'Kay, this guy isn't stupid. He might be, but I'm gonna assume he's not 'cause I assume the best of people. He's not—he's not stupid. So, if he obviously knows that there's this one girl who is ... not the best - (JOSH LAUGHING)
- person. He knows everything that's going on. If he's not saying anything to this girl to stop, you know what I'd say? I'd say maybe, you don't need to like this guy. I'm not saying to shut off your feelings. But I'm just saying that maybe you need to, you know, kind of just do your own thing. Because this guy, if he's not being assertive and saying, like, "Hey, you need to stop, okay? "Because you're being mean to these other people." That's not the guy of your dreams, okay? It might be, but that will evolve, my friend. Well, guys, I'm not gonna lie. I had some amazing answers this week. So ... again, I'll be back sooner than you hope. Because Messyges hurts you. 'Kay? But you know what? I'm just gonna get so many questions I can't even keep track of 'em. So luckily I've got Josh back here keeping track of them for me. 'Kay? So we got some great questions coming up within the coming weeks. Don't be messy. And leave good messyges.
