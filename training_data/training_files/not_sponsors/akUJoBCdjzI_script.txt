welcome everyone to a very rush start to RL craft is very important because these monster boils outside of a chance to drop with our bones and oh my god are there a lot L rippy dippy dude give me them wither bones come on Frick who the Frick is hit this freaking dude bro up here I have I have no friends I have no frames help I probably I think I I think I set my render distance a little bit too high perhaps when I was thumbnailing oh my god I'm getting I'm getting hit by these big dudes up top are annoying and these are the wind egos okay you freakin Wendigo bro is okay now help oh no the wind it when it goes are on the ground oh my god this frickin thing get off my back anyway the bones no no I don't maybe not dude I was being whoa whoa whoa order that what are the dudes over there dude what's that frickin centipede I was told that undead things have a chance to drop wither bones so maybe I maybe it was incorrect these guys but you know I mean we can't wait to come out and visit the people anyway I was I just didn't want to miss the opportunity because I know that these are at spawn due to an event and so 40 and he's like typing at me like I'm 80 I know dude I description of either the stream or the YouTube video where I am going to go into my video settings and reduce my render distance or I don't know what else I did it's usually not this bad I'm gonna turn down the the game cuz goodness gracious we were getting a lot something's dehydrating me also that's creepy too old man oh man what yeah what is do oh you know what I bet it is is just the event spawned like 50,000 mobs and they're probably why doodling me either that or there are a lot of cows so there are a lot of cows that's that's also a thing ya know I mean I'm not like my frames aren't like frames but I'm not unplayable by any means let's like let's thin the herd slightly perhaps there there are a lot of cow a lot of cows just just a few don't have a cow man I'm gonna in fact I'm gonna go ahead and turn down my volume because yes loud as well very very very loud yeah voluminous saw I wasn't correcting your pronunciation I was just no you definitely you were definitely I always I always try to come out for you Karina correct pronunciations cuz I'm like that I'm pedantic also Mike my boy was a hungry boy and I fed him but I couldn't feed yours so I don't know if yours is a hungry boy Oh mine could be a hungry boy I will check in moments and probably feed a one of many robbief yes robbief okay let's see maybe the ODA Oh baby Oh tis very hungry hungry I'm slightly bemused and I don't like it's the one of those where I shouldn't be surprised but I am a little bit that you didn't notice that the landscape is dramatically change oh yeah you just cleared out a little bit of space that it's pretty cute yeah yeah just cleared out a little bit of space like three hours of digging wait really yeah but I I was thinking like our young blasts and our young lad are going to grow up and not going to need their own last lad land and so I've been kind of like crafting a dragon pit as it were and I don't know how I'm getting close like I don't know I don't have all the plans put together okay we didn't think that far ahead so drag where's the dragon pit this oh this is going to be the dragon yeah see how Ivan's like been building up the berms on the sides to show that so I'm sorry that I have not given the credit or recognition is due due credit and due recognition that I deserved and I don't feel like that was provided and I really do truly apologize skadoodle for it also somewhat I don't know funds the right word but one of the things when we first moved in here was everyone was saying hey you don't want to be there and wait what yeah in this tower and there's like there's a there's an event called an eruption event that will have mobs that can turn cobblestone to lava and that happened so if you happen to notice things like a giant gaping hole in the wall that I haven't entirely fixed or over here where stone brick is suddenly interjected or if you go upstairs and the entire floor of or what an entire floor is burned away don't worry about it don't worry about it there's let's not dwell okay it's not how is there an event that turns cobblestone into lava it's listen it's the Emerald room is a little it's it's got a we opened up the diamond room for vaulted ceilings okay yet actually you know what one of my one of my goals at some point I wanted to own like a condo high up in the sky that has one of those double-decker living rooms so it's like not like a dope view so that really just achieved it for me and I don't ever know what you have it anymore yeah we got you I did go and farm some more dragons and stuff just for some and jeez willikers they're kind of like I mean I had a million marked on my map and where we can finally kill the the level threes without too much incident it's kind of funny yeah yo solo um dude I didn't realize you know just how I like that I'm I'm balling hard out here you know what I'm saying oh wait oh never mind never mind there was like we also indigo thing was actually part here's this that I just dropped and I'll tell you when I first hovered over it with its little font I did not read that title correctly yeah so why have you why is this important for something or you no no no no no I just just for the spectral slit just I actually read spectral [ __ ] oh that's nice sparrows short dude yeah okay I initially read it as spectral slit and however I we but we both have mild forms of an ability to read mild forms of an inability to read yes this is me and my where did hear all that you put this back because I don't know where it came from so okay what should I should I get my magic up to 20 I have a lot of levels right now and the question is what should I do with them you know yeah that's an interesting question or I actually haven't done yeah I'm done ELLs in ages I haven't taken too many ELLs by the way it's it's the L is why you were I think one of these is like an option to blow through obsidian and that's why you were cutting so fast or something like that if you member like when we were when we were fighting but I don't see an actual option oh maybe it's maybe that was one of the non L ability things that is an option I can see hmm my magic is 20 what's your problem I just haven't leveled it up um get my magic up mining though don't really care too much about mining because you would have been doing most of the mine Wow Wow I know like I'm not saying you're the worst I'm just saying you're not the best either um well now I'm out of out of XP and want to go kill dragons to get more kids do they give lots of XP I they seem to I mean I don't know usually by the time I go and come back I'm like oh I have 37 levels and stuff I've filled up a number of XP tomes with various level stuff so all right now my magic is 24 and I'm not just trying to 24 whoa when he might just try and get everything to 24 XP golden tools are being held at silly yeah the the golden tools one was like wet okay maybe I should do okay I'll level magic to 2020 it's good he said reluctantly I suppose no wait I'm not a 20 man 90 god dang it it's so misleading every single freaking time upgrade for every single time why would I upgrade farming I'm at level 4 with it Wow okay now middle of seven things were really popping off here dude I'm at 24 I'm mining now so we're good we Auto field is auto feed hungry farmer makes eating a passive tab that's a farming 32 that is it farming 32 I'm never gonna get there that sounds delightful wheat aplenty adds a small chance to gather a second piece of wheat because we don't have enough we had a sorry we don't we need to get more cows I did the green thumb could be useful but still we need we need more cows did you thin the herd a little I did just a little bit good just a little off the top just a little off the top Nate I'm good to burn a bit Oh would into more charcoal do we not have any charcoal not very much only ten all right gonna make sense to burn a bit of wood at a charcoal charcoal I hardly know her mmm that that didn't even have a her in it at all like I don't know where you went with that one it's the anti-joke that's the okay you don't understand my humor no I don't the anti humor so what we want to do though is we want to claim that battle got as our own oh we still have another battle tower yeah that what you're saying - battle tower yeah okay yeah yeah I mean I'm I'm totally 100% down for going there the only problem with that the only drawback this light is you're gonna say something about me I'm alive in yeah yeah when we tried last time you died before even reaching it yeah shut here for a door I'm just saying like do you remember that cuz it was like I was trying to help gather your stuff and you were dead your friend oh oh it's that that's how we view okay cool that's way easier you show your front door okay all right we have 10 grave Scrolls so that'll be great and I have my recall portion portion yeah that that gets us out of there that's that this is out doesn't really help me getting in well I it makes sense with your history that you would be but I'm not personally planning on dying okay cool cool mister mister arrogant pants Allah now having said that oh yeah no no Karma's gonna beat the crap out of you for that wouldn't ya okay so let's go let's do it you ready I'm ready wait I'm planting wheat you're planting your seed I mean not gonna say that not gonna say that and get me some bread good perfect yes excellent wonderful thank you for everything that you're doing right now thank you me okay yeah with Herman wait why they're due season you tossed on the ground go away sooner or later all right you said yeah oh I am all set ready to go rock and roll let's do it boys all right Oh God we are freed voll my balls my balls you know this is how you died last time dude that guy just like went ham on my ass all right yeah anyway god I appear to have a little bit of ham on my ass guys um you know everyone's ago a fetish sometimes it's just help shin huh is that the one that turns cobblestone into lava it is actually oh how nice I hope that's not happening on the overworld side of things I don't think so it seems like oh it's a blah blah blah yeah no you get the blah birds and then you get the vulcans and whoa they eat a lot of theirs there's a lot there's a lot of cream my god yeah it's so good luck I'm just gonna watch you look like you got it under control though you're doing great what are you doing I'm standing back and watching oh you don't want to partake now whoa you just to hit the blah blah bah Aggie was in my way god you're too strong Wow watch out for explosion guy mother trucker mom what is he doing he just blows up like repeatedly he's not a one-trick pony okay oh my lord dude if you shouldn't have fire resistant here fire no no durability there's there's a lot there's a lot going on okay seriously yeah eruption in the nether is a little wild I can't see anything Bryan I'm at taking damage which is always uncomfortable yeah yeah okay oh no I'm down here oh there's the explosion guy you're Urena in a very busy location I'm gonna be honest I'm a little bit concerned about going into the battle tower quite yet whoa there's a nice boy over there too these can happen yeah oh he's not he's not eyes he's just a zero which is oh in in in French yeah get out of here pinkie boy all right so where am i because okay oh wait we got a brainy boy over here we must wait we do we have a brainy boy I started getting oh no it was just over or whatever what are the ones that have the particle effects again blighted white whited is what you're looking for what I want is some advanced power three in my life I have conquered the mess that was needing conquering holy crap look at all this lava over here though there's a bit better you I'm just kind of back near our portal spot I kind of like things just started exploding and I didn't see much after that like I just kind of was stabbing out anything that came hear me what is hitting me right now it's probably facehugger isn't oh no it's a blah blah girly dude remember when we first saw blahblah brand we were like whoa that's crazy and now just like ceased out dude that was a boss that was a boss blah blah oh it was actually remember cuz it had the boston meters oh right so that was a that was a special event blubber these are the baby blubbers okay if you could just chill the Frick out oh my god how are you not unaligned yet how is this thing keep hitting me I don't understand are you with her I can't hit it bro that had so much health holy crap hey come here got it gee willikers you okay yeah I'm okay frickin pinky Frankie's oh my god is so huge fan this is terrible this is terribly the eruption event in the nether like it's just it's been a lot you know yeah this is the worst is I want to do is going to like I'm still seeing I know usually it lasts like two seconds and then it's done but it seems like the event is continuing yeah not cool not cool all I want is a little bit of wither bone in my life and its really hoping that something inside of the battle tower might do that for me but and it still might like don't give up hope yeah no I won't okay I would never um he's a hopeful guy everybody uh I'm just putting out fires so you know how eruption turns the inside turn to cobble stone into lava there's a lot of lava inside the battle tower uh-huh like a lot of it if you take as well the cobble I'm assuming there's probably some cobblestone in there the the does generate from it is not a source block so so it whatever doesn't need to be there will dissipate eventually whenever eventually we says it's no one's responding mobs which hasn't happened yet hey I mean I feel like you're looking at this with a glass half-full situation I also you know can I just can I just say I really like the I like your staircase here at the end of the bag we got distracted when I when I was starting that okay I don't remember exactly the exact details huh it it's it's incomplete okay alright well should we death continue yeah we should what we should do is I see a brainy boy down there I'd prefer to get rid of that because I have bad memories of brainy boys in that particular location that guy is a special brainy boy - oh God Oh mother freak balls but yeah he's a very fast brainy boy holy shoot what the hell bro oh he's a golden brain boy okay hit oh nice I'm I'm here for you I've got your back as usual you know just ah I hate face huggers if there's anything else I can help you with let me know always always happy to be in a business of assistance what is that an asteroid claw level three that's an axe level that yeah affect wither damage - nice nice don't care about heart crystals which is weird but true okay that's good enough for now a little low on water but we're gonna we're gonna hold off oh my god so facehugger bro there's there are a few things more annoying in this than those frickin facehugger crap bolas there's a lot of broken the chests I mean lava doesn't break chests oh oh he doesn't burn him okay oh wait below us is all lava okay good to know maybe we should unblock that up if possible it's a good idea nice well done you blocked my block this man is so rich he's using iron to block it I'm a block blocker oh there's no stairs in these you just have to build up interesting so far I haven't seen much of anything in these later never nether battle towers just like nothing that was strange hmm there it is yeah there really isn't anything this is interesting interesting but hey I'm gonna you know hope slow down who's slow down doing what you were just rolling right at the top and I couldn't keep up because there's nothing here this is this is highly disappointing yeah ii think i think there were maybe i oughtta lived' for this well keep in mind I mean I died for this I'd say guide yeah yeah it could quite be that the there were spawners and everything and when you were on the liveing they were breaking because oh they spawn but what about the chests that's a that's an excellent point yeah maybe they got burned alive by the lava but there's usually a pedestal that the chest would be on there are no pedestals maybe the pedestal is what turned into lava there's just nothing here this thing goes up or ages but I'm not seeing anything just just proposing possibilities you know so far not much we'll report back winds okay we have a pinkie so excitement there when we can move into this and have this be home I love moving into places where water is not available okay so there are I didn't say there weren't logistical difficulties with it you know every place has its challenge yeah just like every rose has its thorn and that appears to be the top um so cool that's cool that's a cool Tower cool tech only the best towers yeah I wonder if like people are saying the columns should still be up there but I not seen anything I mean I don't know how we get higher than this this is this is the top oh we get higher okay you you you you use your pickaxe and right I'm just saying there's nothing about this this is the oh you mean the golem is in the nether rack at the top because yeah that's where he wants to be listen his golems are tricky and that's uh that's bedrock up there I don't believe that he's actually up here yeah I'm not convinced that there is still a golem for us to golem out neither am i neither am i actually i did you know wither skeleton skull from something i just got no bones to go along with it which is making me slightly sad so would you say and I'm just checking here would you say that you have a bone to pick with this tower I don't actually because I don't yeah you have no bones to pick whenever I see wait oh he's going for the lava drop did you make it it's so yellow it's so yellow it's like I'm in P okay I'm good all right easy there bear grylls how alive yeah you're fine I love I love jumping into lot I mean it's heating me up a little bit oh no I went under Oh God yeah yeah yeah you don't want to lose where you're at because if you end up break off if yet I wonder if we can finding those guys they can all just suck nuts suck we haven't been this direction did you want to oh yeah we could I guess we could continue see if we find anything this is a northerly course northerly sounds great and then we can just yeah then we can TP back if we get super far away so I appreciate that yeah that's always brainy boy right it's why am i so bouncy Oh brainy boy what the oh oh wait okay I'd the brainy boy did he teleport here Jesus Christ he might give me my weapon I need that in order to not die if I if I lose my way but was he a steely boy careful behind you another another pinky yeah the blighted guy's really really like disarm disarms a really common thing with them sweet jeebus I am poisoned for days like particularly Friday Oh God ultra electrified astronaut Roli Shh what what just happened I just got nuked well now it's my turn oh is that the was that the brainy boy I don't know oh god oh god I accidentally shot at a pig man the Pikmin aren't gonna hurt you that much it's the the Ashtaroth killer of Astaroth that you need to worry about okay hold on oh it's a dark behemoth big dark behemoth I'm really actually very low on health oh I'm very low here I'm very low okay hold on I actually oh Jesus okay you got your grade scroll hold on I gotta take care of this student Jesus my god how did this happen so good there's no way I can get back without you helping yeah I realize this I'm trying to survive but this is nuts Jesus okay med kit if there's so many things going on I can't even respawn sounds like mad okay Jesus Christ how did like what is there a thing just an event spawning fifty thousand mobs okay I got the asteroid the ass brothers down okay and now there's another loitered mother trucker when it rains it freakin pours boys okay I got a shovel and a dream oh you have been hitting the nether the Pigman definitely didn't help things a lot Jesus Christ I'm gonna die myself this is ridiculous how did it look we were fine and then it just suddenly everything on the planet decided it was time to nuke us yeah oh my god I'm withered again I have not nodding mad as bad holy Sh eisah holy scheisse wither weigh on wither and wither it ah I know okay facehuggers are absolute blights on our existence I would agree oh good it immediately had me looters drop my there's a lot of stuff down here let's see if I can lead some of it away all right I'm gonna see if I can get to your stuff I'm coming back that would be cool good Jesus Christ pinky the the Pigman being mad is not help I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm boy I hate this where is your stuff where's the chef holy crap there's a lot over there maybe you died over here where did you oh you died here I've died all over like I've picked up stuff I've died I've picked up stuff I've died so okay I'm trying to get yours I'm trying to get some stuff from ya I appreciate that look you're draggin I you're draggin I hold on honestly is like the got it I got your drag and I and everything else is kind of is but do you I mean there's still a million guys just right yes there's an impasse ton of things over there okay I keep telling and hoping I guess I maybe but if you have something that can act as like a storage or something like that or maybe I can with this wood I wanted to see if I can make like a chest son of a [ __ ] I mean I'm killing stuff but then I'm dying and there's just a million bucks oh my god dude I actually yeah I I think best best course of action unload the chunks I'm gonna get out I'm gonna get out of the nether and then we unload the chunks and then we frickin regroup come back Jesus Christ Jesus Christ what happened what happened I don't know that answers all right I'm leaving it should unload the chunks and then maybe maybe mobs will despawn and you can grave scroll back and get your stuff holy jesus Christ I mean by the time mobs de-spawn if the like I don't know buddy but maybe leaving the chunks will just kind of reset it but your stuff should still be there hmm here's a here's your dragon eye on the ground here I'm dropping some stuff for ya that I had a brief one where I was like no my dragon horn but that my dragons not in it so the red rocket would be great if we do not have red rocket on me hey no nice you got some Island stuff yeah my inventory was just like super full and if I tried to pause to kick stuff out I would have been income old so I get it no part of me is like how could you cuz it's very crazy in there can I get that it went from zero to a hundred in like two seconds and I don't know what happened it was pretty it was pretty Swift it seemed normal and then it was just like alright have everything so we have a base okay so we have an nth armed base that's a better base I just threw I have two astronaut level 3 claws that I just threw in there so that's a thing master off level 3 claws are you putting them into the chest that we put that stuff in nope didn't good put them in the thing with the other armor and stuff B B DB DB DB DB DD DD b there we go now I can see thank you so base so I really I just need a pommel I don't think I really need the resistance to be useful that's a much better weapon wears a helmet oh here canteen for yeah cool and then put a weapon together I'd be surprised if we didn't miss our opportunity but I think they might not be loaded you never know I was like why am i hearing growling is because I had gold detection on them with money there we go um well alright so you are you're gonna grade school actually you know I'll go back in and then I'll tell you wonder Grave scroll sure remember that time when you said isn't it funny how you went alive in another and you're gonna get karma took place like know part of me is mad no no for sure like you know I I accept my fate and if things get lost and things get lost okay there there are the mobs have despawned to an extent it looks like I am returning then alright go for it go for you are the it looks like most items are no longer with us what oh there's a zombie pigman wearing half of our gear okay so perhaps that's what he's doing why am I not getting them the vampire out of this got it okay we go hey I am in a bad way already because of I'm alright I'm trying to got it right I'm withered because why wouldn't I be withered because why not you get the stuff right holy oh oh it's an invisible blighted mothertrucker ultra ninja mother Frick I'm dipping I'm dipping alright let's let's get out of here this oh there's a brainy boy of course freakin brainy boy I'm like I'm like great scroll I might scroll out of here alright oh that's that's nice you sense that you're too far from home to return cool what the potions not working I wonder if it doesn't work across dimension that's fun holy crap there are many there are many there are many oh we lost my balloon oh my god it's the invisible duty still on he's so otter you knocked me in oh my god invisible blighted facehuggers need to I needed to go they need to go these to not be in the game okay help I have no help to give unfortunately I'm going to report going to the portal I don't even know where the portal is at this point I thought I knew and now I'm up here I left I can come out and get you I think saw where you were oh my god it's you it's you you son of a [ __ ] get out get out holy should I go to the opposite side over to the right okay did it figure out that we got better gear and it just like scaled up the nether actually to be fair though your penis is a volcano event thing has still not stopped spawning mobs apparently so there's that oh you found it nice there is that I have never seen such madness in my life that was that was madness oh good thing the big man grab your stuff for you there was a lot of stuff I don't know what was on him what wasn't there you got your you got your red rocket no no no I made another one oh and this one doesn't appear to have the the what I need I at least as far as I could tell I thought that it was the red the cinder that gave me the vampirism but I certainly wasn't regaining health attacking those guys so I'm not sure why that was Simmons gives me cinder bleach right there darkling school should have given me leech so why is that not but I'm also not seeing the hover text that I normally see well isn't the hover another attribute from something else maybe let's see yeah seven attack damage so detected every time I go a lot faster but doesn't have the leech on it okay well the nether nether does pretty good we lost a diamond helmet that doesn't seem like a huge deal given that we're wearing dragon right no no I might have gotten all of my armor and when we got the dragon I but I lost a lot of other baubles the across the balloon the shield the cobalt shield was pretty nice although I hadn't been using it recently so and then Myatt was obviously but we had a spare of that so that should be fine a lot of canteens but not to worry about that um I also have my you can use my red rocket if you want I see that there might might be my new one might be better but we'll compare okay but anyway you know life goes on no bloody yada and nothing to know you should try a battle tower in the overworld because we have gotten gas tiers and wither bones without going into the nether so there's obviously stuff here and then we cannot worry as much about everything being the worst everything being the absolute a theist of worstest yeah so this gives right now there we go that's the leech and so that's the scope level two this gives slowness versus penetration penetration probably nicer than the slowness and being open with myself and being um what are our thoughts on maybe bringing some gabbles with us well we have really not that many apples so let me turn all our apples into capitals though apples are easy enough to gabble they are indeed right there and then that they're all right put this back here yeah I I was like I thought that I had most of my leech ability back but-- so if something was blocking it or just doing dinner on the ground thank you but otherwise we alive we out here I mean not really alive but I'm alive and put those back the recall potion was a big total diamond that night didn't didn't didn't like that you know it might be that it's a dimensional thing see and then bucket of water that is probably the biggest loss of them all I'm sorry that happened to you how will you recover you're mocking me how might you recover from that oh the legendary pickaxe that one kind of sucks ah poopy pants wait did you we've got a million not the four oh the fortune when we still have it I have a fortune one on me as well I might had the fortune one on me as well no no you didn't it's in here okay I need some sticks and I need a shovel in pkx make myself many things a momentary sorry problem pickaxe got my axe have a canteen have a water bucket okay so now I just need what water and then sorry is little little bit okay a little bit of shifty but okay mate I understand what I lost all my stuff it took a moment to get it back it's like it okay and my pickaxe is clumsy perfect it's just the kind of pickaxe I'm looking for I've got a long pickaxe T to summon the boss hmm but they're after battle tower I think Z needs to like your backup maybe do a little offline work and then we can worry about them bosses dude come on give me something I like taxi images good yeah you're you're experiencing there you go there you go there we go there we go oh that 20% attack speed would be lovely yeah that's good on it's not a show oh and something else that'd be great okay diamonds are easy to find no big deal I wonder if I could actually could I get 20 percent attack speed bonus on my sword that would be big plays if I you said you got more drew oh you've so many dragon buds my god I rewrote some track amounts yeah and get something bonus plus 15% attack speed and plus 15% big speed oh wait you can get attack damage right uh yeah I think that's what I ad was plus 20% attack damage oh that would be even better I feel like yeah 10% attack damage not knocking off dragons ain't no thing right now I mean it might be now again I might have a hard time with it but previously it was not a big deal we still have one or two that are pretty close to us okay but I don't know where a battle Tower is at the moment oh like we've seen many I know we've been to that one I'm deleting of that all right maybe it's week three with that oh plus 10% attack speed and attack and plus 10% attack damage yeah that's a good one that is good I will take it okay let's see yeah I don't have a battle tower in sight at the moment we'd have to all right we could see how quickly we can just nuke a dragon down but that's the thing is I can't get wither owns that way sad right the I do know where one I believe t5 dragon is and then we have a lot of t threes that we can go to but yeah we passed battle towers I guess we just haven't like marked them off I've marked everything that I've seen the only battle towers I know of or the one in the ocean and right near spawn one denier spawn and those with two that we've been through mm-hmm so I'm not so sure I mean we could just go far or what do you want to do dragon or because you've gotten a lot of dragons so I don't know how much more that gives to us right cuz we could get if we got with her bones that'd be a big place I have no idea where to get with her bones from kill random things because obviously it worked for us in the past you know could could be we can always just go oh isn't that where we got the wither bones was in the dungeon lady but never done the nether dungeon Oh was it we we didn't fully complete cuz you did we know we went all the way to the bottom we did okay but there's definitely more to that one so we could try going back there well there's more to your upper floors not the I think we cleared out the nether portion of it right then I don't think our dragons are ready to fly us around and show us the world like I can show you the world probably not probably not but my my dragons of 40 days why are they baby Yoda is 272 yours is 278 Wow they're pretty close pretty close yeah your call do you want ahead we can like just head south and pass a dragon along the way we can or go to the dungeons those are kind of our options in terms of like following with a goal in mind of destination in mind I mean I guess we could try re-entering the dungeon the only thing is that was like mad mad lag mad leg a lot of the a lot of those spawners are broken now trees No it's not gonna be quite the same but it's not gonna be that different either so mmm I'll follow you I'll follow your lead wherever you going go okay where I will follow you I'm gonna get the bones because we need bones for the Dragons mm-hmm but if only we could get looting but it doesn't seem to exist and that would be yeah looting does not seem to be on the list of things to do it is weird it might be something that only happens like as a secondary enchantment and it won't ever show is the only thing in the list it'd be really weird to have that set up that way but you know I mean it has been weird no problem ouch Sookie dokie so I mean I did fall into water so technically yeah exactly you still with me yeah I wait what the what am I getting hit by I'm getting hit by sup there is something of paralysis cool cool I am paralyzed with ain't here I really don't know what from but I got paralyzed so that was cool I don't know exactly where you went to near the water where I jumped off the trees oh okay do you know where I jumped off the trees yes okay see you okay yeah well how long I'm gonna take a swig Ricky yeah I was like I'll take a drink and I had a like a dead bow I was like thanks for that okay he's me not nothing though got intense was this this was the dungeon I think so Oh God we have we seen those before yeah we've ran into them they're kind of icky erect buds down the stairs right I would think so it's always a good guessers to me out hi Oh we'll use someone I didn't grab a summoning wand will you summon a nymph I'm actually in kind of wait what happened painful I don't know I don't know if I didn't maybe I didn't heal fully from before but Oh Apple should be with her and getting to know her getting to know her I don't know why we choose brokenness that's frustrating in a moment I mean I will say that my life steel thing has been yeah kind of so-so it's very hard to tell if it's working or not Oh see on my old red rocket it was like very clear Fanta yeah it's what K it would be alive okay I am fully healed which is significantly better than before when I was partially healed right right I'll pick up those bones since you don't wanna okay are there any monsta boys in here that would like to assist with their wither bones we wish to we wither you and always gonna hate rats oh no you don't Spidey poo Mickey Spidey poo McGee the third definitely I'm cleared out here I have to be ready with that difficulty toggle at some point it is getting a little laggy er but not terrible yet a bit of leg mm-hmm remember if I ran into this area the dungeon enters a ravine over here okay looma a glowstone extracts as that dealer he extracts yeah oh what the okay okay chupa chupa kata from hell holy crap I'm glowing oh that's cool can you see me through walls yes yeah that's really cool that's pretty cool I was like nah I do that Chupacabra was not so I was like on speed oh hey boys why

just like jump in I mean I'm down here are you you're not in the exact same spot as me I'm just off to this letter at least from where you have were when you were sniping down I'm just off to the side okay Oh still really close okay okay okay you're getting a little bit leg bill like yeah like better leg do you see a spawner I think the spawners are I'm just murdering everything right now it seems to be working thus far the spotters are behind the ports behind the ports oh my just took one out there's there's these we call it you can't see I'm too worried to come down there now it's so laggy you are oh there's a wither skeleton down here those so nice out okay stop putting me in cobweb whoever not a fan of that oh I'll do it I'll do it that was a lot of experience cool what's up I just getting knocked around and got knocked down a tiny little one oh wither says a buff wither skeleton holy crap he's done you down yeah I think those I think those are the big big spawners Oh My lordy we might have to dude I think we've got to do a difficulty toggle this is insane I can't do anything it's so laggy it's so bad I think I just saw X throwbacks or whatever those are oh my god I'm trying to hit the rat with the lag it's very difficult oh my god there's so many things down here Jesus Christ ah holy crap Holy Mother of God I gotta go Jesus Christ there's a lot of guys down here wish I hell dude you have so many oh my god I need to go oh my god what it I can't can you difficulty taco please I can't see a damn thing I have two frames a second holy crap oh my god I'd rather than that it was going well I'm like I don't where did it where do we go where did I get down here in the first place didn't you like literally drop down I did yeah let me let me build thank you holy crap okay there's a lot of bones but I just oh right I should just pick them all up yeah I mean a lot of XP yeah I got it I have these two mountain and there's still a lot of spawning activity down here yeah where the hell are the spotters there there's lots of quartz in the walls and they're behind the block support oh okay so you got a you got a like fight your way through I mean I broke a couple but you gotta get there so you see me so all the oh my god oh my god it's not necessarily all of them as far as I know but that's like where I found some was in these crypt areas yeah oh sure oh I might need to actually go do my helmets looking bad got one so although there's so many Oh No oh god I fell down another floor Jesus yeah no I fell down - that's where I was I just worked my way up there's a I just dug up God sure maybe I don't want to do that yet um I am an absolute pin cushion oh my god you but but we we appreciate you for who you are obviously a lot going on the chupacabras are attacking really fast I'm not sure why that there's suddenly so energized hi everybody no either bones sadly I could throw out my shovel God dang it they're all fine over there they don't they there they're good I've taken out a number of spawners but maybe not every single one still working on it so it's a process no there's a rat that means that I'm likely to die i way of oh my god when i look over there it's just two frames per second right okay kill those guys still some more horse over here whoa chupacabra no wither bones there who darklings skull level three Oh a rat oh that's why my helmets going down so quickly it has burning thorns on it okay begone be here there my god I'm not gonna be able to hit that be hey I hit it we're good I'm not gonna be able to hit that eye hit it nailed it that is a terrifying looking thing those bones see this sweet jeebus sweet sweet jeebus most of us right there got banshee eye level 3 I mean cool yeah whatever whatever that does it sounds better than not having Banshee eye a level 3 I'll tell you that much right now you guys seeing like the sort of thing that needs to have that broken oh my god there's banshees everywhere here there's a fancy fancy a banshee spawner a Bansi spawner I don't know another way I can we do a difficulty toggle again I mean this feels crazy more judging us i i'm not even overwhelmed I just there's no frames alright you know what may be pretty extents IV options video settings shaders off-going shaders off we'll see how this does move taking out a lot of spawners but there's these are not insignificant have you have you collected any wither bones by any chance cool oh I don't have the the nope the bees or to stop poison from happening now oh that's fun um let me investigate momentarily as soon as I stop falling in spider web no actually the shaders might have helped with this or turning them off video setting shaders that see if that helps a little I do not have any wither this has been a busts okay in terms of withers what the hell just what nice regular motioning mom you got kaboom there's some amount of possibility that the chest I looked in was a little bit trapped and I looked inside of it and things were fine and then momentarily later with a bone I with a bone and found the things were not fine I got away the run oh good buddy old buddy a wither bone and I actually uh I think I have to leave because my helmet is about to break and I don't want to lose it well we're about at max anyway yeah we are are you cool to find your way out yeah yeah yeah
