[Music] and of course I'll have the weekend what what is a weekend Downton Abbey lovingly tracks the decline of a way of life that's long since faded out of existence and the spirit of that bygone era is embodied in the series most memorable character Maggie Smith's Dowager Countess of Grantham violet Crawley is a guardian of tradition servants of human beings - yes preferably on their days off she views the future as an enemy to be valiantly fought off she's first electricity no telephones sometimes I hear as if I were living in an HG Wells novel and Downton Abbey's attitude to violet is its attitude to the past in general on the one hand it's pointing out how outdated she is and forcing her to watch her lifestyle lose the war against time miscommunication or talked but Downton Abbey is also obviously charmed and delighted by violet it always seemed rather dark when my mother-in-law lived here then she made everything okay so here's our take on how the Dowager Countess personifies the romance of tradition and Downton Abbey's ambivalent love affair with the past and on what her old-school perspective can teach us about living like nobles [Music] before we go on we want to talk about click the link in the description below to sign up now [Music] with two such dota champions United as they are by the strongest ties of all family and friendship Downton Abbey is defined by the push and pull between its two matriarch s-- Isabelle and violet Crawley as they fight to decide which direction their shared family will move in the upper middle class Isabelle represents progress while the aristocratic Dowager Countess represents tradition the difference is encapsulated in their very first exchange what should we call each other well we start with mrs. Crawley and Lady Grantham the show makes it clear that both women generally have a point in the first season Isobel pushes for a local man with dropsy to undergo a new procedure and violet is fiercely opposed this time Isobel proves right my mother was right there but just two episodes later it's the opposite Isobel misdiagnosis Moseley convinced she knows best and violet steps in with the solution because this is not erysipelas this is a rule allergy so the series is sending us the message that we need a balance of Isabel's forward-thinking and violets old-fashioned wisdom Isabel the idealist needs violet to keep her grounded I knew how you hate facing finish while violet the realist eats Isabel to push her and shake her out of her rigid this is the way it's always been mentality you're looking forward to this brave new world of mrs. corney's imaginings that dance between these two poles of tradition and progress as epitomized by the two women is really the narrative arc of all of Downton Abbey I think accepting change is quite as important as defending the past but the role of houses like Downton is to protect tradition ironically a big reason Isobel and violet clash is that they're so alike she looked extremely determined notice determined as I both of these strong-willed women genuinely believe they know what's best for everyone violet thinks class divides are the backbone of society while Isobel has just as much faith in upward social mobility surely we must all encourage those less fortunate to improve their lot where they can not if it isn't in their best interests you might say Isabelle is almost like the politically correct leftist voice of today inserted into the past daddy works harder than a slave and so she has to manage everything else by herself I doubt he works harder than a slave cousin Isabel is very literal her causes and pet projects are noble but at times the show paints her moral righteousness as insufferable you make me sound very fervent with her firm principles can lead her to overlook nuance as we see in her tendency to always expect the worst of violet don't pretend Mary's sudden reluctance can't be traced back to you where shall pretended I told her to take him for all her open-mindedness toward people in the abstract Isabel takes a long time to see the potential in this real person in front of her meanwhile as Isabel's conservative counterpart violet sometimes over emphasizes the individual case instead of caring about broader improvements for people at large she reflexively dislikes any change on principle viewing every sign of progress almost as a personal insult no it is you I thought it was a man wearing your clothes still violets sweeps us off our feet with her ability to evolve and surprise I do think a woman's place is eventually in the home but I see no harm in her having some fun before she gets there and while the show lets us know it disapproves of many of her old world opinions her witty delivery makes her the far more fun and beloved character one can't go to pieces of the death of every foreigner we don't be in a state of collapse whenever we open to newspaper why the later seasons these two are each other's best friends they complete each other they'll never stop trading edgy Barb's but they thrive on this lively never-ending argument say what you like but I know you care about these things as much as I do no nobody cares about anything as much as you do each is better for the ways that the other pushes her to change and this is a lesson to all of us on how rewarding it can be to engage with the person you moe disagree with if you wish to understand things you must come out from behind your prejudice and listen their last dialogue in the series belongs to the two matriarch and as usual they're debating their relationship to the Past in the future violet voice is a reminder that what they're doing is a continuation of tradition what they do every year makes me smile the way every year we greet to the Future whatever may be written her words Express a kind of anxious resignation to the future in the passage of time as something one must face though it's generally unpleasant as always something is enough Isabelle counters with a hearty approval of forward motion what else could be drink - we're going forward to the future not back into the past but fittingly violet gets the last word if any we heard the choice and this moment of violets wistfulness for the past mixed with the look of stunned dismay that isabel gives her in response encapsulate the perspective of Downton Abbey by thinking sensibly you mean thinking like you we of course the Dowager Countess is famous for her wit oh you only say that to sound clever I know you should try it but what can we glean from the content of what she says here's what we can observe about the philosophy of the Dowager Countess as a realist pilot takes the world as it is not as it ought to be she views each situation case-by-case life is a series of problems which we must try and solve and she's comfortable with contradictions there's no logic in it oh no search for logic I should not forage among the English shopping since she's not trying to bend reality to fit any pre-existing ideology violet is exceedingly observant and admirably quick to adjust to unpleasant developments and something bad happens there's no point in wishing it had not happened the only option is to but though she views life honestly she's frequently engaged in obscuring manipulating or shoehorning the truth to serve her ends she believes that much of life is a game of controlling appearances I could never justify telling an outright lie have we nothing in common violet doesn't live by a moral code she lives by a code of etiquette you might say good manners are her morality she thinks observing the proper customs is more virtuous than doing what one privately feels is right in other words the appearances of things are even more important than the inner reality Robert people like us are never I'm happily married what do we do if we are well in those moments a country is unable to see as much of each other as they would like her stiff British manners dictate maintaining control over one's feelings at all times Oh granny even the English aren't in control of everything what I hope we're in control of something only ourselves pilot can be shocking because she doesn't prize many of the classic internal values that a modern mind might instinctively accept as important like honesty there can be too much truth in any relationship hard work Ben PTO wife whose fortune let's go to this old young man and it talks about weekends the jobs or good intentions meaning well is not yet she is deeply offended by transgressions in external presentation like when someone doesn't wear the right clothes to dinner why not addressing God or better still pajamas kathleen Poorman Daughtery writes that the show itself also suggests quote manners are a central means through which we demonstrate moral character manners are employed to demonstrate respect for another so I changed no don't bother to me yes and who are we to weren't any courtesy in violets view the grand play of manners is society's beating heart within that play she believes her classes responsibility is essentially the social good a modern company boasts about creating jobs it's our job to provide employment Narus to craft with new services as much used to the counties across the relationship between the upstairs and the downstairs is symbiotic held together by the glue of propriety and the performance of mutual respect violet sees her spiritual role as an aristocrat as leading by example with a certain attitude don't be defeatist it's very middle class and we can see this isn't just in violets head the servants of Downton do care that their employers project a particular image and persona why should he be a lawyer gentlemen don't work silly not real gentlemen violet is selfish but not for her individual person for the interests of Downton the Crawleys and their legacy I didn't run down to 30 years to see it go lock stock and barrel to a stranger from God as well there's a coldness to her sometimes putting the family name over the happiness of a family member but at the same time there's the sense that violet is looking at a bigger picture informed by her longer view of the past she's thinking further into the future if she won't say his when you might be poor he won't want to when you will be rich before violet Crawley graced our screen actress Maggie Smith played another sharp-tongued aristocrat penned by Julian Fellowes in Gosford Park there's one thing I don't look for in a mage its discretion with my own secrets of course this precursor to violet also has the biting humor and the judgmental air but she comes across as nasty wife and this underlines that it's really violets warmth her strong heart underneath all the controlled propriety that makes the character so special you must choose either death life her harshness is not meanness more often it's a constructive if blunt shove in the direction of life you're a woman with a brain and reasonable ability stop whining and find something to do underlying violets mindset is a sense of romance for days gone by and that she reveals that the core of traditionalism is nostalgia a sentimental idealized view of the past is a crucial part of conservativism can even really want things to go back to the way they were surely of course I do and just quickly as possible political scientist Diana mots argues that when the ruling class feels their position is in jeopardy quote conservativism surges along with the nostalgia for the stable hierarchies of the past so it's no surprise that violets sentimentality is mixed up with support for a class hierarchy that conveniently keeps her family at the top when you get these little people pouty goats today it's like just a drink the show's writing takes many an opportunity to comment on and chastise the past examining social unfairness and applauding the victories that come over time yet probably the biggest reason people are drawn to Downton Abbey is precisely because it activates and indulges a cultural nostalgia downton answers the yearning for the good old days with a bewitching appealing version of early 20th century England an era so far back we can't remember it but can only imagine ourselves in it preferably as one of the upstairs crowd oh thing is there anything worse losing one's made thus it's fitting that the key champion of this era which is so wistfully remembered is a romantic at heart even if she'll go to the grave denying it my granny your romantic I've been called many things never there as a younger married woman violet fell in love with a Russian prince and we resolved to do but they were stopped by the princes wife just in time ultimately violet is thankful that she didn't end up sacrificing everything to follow her heart so she saved you from ruin from ruin the loss of my children my life in the shadows so while it reveals that she did once get swept away by a torrid passion Bhoomi it sounds as if we were both unhappy you wouldn't admit it if it were true you think to be unhappy in a marriage is ill-bred you didn't know me the deeper point of this story is that she's even more romantic about respectability convention and the society she's thrived in for so many decades this sort of thing is in reality it can prove very uncomfortable violet Crowley is a woman who has got to be with the love of her life which is Downton Abbey you'll find this never a dull moment in this house the series is titled after the estate that binds all these characters the title sequence focuses on shots of this house but what exactly constitutes Downton Abbey is not just the building or the Crawley family or the servants or the village it's all these people tied together by shared customs values and purpose violet nearing the end of her life is the custodian of this community passing down the spirit of Downton as it was to Downton as it will be the Downton Abbey film explicitly paints Mary as violets spiritual heir the house of this community and you're keeping it baby and it's not hard to see the resemblance between these two characters however it's nice but he doesn't like a puppy who's been rescued from a puddle she look like Juliet on awakening in the truth as Mary grapples with whether it's worth the hassle to keep this estate alive should we really go on with it you mean leave Downton violet reassures her that while their ancestors live differently from them and their descendants will live differently still Downton will be a part of their future in some form the important thing that violet is urging her granddaughter to treasure and protect is the continuity of culture a respect for and remembrance of what came before us and how indebted we are to so many people will never know or understand we're going to end with a spoiler from the movie here so if you haven't seen it yet skip to our next video at the end of the film violet reveals that she doesn't have long to live her passing signals that certain era we've all enjoyed watching is truly coming to a close but while Mary's Downton will have to adapt almost beyond recognition to have any chance of surviving a dream of the past lives on in this house which will shape the hearts of the future remember to pray for us
