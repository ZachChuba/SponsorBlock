51.6 MHz IU's Homebody Signal Hello, hello (Noisy, noisy)
Hi Today is a special episode These are people who I love
and wanted to invite so much I took courage and invited them
on Homebody Signal I want to introduce you
to these people, should I call them my favorite? Oh My Girl's Seunghee (She's about to lose her voice
due to today's excitement) (Oh My Girl's Seunghee & Hyojung)
We'll have Seunghee and Hyojung with us Two, three Found them, Oh My Girl Hi, we are Oh My Girl's Hyojung Seunghee Nice to meet you (A shy fan-girl)
It's nice to see you (A touched fan-girl) I've never had official guests
on the show before (I can't believe I'm first) I'm not sure what to do myself Before we started, they were
in the waiting room, they went karr, karr (Karr, karr in the waiting room) Have you.. seen Homebody Signal by any chance...? (Expected this question) - Yes
- You have, really? For real? - The one in which you cook
- Egg bread I'm so flustered I didn't know who would see it Seriously Thank you so much I really like Oh My Girl so much as well It feels so funny to say these things Why? Why? Why? - I love it
- I've never done this before Oh My Girl has been steadily
catching more and more attention Each time something new came out, - I could see clearly how much they've grown
- Thank you As a viewer, I felt very happy Thank you How did it feel? - How did we feel?
- Yes You posted about Dolphin
on your Instagram - Right, seriously
- I love Dolphin so much - It got back on the charts
- Right, seriously Did it really get back on the charts? - It did
- It was off the charts before (Super cool)
We almost disappeared from the charts But all of a sudden, as soon as you said, "I love Dolphin" there was a wave - Did I cause a wave?
- Yes I really like it (The reason you love Dolphin?)
Let me tell you why On Sunday, I like waking up and watching SBS Inkigayo
from time to time I slept in and turned the TV on and Oh My Girl was on at the time Until then, I hadn't heard Dolphin before I just loved it (Really?) You all looked so different as well It made me feel a bit excited and nervous I'm been a long time fan But I went, what's this?
Why are the lyrics so good? Why is their performance on stage so good? I watched you guys as if I were possessed As soon as SBS Inkigayo was over,
I uploaded that post I made it I wanted to become a bigger fan I really wanted to have you on the show It's quite random but Homebody Signal is not a show which invites celebrities as guests But still thank you for agreeing to come - Of course
- Of course How did it make you feel
when you got the message inviting you to the show? I was shocked In list of activities, it said [Hyojung, Seunghee, I...] is all I saw So I thought I guess I'll have to do something
with Hyojung, but when I pressed it, it said, Hyojung, Seunghee, IU? I was so shocked, seriously (She could dig a hole to the basement) I didn't mean to dye my hair But I decided to dye it - Really?
- Yes So I could look pr.. oops.. pretty Oh my goodness, oh my, oh my Too funny Actually, we were on break since yesterday Oh my goodness, I'm sorry It's fine It really is fine But I learned that I got
invited to Homebody Signal so I said I don't need to go on a vacation I have to go here Are all the others members
on vacation now then? Yes, they are on break Are you guys all done
with the latest set of activities? But you dyed your hair just for this? (Do I look pretty?)
That's a big deal - I'm so touched
- Pretty Thank you so much - Today is the final day of activities, then?
- Yes, almost Congratulations Thank you Before we get started for real, I wanted to explain the reason I came - to like Oh My Girl
- Oh really? We went to the same beauty salon
for a long time Of all the stories I heard about celebrities, I've only heard good things about this group Seriously That's you though (No.. not me..) I.. (People compliment IU all the time)
That's you for us I mean of course.. (That's her) I actually watch everything in which Oh My Girl comes out Really? Oh my goodness - I got goosebumps
- Seriously When these two people
are on TV or something, this really is seriously what I think I feel very.. embarrassed I do work hard wherever I go But when I see you guys I feel like I really need to learn from you Your energy is so incredible Seriously I'm serious, I'm serious There's no reason for me
to make up stories here (Very touched) I wanted to talk with you guys in person So I invited you guys over on the show Let's get started, the script is this long (Didn't even get to turn the first page) I did some research on you two I heard Seunghee - is good at copying people's faces..?
- Yes - Could you copy my facial expression too..?
- Yes (Funny already) (All ready now) There is a few (1. Laughing in a cute way IU)
You laugh in a cute way from time to time When you laugh in the cute way, you go Wink (What just happened?) Like this (Like this) (Cracking up) But let me tell you something,
I pull off 50% of it with my skill but I can't do the other 50%
since our faces look different We look different, so we can't help it Please take that into account (2. Dreamy IU)
Secondly, dreamy She sits diagonally like this You look similar already - I think I get what she's doing
- She sits diagonally like this She'd have a see through bang (Synchronization 100%) (Why do they look the same?)
Oh my goodness As I watched TV, I thought Seunghee's face and my face give off similar vibes No, they don't I've never seen her this close before We look so similar (Let me pretty myself up first) Ah, Hyojung, I can't... You never get angry? I can't.. I can't express anger very well Other people (While others comply with a theme)
do things like dreamy or sweet like what she did (Hyojung is always smiling)
Hyojung, you always (Someone save me) - I saw the gifs that say, 'No one told Hyojung about the theme'
- Right But do you just never get angry? I do get angry but I'm not scary - I do get angry
- Oh so Hyojung were angry You did feel anger but people are like 'She doesn't seem mad?' - Right, I don't think they can tell at all
- Really? When that happens When that happens we pretend we got scared (Hyojung didn't get the message again) - Hey
- As someone younger? - You are too funny
- She's still our leader So we pretend to be scared like this Can you describe how Hyojung
looks when she's angry? She just hits something by herself like this - She'd hit a wall
- Oh she hits herself like this? She does or massages some body part (Possessed by Hyojung's spirit) (So funny)
By herself, she goes Why were you mad at the time? My tooth felt cold My tooth felt cold Your tooth felt cold? Wait a moment This person Her tooth felt cold Why did you get mad at them..? (Hyojung feels embarrassed) So did you get it treated..? It healed the next day (That's what happened?)
Oh it feels okay now But I feel like she does feel
more anger than I thought though (Thinking about it makes her laugh) Judging from the fact that
because her tooth felt cold, she got mad and hit a wall (Embarrassed) - Hyojung came to  concert (with Mimi)
- Right I've been wanting to go
to your concert so much On the date I wanted to see you, you were
having a concert in Busan, so I ran over After she enjoyed the concert,
she gave me (Hyojung gave a neon sign she made herself)
a mood light that she made herself I felt so thankful After the Busan concert,
everything felt so hectic But I saw it again at home and realized it was so pretty I turned it on and it was so pretty There is my favorite space in my room I put it there The battery for the LOVE part ran out - It ran out?
- So only POEM is turned on now The battery ran out already (Happy)
I'm keeping it safe When we can have concerts again, I'll make sure to invite you So bring every member
of Oh My Girl who can make it I also asked you if there's something
you want to brag about and you said you wanted to brag about slippers..? I thought slippers are good just for walking around the room without causing disturbance But I was wrong - Then what?
- More, more They make make
your body proportions look better So when you take a peak, you'll think - how are Seunghee's body proportions so nice?
- That's what I mean So you take a look,
thinking she must've worn heels But slippers? - Slippers
- You'll think she's got good proportions to begin with That vibe - What about you, Hyojung?
- For me, I moved out of my parents' house
for the first time So I made my personal homemade apple wine (Surprised) (Shy)
Why did you get so shy saying that? - I heard you brought it
- Right, it's this big It was so heavy I almost died Okay then What did you put in here? In this, I put apple, sugar, Chamisul(soju) Chamisul Chamisul Look at her face (Hehe) If we drink this now,
how would it taste? I'm not sure, I never tried it Should we try a sip? - Do you drink a lot?
- Do I drink a lot? My tolerance level isn't very high  Should I try just one sip? Let us do Hyojung's
homemade apple wine tasting Oh my goodness It's very fragrant It should be okay, right? (Half worried, half excited) (How will it taste..?) (Truthful frown) (Oh? This is)
Oh Is it okay? Oh my goodness It's strong..? (She feels like she got a fatal blow)
Wow really? (1 minute ago) - Is the water in here all alcohol?
- Yes - You didn't add any plain water..?
- No Then it must be super strong (Suspicious laughter) (That is how IU got to have a strong drink) I tried to drink all of just this I'll drink it (Here comes a savior) What? (I can't give you this, go back) - It gets stronger more you leave it like this, right?
- Right (Where is the smell from..?) Whenever you speak.. - Do you smell alcohol?
- It smells like an orchard (It's fine, I'm perfect, I'm fine) Let me leave this and take sips of it later I had Hyojung's treasure,
her homemade wine They have so much to brag about (Camera OFF)
I drank so much - This is super good
- It's good, right? Seunghee also likes - frozen oranges
- I do I was so into Korean melons that I ate
them with the peel on for a long time I wanted to change it up
and started having oranges I froze them in the freezer and it got super crunchy and good like sorbet After that, I kept eating it Wouldn't it make your teeth feel cold? No, it won't Hyojung, after eating one orange, would go (I'm mad) - My teeth are cold
- Then, Seunghee and I would be like (Pretending they are scared)
Oh no she must be mad They are super frozen Wait, are they not that frozen? No, they are frozen hard Okay then, let me try eating this (Oh wow? It's nice) - Try it
- This is good But this my make Hyojung angry though My teeth feel cold a bit (Carefully taking a bite) (Carefully, carefully)
My teeth are very bad I'm sneak peaking at her (Hyojung is pretty good at holding it in) (Anger is coming)
Wow She's mad, she's mad, what do we do (They feel closer thanks to IU's joke)
Let's take it away (No problem) Seunghee must have very strong teeth? Igatan Oh, Igatan.. Do you want to be
in the commercial for it..? Choi Boolam, Lee Sunkyun, and Kim Jiho
are doing that commercial right now I have a long way to go As she talked about eating frozen oranges, in the message that Seunghee sent,
the final sentence said, 'Do you want to make a fruit punch with me?' which was random It feels like we are on a date I invited you guys over So I told them they should do whatever
they want to do here Thankfully, there were a lot of things
that they wanted to do here So now it's time for making a fruit punch Let's make a fruit punch The ingredients for it are ready here Seunghee, tell me how to make it We have here an apple watermelon Scoop out the apple watermelon with this scooper like it's an ice cream Wait but Seunghee, why did you want to make a fruit punch? In the summer, you have to have
a fruit punch like this - I'm having my first watermelon this summer with you
- Me too, me too Really? I guess they never even had
time for eating watermelon (Nom) How long would it take
to scoop all this out? Do you think we can finish it today? There will be a miracle like magic There will be a miracle like magic Oh wow, oh wow (Hyojung falls like a miracle) Help, help
