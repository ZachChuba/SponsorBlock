20:18 for me has been all self-work now I'm normally pretty passionate about personal development but this year has been crazy I've treated my bros like my [ __ ] job if self-help will crack I have been smoking crack this entire time and lot of it and one thing that occurred to me is that I should ask all the people who are closest to me what they think my biggest flaw is because they know me best and because I have no objectivity when it comes to myself and you might be wondering you know why what why would you do that do you like pain do you want to cry that sounds like a terrible idea oh but no it's not it is in fact fascinating to hear the people you love the most tell you what your biggest freakin problem is and I will admit okay I went into this naively thinking like in the back of my mind I mean I've been in therapy for so long you know and you know so helps kind of make things so maybe when I ask them they're just like I can't really think of anything are you perfect and I'm a silly little fool yeah pretty silly little [ __ ] fool now a word of caution do not ask people this if you're not fully ready to hear the answer I was an M really down for criticism of myself as a human being because I want to be better I am just naturally curious about what people think of me and I have the time to like mentally prepare to hear their opinions without any defensive nough so though I encourage you to also seek out your flaws don't do it if you ain't ready so here's what they said and the most interesting thing I want to point it out now is that every person I asked preface their flaw with almost this exact sentence well it's a little strange but fascinating and I'll come back to that later but now friend one said well it's also a strength but I would say your need to control is probably your biggest flaw I mean it's good because it allows you to like run a set and like be a boss but whenever you feel out of control you just spiral that would be surprising because I kind of know I'm a control freak but I didn't realize everyone else also knew how much of a control freak I was friend to said well it's like also in your strengths but I feel like you kind of have a chip on your shoulder and so you feel like you have to work so much harder than everybody else like prove that you belong there I don't know if it's consider you're like a woman or like a woman of color but it's always like you're working three times harder to prove that you had just as good as the guys that won really threw me I didn't see that coming at all but once I thought about it I was like okay I can totally see that I see how that's the thing huh and finally a friend three said well it's hard because I think it's a strength but sometimes you get really obsessed and this can be good cuz like if you get obsessed with like an idea or project the next time I see you it's like done but then I've seen you get obsessed with the person and that seems really emotionally exhausting for you and it definitely is for me oh I know I'm well aware of that one and I am working on it but what I loved about this exercise was that it made me realize all of our flaws are probably our strikes just the flipside of them because when I think about some of my friends and their flaws I think the exact same thing like one of my friends can be super judgmental and callous and not very compassionate but it also makes her incredibly observational accurate about people's characters and witty as hell another friend can be kind of thoughtless and insensitive about your feelings but this exact quality also makes him impervious to other people's opinions of him and allows him to create art with a really unique voice without ever feeling discouraged or influenced by whatever's popular my last friend is super self-defeating and can be afraid to even try but this makes her cautious calculated really good at evaluating risk and whenever she does decide to do something she does it 210 percent so all of the things that are wrong with us can be right with us if we know how to manage them and use the aspects of these qualities that serve us so what are your flaws or I guess I should say are you brave enough to I'm Anna Akana and I'm a I'm an obsessive control freak with the chip on her shoulder but you know awareness step one
