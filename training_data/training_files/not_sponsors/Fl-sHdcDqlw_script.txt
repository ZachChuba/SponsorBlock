[Music] given to our community so mountain Blade 2 is now one of my obsessions it truly is it's rough around the edges to say the very least but it's without question one of the most addicting titles to launch in the past I don't know maybe five to ten years at least in my opinion not to mention the practically boundless paradise for modders to reign supreme there will be Lord of the Rings mods Game of Thrones some sort of samurai thing a Witcher universe mod which looks pretty insane so far from the models that I've seen a Fighting's mod expansion and a whole bunch more I cannot even think of right now which will turn this game from something awesome into something nearly timeless however today I don't want to just sit here and praise the title because it is extremely rough at this point that much is admittedly true today I want to discuss tactics the game is currently being patched at lightning speed I did a top 10 tips' video and one of those tips possibly more by the time this video actually goes up has been already broken because they changed the skill values I was considering an entire smithing guide video about the fastest ways to train and why it's so good but then they adjusted all the values so it would have been obsolete the day after I put it up they actually did it that immediately the day after but something that probably won't go obsolete or get changed is tactical combat tips combat in mountain blade 2 is one of the most notable selling points momentum based open field battles or massive army seating and defending castles and towns but within that framework there are certain tips and tricks I wish I had known earlier and a few of which I probably still might not know if not for the help of a chatroom of viewers while I played the game and those livestreams are still up on the channel for anyone who's interested today I want to discuss strategies and tips for what I have found to be the best tactical decisions to make in large-scale field battles as well as some help with the sieges and skill prioritization to start with let's discuss open field battles I'll be breaking away from the script here and discussing this footage in real time as it plays out ok so here is a large-scale field battle where I'm massively outnumbered but I do have better like better veteran c4 troops so the first thing that I always do is put my my infantry in a shield wall and then put them in the frontline here and I draw the line out as far as I possibly can to give maximum coverage and maximum protection to my archers now I also have shield like a shield wall comprised of veterans who also of throwing javelins which just gives me you know even more ranged attack potential when I'm executing the rest of the strategy but I'll get to that in a minute and the second thing that I do is put the archers or in this case cross women behind them and I DoubleTap f3 right so I select the archers with keep-keep rs21 one through four are all the different troops on my on my keyboard two is archers select archers and then rapidly double press f3 to put them in standing apart formation if the archers are all on top of each other they will very often not shoot because they break their own line of sight or something like that so if you put them in standing apart they will all shoot better then immediately after that I put all of my horse archers I select them with four and then press f6 to allow the squad commander to take control because horse archers their default state is just running circles around the enemy units and firing they're extremely powerful so normally right at the beginning of a battle I always put horse archers on autonomous control so they can just run circles in the backline and do all sorts of things like that then I put the cavalry off to one side it doesn't matter left or right I put my cavalry in this instance in the trees off to the right as you can see they're going up there right now and I'm going to wait to bring them in until just until it's better so that they can get to the archers behind the enemy infantry but the meat and bones of this strategy is well you'll see it coming up in a second here I also killed the enemy commander in the open field you can go and engage things in front of the infantry and it usually isn't that much of a problem unless there's a lot of cavalry in which case you'll usually have to use your own cavalry but the the meat and bones of this strategy now is to run circles around the infantry so what you're gonna see is that the pathing on the enemy infantry is very bad it can get confused extremely easily so every time you run circles around them and bring your cavalry across the field back and forth they will change direction and allow all of your crossbow men or your archers or you know whatever your infantry are doing til to lay into them from the side where their shields are not even blocking the arrows so this does require you to have a decent riding skill a decent horse armor and very good armor yourself otherwise you could get picked off if there's enemy spearmen which there are in this case they can cause your horse to rear up which can you know make you take a lot of damage if there's enemy units around you but basically you're just riding circles around them and then sending your cavalry whenever possible into the backline of archers which you can see in the distance over there so my horse archers in my actual cavalry every time I do a loop I'm sending them back into the archers which you know decreases enemy morale makes a lot of them run away and just overall does a lot of damage so you can see that they're losing troops extremely quickly and I'm actually I think outnumbered in this fight two to one at least maybe three to one but because I'm changing up the the infantry pattern and they're just going back and forth chasing me my archers are getting tons of damage in my crossbow men are going to work and yeah if they had actually gotten to my line then they would be killing my infantry units because I have very few relative foot soldiers compared to them so if these units were to get all the way to my line and overrun them then I'd be left with only cavalry and it would take forever to win the fight if I could even win it at all so what I had to do is execute the strategy and lead them in circles around and around in the middle of the field while all of my archers are going to work and as you can see there are chairs are not even getting shots off the other thing about enemy archers is that they will readjust their position based on where your cavalry or where the closest units are so if you ride up to the enemy archers they will readjust their entire line while not shooting any arrows during that entire time just because you're close to them and the same thing works with cavalry so if you send your cavalry into the enemy archers while leading their infantry in a circle in the middle like I'm doing right now you will actually most of the time kill the vast majority of their archers without them ever getting damaged on any units at all while their infantry are dying on top of that so this strategy will allow you to take down armies that are orders of magnitude larger than your own if done properly now it's a little bit risky because if you do ride into the middle of the enemy soldiers you can end up taking a lot of damage so you do have to have very good armor and I did it a couple of times here I risked it because I don't know there was no other way to get them to turn towards me instead of charging towards my own units but it's something you do have to pay attention to it does take some practice but if you're quick swapping back and forth between a bow and a very long pull arm in this case I have a glaive a war clave which is very good as high damage on top of the fact that it has very long reached so I can ride in circles and still get kills on the soldiers while they can't even get to me if you're able to execute it you can see that you're you're taking down most of the unit's before they even get to you and then incrementally you'll see a large section of them run away that's because the morale got so low that they abandoned the fight so you're not actually gonna end up killing every unit here a lot of them are gonna be abandoning the fight before it even really begins before they've even gotten to your line so doing this you know circular running in circles strategy you know dealing with the aggro in the pathing can allow you to take a lot of prisoners not have to fight the full scope of the army and then also not lose hardly any troops now it does depend on difficulty a decent amount if you're unrealistic you're always gonna lose more troops than if you're uneasy but even so even on easy if you auto resolve these fights are gonna be losing most of your army if you're Auto resolving or even if you're just pressing f1 f3 which charges all the units into the enemy um if you're charging anything really into the enemy that isn't cavalry into archers or horse archers running around in circles you're gonna be losing a ton of units so messing with the pathing you know riding in circles you know getting them to aggro on you and trading it back and forth and making sure that you're you know dealing with the enemy infantry in the middle out in the open before moving on to anything else and then routing their archers with your own cavalry you can take down fights that otherwise would be extremely difficult to do so now it's just a matter of riding through and cleaning everything up since most things are routed they have no shield wall they have no line what I typically do at that point is I select archers and hit f1 f4 now you can hit f1 f3 which is charged and archers sometimes still you know operate correctly when they're charging but if you hit f1 f4 which is advanced for archers they will typically hover at their maximum range and keep shooting their arrows so you want to do that because otherwise once in a while although it seems to have been slightly fixed they'll ride or the run straight into combat and just use their fists or like whatever small dagger they have and have their shield out and you want them to still be using their arrows because archers in this game really don't end up hitting friendly troops all that often if they even do it also you want to use f1 f4 instead of F f34 charge and then four footmen you can have them charged you can have cavalry charge but at this point the battle is already won it's it's pretty much over you can just see a wall of green text here because the only way that I would lose that fight is if I didn't deal with their archers and I let their infantry overrun my own infantry get up to the line that means and then surround me because I had less I couldn't make a long enough line to actually hold off their entire you know large section of infantry units their shield men their spearmen etc so held them off won that battle absolutely decisively I think I lost one one unit here and you can do much better than that I've seen some strategies and some people that do even better than this when they when they execute their own strategy so it's by no means the only way to do it so that's basically the entire strategy I use an open field combat almost every single time a lot depends on army composition though if you don't have enough archers you obviously can't do it if you don't have cavalry you can't route the enemy archers so in my experience having a diverse army composition is a really good thing and other methods though they're definitely available some players will do truly spectacular things with this system I can't stress that enough there's a lot of potential here and there's no doubt about that some easy alternatives that come to mind immediately are such as getting all Kazu at cons guards and then running circles around the enemy never losing anyone and massacring anyone you go up against I don't know what can be done about this because horse archers were honestly extremely strong historically we can look at Genghis Khan or something like that and what the unit's allowed him to do from an empire perspective but an army of horse archers in mountain blade is like an unstoppable death ball that really does feel extremely overpowered regardless having an immediate and well-planned strategy as well as memorizing a few of the relevant key press combos can really make the difference between winning and losing battles immediately right off the bat especially from a troop count perspective and most definitely when outnumbered or out positioned before getting to sieges and then the importance of athletics because F let extinct you leave a ggest game-changer I have run into and I didn't even start looking at it until over 80 hours into the game it's time for a sponsored ad mountain blade the next major combat focal point is extended sieges sometimes enemy settlements especially can climb to very very high defence numbers I'm talking in excess of 6 or 700 which makes seaching them an incredibly draining task for even experienced commanders and armies the best method I have found to combat this is to break all the walls if you go in with just a ram and ladders or even a ram for the gates and a couple of siege towers even you create what I call the meat grinder the meat grinder is when enemy troops stack up right at the top of these ladders or at the front of the siege tower whatever it is with a shield wall and just mow down every soldier that climbs into their line because they're often just entering one at a time this can lead to a huge chunk of even your most elite units getting crushed while the RAM finally breaches the gate or one side eventually in very slowly chips through that wall but overall this strategy sucks and can [ __ ] an army outright especially on realistic Polti the solution is pretty simple Trebuchet x' but it's not quite as simple as just building them outright by the time you get to a settlement it will likely have three or four catapults or ballistas set up on the walls which means anything you construct on the front line will get attacked immediately upon completion and die in real time to get past this you can queue up for trebuchet x' nothing else in the siege menu seems to have any value compared to them by far they are the best and that might get patched who knows but as it stands that's true and then as soon as the item finishes building pause the game click it and move it to reserve this should be replicated four separate times and then all at once while the game is paused place the trebuchet down in all four slots that will then allow them to start bombarding the walls down without getting Focus fired by the stuff that's on the walls fighting back and the combined power will wreck through the enemy ballistas or catapults very quickly this turns the siege into a bit of a waiting game simply continue until the walls have reached a zero health in a couple of different places and make sure that your army cohesion in the army panel at the top there is an option to spend influence to increase cohesion just make sure that cohesion does not run out because if it does that's very awkward and your army fragments all over the map but if you do this you'll be good to go the trebuchet x' will kill off some of the defenders which is good they'll create two holes in the wall itself and make it possible to simply Rush in immediately and avoid the meat grinder it's not always possible to do this maybe you need to execute a siege quickly and only have time for a ram or a siege tower but this will very often save you hundreds of troops and make it possible to keep going afterward instead of having to wait and heal or find more units and recharge the army now as a final tip I want to focus on athletics for my first three playthroughs a couple of which did not get pushed to absolute completion but still amounted to dozens of hours each I focused exclusively on horse combat the game gives you a horse from the start and organically training your riding skill makes it hard to picture anything else being viable there are certain areas where athletics will be trained like tournaments but it's marginal compared to how fast your horse skill will go up when every open field battle is begun on horseback and the best strategy that I have found on top of that involved kiting units in the mid section of the zone on your horse at full gallop however if you are willing or able taking that horse away from your character can make you an absolute powerhouse in all other combat scenarios side by side right now is a clip of high athletics with low relative weight to your characters armor and low athletics with heavy armor on as your athletics increases you become much more agile obviously but the bonuses here are substantial a character with high athletics who has purposely neglected the advantage of a horse can actually move and swing so quickly they can run through combat in almost invincible way this is not even close to maximum athletics here on the screen either and can be achieved in a matter of hours however with another few sessions of grinding I think the discrepancy between your own abilities and the abilities of enemy soldiers might become even more defined this is less of a tip and more of a personal realization I had not too long ago sacrificing your early horse advantage to become an absolute wrecking ball of footwork speed and athleticism makes the gameplay so much better it's hard to describe it won't be for everyone though taking on the cavalry role and also the benefits of being mounted for map movement and other bonuses can be very very appealing but the point of this one was to say that no one should be neglecting athleticism because more so than most other skills in the entire game the passive gain on it is extremely powerful the added bonus to this is that everything in the combat is momentum based so the faster you move that means the faster your sword is moving and the more damage you will deal so athleticism in a roundabout way as far as I can tell actually increases the amount of damage that you can output by a huge absolutely colossal margin because not only are you swinging faster and getting more attacks in but you're moving faster while you're executing those swings which means more damage from each and every attack that's it for today though hopefully these combat tips helped some players out and I'm pretty sure as time goes on I'll be making more guides for mountain blade 2 because I'm very much in love with it it's an excellent game if you want to support their links down below again surf shark has a huge promotion with our channel if using code Escalon and there are
