we've got another update guys 2020.16.2.1 is here you're all getting it right now you've probably already seen videos from other channels about it but what we're going to look at here is what exactly is on this update and how does it affect autopilot because that's really what i'm concerned about at this point in my channel and so i mean real quick here's what is on this update there's a new tesla toy box which just simply means that when you go to toy box it now makes it simpler to see and understand what all those things are it's a much big improvement before we always had to go up here to the tesla i mean there was other ways of getting to it but the main way you would go here you'd pull down and it would appear that's no longer there which is great i hated that so now it's all in here and the great thing about it is actually gives you an explanation for what it is uh before you click on it which is great and you get a toggle for santa mode which before i always had a fight with myself trying to figure out how to turn this thing off because i could never remember that so that's all fixed now i don't really care that much about that so let's see what else is next here we now have nearby superchargers uh kind of filtering as what i would kind of call it we could basically say you know really uh slow charges fast chargers super fast charges you can filter it by what is available and around you here one huge part of this is the dash cam improvement where it'll actually now format your usb drive for you so one of the biggest challenges that i have to help people with all the time is how to actually format your hard drive creating the right files and format and all that well now the car will do that all for you in here right down here you have a button that says format usb device so if your device is not formatted you put it in there press that it'll erase everything off the uh flash drive the zip drive whatever you're calling it and make it all ready to go for your tesla cam which is great so that's a really nice feature now you have to worry about plugging in your computer anymore and all that stuff so that's huge thank you tesla and the last thing here is a backgammon improvement so if you like that kind of game there's some improvements there i'll put this up on the screen so you guys can see this for a few minutes and read it but it i don't really play this game i really care about that let's go see what's going on with actual autopilot and the stuff that is actually interesting now marty had mentioned that he thought maybe the car was doing some kind of a auto park thing with the stall that had just lines in it was backing into it so we're gonna go confirm or deny that we're gonna take a look at different uh autopilot auto steer see how that's working because i've heard from other people on the comments there were some massive improvements there which that's awesome i am always all about the autopilot stuff all these little other things are really cool but really on this channel i focus on autopilot and its improvements as we get to full soft drive so let's go check those out and see where we are at in that process let's do it all right now so we're pulling in the safeway parking lot we got all kinds of open stalls here what i'm looking for now is a p sign to pop up on my screen anywhere i'm not seeing anything there let's uh let's back up here into a stall and see if you see anything look at me driving like james bond drive past this one you see the stop show up there the arrows nothing there i'm gonna assume that the parking into a spot let's try backing up real quick actually okay i'm not seeing any stalls here showing up on the screen for auto park okay so i don't think that is there now all right here next let's go into the parking lot here and see if you can't find somebody walking to see if there's any improvements visually on that i heard that they do show people actually moving instead of just appearing on the screen of course it's raining out so it's gonna be hard to find people here's a fella unloading his cart let's go by him slowly and creep him out okay nothing showed up there okay so here's someone walking in front right now who has a cart oh yeah look at that they're actually walking uh perfect look at that yeah so everyone looks the same on the screen um obviously i think they're gonna be male and female um look at that person walk okay nice even get you got a very nice strut lady crosswalks still don't show up not that i'm expecting them to now let's try out some autopilot and see how well the autopilot works put it in autopilot here we've got it set to 40 miles an hour so now this truck beside me wants to what a joke to think that he could actually do you think that he could actually give me a run for the money you know people are such jerks nowadays like what's up with that like you're gonna hover right beside me knowing i gotta get over like you're crazy yeah i know i'm speeding all right so next up we're at our infamous intersection that we constantly chest out test out autopilot on here to see how well it could ah yeah see look at that the last two updates we've nailed the intersection perfectly straight through no swerving no going crazy no jumping over lines loving it let's get on the freeway all right now what i'm looking for here on this on-ramp is do we actually get to use a blinker while we're merging onto this highway this is something that i've always had to pet peeve with that i've almost thought they've fixed a few different times but they never seem to and it's the law says use a blinker when you're merging so uh we're gonna see does it do it here no it does not we're gonna treat this thing just like a wide lane that just sort of narrowed so that is a next up let's put it in navigate on autopilot again meaning that the car is going to change lanes for me here goes our very first one let's see if you notice any kind of improvements or changes there what i'm really looking for here is just smooth around cars back and forth when we're in the fast lane getting back out of the fast lane right away that's what i'm looking for so right now what we should be seeing is us getting back out of the fast lane into the slow lane because that car in the slow lane is actually gaining distance there we go it's automatically now putting us back over into that slow lane which is perfection so we're gonna go right now you guys i'm gonna go out to oh by the way there's a great example again of us swerving into the big wide on ramp uh still hate that man i wish chess would would fix that but we're going to head back up to this really swervy road that you've seen me do a couple different times a great place to test autopilot it's going to be low visibility because it's now getting to be quite later on in the day maybe it hasn't seen the way in the camera but a great way to test out how well they have fixed some of the auto steer which i keep hearing improvements about going on a straight freeway like this doesn't tell us anything so we're going to get out there and try that guys have seen so far so this guy cutting in front of me here you can see the car is going to slow down to keep that space i have set in front of them by the way if you want to know how to adjust that space it's right here in the steering wheel you just move this either on this side to the right or to the left i have it on four car links right here but if i wanted to move it closer i'd pull the wheel right here to the right that makes it three car lengths now you see this cop up here setting up here the car does not know that's a cop unfortunately let's see if this new update has radar sensors built into it do we see a police officer no okay that means we can't speed guys all right now check this out this car over here is merging now notice how it makes it a dark gray that picked that up when it was parallel to me and the car slowed down i have my max set at 65 it slowed down to let this car in which is just really great how well it is at picking up stuff like that now this car does not accelerate what you're going to see happen is the car is going to pass him but he is accelerating we're going to get up to our max speed and it's not going to be a problem but i just want i love watching how tesla with each update responds to people coming into your lane and leaving your lane and it seems like for a while it got worse and then the last three updates has just been smoother and smoother and smoother and that goes for everything in terms of even just breaking and accelerating from a stop to a car cutting in your lane to making uh lane changes to on-ramps off-ramps it's just guys we've had some really good improvements lately let me know if you guys agree with that down in the comments below i'd love to know what your opinions are because it seems like not everyone is created equally not every update is equal that every car is equal sometimes people say i got a great thing that happened other people like that isn't happening for me so i'd be curious to see now let's just see if we see this car on the side of the road here that'd be interesting no okay but it did see that you did see the bumper show up the sensor saw right that's what i was talking about earlier is that the sensor did see it it just didn't paint the picture of it on the screen which is fine for me all right so real quick let me show you what's coming up here let me put an autopilot this is what we got going on see all these windy roads through there that's what we're going to be testing on autopilot on and what i want to see is the car mostly staying right in the center of the lane maybe hugging the inside lane a little bit on corners because that's what's natural so when you come out of the corner you don't swing too far but let's just see what exactly is going on here so here's our first sharp corner coming up uh let's see how old the car does my hand my left hand is on the lower right of the steering wheel let's see how well it stays in the lane all i want to see as a car do is not touch that blue line and right there it was a perfect success no problem whatsoever by the way you saw i just tried to speed up the car because i hate going 40 miles an hour the speed limit on here but i can't do it because there's no barrier between oncoming and going traffic and if there was a barrier between the two lanes i would be i'll do so when i do accelerate here what you're gonna see it's because i myself and pressing on the accelerator it's not gonna turn off autopilot it's not gonna change any of the autopilot settings it's just that i am telling it to go faster the car is not doing it on its own okay so here's another corner coming up is really nice and steep here um i'm gonna put us at five mile an hour over the speed limit because this is in the future once elon releases this uh what we're going to be actually driving at not 40. and look at that look at how well it hugs it nice and perfect in the center now here comes an s an s turn look at this ahead s turn let's see how well it does it i'm going to give it a little bit more speed a little more realistic uh you get the warning that pops up but look at that it's keeping me nice and centered every time look i have not yet touched the blue line perfect absolutely perfect wow love it here comes another one are we gonna touch it nope man this car is fast okay how let's see if we can do this at 70 miles an hour on a 40. here it goes autopilot we're honest we're going way over the speed limit how is it going to handle it it still keeps us in the lines what oh my gosh look at how good this is okay we're going to go like 60 around let's see how autopilot handles it it's warning me oh we barely touched it 23 over the speed limit it still could handle it what okay here gets another sharp turd let's see what happens here hands on the string well just in case we're going 15 over the speed limit okay well over what the car should be able to do it at and look at that it is perfect i can feel the gravity of the car grabbing it look at these turns coming up here guys let me go the speed limit here this is all autopilot you guys here we go 80 miles an hour under 40. whoo okay i took over i didn't want to trust that that was freaking fun okay before i get myself in trouble let's get back on track here okay putting it back in autopilot by the way there's nobody around me oh road work ahead work begins now okay here we go so we're gonna go here uh let's just go five over the speed limit so here we are just a normal uh like normal person with drive and here's a really sharp turn will we touch the blue line no almost okay almost there but i was going over the speed limit too right keep that in mind okay and let's see how about this one nice and sad okay guys it is it is extremely obvious the cars being more aggressive and here's why before when i did the test on this road everything was gradual it was a gradual correction well here comes it on a turn lane here okay handled that pretty well okay on the last time we did this it was a gradual correction this is like gradual and then when it sees that it's wrong it doesn't just slowly go in onto the line it comes back it's actually aggressively correcting me back into the lane which is something new it's never done that before okay here we go 10 over the speed limit on this corner let's see how we do hand is on the wheel will it center us and guys here's the thing if you can do it at a faster speed than the road and the map is set for it can do it at regular autopilot speed too it's just that's really freaking boring and i don't want to do that so here we are 40 miles an hour okay the speed limit signs right there 40 miles now let's see if we can hit 80 by the time we hit the 40. nah we got 73. you guys if you don't own a tesla yet if you've never driven an electric car or a tesla specifically you don't understand the acceleration of this thing i've had this thing now for 10 000 miles and i still every time i hit that accelerator i'm like uh and it looks like that's the last of the real sharp corners we have to mess with but seriously guys each update nowadays is just getting better and better like it's becoming fun to be a test loner again not that i didn't like it before but the updates were kind of lame and i feel like they weren't really working but they're working now and autopilot is great it is working very well all the new features and updates coming out just are actually getting me excited again and uh so i you know what guys if you're on the fence of buying a tesla what are you waiting for they're amazing they're already worth the full self drive package all these new features coming out are all targeted to people who've paid for the full stop drive package it's worth it i love it i have no regrets on it and it's just a lot of fun so this latest update again added some good improvements for getting your car set up for your autopilot for sentry mode uh sentry mode um you know it's got backgammon which who flippin cares about that game why are you sitting in your car playing backgammon we've got improvements to the toy box improvements to the charging sites and these things may seem a little bit minor they are but you know it's interesting how tesla doesn't talk about all the improvements they do the other stuff the internal stuff like autopilot and all that this is like a massive thing but that's why i go and do these things you guys i take it out here to the same roads i tested on every time because that's the only way we're gonna see real improvements and there are real improvements so i hope you guys enjoyed that video i loved making it see on the next one
