what is going on you guys my name is CPK welcome back to another video on my channel and it's here quickly to tell Helios 300 and without further ado let's get into the rest of today's Kingdom the ace of predator Helios 300 laptop so we're now in the game as I said we are doing this whole video on the printer Helios hundred laptop now I've actually done a little bit off-camera I've now placed a zombie spawner in here but it doesn't work very well if you could give me some tips on how to improve this man I'd really appreciate it because this is a painting that they have to come really close then once they get that I actually can't get the XP I have to go in all that time actually got it but usually I can't quite get it you see I mean this one I'm faced with so I need a better way to get the XP and I can set up one of the big ones with like a lot of water and stuff but honestly I don't want to do that I really don't want to do it so I'm trying to stay away from that if that makes sense I really do want to level up to get my enchantments before I go to the end now my hope is my plan is to go to the end with Lizzie I ask you an enderchest from a quest so in case you're wondering where that came from there was nothing dodgy happening I just got it from a quest from from Godric so my plan is to go to the end with Lizzie if she's down I haven't asked her yet but I can't see why she wouldn't be it's a great opportunity for us to become the first people to have a light Rose on the server or to have an alight row because obviously there is just one I think unless of course there's more than one can you tell me is there only one per end City but there's actually quite a lot of them around let me know because I'm stupid and I know the answer and if Lizzy's not free to do it then maybe Scott will come with me the only reason I'm asking Scott first is I think Scott's more likely to kill me for fun you know I think if I invite Lizzie out she might not do that but if I'm fake Scott he might kill me for fun and I just don't want that at all so I'm gonna go ahead head to spawn see what the quests are looking like today hopefully got a nice day of questing atomy we're gonna go take a new one from Godric now that we finally got rid of that dastardly kill with an enchanted stone sword job because that was a real pain in the butt honestly okay God Rick hit me with your best shot just fire away oh my goodness he wants me to go to the nether and kill a guest I mean honestly that's pretty doable that's definitely pretty doable I think so we'll grab that I'm gonna go and have a quick look around the the loot chests of course it I feel like it's been a while since we've loot chests it properly so I'm gonna take a lot of uh a lot of time to go do some loot chest runs hopefully get something really sick I'm looking for bottles of enchanting ideally oh yeah there we go ten balls I'm enchanting nice that's a good amount to start with just because that's gonna get me closer and closer to thirty I can't see start getting some good enchantments on my stuff because as much as I caught up in power a little bit and I caught up in like cash I don't have any problem with money now I have been left behind with things like enchantments everyone seems to be way ahead I don't want it to happen I don't gonna be getting you know way behind because at some point there's gonna be a lot of fighting happening in this series and I don't want to be the one that's you know struggling behind fall or fail fall for tooth fall 200 blocks Oh in total huh I guess the key jump in yeah I don't know if he counts ender pearls I'm going to the other loot chest first fall 200 blocks nope he doesn't count it oh that's good I'm gonna leave most of this stuff because I don't want it honestly these saplings can go and as normal we're gonna try our best to get into the well so yeah that's got to be the best I've ever had or getting into the well I always land like right outside the guy's house yeah whereas head Bill's house I don't think it's possible to reach the well you know I think it's just given my dream this is a real mess what even happened here the camp fire has gone out goodness me it's all gone wrong it's all gone wrong in Amity village but make sure I get those block drops in okay and again a bunch of stuff probably couldn't leave behind but what I do want to try and do because I haven't done this yet is I want to give it to the mansion but I want to go into the part behind the behind the painting apparently if I get in there really quickly I can really get in and out without being like caught up in anything too serious so that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go straight in straight out cuz those you don't know I used to love this mansion it was like my home but then the zombies became super speed and I couldn't keep up anymore and they're terrifying and they hit like four hearts each as well as I'm you know pretty well I quit I've full diamond so uh we're gonna go straight in straight through strewth depending into this loot chest oh my goodness I just I need this I don't care about this okay I have all the time in the world in here I think nothing comes in I don't think anyway so does look look how fast these things are now when they spawn ready I him whoa seal it they're fast and they hit four three hearts I'm not about to risk that I'm not about to risk it guys got a zombie villager spawner how do I cure a zombie villager I know there's a way to do it I had to learn how to show a zombie villager must also repeatedly jumping down from this like a hundred times but I think the best thing I can do is I mean T jump me like this but I'm gonna go to the nether and try and kill a gas that shouldn't be too difficult I don't think it's more getting back out of the nether I'm worried about I always feel like I get lost you know I mean it's it's quite a confusing place I feel it really is also how strong was the sword I just got I didn't even check sharpness seven looting fall curse of vanishing okay yes is now stronger okay diamond soda is for now boys and girls even that has the curse of vanity which means if I die it'll vanish like it did last time when I got baited and I died and just like an idiot lost it so we're just gonna go home drop off a bunch of stuff that's not important in our now organized area gonna use these bottles of enchanting right now barely even gonna get me on one level honestly okay got me up one whole level so we're getting closer this is my miscellaneous thing and until I can organize everything don't worry I'm not neglecting lose system okay Lou worked very hard to clean up all my stuff I'm not about to ruin it for him this can go in here because it's super special to me so I can these don't they I'm gonna need the pickaxe or the silk touch Roger and I will need one picture of me the bow the arrows are super important and now we're gonna go and try and kill a guest that's that's the plan and my plan is to do this by going to smallish beans is birch kingdom using his nether portal there because I think it's gonna be easiest one to get to I know he definitely has one so you know it's pretty pretty handy and I'm hoping me a pretty good reward for killing a ghast Godric as a general is pretty good at giving rewards out so I'm hoping for something extra tasty honestly if you wants to give me experience potions I'll take experience potions but one spot on the way to the merchant kingdom guys wait to say another big thank you to ASA for sponsoring the video I really means a lot to me that a company as prestigious as ASA believe that I am a worthy person to advertise their product so a big shout out to them for letting me play with the amazing ASA predator Helios 300 laptop it's actually insane like I said I'm making the whole video off this it's pretty much silent there's no noise coming from it at all which is a problem I've had with laptops in the past so it makes it really difficult to record this is perfectly quiet and it's running everything so nicely so I'm stoked and like I said if you're interested then take a look in the description where they'll be a link for you to check out this laptop and the rest of their range but we have arrived now as my perfectly timed sales pitch comes to an end to jump in the nother bottle why have you set this up so that you just go in it and fall off it's kind of genius actually what's this why is there another one what's going on here so I mean I think the way this works is like isn't everyone block you take in the nether seven steps above ground or something so maybe Joel was using that as a way to get into someone's base I have heard there are ways to TNT raid through nether portals and I'm very curious to know more about that so maybe I'll look into that more for the coming episodes because that could be a lot of fun so now business you to look for a ghast oh yes it makes P over here that's a big chunk okay I'm gonna take the drop here shouldn't kill me I don't think no no when Nia kills me and I have a little bit more to explore cuz it was kind of a honestly was Ken like a dead area I was in there's nothing there well I heard the noise I heard the gas noise what was it he sounds close where is he I bet they usually hover over big bits of like big bits of lava I feel that's where the ghasts hang out it sounds like he's directly underneath me actually show yourself gasp you coward okay he sounds so close by I'm very lost how am I not seeing this giant white entity I don't want to hurt you well no I actually do want to hurt you that's a lie I can't lie T I do want to hurt you but it'll be quick maybe he's above us instead of below us well if he's up there at this point I almost feel like the game is just playing the sound even though he's not here that's really what it feels like I found him I found him Berryman where I started though how on earth is he over here well how could I even hear him I put use they probably gotta hit him once goodness me you know what I should have brought my touch pickaxe cuz I could've gone over there and probably got a blade spotter good night that would have been very useful okay while I'm here I'm gonna very quickly keep jumping so get 200 blocks jumped and then we're heading home the good news is you can teleport from the nether and I didn't know that now I do know that so I'm just gonna go having this in first the whole jumping is taking a really long time it turns out this is where the best place to do actually think that I get three oh that's Hank oh goodness me Smosh because I'm like oh he's dead she at spawn too he didn't see me he's to go away from me I want no trouble with smallish beans what's happened to God up his back three ender eyes well that would have been great but you know the other time when I was trying to get to the bloomin end now I'm set but see if I'm running here and jump into this I get three blocks crops every time about two and a half o'clock so I'm gonna do this I get to 200 and I'm gonna bring you guys back cuz you don't want to watch this let me tell you you know what I'm saying a lot like the hair brow nice to see me hurt myself 194 198 here we go OOP returned to her oh no where's Cho though where's Joel I don't want to run through here in case he's like hanging around I'm gonna risk it like imagine if he starts coming from Hera Brian right now something that'd be the worst thing that could ever happen to me oh I liked that okay I take it back that's the worse thing that could happen to me okay we're safe holy moly for a second there I actually panicked I thought well if he jumps out now I'm I'm dead that's it it's game over for me friends right let's have this bad boy in and between now and next episode hopefully get some enchants honestly you're kidding me 64 well right well that was absolutely terrible guys thank you for watching this video I hope you the laptop for yourself or any of the rest of the ASA range I'm a CPK that's watching I'll see you guys next time who's [Music] you
