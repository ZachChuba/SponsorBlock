[Sowon, Yerin and Umji in charge of grocery shopping on their way!] -Wow, it became dark so quickly.
-It became dark. [The winter sky became dark while they were playing games]
-more because it's the countryside..
-Yeah, it was really bright just a while ago. Where are you going? Me? I'm.. just looking around! -I didn't have the chance to..
-Are you bad at directions? [No~]
I was sightseeing, I didn't have the chance to do before. [The night view is very pretty]
-It's so pretty.
-Yeah. [Best driver, plotting the destination on the navigation beforehand]
It takes 10 minutes, who said that it takes only two? [Are you leaving me alone?]
-Wait, nobody's sitting next to you?
-Oh, I'll sit next to you! I will I will~ Good good~ [Disappointed]
-Yeah, I sit next to you~
-Someone said that it will only take two minutes [Find the suspect of the two-minute rumor]
Who said two minutes? [Ready to drive!]
We are heading for the mart. Today's dinner is barbecue~ Wow~ [Clap clap]
We have to buy rice too. Let's go. [Checking morning ingredients too!]
And for tomorrow's breakfast... Cereal for tomorrow's breakfast~ [To the mart 2 minutes... no 10 minutes far away] [Meanwhile, what about Eunha, Yuju, and SinB?]
It's a little cold. I want to see the dog. Oh, we're gonna do it here. [Happy dog person]
-Where is the dog?
-There! [The three came out as soon as they heard there's a dog]
-Go to the cafe there.
-The dog is there? -Yes!
-I like this song [Singing out of excitement] [Ears are happy / Thank you for raising a dog.] [Here is the cafe next to the pension]
I can't walk past the mirror even at a place like this. Terry~ -What's her name?
-Terry~ [The dog coming out as soon as she sees GFRIEND]
Terra! Hello, baby. Terra Terra! -It's Terra? Not Terry?
-It's Terra. So cute! [Following her mother after greeting them]
-Oh my god!
-Oh.. Are you going to go to your mom? [(1 year old) At an age where she only follows his mother]
-It's so cute she's going to his mom.
-Play with us. [Wouldn't you please play with us?]
Terra! [Okay let's play]
-So cute!
-So cute! So smart! Yeah.. [Why are you doing this to my heart..]
What's wrong? [Showing off her talents for GFRIEND]
Look at that! So cute! Eunha : She's gonna look pretty in the camera! [Do I look okay?] -Terra!
-Terra, come here! [The drums luring her] [Tips from her mother - if you play with the ball she likes it] [Eunha on her mission]
She doesn't want you doing it. [Passing it to SinB] [Healing with the cuteness]
So cute! Does she like doing this? Look. So cute. -Wow, there is a reason why [So excited]
-you participated as a rhythmic gymnast. [Our team also has a dog!]
Doggy Doggy! Doggy Choi! Go bring it! [Healing / Peaceful Terra world..] [Meanwhile the mart team arrived at the mart]
-Let's go!
-Let's go! Go go go! Go go go~ Wow! Guys! [Shouting of joy as soon as they enter] [Entering the mart]
Let's go slow from here. [A reliable leader]
Sowon : Let's buy the ingredients for our dinner first and then the rest later.
-Yes, okay. -I want this crunchy pepper!
-Okay, let's put the crunchy pepper in the cart -Are you happy?
-Of course we have to put it in [Crunch pepper is the first to go into GFRIEND's cart]
-It's so cute!
-Crunchy pepper.. [Oh right!]
-Yerin : We wanted to buy mushrooms.
-Yeah! Yeah! [Shopping quickly as they remind each other]
-The onions are cheap, so I'll put two in.
-It's these button mushrooms, right? [And also the King Oyster Mushrooms]
Are we going to eat spring onions too? -I think I will if there are some.
-Okay, we'll buy two of these spring onions. [+Sausages]
Okay, let's buy the ones already chopped up. We'll also cook ripe kimchi, [+Herb salt]
It's really delicious when you eat it with mushrooms. [+Neck & Pork Belly]
and for the mushrooms sesame oil.. Should we buy coke and cider? Okay. [+Coke&Cider] [+Milk] [Umji looking for the ingredients for soup while the other members are FLEXing]
-I'll go buy the ingredients for soup.
-Okay! [The cart kept became full even after Umji left] [Checking the recipe] [Looking around] Where are the potatoes? Potatoes are at the back! Can I have four of them. [Buying potatoes for soup] [Where is Umji?] What else do we have to buy? We have to buy vegetables for ssam. [Being frugal and FLEXing at the same time]
Let's put it in the bag ourselves, I think that'll be cheaper. How many eggs do we need? [Umji in charge of eggs, Sowon in charge of vegetables]
-I think the small box will do.
-This one? Yeah, the smallest one. [Powerful]
Okay, I'll start putting them in~ [Fresh] How much do we need? [Asking the members when not sure]
Will this much lettuce do? -And a little perilla leaf?
-Yerin : Yeah, I've never seen the members eat ssam (wrap) that much. [The next ingredient is radish wraps]
-Hey!
-Yeah? Should we buy the green one? Or the white one? The green one! -The green one has a slight wasabi taste, is that okay?
-The green one! [Confident taste]
-Okay.
-The green one! [Waiting for ssam vegetables' price getting fixed] [Surprised]
Thank you, wow why is it so cheap? -Is it cheap?
-Sowon : There was a time when the price of the lettuce was like the price of gold now it's only 1,500 won~ -So cheap!
-Right? [Suspicious]
But this might be expensive. [The total shopping budget they have is 150,000 won / It's time for midterm check]
Let's do a midterm check. -and see how much it costs, and then buy things for dessert.
-Okay okay. Okay, we have most of the ingredients. [While the mart team is shopping] [The team left behind is about to face the time of truth.]
Now it's the time of truth. [Switching on the lie detector]
Ring the bell of truth! [Let's have Yuju try first..]
Oh, I guess you have to ask me a question and then press this button. [With a light start]
I want brunch for breakfast tomorrow. [No?]
I want Korean food. [Click] I really want Korean food. I only need to have rice and kimchi. I really want Korean food. What do you know? What do you know about my taste? [I's brunch. You want brunch] -This is because of the music! You try.
-You are such a liar. No I don't want to! It hurts. [Yuju tries once more instead of SinB who is scared to try]
-Okay, then I'll ask myself.
-Okay. -I'll press the button for you.
-Okay. [Too serious / Hehe]
Choi Yu Na. Are you.. [Haha] [Hahaha] [Serious moment ended very soon haha]
Wait, what was my question? -Choi Yu Na, are you..
-Oh! [Dark Yuju]
Choi Yu Na, are you looking forward to your comeback? [Angel Yuju]
Yes, I am. [Shocking / The question, and the way she asks it is very novel] She's weird haha [Imitating]
-Yes, I am!
-Yes, I am looking forward to my comeback. What do you know? [Reappearing]
Do you know our buddy well? [Rebellious] [The lie detector is very rebellious]
No, this is all a lie, again. [I want to do it again]
-Last question.
-Wait. Or do it again. [Changing the mode from electric shock to vibration] [SinB caring for her member]
I think this mode hurts less. Okay. [Dark Yuju returns]
-Give yourself a big question.
-Choi Yu Na, do you really like the members? Aren't you just pretending to like them? I like them! I really do. [It's gonna be a buzzword haha]
-What do you know?
-What do you know? What do you know about our friendship? We just met. [Yeah, I don't know] [A shock that's different from an electric shock]
What's this? Why? Does it hurt more? [It's okay]
No, the one last time feels more weird. This one is vibration mode. -The vibration mode is better.
-I wanna try! Okay. [Serious]
-Jung Eun Bi, finally it's time for us to get to know you.
-You have to ask yourself too. -It's time to ask yourself a question.
-I have to ask myself? [Don't ask boring questions]
-Ask myself? What should I ask myself?
-Do a big question like mine. [Expecting]
So, ask yourself. [You have to say it in this tone]
Hey you, Jung Eun Bi! What should I ask? Ask me a question. I'll answer truthfully. [Then..] Jung Eun Bi. [O.K.]
Wait.. not yet. Jung Eun Bi, you actually hate using the same room with me, right? No for sure! [Will the bell of truth ring this time..?]
-I'm gonna keep an eye on you!
-No for real! What do you know? What do you know? [You are just a machine..]
Hey you lie detector.. you.. -We just met.
-You aren't going to ruin me and Yuju's friendship, are you? [Vibrating] Wow this... -But it was all a lie up till now, right?
-Yeah, everything was a lie up till now. [Eunha feels victimized]
I said the truth. [I'm not your friend anymore!]
-Hey! You're just a liar!
-Yeah. The lie detector was the liar. [Note: There is no scientific evidence. Just enjoy it as a game.]
-You are such a liar, aren't you?
-Aren't you a liar -You are such a liar.
-Ouch it hurts! What's taking the other members so long? [I'm hungry]
Why aren't they coming? [Studying mode]
I'll just watch the dance video we took yesterday. [Mart team / Checking how much it costs up till now]
I wish we could buy ice cream. We'll check first. [Checking if there is anything missing]
-Did you buy ramen? For tomorrow's breakfast.. oh it's not ramen for breakfast, right?
-Yeah, we're going to have cereal. We only have milk! [Lonely]
-This is so funny.
-I'll stay here. What cereal do you want? I like original, I like everything I eat nothing(?) Oh, there's nothing I can not eat. [Already half the budget / The price rising quickly]
-Did it exceed? Did it exceed?
-Hey hey hey! Did we just make it? [No]
We're almost there. [Exceeding the budget..]
It's exceeding! It's exceeding! [Bye dessert.. Decided to leave out a few ingredients]
Let's leave some out. [As expected]
It exceeded. [Leader's advice]
Sowon : Let's leave the Almond *lakes and *reos out Sowon : and just buy one original corn*lakes [Nodding]
That's also a good idea. Let's take those two out, wait. [Leaving the ingredients for dinner, and making a slight difference in the breakfast menu.]
This is the biggest and cheapest We did it! We did it! [The price went low after changing the cereal]
-We have 2,100 won left, right?
-Yes. Umji : What can we do with 2,100 won? [Can't not use 2,100 won]
You want to use it all? -Let's buy 6 ice cream sticks.
-Oh shall we? The ice cream stick is 500 won each. [The price will exceed a little bit, but still buying them] [Participating in choosing ice cream]
Yeah, you have to come. I was thinking about buying ****. [Sowon wants the watermelon ice cream]
I want ***, but don't the members eat ***? [Buying this and that..]
Then buy that, and one of this. -Okay.
-That's all, right? [Buying variously] [One of these will suit their taste!]
I don't know. How are we supposed to know all of their tastes? [Wait]
Wait, 500 X 6 = 3,000 won, we are 900 won short. 900 won? Let's check~ [With a charming voice]
Give us 900 won! [Umji AlphaGo LOADING..] Umji : Then we'll take one potato out. -Is that possible?
-Yeah. [Umji chose a potato out of all those ingredients]
Sorry! We'll take one potato out. [Didn't know that 150,000 would be not enough]
We took the money not too seriously. The money is spent so quickly. [Potato getting removed..]
-You only want three?
-Yes. [How much would the price have shrunk?]
Thank you. [One two one two / Let's trust Umji and put it in]
We want to change it to this one. Employee : Wow! Look everyone! [149,990 won]
Wow this is amazing! Wow! Someone film this! [The employee also was surprised / SAFE with 10 won left]
Did you film it? -Do you see this?
-We spent 149,990 won. [Umji did it]
This is amazing. We're done~ [Sowon&Yerin&Umji done with dinner shopping!]
We're done with grocery shopping. [Ordinary living room scenery of a house with many daughters.] I'm hungry. Me too.. I wish they would come quickly. [As they are becoming tired of hunger and longing..]
-I wish the members would come quickly.
-Yeah. Arrived~ [Mart team arrived back at the pension right in time~] [Umji getting off first] -Tada.
-We're here~ [Yerin is here]
We arrived~ [Featuring]
We're here, everyone~ They're here! That sounds like Sowon, right? Is it Yerin? [Let's go out first]
They are here~ [Thought they were going out..but they gathered around the window haha] [All gathered around] [The baby birds waiting for their mother birds]
I heard something? [It stuck the leader's heart]
Ah so cute! I'll hurry up. [Thank you for your hard work, come on in]
Cute cute. [Scanning through the window haha]
I hope they bought snacks! Is it ice cream? That is ice cream! [Yay]
Wow I love it! Umji : 150,000 won was less than I thought. - Welcome~
- Hi! [Touched / They just went grocery shopping for a while but why is it so nice to see them again.. ] [A big welcome] [Proud] [The last chick has entered the dorm!] [After a hard day, it's finally dinner time!] How delicious would a barbecue be under the starry sky..] SinB : I'm going to go grill some meat, who wants to bring some mushrooms? Yuju : This? I'll take it. [SinB, who's in charge of the barbecue came out first]
SinB let's go together! [Barbecue table] Ha..I feel lonely.. [Heavy] [Pork belly? Pork neck? What should I grill first..?] [Shaking shaking] [There's an earthquake on the garlic paper] Is that something to be so nervous about? Haha Eunha : Too unstable, my... [The end] [They are most worried about this at the moment]
- Wow, garlic & onions.
- Shall we start with pork belly? Or pork neck? Sowon : The pork belly is a little greasy and the pork neck is less greasy?
- Everyone, it's summer! [Sunny summer] [SUMMER in January greeted Yerin alone]
It's cold in January, I'm in summer. Directors.. [Increased reliability /Director chance after rail bike click mission]
- Do you usually eat pork belly first? Or pork neck?
- But I think we can grill them together? Half-half? [Agrees / Grill them together~]
- Together?
- Yes. I think there's a lot of opinion to grill them together. [Delicious ones all at once]
- I think we can grill them together and grill the mushrooms on the side.
- That's good. [Organizes it neatly then leaves]
Is there anything else to bring? [We should go now]
No! Let's go in. [Nice, I'll grill it all!] [Sizzle sizzle sizzle..] [If you enjoy meat, this sound is always exciting] [Button mushrooms can't be missed] [While the meat is being grilled deliciously..] [Chef Um and So is working hard in the kitchen]
Do you have anything to put in here? Um.. I don't think so. Are you done? - Me?
- No. I'm totally done, she's totally done haha You can do it here. [Give me work too]
Is there anything else I can do to help. [Then cut me some garlic!]
Cut this for me. - Hey Yuju, this
- What? [Earlier Eunha]
She cut all the garlic? [No no we are the people of garlic]
- Let's do more, just in case.
- More? [Is this enough?] [Yuju also goes to the sink to wash the garlic] We didn't take the spoons. [It's crowded with the ingredients and people] [Escapes]
Here I'll take the spoons. [Put red pepper paste in the meat, stir-fry it, then pour water]
Yuju, is there room for garlic? Uh...you can just pile them up. Sorry~ [The reason I'm here.. because there's instant rice..]
I want to help you but my hands are spicy.. Ah I need to sit here, because of the rice. [Working hard]
Umji : How many rice is done? Yerin :  Right now 4 is done, Yerin : 2, I need to grill for 3 more minutes. (?) [Haha]
You have to grill them? What are you saying? [Red pepper paste stew doesn't want to be boiled..]
Why doesn't the stew seem to be hot? - I know right, it's not boiling well.
- It would be comfortable for you if it boils hard. [Working hard working hard] I'm here with sliced mushrooms~ [Shocked]
Sowon : Why didn't you open the lid? - Sowon : Button mushroom?
- What? [Closed]
Do I open the lid and put it in? [Knows how to eat well]
That's the point! It has to have some water. Then let's open this first and do it again. But it's cooked. - The meat?
- Yes. [Barbecue time is officially just around the corner]
I think it's time to come out and eat? [I'll be back]
I'm cold! Wait a minute. - Hey SinB, don't you need clothes?
- No. [SinB's cute mistake is spread through the kitchen]
Shocking! She grilled the button mushrooms without taking out the seed. The soup of the button mushroom is the point right? - You have to take out the seed.
- She was grilling it without taking out the seed. - So I took out the rest.
- Ah~ It must have been really cute. Haha Yeah haha - Are you all set, the youngest?
- Umji, how long does it take? [The red pepper paste stew needs more time]
About 10 to 15 minutes? She said it's better to come out and eat. I'll go after microwaving the instant rice for a minute. Give it to me, I'll take it with me. [SinB we are here] - Wow the meat looks delicious!
- Hey you wore the wrong shoes! - Hey Yuju!
- Yeah? - There's two left shoes!
- Ah really? I feel weird right now. - Let's change it later.
- Ah it's so funny. Left foot left foot left foot! [Hahahaha] - Let's just roughly put them on, let's just switch the right side.
- Okay, [The right foot has returned to it's original state]
- Ah like this?-
- Yeah. [Must see this]
Look at this! Look at his! Cute. Is Ye Won not done yet. [Cold stew /The stew master is still working.]
It'll take 10 to 15 minutes.. [Yerin is here]
- Hello~ I'm here~
- Welcome~ The rice is done too. [Worried]
What about Umji? Is she doing well right? She looks very urgent from the back? Oh no. [It looks pretty boiled] [Slurp] [This seems enough] [Carefully carefully]
Let's go. [Finally Umji joins the barbecue..] [Finally Umji joins the barbecue..] [Second person in charge of the grill]
Anyone who wants radish for rolls? [In the midst of a barbecue party]
- I should share the barbecue here.
- Oh, you haven't cut it yet? [Arrived the gochujang stew by chef Umji]
- You want this?
- Folks, sorry but the stew doesn't have that deep taste. [Nom]
Umji, let me make you a cabbage roll. [Thanks for your work, Umji] [Nom!] [Eunha will give you some barbecue]
I think you can take a few, anyone who'd give me your plate? [Ma'am, do you have the garlic ready?]
Is the garlic ready? I think if I grill garlic, it may fall off the grill. [We should have some grilled garlic]
[We've gotten a lot of garlic sliced, that's a bummer!] But I think I should put it in in the cabbage rolls. [It's not easy to grill garlics]
The grill has large holes, so.. [Let's figure it out!]
What if we use some leftovers of these to grill them? [She was just looking at tit quietly]
I like raw garlic, so there's this.. [Oh, you know how to eat them properly?]
You know it tastes good when you grill garlic with sesame oil? [The food enthusiast Yerin sets out]
Then give me the garlic, I will put them here And make it round That's good. [Making garlic dish out of foil] [That looks good?] And grill it with some sesame oil besides that.. [Passes Yerin's sesame oil and garlic to the grill team]
- Could you leave this beside that?
- Here. [Takes it as if she's careless but puts it with much care] [Looking delicious]
Now, shall we grill some sausage? Okay. We have a little more barbecue, but what about a short sausage grills? [Affectionate]
Sowon: SinB, Eunha, tell me if you are tired. Right, I am ready, too. [The standard way / Cabbage, shoulder butt, and ssamjang]
Could you throw me a raw garlic? You shouldn't throw it, though. [And picks up a raw garlic.] Get a bite of barbecue in between! [In-between barbecues always taste good]
Mm, good. [Trying too hard] [A break, and another bite!] [Our Umji accomplishes such a hard task!] [Enjoying the seasoned green onion] Where are you going? To grill some barbecue. [Aha] [Thank you, folks / This time, Sowon will grill barbecue] [Do you know that?]
Umji: It's been such a long time since we grilled outside. Yerin: I really don't remember eating outside. [For Yerin, today's the first open barbecue]
- Outside?
- No. Good barbecue! [With good food, Memoria's first night goes on.] [The staff visits their lodge during the break after the barbecue party]
You should enjoy your break, but.. We were just worn out. We are going to offer something. Okay. You were supposed to wake up at 9:00 in the morning. But if you win, how about 10:00? - Folks, we should get that 10:00 chance no matter what.
- Right. [A chance to get another hour of sleep]
- Oh, 10:00 for all of us? Not only that person?
- Right. Wow! That's awesome. What do we need? [Mission for morning schedule adjustment "Gone with the Wind" - A mission where you have to blow a tissue in the air for a long time] [One chance for each member, and the net time for all members exceeds 30 seconds, it is a success / If they succeed, the wake up call will be delayed for an hour] [First contender, Sowon]
Okay, we have 6 of us. [Wait]
- How much time do we need per person at least?
- 5 seconds, just blow it for 5 seconds. [Set the goal, and gets ready]
Shall I go? I am ready. Go! [Oh! The tissue floated quite high from the beginning] Way to go! [What's Sowon's record?]
How many seconds? [Four seconds!] [No! This is just four seconds?]
OMG~! [Next up, SinB]
- Is it me?
- You do it for like 7 seconds. [A messenger of hope / No, this is fine!]
4 by 6 is 24 seconds! It's not that hopeless! [Getting the position ready]
- Just do it better than this.
- This is harder than you think! Ready, go! [As always, it was a powerful start..] Hey! [Lands]
It's not the floor, it's not the floor! [It landed on a sofa, that's the record] [SinB 3.26 seconds]
Reset! - You attacked me for that, huh?
- No, she will get 10 seconds. [Let's not be so harsh to each other]
- It's good to sleep in late, folks!
- No, she got our 10 seconds. [Slaps] [Everyone, Yerin is ready to go!] Now, start! Yerin, do it long! [Fails to aim] [The messenger of hope lost her hope..] [But 100% for the aesthetics]
- You got the same record!
- Where is it? [I will see you how long you could last]
- If you criticize me, come on out and try!
- Where is it? [Yerin's record: 5.77 seconds]
- You shouldn't go there.
- Oh, I feel dizzy.. [Already the fourth runner, Eunha's turn]
Next will be me. I don't think I can make it. [Enthusiastic coaches everywhere] Yerin: No, Eunha has a low height. (?) [It's relatively better for short Eunha?]
- So she can see it more..
Try it as much as you can, You blow it really high at first [Quick reality check]
We did only three or four seconds, we are not worthy! So who tells who? I am.. [No practice] I lost the view and I lost that, too. - Okay, okay.
- I am naturally good but it fell on the sofa, I mean it. [Can't listen]
Tilt your head as much as you can.. - Next time, I can do it for 30 minutes consecutive.
- No, do how you wish to do. [Eunha's ready]
I am up! [Sowon's support?]
It's hot! It's hot! Oh god [Failed]
You shouldn't do that! You! [No..]
She lost her way! [A poor sheet of tissue lost her way..] [Where should I go?] [Eunha doesn't deserve it!]
I blew it this way and it flies over there! - How many seconds?
- 3.87 seconds. [I am sorry]
This is a team kill, let me do it once more. [I tried to help, but in a moment she turned into a traitor!]
- Right, she wants to get up at 8 by herself.
- But even without this, I predict 3 seconds. [Nope!]
What if I exceed three seconds? If you exceed three seconds, I will compliment you. Now, go! [With an unexpected team kill, Eunha tries it again] [It's a second attempt, she's taking care] [Stick on] [LOL]
She's kissing the tissue. She's kissing? [Eunha threw all her body, what's her record?]
How many seconds? How many seconds? [By far the best]
5.97 seconds. - 5.97!
- Then how many seconds is it so far? That's still too little.. [Total seconds so far]
- 19 seconds?
- Right. [Burdened] You and I have to do 6 seconds each. [Stamping]
Just count on me! - You are the main vocal. You must have good lung capacity..
- Your lung capacity! Yuju, you are the best female main vocal of Korea.. It's Choi Yu Na. [Same]
It's Choi Yu Na. Umji: Be nervous, you are out for rhythmic gymnastics of tissue. [Yuju - Girlfriend/ Rhythmic gymnastics of paper towel] Hey, give me the intro of Shinhwa. [Concept of the stage / planning to blow tissue in the wind in a unique way] Okay, I'm starting. You are going to do it like that? [The beginning is a bit unstable]
Failed. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! [Crazy] [Succeed with 7.35 seconds] Wow, crazy! [Have something to say]
Hey, what's wrong with you? [Impression of audience of A-row seat]
I just saw the exorcist! [Yuju's Passion Shocked Yerin]
I saw the exorcist! [Doubtful]
You honestly run down the stairs like this, right? [Is that a reason you chose room on the 2nd floor..(?)] [Last, Umji's turn]
Don't make me laugh. [Can sleep one hour more if they surpass 3.65 seconds]
- Ye Won, everything's on you.
- If you want to laugh, just blow it on the wind. Practice once before you go. Can I? I don't think she can make it anyways [Giving a chance to practice as it's the last turn]
- Ye Won, the fate of the directors depends on you
- Just hit it with your hands! [Starting with the technique Yuju used] [Good] [One more!] [Relaxed]
- Wow, your breathe is strong!
- Hey, Ye Won. [Nice]
- That's good enough.
- You are so good! How long was that? [Secret since it was a practice!] [Lie! / Umji just passed 8 seconds in practice round]
- Hey go! You have to continue this feeling.
- Here I go. Here she goes. Don't laugh. [The tissue left her hand] [What's Umji's record?] [Umji (23), the magician of tissue] Wow! You look like a medieval magician! [Burnt] [No one pinched]
Ah, it's so funny! [Like this] 3.5 hahaha [Crying]
- Ah! I should've done it at first
- Can I try it one more for the last time? [Desperate]
Ah please! Love you! [They are sympathizing with her] [Told you not to give up your pride!]
Hey! I never taught you like this! Don't do this! [Sorry.. Sleep is more important to me]
Love you, directors! Love you~! [Love attack spreading like flames]
I love you~ Sowon: Okay then, let's start again and surpass 35 seconds. - How's that?
- How's that? [Re-challenge with increased difficulty...?]
- 35 seconds for 6 people.
- Then, pick three best players and surpass 15 seconds with those three. We are all similar in terms of the capacity. Good good! [Attention] Just five seconds per person. You are only good at practice! - Kim Ye Won!
- Umji, this is how you did [Keen analysis of So-coach]
You have a long term after an initial blow - You have to shorten the term. Hu! Hu! Hu! Like this.
- Ah, okay. Don't be nervous! [Umji and Yuju are confirmed]
Oh, but I think Umji will do well. - Umji's going to be good.
- Okay then, Ye Won, Yuju Choose with rock paper scissors in here. Rock paper scissors! [Scissors/ Scissors/ Scissors/ Rock] She won. Rock paper scissors! [Rock /Paper/ Rock] - I won?
- Good. Rock paper scissors! [Scissors/ Rock]
Rock paper scissors! I won? You are going to well. [Final list - Yerin&Yuju&Umji]
You did well before [Umji's going first this tine]
You have to continue that then. No, not yet! [The heart almost fell with the tissue]
Hey, Ye Won! - Not yet.
- What about changing the tissue? [I can do it.. I can do it..]
No, I'm fine. [Magician of tissue appeared again] Wow, beautiful! [Disappointed]
This keeps sticking on to my shirt! [Tissue is moisturized with long practice]
- This is invalid!
- I think we should get a new tissue. Yes! Change the tissue. That is heavy! [Let's save the time]
- Ye Won, that has saliva on it..
- Can other person go first? - You can make some footage with this now.
- Hey give me. [So funny/ Why do we have to worry about the amount of footage? It's enough] What is this game hahaha [The next player is tying her hair and getting ready] She tied her hair. [Firm]
Here I go. Don't get surprised. [Go, quick]
- Eh oh~
- My throat hurts. Bow-wow! [Start!] [She now knows how to do it after one trial] [Ending fairy] Uh? It's still on you! [I don't know hahaha] [Flapping] Artistic point! Artistic point! [Artistic point 960819] Wow, that was such beautiful ending. Ah, that was good. 7.6 seconds. Wow! I did 7.6 seconds! [Great/ Yerin did half the target!]
Okay, Yuju, you are next. [Next is Umji who changed her equipment]
- You go.
- Wait, how much did we do? [Almost done! Can see the hope!]
- Almost done.
- How long did she do? [7.4 seconds left until success]
Okay, the two of you. [Nervous]
- Do not fail this.
- You guys have to do more than 7.4 seconds together [Start] Wow! So good! Wow! [Yum] [Umji blow! Don't bite, blow!]
Blow! Blow! Umji, blow! Eating is invalid! [Audience mode] Umji: No, I couldn't help it because my lips were moisturized. [Confident]
Umji: please, tolerate this. I couldn't help it. How long was it? How long? [Umji did 4.1 seconds/ 3.3 seconds left] You are good. Next. We have 3.3 seconds. [She surpassed 7 seconds in the first trial]
I can do 3.3 seconds. Yuju, wipe your lips. [Again]
- One blow can make 3 seconds.
- Yuju, wipe your lips. My lips are dry now. It's fine. Why am I good only in practice round? Just blow once and you'll have 3 seconds. [If you look at art scores, the time to wake up is delayed to 10 hours]
But right now everyone's art score is outstanding? Thank you. [Yuju holds the best record in the first game]
I'm going, it's three seconds.. - I need to sleep well tonight.
- Don't be too arrogant. Okay. [Lost balance]
- Don't try to be funny.
- Ah no I'm not, start! [Thud] What the heck? [Highest record in the first match.. lowest record in the second match..] [Head massage for the arrogant]
- You come upstairs!
- Follow me. [Time of reflection] [Worn out worn out] - No, this isn't it.
- If we can't do it [Conclusion: Let's do it until we succeed]
It's nothing else, the picture isn't fun! Let's quickly do something else. Individual skills of apology [Blocking]
- Hey, go back to your seat!
- Just go upstairs. [Ending the mission of 'Blow of the Wind' with leaving the regrets] What should we do? What should we do? We'll play the initial consonant game next. [Emergency Additional Mission- When the staff presents the initials, answer the words of the initials one by one, you succeed if you pass two of the three chances] If we get it right, are we delaying our time to wake up by an hour? Really? - We can do it quickly!
- No I'm slow-witted..ㅠㅠ You switch seats, let's change the order. [Positioning completed through a meeting]
What should I do? I'm nervous. - I'm nervous.
- Oh, don't give us anything too difficult, honestly. Let's get started. [The first keyword is]
With conscience. "ㅅㅂ" - Defense.
- Caring for a patient. - New Year's bow.
- Watermelon. - Consumption.
- Buckwheat noodles. [The first round was a bit uneasy but it was successful]
Wow perfect! Please take good care of Yuju in the next round.]
Yuju is usually a beat slow when she talks. I was going to say watermelon but she said it so I was in a panic. [It's also a strategy to think of candidate words!]
- You have to think of a few.
- Unnie, think about a couple of things. Okay, I'm thinking of several things. [The second keyword is] "ㅁㅇ" - Bird food.
- Martial arts. - Jacket.
- Mind. - Every..every..
- Wrong. [Failed!]
Everyday! Everyday! [The second round ended relentlessly]
Ah! This is impossible.. Hey change seats, her! [Yuju in the fifth seat..is this going to be okay..]
I think we need to move her to the front! [Mental confusion]
Why am I slow? [The aftereffect of 'Blow of the Wind' is not yet gone]
It's because she's out of breath. No, I think you need some time to think. [Sweet.. Eunha is sweet..]
Like when unnie hits you, you start [Eventually Yuju moves to the front seat] - Let's move aside like this.
- Okay. No no! No no! I can't go to the back. [Umji moves to the fifth seat]
- You can totally do it right?
- Yes. Umji : Two wins out of three, right? [This is really the last chance]
Oh, so there's one round left right? [Breath in breath out]
- Ah I'm nervous!'
- I'm nervous. [The last keyword is "ㅇㅂ"] Eunha! [Surprised]
- Father.
- Fried tofu. - Raincoat.
- Oratory. - Grand.
- Worship. [Let us hear your explanation for a while.]
- Ah Eunha usually needs to take some time.
- That's right. [Ambiguous situation, the production team is also thinking]
- Sometimes I can't think straight.
Oh, but I think it's a pass since it started and we said it in a rush. Ah? I think the delivery is here. The delivery is here? [Suddenly calm]
- Please forgive us with this!
- Yes hello? [Unexpected situation]
He arrived at the front, but he doesn't know where to go Here! [Staff's meals are on their minds all the time] [GFRIEND secretly ordered the food during their break]
Yes, I think you can come inside. Thank you! [We can't just give it to you]
Delivery is possible if you get the initials right. [Hahaha]
We ordered something really delicious Directors, let's start the initial consonant game! I ordered it after I read the reviews! But honestly, you admit this, right? [It's absolutely not because of the delivery of food, but because all six people spoke without blockage] The time to wake up changed from 9 AM to ▷ 10 AM] Yes congratulations! Take it with you! [Friendly atmosphere] You can eat them! [Thank you! We'll eat it well!]
- Enjoy your meal!
- You've won! [Wrapping up the day in a warm atmosphere] Do we wash and go to sleep? Thank you for your hard work~ [Today's ending slate fairy]
One, two, three! Thank you! [Today's shoot is over! Good night GFRIEND~] [Next episode / The last day of Chuncheon trip! [GFRIEND went to the sledding slope]
[Scream if you two are scared!] [Scream] [A mission for a hearty lunch]
We have to get buckwheat noodles! Answer! Embarrassed. [Frustrated / This is tough..] Let's work hard. [Looking back on the trip, and picking out pictures] [The GFRIEND on their last day of trip to Chuncheon?] GFRIEND's MEMORIA~ [See you next week!]
- We did well.
- Totally
