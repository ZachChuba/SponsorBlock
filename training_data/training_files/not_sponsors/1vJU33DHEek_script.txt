hey guys Carsten ear you know what I love dr. Seuss books and you know what I hate dr. Seuss movies dr. Seuss is one of the most famous authors of all time creating timeless classics like Cat in the Hat green eggs and ham red fish to fish one fit whatever the everyone I knew grew up on this man's books because they have this universal appeal that spans across all of his work so in short we have a successful thing right it's going really well so what does the world do it ruins it by turning them into movies because you know you got to make that money now I would like to emphasize that there is a difference between these classic 60s and 70s shorts and this those were pretty much literally booked to video if the book was a few pages long the short was a few minutes long like you know like it should be these movies these features however now these are the problem I'm talking these two awful live-action remakes I'm talking horton hears a who I'm talking to lower X and of course I'm talking about the latest example the Grinch these movies all span across different levels of mediocrity I don't want to see any of you folks coming in here like hello but the live-action Grinch was my childhood the live-action Grinch isn't worth defending all right it leave it alone accept it okay now back to the point some of these aren't necessarily horrible movies like horn hears a who and surprisingly the latest Grinch I don't mind either of these movies really they're not awful they're just kind of perfectly average so now you might be thinking well well then what's the problem if they're not horrible then what are we here to talk about well you see the original books are classics they're masterpieces and horton hears a who the Grinch those aren't masterpieces in fact both of those movies are pretty forgettable oh hey remember that video that I made last week so me being the fun film guy who likes to talk about things that aren't worth talking about he's gonna try and figure out what went wrong in the making of these movies why they aren't as beloved as the original books as a way of proving that hey let's cool it on the Seuss films [Music] you see these dr. Seuss movies are never that long they all lasts pretty much the same length falling around a good 90 minutes that's the average length of a kids movie but when we take into consideration how the books are like 65 pages long and each page is just a few words yeah 90 minutes is a little much as I stated earlier this is why I am a huge advocate for films like the original 1960s Grinch because it is a direct page to video situation the story Seuss crafted were carefully put together and made so that children wouldn't get bored of the story being that children have somewhat of a low attention span their stories you could read before going to bed you not make a whole night out of it he understood pacing that's why some characters with more depth got one entire book and others like one fish two fish were multiple different characters in different scenarios boredom was a common theme that I noticed while plowing through these films the first 15 minutes of each one I was like oh this isn't half bad maybe I don't even need to make this video but as soon as the first 15 minutes were up and I realized we weren't even through act 1 yet I realized I was in for a very long and boring experience and that pisses me off because dr. Seuss is the opposite of boring if you're going to experience a dr. Seuss reading for 90 minutes that would probably entail multiple books in that situation I probably wouldn't get bored but these characters and stories were not meant to be stretched out for longer than they needed to be and as a result you have a series of really boring movies about really interesting characters movies will always naturally come with a few different protagonists there are a lot of movies where there are several different people for the audience to connect to rather than just one single person that being said dr. Seuss adaptations are faced with the issue of making a film where there is really only one main character most of the time not counting the animal sidekicks who can't really speak this is where these films get annoying and where the authenticity of the original stories loses their touch this doesn't seem to apply so much to the live-action adaptations as much as it does for the animated ones when I went to go see The Grinch we of course had the Grinch as our lead but the film felt as though it needed to expand and add this entire friend group there's always been the little girl but now she has a friend with their own little subplot going on she has a mom who now has like a whole personality that kind of sounds horrible but what I'm getting at is that when you introduce these new personalities that weren't originally there it means giving them a voice and illumination loves writing characters in a way that seems so unnecessarily relatable so now you might be thinking what's wrong with relatability usually nothing but we're talking dr. Seuss here okay this isn't a world where the same rules apply there's a small scene near the beginning of the Grinch where the mother is making the baby toast and jam and it's a big ordeal where she's working her hardest to get it all together and when she finally gives the baby the toast the baby just kind of makes a mess with it and well it was a pretty average whatever scene at first it just didn't feel right with me it feels like illumination trying to be like yay parents this isn't this relatable when in reality we're supposed to be viewing this world with childlike wonder because you know it's dr. Seuss this happens all over the place in these movies The Lorax is just a whole movie full of these examples so in short dr. Seuss movies should sound like dr. Seuss movies they shouldn't sound like shitty jokes that news anchors would say my last point is somewhat similar to the previous one but also not really as I've said numerous times now dr. Seuss's books were very universally appealing anyone from anywhere could pick one up and enjoy it I say that because the books were written unlike anything out there when reading a dr. Seuss book it was as though you were speaking in a completely different language they are their own thing and there were books that felt as though they were meant to be read out loud again just look at books like Fox and socks that were meant to be full of tongue twisters by doing so these books are making us the storytellers and giving us the dr. Seuss voice it's really kind of genius fellow video essayist Captain Christian gets into this aspect of his books and more depth in his video which I will link in the description while the messages and the creative characters are a vital piece and what makes Seuss books what they are to me they're only about 50% of it and that's all that it seems like these movies are picking up on the other 50% is like I just said voice and these movies have none of that by turning dr. Seuss books into movies you lose that sense of participation it makes it difficult to connect to these stories because you're not the one reading anything your watch it happen in front of you not to mention the inconsistency of the way at which the film delivers lines sometimes they're rhyming and other times there isn't it it makes the entire piece feel incredibly ingenuine and not fun or immersive for anyone which is the opposite of what dr. Seuss was about so at the end of the day if you work at a production company and are thinking about adapting some dr. Seuss book just don't it's not really a thing that can be done well and to be honest it's impossible to make a good adaptation because they were simply not meant to be adapted dr. Seuss wrote stories that were meant to be told forever on the pages so you know what let's just keep it that way everyone ignore the mustache I'm trying not to lose a bet before you head out for watching make sure to check out Squarespace and I'll see you guys in the next one [Music]
