anyone in need of a website in the early 2010's there was one online media company that seemed to be on track to take over the Internet and this was of course cracked originally a magazine in the 1950s half a century later they were trailblazers in the online landscape they made popular a business model that's still being replicated to this very day for years the cracked YouTube page was a pretty popular place hosting many shows that was until the end of 2017 when uploads one day just stopped with all the series being discontinued all at once fast-forward to today and you can see that the only thing posted on the account now are these really weird out of place cartoons so what on earth happened to better answer this question though will first have to learn a brief history about the brands not that magazine that started in 1958 but rather the company's online revival in 2005 the brand name cracked has been passed around a lot over the decades with no one really knowing what to do with it since it's only remembered as an old magazine but with the help of Jack O'Brien a former ABC News producer they were able to turn crack calm into a popular website which was then sold to demand Media in 2007 and this is where things started to get interesting you see they figured out that to maximize viewership they'd have to make short form articles with very eye-catching titles to maximize views on top of this they started to make their very own video content that would be shown on the site as well as the YouTube channel I recall them being one of the first sites to really start spamming out clickbait d-list articles things like 5 movie and TV fan theories that make way too much sense these were easy to slap together and brought in millions of views the main focus of this video today however will be about the YouTube channel which started out with content that was very rough around the edges it was basically just a guy in front of a very low-end camera reading headlines and making jokes kind of like a low-end cheesy Weekend Update in these first few years they didn't get many views and it seemed like they weren't taking it very seriously but in 2010 cracked really started to get serious about getting views on YouTube this is when they started up the popular after our show where four friends would sit around a table and discuss random pop culture related subjects it was a huge hit with each episode receiving a million views apiece on top of this they were making a variety of different skits and animations that were of a very high quality considering they were still in the very early days of YouTube because of this they were one of the more popular channels on the site although never an a-list Channel their other big show was honest commercials that started up in 2012 in these you'd have an old guy in a suit who would make fun of whatever product they were discussing in that episode it was an entertaining concept and made for eye catching titles so they were the channels other consistent hit because of some very successful video content as well as the bustling cracked.com they were eventually sold yet again in 2016 this time to the e W Scripps company who had the intention of growing the video segment to new heights this is when things start to really go bad shortly after the buyout Jack O'Brien left the company and although they were sinking a lot of money into the new video programming none of it seemed to be bringing in the consistent viewership that after hours and honest commercials had found years prior only a year and a half after the buyout the entire video wing of the company was laid off with the e W Scripps company writing off 36 million dollars as a loss this means they had lost around 90 percent of their investments so where exactly did they go wrong well first of all if we look at Google Trends we can see that cracked peaked in 2013 three years prior to the buyout this means they had paid millions for a company that was already going in the wrong direction and on top of this they were facing major competition from companies like BuzzFeed they just couldn't make it work I think one of the biggest problems specifically with the YouTube channel was that the views were so inconsistent if you go through the channels history you'll notice that there are videos with two million views right next to uploads with 20,000 they seem to have trouble abandoning kontin that no one cared about and instead use those resources to double down on the content that actually did work the third reason I think they failed was that they overestimated how much money is in YouTube I know I repeat this in my videos often but I really don't know how most of these YouTube channels run by big companies turn a profit that revenue has never been that great on this platform compared to other mediums and when you have to pay for a team of video producers and studio space and expensive cities for them to work in the math just doesn't really add up most of the time I kind of have a feeling that most of these places startup video divisions with money from investors who aren't savvy enough to understand that there's not really that much potential for major profits sure if you're a one or two man operation working out of your house you can make some good money on this websites but on YouTube it's almost impossible for a channel to scale up to the size of our traditional TV operation and still turn a profit even though I understand why they cut their losses on most of the content I really can't get over how they just gave up on honest commercials and after hours though these two shows were getting an average of a million views of peace so many people would die for numbers that consistently high but it appears that they were at a point where they just didn't want to sink another penny into the content to wrap this video up today let's take a look at what the channel is currently uploading which are just a few episodes of the animated show people watching I'm guessing they already had a deal to make this second season before the layoffs and they're finally finished since animation takes a long time to produce once this batch of content is up however I doubt we'll see anything else on the account the one thing I take away from this story however is that hypothetically someone can probably go and hire that old guy from the oddest commercial videos start the series back up making their own knockoff versions of them and then potentially make some good money but that's just an idea but up your very own website [Music]
