this video was made possible by tab for a cause on december 31 2019 an announcement was made that changed the world 21 people in hubei province china were infected with a novel coronavirus and experiencing pneumonia-like symptoms since then it's become known that the number of infections was probably closer to 260 at the time of the announcement and the earliest traceable infected patients were tracked back to november 17th at this point in 2020 i don't really think i need to explain the impact this novel infectious agent has had on the world at the time of writing there's been more than 15 million confirmed cases and 600 000 deaths with many more likely to come at least that was what i wrote when i first started editing this video at the time this was recorded there's now been more than 22 million cases and 780 000 deaths that was a difference of about a month and a death every 10 seconds or almost 250 more by the time you finished watching this video this video is going to be fairly serious and we're going to be taking a deep dive into how the virus works and importantly how we test for it testing or rather the lack thereof has become one of the most contentious issues this year and the only way this pandemic will ever be reined in is through significant amounts of testing and tracing while a vaccine is manufactured and deployed while i will make this as understandable as i can i'm not going to shy away from technical details so be prepared for that i have put many links to other great videos papers and more in the description for those looking for more info but i want to cover as much as i can as well as some bits of research i'm participating in so this video will be much longer than what i would normally make here are the time codes to each section and there are markers in the video bar and time codes in the description for those who want to just see one specific thing but let me get this out of the way at the start conspiracy theorists can save their breath and will be instantly muted there is no evidence that this virus is a bioweapon or spread through 5g or any of that other speaking of which wear a damn mask this isn't up for debate every medical professional on earth agrees that they are important and reduce the spread personally i wear an n95 mask at all times if i'm going out in public and i'm going to be building an even better one in a future video and it would be ideal if everyone did the same but even a basic surgical mask or cloth mask reduces the spread of virus carrying droplets masks are important they cannot hurt you and not wearing one makes you selfish most masks don't protect you they protect everyone else from you and so work best when everyone is wearing one so please wear a mask keep a minimum six foot gap between each other and avoid gatherings of any kind wash your hands and clean everything before you bring it into your house working with viruses is sort of like playing a game of the floor is lava except everything is lava and the consequences are real and serious this should not be taken lightly now with that out of the way let's talk virus and testing there are three main types of tests being used to detect the virus and they're broken down into two categories tests that directly detect the viral rna and tests that detect antibodies a patient produces as their body fights off the virus we're actually going to be performing all three and exploring how they work why they work as well as the pros and cons of each there has been a lot of issues with false negative results when a patient was actually infected so much so that at this point symptoms have become the most reliable way to figure out if someone was likely sick or not so if you're experiencing symptoms you need to isolate yourself for 14 days and get tested even if you're not carrying sars cove 2 that's just good practice to stop the spread of infectious agents and in this case it is so much better to be safe than sorry also quick note these three tests are by far the most popular and are currently the most heavily deployed but there are lots of others being investigated as well that can improve on specificity sensitivity and ease of use of all of these these include cell free assays aptomers and many many more but this video would be too long to really get into them before we dig into the tests themselves let's do a quick rundown of the viruses anatomy and see what makes it tick kovid 19 also known as sarskov ii also known as the rhona is a member of the coronavirus family which includes serious illnesses like sars and mers but also the common cold that's not to say that all colds are coronaviruses but about 15 percent of them are and there's a lot of coronaviruses that affect many other species so just being part of the coronavirus family doesn't necessarily make something particularly dangerous also just to clarify covid19 is the disease caused by sarskoff ii people often use these interchangeably but the former is referring to the disease the latter is referring to the specific virus coronaviruses get their name from what looks like a halo of spikes that surrounds them that looks vaguely reminiscent of the solar corona kovid 19 is most closely related to sars which was responsible for a brief epidemic in 2003 and 2004. what makes them different is that sars was actually much more deadly but it also caused symptoms to show up faster making it vastly easier to track and isolate kovid 19 on the other hand has an incubation period ranging from 4 to 14 days so infectious carriers may not know they're sick until long after they've infected many other people this is why social distancing and masks are so important and avoiding things like house parties or just crowds in general is vital the actual structure of sarskov ii isn't overly remarkable for a coronavirus it's got most of the same stuff as sars but with some slight tweaks to some of the amino acid sequences of the various proteins coronaviruses are what are called enveloped viruses basically this means they maintain a thin oily shell around their genetic information this is in contrast to non-envelope viruses which are basically tiny crystals of protein this is why washing your hands with soap or hand sanitizer kills the virus it dissolves away the oil disrupting that membrane which makes the viruses pop open effectively disarming and killing them the oily shell is embedded with various proteins that help stabilize it as well as give it a tool kit which allows it to enter cells the s protein for example is responsible for binding what's called an ace2 receptor and tricks the cells into thinking that the virus is actually a protein that it's supposed to interact with one of the things that makes sarskov2 different is that the few amino acids that actually do that binding are different from sars and various other amino acids in the protein are also different slightly shifting the precise shape of the protein making it interact with the receptor differently additionally something called glycosylation is different this means that the special sugars that get attached to the protein as it's being made have been shifted around and are slightly different as well that ace2 receptor is actually why covid19 has such variable symptoms you have ace2 receptors in various concentrations throughout your whole body depending on where the virus happens to be replicating in a particular patient it will affect those tissues differently your lungs are full of ace2 receptors and is the place the virus is most likely to enter from so of course respiratory effects are to be expected but you've got ace2 receptors in your stomach which is why stomach symptoms are also possible or some in your neurons which is why neurological symptoms like loss of taste and smell are also possible there's also many in your sexual organs and your heart and growing evidence that covid19 could cause damage to those as well keep all this in mind as it'll become important in a moment when we talk about testing the other details i want to quickly point out are the other proteins in the viral envelope there's three more the e m and h e proteins e m are mostly structural and stabilize the lipid envelope but he also known as hemagglutinin esterase is actually an enzyme and is responsible for performing chemical reactions these include assisting in binding the virus to the cell and mediating fusion of the viral envelope to the cell which is how it actually gets inside the last detail i need to mention is what the virus is actually trying to get into the cell and that's its genetic information unlike our cells that store our genetic code as double-stranded dna sarskov ii is an rna virus and maintains its genetic code as a single-stranded rna also unlike some rna viruses like hiv that flip-flop between rna and dna it maintains its code as rna through its entire life cycle some of its internal proteins are responsible for copying the rna once it's inside the cell and so it doesn't need to hijack the cell's copying mechanism the other nice thing i mean at least for the virus is that the rna can be immediately translated into protein so by just supplying the cell's ribosomes with the appropriate rna the cell can be made to produce all of the viral proteins on mass quickly but in theory this also means that unlike hiv which turns its rna into dna so that it can integrate into the host genome it shouldn't be able to remain hidden in a patient's cells laying in weight for another chance to start an infection so once the body fights it off you should just be free of the virus in theory this also reduces the mutation rate a little bit as the rna to dna step is particularly lossy so while the virus is mutating especially as it spreads around the world it's nowhere near the rate of something like hiv which constantly mutates as it's evading the patient's immune system now we can talk about testing and the first step are the tests which detect the virus directly in this category there's two tests that we'll be covering pcr and lamp tests both tests are a collection of reagents then when mixed with a sample from a patient that's infected will make millions of copies of parts of the viral genome which depending on how the test is made gives off a signal which is easier to detect usually the signal is a color change of the test or the reaction will start becoming fluorescent as the test runs if it's positive let's start with pcr pcr stands for polymerase chain reaction or as i like to call it pipet cry repeat it's an extremely standard procedure in a bio lab and we've talked about it many times on this channel i actually have a whole video on the basics of pcr which i've linked to below if you'd like a more in-depth rundown of how it works pcr comes in many flavors depending on what you're trying to do so before we talk about the one used for the virus let's quickly review how basic pcr works the short version goes like this in the reaction mixture there are four main components an enzyme which can copy dna called tac polymerase the individual dna letters a sample you'd like to amplify and two short pieces of dna called primers that act like targeting sequences and mark the start and end of the bit of dna you want to copy the sample is usually taken as a swab of the back of the nasal passage near the top of the throat though it is pre-processed before adding it to the reaction for testing pcr is run in a device called a thermocycler which basically is just a block of metal that gets hot and then cold and then hot again all at specific temperatures and for specific amounts of time first the dna is heated to 98 degrees celsius which melts the two strands apart then it's cooled down to what's called the annealing temperature which is a specific temperature where the targeting sequences will stick to the now separated dna then it's heated to 72 degrees celsius which is the temperature the copying enzyme works best at at this point the dna is extended from each targeting sequence onwards then the cycle begins again melt anneal extend repeat at this point what's normally done is a sample of the reaction mixture is run on a gel which we've also covered in a previous video this gel is made of a material called agarose and when you put dna in the holes at one end and then put a voltage across it the dna is literally pulled through the gel the larger the fragment the slower it'll move as such you end up with these distinct bands of pieces of dna of specific sizes but running a gel is slow and tedious so for diagnostics where you already know the size of fragment to expect and millions of samples to test it would be better to have a way to observe the reaction as it progresses and get a simple yes or no result this way if you see a reaction happening you know the sequence you're looking for is present meaning the test is positive and if not the test is negative this is where qpcr comes in which is the type used for covid testing a third special targeting sequence called a probe is added to the reaction the probe has a fluorescent tag on one end but the tag won't glow while it's attached to the probe and the probe targets somewhere in the middle of the fragment you're looking for as the reaction runs if it's positive the probe will stick and as the copying enzyme passes over it it cuts off the fluorescent marker which then floats away into the solution priming it and leaving it in a fluorescent state as this happens the tube will have more and more fluorescent dye accumulating in it so by including a blue light and a photo sensor underneath each tube you can measure the fluorescence as the reaction progresses if after a few cycles you see the tube start glowing the test is positive however there's one extra hiccup we need to address the virus doesn't contain any dna and pcr only works on dna and doesn't work on rna so an extra enzyme called reverse transcriptase is included in the reaction this converts the viral rna into double-stranded dna which can then be used in the test now let's get a little hands-on and see a modified version of this in action i don't have a qpcr machine and even the cheap open source one costs 5 grand so i wanted to see if i could rework this to be possible using stuff that you'd find in any normal bio lab and i already have like a regular pcr machine and a gel box i picked up the primer set published by the cdc as well as some other primers from other papers and got a positive control plasmid to test on this plasmid is a ring of dna which contains some of the viral genes not enough to be dangerous just enough to be useful for the sake of this sort of testing importantly it contains the n or nucleocapsid gene which codes for the protein that the virus normally uses to package its rna inside of itself and the gene that the cdc primers target the primers are designed for use in qpcr which means that the result of a successful reaction would only be about 80 dna letters long which for me is far too tiny to visualize on a gel reliably so instead of using the primers and the pairs the cdc recommends i mixed and matched them as well as some of the other primers i have which we'll talk about later the result would be that if successful they should make products which are 500 to 1000 dna letters long which are much easier to see on a gel in total i ran eight different reactions the new patreon and member only discord so big shout out to ryan fave for helping me crunch all the combinations to find the best ones since i'm using a dna plasmid for testing here i can actually skip the reverse transcriptase but if i were testing out a real sample i'd need to include it as well as an extra step in the thermocycler settings to account for it and i do have some rt but this video is too long to get into that aspect of this that said while i'm demonstrating this for the sake of education i need to make something very clear under no circumstances should you be running covid tests or handling samples unless you work in a lab that does that professionally and are in that professional setting i'm doing this so i can show you this working and because i think it's valuable to have the ability to run the test on myself should testing not be available for some reason but if i actually thought i was sick i would go get the testing done professionally this is more of an educational curiosity and for the sake of research as these things go setting up the reactions weren't that different than a typical pcr run though i did make one substitution i don't have any tack polymerase at the moment so i just use the different polymerase called q5 they do basically the same thing but q5 is a much more expensive enzyme so this is a bit like strapping a corvette engine to your lawnmower but it does get the job done first i made a master mix of all the reagents including a bit of the dna sample but none of the primers this was distributed to eight tubes and then the correct primers were added to each then the thermocycler was loaded up and allowed to run here are the exact reaction conditions i used for those interested one thing to note is that i used a method called touchdown where the annealing temperature is lowered a bit each cycle for the first 15 cycles to slowly inch down to the right temperature this helps tricky reactions work better and this is what i got when i ran the results on a gel it took a few tries but once i dialed in the reaction conditions i got all eight working at once and they produce bands of the right size here's a diagram of what i expected the reaction to look like versus what it actually looked like it's a bit more condensed because my gel is kind of short but it looks basically perfect however this is the best run i actually ran this multiple times and a lot of the runs were less stellar sometimes some reactions worked while others didn't sometimes almost none of them worked and sometimes the lanes produced tons of extra junk in the runs that had some lanes fail i ended up chasing this down to contamination in some of my reagents and this points to why it's so important to have good reagents there have been multiple instances of labs doing covid testing having issues with their reagents which was skewing the results one way or the other one lab had samples contaminated with actual virus whereas one had weird false negative results and something like this could be why since then more checks have been put in place to safeguard against this and we'll talk about that in a moment another curiosity is why some of the lanes have extra junk in them remember pcr in theory should normally give exactly one band this is indicative of either running the reaction too cold or the primers being a little bit promiscuous which is to say they might accidentally stick to an area they aren't supposed to these two lanes for example use only cdc primers yet produce a bit of extra junk i've run those reactions several times and they always seem to make extra junk so i think this may point to one of the primers not being as specific as it could be they still work and produce the right size band but it means there'll be a little bit of background noise and reactions that use these specifically i think it's that n2 reverse primer that's causing the weirdness these two other reactions use the same forward primers but a different reverse primer and they don't produce extra junk one reason for these issues could be due not to the design of the primers themselves but the company i bought them from as i was troubleshooting this i talked with some friends that used the same dna synthesis company and several had mentioned that they'd been sent misprinted primers that ended up inducing mutations in some of their work or had primers that just didn't work and if that's the case it would explain why lots of other reactions i've been running over the last few months from my other projects failed as well this is also why the fda now tightly regulates which companies can make the primers used for the actual covid tests to avoid misprint issues but since i'm doing this in a research setting and didn't buy from those suppliers i may be having issues that shouldn't occur in a clinical setting one of the reasons i ran these eight reactions was because i wanted to mimic the actual test used in qpcr and find two or three that worked well and gave conveniently sized products you see the qpcr test itself isn't one reaction it's actually normally three this safeguards against artificial false results one reaction targets a human gene to make sure the sample itself is good the other two target different locations on the end gene and only if both come up positive is the test considered positive if only one works then it's considered inconclusive and the test needs to be rerun and if none of the three worked there's a problem with your sample they also include positive and negative controls that get run with the samples to make sure the reagents themselves are still good those reactions would have caught the issues i was having with contaminated reagents so if any of those checks throw in error the batch is scrapped and replaced with fresh good reagents and if the results continue to be inconclusive the sample is sent to a central cdc lab to be tested there to use the reactions i showed before as a covid test you need to first isolate some rna from a sample then do the reverse transcriptase step and finally use the result to run at least two of these pcr reactions personally i suggest these two as we now know that they give the cleanest bands if you get the right size bands the test is positive if not it's negative it would also be ideal to include a reaction that targets a human gene if you're going to use a saliva sample something like amylase would be ideal as there'll be lots of rna for that gene present and as long as that reaction works you can be reasonably confident in the result of the other reactions though of course contam issues are something to be aware of as you saw but as i said before this isn't really something that you should try yourself if you're in a situation where you can't get tested but think you're sick it's better to just assume that you've got it a positive test doesn't actually change much you should just start isolating and act accordingly before we talk about the next type of test let's talk about how this is done at scale one of the reasons testing can be slow is that in many places these reactions are set up by hand so first a tech has to process a patient's sample to isolate the theoretical viral rna then they need to set up the reactions which even if you're using a master mix of all the reagents this is still a time consuming step and a lot of pipetting then they run the reaction in the machine collect the data and then send it off to some bureaucracy to distribute the information back to the patients and let them know if they're positive or not all in all it's a ton of work but it is 2020 after all and we live in a cyberpunk dystopia so of course there are much better options that could massively speed this up one is to simply automate much of that manual pipetting work shortly before the lockdown went into effect i got an amazing bio robot that does a variety of lab tasks for you it's called the ot2 from a company called opentrons i'll be making several videos about this amazing robot but i wanted to talk about it briefly here because the fantastic people at opentrons have put together a workflow that would allow running 2400 tests per day using only eight robots or about ten thousand tests every four days with ten labs running eight robots each that's more than a hundred thousand tests per week including all the reagents and robots each setup of eight robots costs about a hundred thousand dollars so at five dollars a test a lab would have made their money back in about two weeks and while that does seem like a lot keep in mind that the amount of money currently being spent on testing right now is enormous and this cuts down the number of people that need to be in the lab to keep it running so that drops the price of testing as well they're actually setting up a pilot plant at the open medicine institute in palo alto california to test the workflow and prove its capability and i'm excited to follow along with their progress i'm still learning how to use this effectively but it's an extremely accurate and repeatable machine and perfect for setting up reactions like this here i've got it drawing out a thumbs up which by the way if you're enjoying the video so far you should hit that like button and consider subscribing the workflow they put forward uses three robot stations the first robot preps the samples and gets the patient samples ready to start the process the second does the rna extraction and then the final one sets up the pcr reactions and gets them ready to load into the qpcr machine all a technician has to do is load up the robots press go and then collect the results and move them between the machines also as a little aside if you've ever set up a 96 wall plate you'll know that you go cross-eyed trying to keep track of which well you're on and it's just an abysmal experience whereas with this you program the machine using their sleek online ui and then just let it rip we'll be coming back to this robot in future videos and i've already done one live stream covering it and plan to do more so stay tuned for that moving on we've got two more tests to go and lots more to cover so let's get after it the other test in the genetic information category is called lamp it's similar to pcr but with a few key differences lamp is short for loop mediated isothermal reaction which if you're wondering how they got lamp from that we're in the same boat because the short form makes no sense but i guess it's better than lemur ridiculous name aside lamp is kind of amazing unlike pcr that requires a thermocycler to raise and lower the temperature during different parts of the reaction lamp happens all at one set temperature that's what the isothermal in the name stands for the loop mediated bit refers to the way the dna gets amplified unlike pcr where you get short consistent pieces of dna lamp ends with these weird long concatemers of the same sequence over and over again it also uses different reagents and different primers that are trickier to design but one of the huge benefits is that you can mix a raw sample like saliva into the reaction and it'll still work and if the reaction is positive the whole thing changes color and it only takes 30 to 45 minutes to run though like pcr if you're trying to detect rna you also need to add a reverse transcriptase step however the enzyme used in this sort of reaction called bst also has reverse transcriptase-like activity and so can actually be doing both things at once i'm not going to go into too much detail on how the reaction works because honestly it is weird as hell and it requires a whole video to dive into but the extra super short version is that it uses the extension of the dna primers to unzip the strand as it goes and the primers are designed in a way to constantly stick and unzip each next product each time it does this it gets longer and longer until it's just one long massive tangle of replicating dna here's what that tangle looks like on a gel you can see the first few bands are a reasonable size and then just a massive smear from the main tangle this has a bunch of other advantages other than just the time and simplicity of the setup first it uses six primers which makes it way more specific and you can actually use multiple primer sets in one reaction this reduces false negatives and guarantees that you'll detect something second all of that dna synthesis throws off a ton of hydrogen ions as part of the reaction this dramatically drops the ph of the solution so by including a ph indicator like phenol red or cresol red you can have the solution change color if it's positive a negative reaction would stay dark pink a positive one would turn bright yellow though i do have a friend who we'll talk about in just a second who tried this with cabbage juice extract and it did actually kind of work alternatively if you don't want to use a ph indicator you can use the same sort of dye that i would normally use to stain a gel these dyes are called intercalating dyes and only fluoresce when they bind to double-stranded dna this is why the whole gel doesn't glow when i'm running it and only the dna bands do if the reaction is positive all of a sudden there'll be a massive amount of double-stranded dna and so the dye can stick to it and will start to glow brightly under uv these types of tests are also very cheap to set up as ironically six primers cost less than two primers and a probe qpcr probes are way more expensive because it's very expensive to stick a fluorescent tag to them also the enzymes themselves are dirt cheap i bought the smallest size bottle and have enough to run 800 tests and it requires no special machinery as such many countries are now starting to trial lamp-based tests because of all the reasons i just mentioned if this was combined with the opentron system they could churn out tests at an even higher rate i suspect close to 5000 tests per day on half as many machines however remember those pcr reactions i showed before all those extra primers i had were primers meant for use in lamp reactions that target the same end gene i've been trying to get it working so i can show you this on camera and have all the reagents but have never been able to make it work i've now narrowed down the failure down to bad primers as there's no other reason it should be failing this constant failing was one of the reasons i became suspicious of misprint of the primers i've triple checked for contamination so it's the only thing left that makes sense in pcr you can get away with a misprinted letter or two that might screw up later steps but the reaction itself will still work but with lamp misprints can be much bigger problems the reactions themselves are more robust to contamination issues but are more sensitive to misprints but i wanted to show you some real lamp working so i reached out to my friend at a lab called biofoundry down in australia they're working on developing a lamp assay for commercial use for covid19 and my friend has become somewhat of an expert on the topic this is meowludo disco gamma meow meow and yes that's his real name i have cool friends and this is him setting up a lamp reaction as you can see it's a pretty simple process so much so that he's doing it in his apartment due to lockdowns in his city the way this works is you just combine the master mix which comes directly from any bee the primers and then the sample and pop the tube into a heat block and let it cook at 68 degrees celsius for 30 to 50 minutes in the case of this footage he's also using a positive control plasmid and not a real virus sample for what i feel like are obvious reasons though that is something that he's working on when he's in his actual lab when the sample is done depending on if he's using a die or a ph indicator the results can either just be viewed visually or through an orange filter with a blue light to stimulate the fluorescence what i find amazing is that as the tests are removed from the heat block you immediately know the results and it's super clear here's a range of sample concentration approximating various numbers of individual virus particles noted as copy number so 200 copies would be as if there were 200 virus particles in the sample as you can see that as the sample contains more virus the test is set off more and more but even a few particles is enough to set it off so you can see that the test is quite sensitive as well i also need to give a huge shout out to the people over on joggle also known as just one giant lab who have also been working diligently on lamp testing and who were immensely helpful as i was troubleshooting this links to joggle and biofoundry are in the description unlike pcr which occasionally has false negatives lamp has a bit of an issue with false positives the long chains of dna that get made in the reaction are terrible contaminants if they get out of the tube if it's open for some reason many of the labs i know that are working on lamp have had issues of weird false positives and unless someone infectious has been sneezing into the air ducts in the building it's been suspected that somehow they manage to get airborne through handling and tweaking some of the reagents to make the test detect even lower copy numbers can also make this worse but the false negative rate is really low and this is actually a fantastic thing a false negative lets people out in the world to spread disease whereas a false positive keeps people home and isolated and at the least positive tests can be cross-checked with pcr afterwards to confirm a false positive is annoying a false negative is dangerous and as long as the tubes are kept closed after running it should cut down the false positive rate a lot the only reason they were even opened in the first place was because this was a research setting in clinical settings there's no reason to ever open them okay before we move on to the last test let's talk about the failings of these sorts of tests in a real world scenario first the virus isn't always present in the area being tested if they're replicating in your stomach but not your nasal cavity the test could be artificially negative if the viral load in those areas is too low for it to detect next there is a distinct time window where the virus is most detectable which is 4 days after being infected and within about 2 weeks after that but from 4 to 10 days seems to be the sweet spot after that point you can still be symptomatic but the viral load could be low enough at least in your nasal cavity that you won't set off the test further people who have recovered won't test positive so if you're asymptomatic or had mild symptoms you may not have known and if you got tested it could have been outside of the window where it's most detectable compound that with the lack of availability of testing issues with reagents or availability of reagents and you've got a recipe for a lot of cases going unfound so what if we had a way to test for people who aren't currently sick one of the ways your body fights an infection is by generating antibodies these sticky y-shaped proteins consist of two main parts the ends of the y are a randomly generated series of amino acids your body makes thousands of variants and whichever sticks to the invader is chosen to be mass-produced i'm massively simplifying things here immunology is hard and weird but that's the basic idea the bottom half of the y is called the fc domain and it's what your immune cells actually recognize so when the sticky end attaches to something and this happens enough it'll eventually trigger an immune cell to come and attack whatever the antibodies are stuck to if an antibody only has one target it sticks to it's called monoclonal but if it can stick to either a bunch of different proteins or different areas on a single protein it's called polyclonal also just a quick note about how antibodies are named typically they're named by the animal they come from and then anti whatever they stick to so if it's an antibody from a mouse that sticks to a protein called tubulin we'd call it mouse antitubulin if it's from a rabbit and sticks to antibodies from a mouse we'd call it rabbit anti-mouse the antibody test that everybody talks about are testing for these proteins and the way they're engineered is actually really clever unlike the other two tests let's do this one in reverse and perform it first before explaining how it works the test comes with a few things a spring-loaded lancet to prick your finger and draw a drop or two of blood the antibody kit itself some little pipettes and an alcohol pad and a running buffer solution to take the test you use the alcohol pad to clean your finger and then remove the cap from the lancet grasp it between your thumb and forefinger and squeeze this will trigger the mechanism and prick your finger on the test itself and keep in mind this will vary depending on the brand there's a spot usually marked s for sample a drop or two of blood is collected using the pipet and placed onto the pad of the test in the sample area then two or three drops of the buffer is added on top and it's allowed to flow through the device over the next minute or two you should see a wave of what looks like a purpley fluid flow across the inner strip of the test and then almost immediately a line should start forming next to where there's a c marked this is the control line and if you did everything right it will always trigger now it's a waiting game after 15 or 20 minutes you can check the test results again and see if either one or two more lines show up if they do the test is positive if they don't the test is negative though even a very faint line is considered positive okay let's rewind and look at a cross section of the test first up what's up with that purpley wave well the purple color comes from gold nanoparticles which have been chemically stuck to one of two things the first is actually a piece of the virus usually the s protein and the second is an antibody from a rabbit it may seem odd that gold is purple at this scale but this is a well-known property of gold nanoparticles here's a set of plain solutions of nanoparticles and you can see it's a vibrant color that changes based on particle size and at this scale gold is actually cheap each vial here contains less than a milligram of gold so the amount of gold needed to make many hundreds of tests costs only a few dollars on the actual strip of the test there's three areas where specific antibodies have been chemically attached at the control line area antibodies that target those gold rabbit antibodies from before are attached so as the solution flows through the strip it drags the gold rabbit antibodies over it and they attach to the anti-rabbit antibodies waiting there there are many different kinds of antibody but the ones which are most well known to be associated with this sort of infection are igg and igm antibodies so in the g line there are anti-human igg antibodies and the m line they're anti-human igm i'm not sure what species these come from but i'd guess it's probably a mouse or a rabbit so when you put some blood in the sample area and then drip the buffer on it it washes any antibodies in the sample through the strip the first place they flow through is a pad full of gold coved particles if you have any antibodies against the protein the test uses they'll stick to the covid protein and then flow through the rest of the test when they get to the igg or igm area they get caught by the appropriate antibodies that are waiting for them and if they happen to be anti-covid antibodies they'll be dragging a gold nanoparticle with them at this point they concentrate in that line and eventually become colorful enough that we can see them now this all sounds great but there are some huge issues with this first is again quality control while the tests the various governments have bought often do use true covid proteins there have been instances of companies selling ones that just use proteins from another coronavirus and while there is a possibility that antibodies could stick to those as well if they're similar enough it's much less specific another issue is sensitivity there's growing concern that the tests are calibrated too high which is to say that they expect higher levels of antibodies than most people actually produce if the tests are calibrated against only the severely ill they could be expecting more antibodies than someone who has just a mild case would be producing as their body wouldn't be working as hard to clear the virus also even if made properly you just might not have antibodies against the protein they use for a variety of reasons maybe you have anti-e protein antibodies but not anti-s or maybe you didn't produce antibodies at all or not in sufficient quantity to set off the test something we're learning about what makes covid weird is that everybody responds to it differently it seems often that people who have severe symptoms especially the long haulers those that take a very long time to recover on average are much less likely to mount a strong antibody response whereas fast clearers people who have mild symptoms and get better faster or are asymptomatic tend to have a stronger antibody response i've linked to a great ongoing study below about that particular concept as it's really wild and again there's also the time factor the number of people with symptoms that tested positive for antibodies tend to have their test much closer to when they were infected and the longer you wait the less likely you are to set off the test and we don't know if that's because the antibodies just stopped being produced quickly or if the test isn't sensitive enough to detect them and this has huge implications for if herd immunity from being infected is even possible without a vaccine though there are other considerations like t cell based immunity but that's too much to cover in this video like everything else there'll be resources below for those that want to learn more so where do we go from here it seems that all tests have flaws and cases get missed regardless of which you take so does that mean you shouldn't bother no absolutely not if you have the ability get tested if you think you've been in contact with someone who's either tested positive or shown symptoms instead what i think this shows is that even more vigilance is needed there are very few countries who've managed to completely clear the virus from their population so until a vaccine is rolled out this is going to be an ongoing problem and more and more evidence mounts that even mild or seemingly asymptomatic cases can have devastating long-term side effects and cause damage to organs which could be permanent keep in mind that people marked recovered from the virus didn't just get over the mild flu their bodies were just ravaged by an invisible monster and can be full of scar tissue clots and a host of other new medical problems that may haunt them for the rest of their lives they just aren't dying at this particular red-hot second i'd say i'm not trying to be alarmist but i kind of am and the evidence backs this up there are a lot of people not taking this seriously not just in the us but in my home country of canada as well this is not a mild flu no matter what cheeto von gropensnatcher says and anyone who thinks there'll be a swift return to normal at any point in the near future is deluding themselves the world we knew is gone it will not be coming back our only option is to embrace this new future and overhaul essentially our entire existence and yeah that'll be a lot of work but if you think this is bad we are you in for a surprise as climate change ramps up and a reminder the old normal wasn't good the world has been in crisis for a long time and doing nothing about it as we look to establish this new normal hopefully we can emerge from this crisis actually ready to face all of the others masks aren't going to be temporary all evidence points to their use becoming part of the cultural norm for the foreseeable future and for those hoping for vaccines soon you'll be dearly disappointed even if one is approved before the end of the year there's a chasm between approval and mass producing the billions of doses needed especially if they're formulated to need a booster after a few weeks or months and if there's no hiccups in production or testing and of course there's the other issue that even if it was available not everyone will take it because misinformation is the only thing that seems to spread faster than the virus itself and yes we're finding drugs that can treat this and yes we will have a vaccine eventually but there are other invisible nasties on the horizon antibiotic resistant microbes anti-fungal resistant yeast thousands of new viruses i just hope this will be enough of a wake-up call to finally give scientists and doctors the funding they've been begging for for years so for once we can get ahead of some of that and prepare rather than just try and mop up the mess afterwards and pay a thousand times as much to deal with it thus far all we've demonstrated is that we have the money to roll in the tanks but not enough to buy frontline workers more than garbage bags as ppe we need to listen to medical experts and we need to supply them and our essential workers with proper protection and this is just my opinion but i suspect the debate around reopening schools will end as swiftly as it began after a few weeks of kids being back in school i suspect a huge uptick in cases will force them to close so it's best to prepare for that eventuality for us to get through this the world is going to need everybody to support each other best they can and one of the easiest ways that you can do that for free is through an amazing browser extension called tab for a cause the way it works is in exchange for hosting ads on your new tab page every time you open a new tab you get a heart and as you collect these hearts you can choose one of nine charities to send the hearts to each heart is worth a small amount of money but if you're like me and open dozens and dozens of tabs per day they add up quickly so you can donate to great charities at literally zero expense to you doing something you're gonna do anyway tab for a cause has raised almost a million dollars over the years and it takes literally no effort so if you'd like to try it out there's a link below in the description and on that cheery note i'm going to wrap up this video as i've said there are tons of links to papers and other resources in the description and if you've stuck around through this whole thing i hope you enjoyed i've been working on this video since almost the moment the virus was announced so i'm glad it's finally done and i can get back to working on less depressing projects and of course i need to say a huge huge thank you to my amazing patrons channel members and supporters on kofi and streamlabs who've allowed me to keep working through this crazy time this video was very expensive and took me many hours to work through the issues with all the tests source the reagents and get everything working so your support is greatly appreciated if you'd like to keep the flow of science videos coming there's some links below that's all for now and i'll see you on the next one
