hello what's going on everyone welcome to Neeta this game came out into her day and I played it on stream for about four hours because it's a game that I've been highly anticipating for a long time and it was definitely definitely worth the hike as you can see it's like a physics-based it's a roguelike and it reminds me it plays a lot like terraria plays with the overhaul mod terraria overhaul mod controls almost exactly like that and just like the terraria overhaul mod it's a lot of fun to just set everything on fire and cause all kinds of craziness and also like terraria Victoria's Toria Minecraft are like block-based this game is pixel based every single pixel in the game is simulated that's like the catchphrase for the game every pixel simulated but it's true every single pixel of fire one tiny pixel of fire can start a fire there's pixels of smoke going up there there's what is this is this whiskey I think this is whiskey yes so we got a barrel of whiskey right here but I can shoot I'm kind of drunk right now you can see alcoholic the heavy scent of booze uses up off your clothes aiming is disturbed and alcohol is flammable too yeah so this is a bad idea but uh I can get in there there we go you can just burn down this whole place so yeah amazing amazing combinations of things can be done in this game you're a mage you could levitate as you can see we got levitation energy right here this is mana you start with this wand that's good for sniping things you got this second wand here that's three bombs only has three charges right now you can restore those charges between like biomes between levels see I'm drunk so my aim is completely random I need this to wear off 15% it's incredible I'm also oiled oil makes you slippery and more flammable see I'm sliding around and obviously very flammable so yeah not a good idea to be oiled so let's just play okay we can take a bath good I needed that so you start with just two wands obviously you get more stuff you get potions - and the really interesting thing is let's check this out okay we got a torch wand good yeah I'll take that right here and I want to try something now that we're like we're up high enough we don't haven't gone down anywhere yet now that I have this torch wand I want to see if I could use that to get someplace cuz the game is mostly about going down into the mines and seeing how deep you can get down there but there is a surface I have another video that I'm working on exploring the surface but I wanted to just record a video I did a stream yesterday for hours over four hours I couldn't stop playing it and yeah I just wanted to do a let's try like a first look at this game just to get it up on the channel for all you guys cuz I think like it's incredibly exciting it's got some performance issues as you can see like there's framerate problems at times because the vast amount of like things that are happening all the pixels have to be track of now I should have just tested this before going up here but let's see can I melt my way through the tree No so this is a giant tree I haven't yet discovered how to get like through this but I know you can I know you can oh these guys are out you know what let's just go see you later there's an egg up there oh my god but these are like some of the most deadly enemies in the entire game they shoot acid all over the place and they just completely melt through the entire world so let's get far away from them they're gonna keep chasing me now that's the bad thing but it's fine this whole game world is interconnected just like you know terraria I I hate to keep comparing it to terraria but that's like the mean thing that i play on this channel so and i know if any of you were watching this the majority of you are probably you know know who i am and well if you don't then hey what's up i'm fury i play a lot of terraria but here we go magic arrow with timer that's a spell i can't use it yet there's another wand up in there let's try to not get toxified we got toxified don't woo alright I need water somewhere I don't know where let's not kill ourselves we're not toxified anymore I knew I was trying to get up there to get that wand but who knows if we're gonna go get that now so the whole world is procedurally generated this is just the first of several biomes that I've seen and it's extremely deadly this game is extraordinarily deadly but it does very much remind me of playing Terraria with overhaul mod and here we'll use this here's a bomb the control and just like the the fire and everything like that you know it just reminds me of that so much okay so this guy is gonna be a big nuisance a big nuisance is there anything yes good kind of chest we got treasure and what is this is that a bomb it was a bomb I'm glad that I didn't stand right next to it this run would have been over right now probably oh my god I'm on fire how did how because I shot it and then ran through it okay we're still we're not that bad we have oil on us but we also have water okay hang on yeah we're getting some really gnarly RNG here like bad luck bad luck these guys need acid guys like we need to probably get out of here this this thing is going to right I just exploded it man that's all whiskey up there so you can get some crazy combinations of things in this this is all flammable gas do I have oh yeah we have this I can set it on fire please there we go alright now didn't kill this guy but whatever we melted that entire area there's just like single little pixels here and there alright get rid of you what is this gunpowder or is this coal I think it's just cold all right sweeten so that all burns away ah take a breather real quick up here so the amazing part of this game other than everything you already see which i think is absolutely amazing is all of these all your wands these are just individual spells that you can mix and match right not right now you can only do it in certain locations unless you get a certain upgrade a perk all right so this is all whiskey I'm gonna get drunk when I fall in here but so that is this gonna kill me hang on yeah okay I'm glad I got out of it so there's traps obviously week but enchant yes so this is the same thing as my starting wand except it has more slots mana drain 5 whatever whatever let's try to get out of here actually I only have an 85 gold it's pretty bad I need a lot more money ok or I need to just not die I'm drunk so it's our game can you please do don't kill me I can't even move don't die to being drunk please oh my god this guy this is bad we've had a horrible luck here alright so I'm still alive for the moment I don't want to walk on this might ignite some covered and whiskey can you not please I need to get out of here okay so the holy mountain is where I need to go it's right here let's go oh man so we don't have much money but well so before I do this alcoholic does that obviously and then bloody you sense an increased chance of attaining critical hits and it also gives you a little bit of fire resistance so I think it's cool that let me just wash that off being in like swimming in your enemies blood increases your critical chance and that was a full heal and this restores all of my charges for any wands that have charges like just that one right there and now I could buy more spells we already have torch on this one we can't buy that sea of acid I have to buy that that's gonna be crazy alright see of acid oh man so now let's see let's see I'm gonna put this up here so we got three on there this I'm not gonna use probably sea of acid okay lights your wand right up it's this is like a passive it just like if you bump it to fire or bump into wood with it you could burn the wood I guess we'll just keep that on there I don't know what's this magical arrow what timer I guess we'll put this on here actually no what am I doing here yeah we're gonna just put that there haribol whatever that's a passive so every time we actually use this thing it's gonna cast it's gonna create a sea of acid so let's try not to use that because that's gonna be crazy put the bomb at the end all right so good before I died we need to use the sea of acid exploding corpses man trick greed electricity immunity and we're gonna get exploding corpses because that should be a lot of fun all right now the coal pits I will do this oh my god see there's the sea of acid with the flammable gas that happens afterwards that's crazy see how deadly that is that's awesome so I can melt everything I melted like the entire world look at this oh my god okay let's see what did I do hopefully there were no good items in this entire world it's amazing all right so we got some rats they explode I forgot they're gonna explode so I just heard explosions while I was under the water so what does this one do is just an arrow with a timer okay and then that so we only have two more C's left but I can just carry this one and then just set things on fire with it so it's kind of handy for that these guys when they died they have a lava blood so I don't want to stay away from them we still have an amazing wand the sea is is awesome don't get me wrong the acid sea but we need a good one for our main attack this is decent it'll get the job done goodbye gold but yeah so I could set all this on fire to sort of bombs I like to try to keep it a bomb whoo that's gunpowder okay yeah I like to try to keep the bomb wand oh my god doing this place is crazy all right whoo mmm that gold Hey Oh suck we just got shotguns all right whatever see you later Punk I don't like these guys at all that he that was not good I need to get out of here all right he's gonna blow up mana 27 HP left and then what one HP can I get out of here somehow I'm gonna try this might be the end I mean I have 1 hp left guys we should oh yes don't cast it I can't believe the luck 1 hp and we made it Wow of course we have no money to buy anything unfortunately because circle of thunder summon rock spirit ah man that would have been great spark bolt with timer you can Electrify the water explosion of spirits it's an explosion of whiskey everywhere magic missile oh well we get a perk at least now we're gonna die though because we're not ready for this next biome revenge explosion freeze filled vampirism vampirism is really good obviously but I don't know if we're gonna get a chance to really use it so I'm gonna keep the same things like we're not ready for this at all and you can't backtrack game make sure of that alright so yeah rip we're gonna be dead very quickly so let's just melt everyone oh my god I already died but hey there we go that's some of the craziness let's jump back in see if we could do another run real quick unfortunately between runs the entire program like shuts down and it restarts again I guess to clear memory it seems maybe something like that because it's like you know obviously uses a lot of memory which isn't a problem for me I have 32 gigabytes but most people do not and I'm sure that this game uses up a bunch of memory keeping track of the state of all of this chaos alright so let's try to progress a little bit faster now but at the same time have fun and set everything on fire but I would like to I don't know see if we rush we're just gonna die up in that spot again because I've never actually gotten past that the snow biome it's really difficult we got an egg I'm not exactly sure what this does but I think it's summons the Ellis what if I just use a little bit now you can't I can throw let's try throwing it at something for that wait a minute I think I dunno what this does hang on yeah let's use it on one of these guys oh okay well it hatched oh it's like a decoy in it like it created I'm an enemy and then the other enemies attacked it instead of me that's cool all right let's try to get that wander potion or whatever it is that's really cool finally figured it out I was wondering what the egg did let's get this another torch one okay I mean it's not the most useful but it's cool it works boom take that I need all that money stop it now I mean I guess I don't need that money if I'm gonna die trying to get it these things I hate them this debuff the poop the toxic this one white clothes protect you from fire can be washed off by liquids toxic sludge in your clothes makes your health degrade slowly yeah obviously we see that everyone sees that I don't know why I read it from bottom to top I just think that's what I do sometimes all right so this is going to write that's okay so I need to take care of you don't toxic me again I got toxic because we jumped in a puddle I can't go that way anyway because there's a lava a giant sea of lava that I don't have any way to put it out right now so we're just gonna go we have 130 let's just go it's fine can you please stop right now 133 we can get the middle one let's just get it whatever whatever we don't need that one let's see so bifurcated formation we're gonna put that in the front triple scatters fell Simon simultaneously cast three spells with low accuracy so three spells a let's see what this wand is like that okay oh it has a long recharge it's not a you know you don't want to use that in the middle of like trying like a crazy firefight let's this one doesn't shuffle though that's the good thing about this it doesn't shuffle my mean one doesn't shuffle either I'm gonna actually put my torch on that and then let's see we can get rid of this wand at any time put the bomb on next okay cool alright so now we're just gonna set everything on fire probably ourselves too I wish I could get something better but it's alright homing shots probably tricked greed and yeah let's get homing shots nice and let's go boom all right the next shot is gonna set things on fire or we could just do this wait all right yeah I don't even know if that's gonna be good you never know it could be a really horrible wand usually like the really amazing ones are like gigantic oh crap come on there we go what does it do large fire bolt and a more powerful version of fire bolt yes right there okay because 25 uses 25 charges sure thing buddy let's just go oh my god that is very nice isn't it we got water now we don't wait hang on I'm just gonna use this the whole time try that get this hang on dive don't drown this might blow me up it didn't I thought it did at first was like oh okay good so let's put a bomb right here sweet now I need to shuffle my weapons again real quick we're going to this is my mean one right now this one is the bad thing and the bomb at the end okay all right cool boom yeah this game is so much fun so much fun and because it's chaotic it's like completely chaotic is very difficult but that's what makes it all if it was easy then it wouldn't be nearly as fun and look at this what wasn't even looking get out of here yes get it that's what you do right there don't toxify me stop it all right I don't know that's like toxic cloud or something get out of here I am toxic get rid of the bomb one whatever what does this thing do I'm just gonna use it I guess I don't know what it's doing but it's I'm gonna die but it's okay we got to check this game out a little bit if I could find the holy mountain which is like the if we it's right down here someplace let me just kill these guys maybe we're kind of in a bad spot right now what the heck can you recharge what's going on I can't attack why is it taking so long to recharge I can't shoot you I'm gonna die because I'm not able to attack and it was right there right there all I had to do was just get over this thing but I was out of levitation energy I couldn't make it right there that's it we could have had it but it's fine it's perfect timing to end it I just wanted to give you guys on this channel a taste of this game no eita anyway I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next video thanks for watching and have a great day peace you
