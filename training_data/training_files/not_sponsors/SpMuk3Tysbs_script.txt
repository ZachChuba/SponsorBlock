the two games are on it three or five and six forty yep three or five and seven probably right let's assume Ellen gets delayed three or five and six forty on Sunday I like the back-to-back I like the chance to spend Sunday with the NFL the National Football League I think everybody in the world is in the agreement that the Chiefs are gonna win that game against the Titans but everybody was in agreement that the Baltimore Ravens were gonna smoke the Titans or the Titans the team of Destiny that is something that you have to think about right now you look back to the Giants and I know it's a cliche thing to say but that Giants team when Tom Coughlin and Eli Manning when they eventually went on to beat the undefeated Patriots in a Super Bowl Tom Coughlin was almost fired like week 10 week 11 and then they got hot they went into the playoffs as this team that was supposed to get out in the first round they get hot win a Super Bowl Steve Weatherford pins the Patriots inside the five like I think five times or something like that they were super well they were a team of destiny then you look at the Astros the Nationals have been somehow by the way yeah somehow someway the Nationals beat the terminator' teams that were buzzed off they were a team of destiny you look at the New Orleans Saints after Katrina tima destiny you look at the Patriots after 9/11 team of destiny this tightness team now banning there's no national disasters that have happened but it feels as if this team has destiny on its side right now it feels like this team has come out of nowhere and got very very hot and if there's any team that could just slaughter a destiny now this Derrick Henry video of him stiff-arming a helmet on a stick while Mike Vrabel is hopping on his back and getting carried the head coach of the team is insane and Derrick Henry is always going to be a massive part of the success of this whole thing but if anybody can just saw right down the center of destiny it is this Kansas City Chiefs team with Andy Reed a beautiful mind of Patrick Holmes quarterback they have so many weapons they were down 24 nothing or something last week and it didn't matter they end up winning by 20 they're like the Golden State Warriors were a few years ago where everybody could get hot and score 40 at any given moment that's what it feels like for the Chiefs every single one of their wide receivers could go off for 250 yards and none of us would be surprised and that's just the way the Chiefs are so I think the Titans are running into too big of a problem here but we thought that what the Ravens I would not be surprised if they keep it closer maybe even win two damn thing order from seeking now back to the magic I think I'm Titans might be the team of destiny but the Patrick mahomes is the human of Destiny like that oh that guy yeah human of Justice oh yeah he is all-powerful all-knowing all throwing Oh Patrick mahomes is I love that man and I will never ever bet against Patrick well let's remember Alex Smith was the quarterback for the Chiefs they beat the Patriots week 1 and then they went on to win a lot of games and he was almost he was an MVP conversation and they did so well that during the last week of the regular season they rested Alex Smith in Patrick mahomes played against the Denver Broncos in Denver gets a win for them plus all the things that they probably saw in the practice field Oh Patrick Holmes was the backup whenever Andy Reid decided to get rid of Alex Smith after his best year he's ever had out Smith get rid of him and put Patrick Holmes in as its starter we all laughed we literally all left except for the Kansas City Chiefs people except for the fans of Ken's Adichie's now that we've got a chance to watch this guy what an unstoppable force this dude is every single throw he had a dislocated patella he came back two weeks later he looked even better I mean he's just he is the prime football player the prime quarterback that they're gonna be trying to let now him and Lamar are gonna be awesome to watch for the next 110 years probably they're gonna be awesome watch but when you talk about the quarterback position drop back Pass magical throws strong enough arm to throw it out of a stadium I mean he is just so fun to watch I'll be excited to see what the Titans team can do to corral him in that offense with Andy Regis drawing magical line so Perry Tyreke you're gonna run here here here here here here and then go in there like that's all pre snap so then you have to fit you they have to give away if they're in man or in zone because Tyreke kill you have to figure it out Travis Kelce is a weapon Sammy Watkins is so good Nicole Hardman is an animal LeSean McCoy still got it if you need them and that other running back in Williams Amy it just keeps going it's like they have so many weapons in the defense if they can obviously not play like they played in the first quarter against the Texans for the rest of that game was pretty much shut down it's just that team feels like they're gonna be a very very difficult stop it's tough to see the Titans wing just because so very like you not very often does it happen where a team can just absolutely dominate the time of possession and still potentially lose by like two scores yeah like the Chiefs could have the ball for like ten minutes on Sunday and still potentially win by like two touchdowns legit they score so fast so quick and it doesn't matter what the weather is patrick mahomes can throw the ball in any weather he is an all-terrain quarterback and that is something that you need in the playoffs especially with the potential bad weather over there it's game and you've brought up shady it's like they're keeping he didn't touch eating and have one carried he didn't have one touched on Sunday Andy Reid said he's rest of them just well bring him in with need him what is it second half we're down three all right shady you've been arrested for a month here you go pal let's do it
