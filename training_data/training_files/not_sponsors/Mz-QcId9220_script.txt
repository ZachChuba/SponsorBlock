We! Ki! Me! Ki! Na! Mu! Wi! Ki! [*vuvuzela sound*] Wow~ SUYEON. [Ms. Tough]
Yes? [Self Censorship]
We're gonna edit some of them. I've checked my Namuwiki page after the debut? Me. [Unexpected]
-Oh really?
-Yes. -You haven't, right?
-Nope I haven't, either. [Namuwiki WEKIMEKI]
I thought that the team name was similar to Namuwiki, when it was first decided. -Shall we see the details?
-Sure! Wow. Does this really show up when you search WEKIMEKI in Namuwiki? Sorry, I must have missed it. [Quick change in attitude]
That's interesting. [Didn't she just say she knows how to use Namuwiki?]
Me. This is the latest update. I see. Leader JI SUYEON. Shall we read the first part together? Summary. Let's get crazy! Hello, this is WEKIMEKI. WEKIMEKI is an idol group with 8 members, which belongs to Fantagio Music. They made their debut in August 8, 2017. It's correct! Wow~ The name of the fandom is Ki-Ling. Right. Who came up with that name? We did a vote with various suggestions. [Never heard of that]
-That's correct.
-So we picked this name? -We did.
-Along with other staffs. I think there were two candidates. Ki-Ling and...what was the other one? -Kiki?
-Was it Kiki? I think so. Member and position. I wonder what they say about the position. JI SUYEON is the leader, and the main vocalist. They say I'm the lead vocalist. Never heard of that. Me, YUJEONG, is the sub vocalist, main dancer, and the main rapper. We all dance well, but I think it's because I danced longer. LUA is the sub vocalist, and the lead rapper. Lead rapper? Rapper? [Admits]
-Yup.
-A lead rapper? [Taken aback]
No, no. [Dang~!] I think there is some wrong information here. [Admits]
She puts exclamations in the right place. Turn on the light~ [Queen of rap]
Is this a rap? Oh, chemistry between members. Wow~ [Organized in alphabetical order. Please add to this if more is found.]
Please add to this if more is found. [Excited]
This is interesting. 99s Dodaeng. 00s SEI and LUA. -Soodaeng. Is it the two of us?
-Yes. YUJEONG likes to joke around with leader JI SUYEON. SUYEON feels annoyed at the first, but accepts it. She is two months older, [Two months?]
Two months older? No, two years, two years. It says that although she is two years older, I talk down on her sometimes. It isn't 'sometimes' anymore. She does that everyday. SUYEON. [Ms. Tough]
Yes? [Q. What kind of chemistry do you want to add?]
I want to write this. ELLY & LUA movie mates. [ELLY & LUA] [True.]
I get it. Because they are watching horror movies every night. -Cute.
-It's like my small but certain happiness. Who is writing this? The representative! [Convinced]
Oh he is the one writing this? [Fooled] [To. SEI Thank you!] Only 3 of the 8 members use their real name. The rest of them uses stage names. Some say that they considered foreign fans, but a lot of people either like it or hate it. -Ah~
-Oh~
-I see. 2 of the 3 members who use their real name were famous for being in I.O [Lol]
I.O~ and they are KIM DOYEON and CHOI YUJEONG. Oh, so they considered foreign fans? [Never heard of that]
I didn't know. I think I heard that they named us to match the group color. I heard so too. [Behind story]
I still remember the day when the members first heard their stage name. I wasn't feeling well, so I was at the quarters. I was sick around the debut. So I woke up [They came home with their stage names]
and found other members home from work. [Fuss]
And they were like, 'What is this? What is going on?' So I asked why, and they say that they have their stage names. I said, 'What is it?' and ELLY told me to guess. I said a few, and I was wrong. ELLY, ELLY! I am ELLY. SEI alone liked her name. LUA had another name at first. -SHUSHU.
-It was SHUSHU. The tallest members are KIM DOYEON, as tall as any other men, and LUCY, nearly 170. CHOI YUJEONG, on the other hand, is quite small, and other members are between 160-165. That's straightforward. Why did they write like this? DOYEON increased the average height by 2.6cm. [4th among all girl idol group members.]
That's a lot. And if you remove the tallest two, [Hurt / Detailed Namuwiki]
-Whey did they have to do this?
-Seriously. the average height is 162.1cm. Including the two, 164.7cm. So the two of them increased the average by 2.6cm. [CHOI YUJEONG is hurt] About our activity, there are information about our VLIVEs and activities before our debut. It says that we were trained on i-Teen before we debuted We did prepare our debute under the name, 'i-Teen Girls.' This is correct [Correct]
This is correct [Self-editing]
We're going to skip a few things [List of Albums] [Amazed]
All of our albums are on here -No way
-This is great It's like a WEKIMEKI history book [History Class for WEKIMEKI]
Let's read the history Title of Mini Album 1, WEME The title song, I don't like your Girlfriend [Long ago]
We worked so hard back then We were so passionate [Suddenly becoming the MC]
What's your favorite album? [Thinking]
Me I like LOCK END LOL the best The album that I love but also makes me sad La La La? Why does it make you sad? [Relates]
I feel like a lot of people didn't really pay attention to that album [Fan Cheers]
Fan Cheers, what? [Wow, Respect]
All the fan cheers are here -No way
-This is so great There's too many. Let's skip -They even have the fan cheer tutorial video
-Right This is amazing Let's look at the list of awards We got two prizes We got the K-Pop Singer Prize at the 2018 Culture Awards We got the artentainer award at the Soribada Awards in 2019 Yeah Hopefully we'll get a prize in 2020 and it'll be added to the list on Namuwiki [Let's go WEKIMEKI]
-We'll work hard
-We'll work hard, fighting Side stories [Surprised] [Real reaction]
How do you guys know this? What was in the list of options for our team name? We had the Girl Squad, Artistar, Chloeye, A-Nana, and etc [Thank goodness]
They added an ellipsis behind Girl Squad What's this? They debuted to Idol Star Athletic Championship on Korean New Years 2018 Do-yeon Kim and Lucy earned silver medals on bowling And in the 400m baton pass, they crossed the line Who's this? [Is LUA the culprit?]
Wasn't it LUA? [Scared]
-It probably was LUA
-Right? This is because of... [Doyeon the storyteller]
There's a bit of a backstory to this -YUJEONG and I were supposed to participate in the race
-Right What was wrong with YUJEONG? [She was sick with flu]
-Was she sick?
-She had a bad cold [Right] -It was flu
-Great memory -She had a flu, so they switched to Lucy the night before
-Right So Lucy did it after trying it once But she was so good, so we earned the silver medla We could have gotten gold, but we couldn't [The precious silver medal was proof of their teamwork]
-It was so close
-Right It says we were on Elle's 2020 April magazine And it'll be updated too We filmed with the 2020 July 1st Look Magazine Hope it gets updated We looked at WEKIMEKI on Namuwiki, how was it? It was really fun -There were a lot of wrong information, but at the same time, there were a lot of information that I was surprised to find on this
-Same I'm a little embarrassed It feels like revealing myself [If there's anything you want to change]
If there's anything we want to appeal [Let's go home and fix it]
We can log in and fix it at home [Check out WEKIMEKI's photos on Magazine 198 in the bookstore] I'm from Eunpyeong-gu? I've never even heard of that I was born in Ilsan I didn't switch schools I was in Bansong Middle School for all three years 35kg?

-Yeah -LOL
-They got this part right too Can you please edit the Doyeon goddess part [Motto: My motto is not having a motto]
I don't make one these days It always changes depending on the situation They got the characters for Noh Hyo-jung slightly wrong I don't know if it was when I was four, but who wrote this part where it says I moed to Seoul, Seongbuk-gu, Jeongreong-dong? -Is it your mother?
-Mother? [See you next time!]
