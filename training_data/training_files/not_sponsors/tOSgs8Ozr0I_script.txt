thanks again to audible for sponsoring this video if you'd like to support the production of the series thank you welcome back to the eighth week of gillin or games [Applause] last week team europe got their first win in four weeks and eliminated a tmna member from the game we're now down to five framed chem q and flutten for team na and tanzu and guns chili for team eu five super solid competitors you all have definitely deserved to make it this far nice job i'm super happy to have made it this far and i hope that today we can grab another win the last thing you want to happen is to get eliminated this far into the series at the end of last week i told you guys to check if there were any combo deals available and by combo i mean heal your hit points as fast as possible it's been a while since we've been in the wilderness the last time we were all there was way back in episode two well i think it's about time we head back out there to help with today's challenge i decided to bring back some familiar faces some people you may recognize come on out guys [Music] welcome back c engineer and rake c for team eu and rargan chemcu for tmna hello there did you guys miss me you guys thought a game of roon link would keep me from coming back not gonna happen hello yeah there they are what's up everybody yeah i'm happy to be here again take out some of these horrible horrible eu people yeah i'm gonna smack these people down these guys will be the ones you have to deal with to make it through today's challenge they'll be attacking you and you'll be trying to survive today's challenge is called tanks alive as you've probably guessed by now today's challenge is a tank test something i think all of you have probably experienced at some point in the wilderness your goal today is to survive during your tank test as long as possible tmna members will be attacked by the returning team eu members c engineer and rexy and team eu members will be attacked by their returning tna members rag and chem q the gear you'll be wearing consists of standard tank gear which includes tour eggs and black dehyde and your inventory will be filled with brews restores carm ones anglerfish and phoenix necklaces pretty much all you'll need to stay alive as long as possible you will be allowed to move around while you're tanking but you're not allowed to run away the pkrs will be using a tribrid setup comparable to the one used in last man standing rng of course will play a factor but knowing how to combo eat quickly switching your prayers and gear and not panicking will play a much larger role in staying alive today's challenge is incredibly important and here's why the two people who tank for the least amount of time today will automatically be in the banning no nominations no discussion you're automatically in now if you're one of the three who tank for the longest amount of time i have some great news for you you'll win yourself a spot in the finals of guillenore games that's right guys this is the final challenge before the season finale of gg the last thing you want is to get eliminated one challenge before the final so i suggest you guys do your best today as soon as you said this was the final challenge before the finale i had a weird mixture of nervousness and excitement this is what we've been working towards the entire season and if we can knock one more team and a member out we'll be back on level terms go ahead and gear up fill up your inventories and i'll meet you guys in the wilderness good luck [Music] even though i'm eliminated right now i still have a chance to help out the boys on team eu and hopefully me and mr c engineer can make that happen here we are guys the penultimate challenge those who are tanking will get to choose the world they'd like to tank on in order to have the best ping possible up first is going to be framed for team na being attacked by c engineer and rake seat i was worried about bs rng to be honest because you know they did have d-bolts you know d-bolt and dds if they got it on the right tick then they could have just completely killed me i'm going to count down from three in game and when you see me type go your time starts there is a decent bit of pressure in going first but i figured i'd just go first to get it done with since i'm pretty good at eating and i'm pretty good at tanking so i should do pretty well here all right framed here we go three two one go [Music] uh stand back the barrages are going to be huge here i just barrage he doesn't use that [Music] there you you have to eat that that's fine it's fine it's fine just one sec oh that was a rush he just started on purpose he's doing it too he might be out that's it i think yeah yeah that's it oh no oh it's p-neck i think you just p-necked oh yeah get the read-up you get the production tanzania is gonna be hard bro i think he's done well here [Music] time nice job framed really solid first tank i mean honestly like at this point i hadn't played in a few days so i feel like it could have been a lot better than it actually was i i didn't feel like my tank test was too strong like i could have gone at least another 30 seconds if i was on the money oh that's that's not bad you wouldn't it's like i'm attacked a tv that's all i care about did you say he wouldn't have taken tv of course not he didn't multi yeah idiot i mean but he did singles opd gear but in singles that would have been like seven minutes you made me the entire time next up we have guns chili being attacked by chem q and rarg rark i need you to summon your inner peak hair for this man all right i need you to walk him through this martin shake his little i'd rather he didn't touch that i didn't think i was gonna make it through everybody in team na has very good pvm experience most of them have very good pvp experience yeah i i wasn't confident three two one you got this tom you smurfing man go [Music] [Music] oh oh ko no gancilla knows how to eat i thought my tank test was going to be alright to be honest but there are a bunch of times i just got stacked out with a lot of damage so i ended up losing all my combo food extremely early oh geez that was a combo oh my god that was a big ko dude that was a ko holy [ __ ] tank though that was good you did a really good job yeah that that ko holy crazy that was crazy a nice combo there from chem q and raag finishes off guns chili good fight right it's so weird i couldn't hit for sh yeah i thought i thought i had it in the bag not gonna lie and then how much food did you have left a fair bit like mostly bruised oh wow i wasn't too confident that my time was any good and i also got rambo'd by ra i think he uh he dds me well over 60 damage so it was it was a shaky it was a shaky run for sure rake cnc engineer are back up this time going against zulu before the tank test the goal was to just basically try to keep my hp up watch what they're attacking with and it was uh two of the previous eu team mr rexy and mr c engineer zulu here we go i have a strong appeal i'm getting some kind of weird ko three two one go oh oh my god what that beginning i i thought it was all over i saw my life flashing through my eyes i heard the duh the death music everything it was all going through my head all at once i was down to 10 hp they hit me with crazy specs at the start very lucky and caught me off guard this is done this is easy most of my combo food was gone after that i think i maybe had like three combo food left at the end there uh after their initial specs so that made me a little nervous fortunately i was able to get you know get some momentum back and get my grounding back stop barraging rexy hey dude [Music] start was hard oh my god that's start man it's starting to throw like that start losing so much like it was a there was a lot going on it was probably like 50 things going on at once in my head it was let's eat up let's make sure we got the right prayers on and make sure that we keep right gear that we need to have on they're probably going to go over some barrages let's throw some dehyde back on keep eating it was just all happening at once really nice recovery there from zulu after that initial combo we checked the footage back and can confirm that the initial combo was 111 damage so if you hadn't have eaten that anglerfish at the beginning to overheal you would have died immediately nice job and now the second and final eu member going up today tanzu going against kemp q and raag [Music] uh to stand between two people not for the first time sleep it's not something i've really done that much i've done a bit of it when i used to pk but i wanted to go a couple rounds in so i didn't want to be the first up so i wanted to see what other people did and then so i was leaning on the job like an apprenticeship all right they're about to start us off okay all right we're going down angler paw this time we need a smite yeah because we didn't we forgot to do that three two one go oh beautiful start for us nice brush oh oh you got this dave easy peasy [Music] oh my god do something [Music] c engineering and roxy were like freezing each other a lot because they were using barrage over blitz he just sent me a swifty i'm like oh tom mate do you think we could do you think i could like step under i was i don't know if i'm gonna like try or whether it's legal or not but i think you should go for it [Music] dude don't claim it you know he's tempted to claim it you know he's terrible oh that's small oh wow that was clever 500 iq dude that was fun dude i honestly didn't even think of that you're 500 iq my guy i was noticing no one was moving and you said at the start that we could move and i thought why is no one hugging trees or anything like that so i thought by watching people they kept freezing their teammate i thought right as soon as they freeze them if i stand under them that's one person out of the game for what 20 seconds and i could just focus on tanking and take as little damage as possible oh wait oh my god he's so smart what the [ __ ] oh my god next level tvu iq is huge [Music] uh oh here we go oh come on one more hit nice another one oh oh gosh okay holy [ __ ] dude you were fine tanza with the extremely high iq play of standing under whoever got frozen that may have just secured your place in the final and lastly today we have flutten who is the final team n a member going up against c engineer and rakesy so far everyone has managed to tank for a pretty long time hopefully you can as well i have had to tank before when doing callisto and things like that and will deep it always went really well so i kind of was a bit more confident three two one go oh my god it's gone so fast [Music] please please please this is why you always get to kill me your barrages are on [ __ ] dude eu has done the most collateral damage to their team this whole that time [Music] i tried to get my prayer switches right and my armor switches but then it made me forget about eating and stuff sometimes too i was definitely focusing more on what they were doing than what i was doing or i guess i wasn't looking at my prayer very much and not my hp come on another zero keep going nicole you got this you're doing well you're doing well yeah good job keep that hp up [Laughter] her oh my kill finally the final tank test ends with a nice little combo from the eu duo but a solid tank all around from flutten nice job the biggest thing that like caught me off guard which is how fast it all started like it like i blinked and suddenly i was almost dead and it all just went so fast all right that's everyone we're now going to all meet back together and i'll announce the times great challenge today guys everyone put up a solid tank and the times definitely reflect that the five times were all within 33 seconds of one another so very close the top three times today will get those competitors straight to the final the bottom two times will automatically go into the banning in first place today with a time of three minutes and 33 seconds earning a spot in the final is framed of tmna so kevin officially safe you're on to the finale congratulations so because i survived the longest i managed to secure my place in the finals and i have a shot at winning this entire thing it felt really good and i hope that i can go on to make my team proud and win this whole thing i hope i don't make jimmy proud though jimmy in second place also earning a spawn in the final with a time of three minutes and 17 seconds is zulu of tmna after almost dying immediately during the tank test he recovered well and zulu you're now in the final congratulations you know i feel pretty good i was i was saying from the start that we're gonna go uh six and two and six and one after we like lost our first couple challenges and here we are we are here at the final um i'm happy to represent my team all right three of you are now left two team eu members and one tmna member so team eu will have one person in the banning today if flutten wins tmna will have three members for the final and team eu will only have one in third place with a time of three minutes and 12 seconds is [Music] tanzu with a three-minute and 12-second tank oh my god it came down to a couple of seconds and by watching everyone else get like three and a half minutes i thought yeah there's no way i'm getting that i was buzzing i didn't think i i got i thought i was at least like fourth i didn't it when you're tanking it doesn't feel like over three minutes it feels about 45 seconds and i didn't think i had a good time it looks like the walk under strategy from the tank test was enough to get you through the finals well done man guns chili had a time of three minutes and seven seconds and flutten had a time of three minutes on the dot barely missing out on the top three unlucky unfortunately this means that both of you will be going into today's banning guns chile now in his third banning and flooding in her first in today's banning you guys will be playing tanks again your tank testing isn't over just yet both of you will once again be attacked by the returning members of tmna and eu but this time you'll be tanking at the same time the person that dies first will be eliminated from the gill in our games one challenge before the final if you win this banning you'll join framed zulu and tanzu in the finals the final test will take place in clan wars i'll meet you all there [Music] i i wasn't confident to be honest flutten did really well in the tank test and there's a lot of rng involved as well so uh i think it could have it really could have gone either way for for both of us she's a she's a very competent pvm and she knows how to keep her hp above zero so it was it was tough i thought i was gonna go home like weeks ago i think actually like the second or third challenge ever the jad speed run thing i thought for sure i had the lowest time that time so ever since then i was just like yup gonna go home any moment now i mentally prepared that time so i was just set ever since then all right guys this is it there's one spot left in the finals guns chili flutten this is the biggest tank test of your lives good luck soup brought me back to life to complete my next challenge which was to help team europe get to the finals we can do that right now by helping gunshielele rex and i just need to make sure that we make zero mistakes this time against flutten three two one [Music] go [Music] yo ghost click i swear to god clicked on the phone you're like you're literally trolling man i swear to god i was quite nervous i know that floating probably has a good idea out of tanks she's got infernal key i don't even have one of them but tom also does quite a lot of pvm so i thought that it quite equally matched so i was nervous for him oh oh god oh my god she's safe my thread it's my dead that wasn't me she's out she's out oh stick in there guns chilly we got her down the last necklace killing nicole complete them that's it gunshilli wins and earns himself a spot in the finals along with tanzu for team eu i think the only reason i won was because of sea engineering rexy they i think they were more composed and they had seen fotoso stepping under wrong and i don't think that the n a attackers had learnt from their mistakes so i was able to stand under them a couple times so i think that's what got me the win just uh their composure more so than my tanking [Music] she's not a peak here so i i don't i don't blame her you know it's it's a weird thing to do with tank tests it's one of those weird things you don't necessarily do so i was rooting for of course but i i kind of figured especially after watching gunshilli's first tank that he was going to get it fantastic challenge and banning today guys seriously well done chemcu rar great cnc engineer thank you all for coming back and helping out today it's great to see you all but uh you're still eliminated so yeah bye [Music] guns julie congratulations on securing your spot in the finals flutten you came up just short this time so close but i'm sorry you've been eliminated from the gilanor games like i said i lasted way longer than i thought i feel like i learned a lot about the game just from doing everything but it also made me realize i still have a lot more to learn and i'm okay with that great competitor awesome having you here and maybe we'll see you again in the future guys you made it to the finals of guillenore games framed in zulu representing tmna and guns chile and tanzu representing team eu i bet you guys weren't expecting a two versus two for the final but i figured since you all came in as a team it only makes sense that you finish as a team as well i think john and i are very strong players overall and the the other team they are they definitely do have their strengths but depending on the challenge it could go either way you know it really depends on what the challenge is going to be so i i don't want to say if we're going to have a strong lead on them because i honestly don't know the challenge you know and the other players they are very high iq about you know clearly they were the only two people to stand underneath so they're high iq i i i would say i would say it's going to be a good challenge it's it's a very good finale me and tanza were just a really ecstatic um we were talking about how much we clowned n a without without standing on the technique that he came up with um so we uh we found it pretty funny and we found it pretty deserved to be honest i think um i think when you do when you when you think like that you know and it gets you the win you i guess you deserve it speed and conscious chilly hopefully it's framed in zulu pk and a pvm editor and uh challenge person there's your confidence i think it depends on the challenge they're both good players they both do a lot of rebuilding a lot of challenges lots of varied content but framed is a very good player i'd say that i know my way around the game so i think it'd be a good matchup it's been a long season with great challenges and drama team eu winning the first two challenges tmna winning the next four and then team eu winning the final two to bring it back to a two versus two i can't wait to show you what i have in store for the final all i'm going to tell you is to bring your stamina potions because i think you're going to need them i'll see you guys soon you
