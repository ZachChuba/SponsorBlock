hi everyone hope you're doing well today I've got a great match of cod war zone with the legend jacksepticeye and this was the first match where I played with a much lower sensitivity than I usually do and I think that it helped quite a lot to improve my tracking of targets usually I would use nine or ten in modern warfare and war zone but I don't really play modern warfare as much anymore whereas I'm playing way more war zone now and you tend to fight at much longer distances and you don't need to whip your mouse around for a quick 180 as much however with the lower sends I've just found that my aim is more consistent and I can keep track of targets better and also control recoil more finely and accurately so try it out for yourself I'm using six at the moment on PC with 400 dpi it can take a bit of getting used to but I feel like it will improve my aim overall and I also feel that lower settings on analog sticks on console could be beneficial in the same respect with that said I hope you guys enjoyed this match leave a like if you do and subscribe for more if you want already subbed and so let's get in to the game Payet plays being hunted [Music] Captain Hook god
