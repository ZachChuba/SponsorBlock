are you tired of gaming and boring old 4k well this sucks i could barely even make out the individual pixels i'm even gonna know it's a video game are you tired of having all that extra money in your wallet introducing the new rtx 2060 the more expensive version of the gtx 1160 we accidentally leaked a few weeks ago now you can play all your compatible games at half the frame rate buy now awesome offer code linus to get 25 off below [Music] all kidding aside we've been pretty negative about product releases from nvidia lately and while it's good to get our frustrations out every once in a while it gets pretty boring if everything is crap you know so for this review i'm going to give the rtx 2060 every chance i can for it to impress me and i'm gonna try not to think too much about my problems with the rest of the rtx launches and that should be pretty easy on paper this thing actually has a lot going for it compared to the gtx 1060 it's got more cuda cores and way faster memory uh that is depending on which version of the card you get more on that later and that's to say nothing of the inclusion of the usb type-c based virtual link connector in fact the rtx 2060 looks more like a beefed up gtx 1070 which is great because it's priced that way too okay all right sorry i'm letting a little bit of salt seep in here but at 3 49 nvidia's newest real-time ray tracing accelerator is a cool hundo more than its direct predecessor 60-tier card anywho like the gtx 1070 we are down to one 8-pin pci express power connector and while our founders edition is still rocking the new rtx style dual fan cooler design we're treated to a smaller lighter card overall that on the surface looks a lot friendlier to small form factors than his bigger brothers in practice though this shorter pcb design ends up being less helpful than you'd think thanks to the rear position of the pci express power connector bummer partner boards don't have to end up that way though so all that really matters about our founders edition is how it performs since launching to uproarious applause rtx ray tracing and deep learning super sampling anti-aliasing have been hot new features announced for dozens of games so we should have plenty to look at now that it's been on the market for several months rats that was more salt there wasn't it but it's okay it's okay at least we have something to look at now the shadow of the tomb raider team's only birthday present to me ended up being empty promises but battlefield 5 and final fantasy xv respectively had support for these features though a new card supporting them doesn't tell us much that we didn't already know our fps is roughly halved for the privilege of turning rtx on which in this case unfortunately takes a gpu that is capable of playable frame rates at 4k medium settings and drops us to 1080p is the difference between 1080p and 4k that noticeable maybe not so much like we're really in the heat of battle but as we discussed in our recent video on resolution versus frame rate the inability to run at greater than 60 fps is going to put you at a competitive disadvantage in competitive games and that difference in resolution is noticeable in sightseeing titles as for dlss it performs pretty well but it's locked at 4k which means that this card translates to a passable score in the final fantasy 50 and benchmark it's not a great benchmark but it does show us a pretty representative performance difference between taa and dlss now whether or not you like the lss anyway and the shimmering that it retains on thin edges versus taa that's another story on to more traditional gaming scenarios the rtx 2060 runs significantly faster than the gtx 1070 a pretty solid place to be considering its similar specs and launch price directx 12 in particular exemplifies the improvements to a synchronous compute that turing brings to the table and as a result we've got a decent uplift pretty much across the board and the rtx 2060s prospects improve even further in our productivity suite where it beats out the gtx 1070 by a significant margin in luxmark and for that matter actually most workstation tasks budget workstation use actually might be this card's calling especially when you look at its performance across all but one test in specuperf now while we didn't run any deep learning tests today armchair ai researchers should directly benefit from the tensor course and the fact that the geforce rtx 2060 is the cheapest card that has them it should come as no surprise though but with all this tech packed into it power consumption is up along with thermal output showing us exactly why the card still rocks the dense fin arrangement and dual fan cooler design it's not terrible though because the thing about power and thermals is that you always have to look at it relatively and amd's closest performance competitor vega isn't even in the same ballpark helping matters further partner cards will probably have some interesting board layouts and cooling solutions that should make this a very versatile little gpu with all of that in mind who exactly is the rtx 2064 well at risk of sounding negative for the life of me i can't think of a reason to use its premiere feature you know the one that's printed several times on the card i mean even at medium settings it still halves your frame rate which is unacceptable for a competitive shooter like battlefield 5 especially if you use a high refresh rate monitor and yes dlss is faster than taa but that assumes that a 6 gig card can run future supported games in 4k well enough to even use the feature as for traditional rendering well it's faster than a gtx 1070 at a similar launch price but then you're paying a hundred dollar premium on a 60 series card compared to the previous 60 series anyway just for the privilege of that rtx badge that you're not using so the real conclusion here seems to be the one that we haven't been given the information to draw and that's that you should buy the rumored upcoming rtx list gtx 1160 that was leaked with otherwise identical specs now workstation performance seems really promising at first but the 1160 should come with the same benefits there as well unless you're into deep learning which leaves us today then with a card that occupies a tidy little decent gaming and also light workstation use niche until nvidia undermines its own product with a lower priced alternative so buy it quickly then to ensure that it's not irrelevant by the time it arrives oh but buy the right version because rumor has it there's three different memory configurations across three different capacities so your mileage may vary skillshare is an for free so go check it out so thanks for watching guys if you disliked
