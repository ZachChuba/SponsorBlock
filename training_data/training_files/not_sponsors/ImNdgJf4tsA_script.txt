- boy oh boy do we have an episode here for you today there's so much to talk about in so little time wouldn't you agree II love my beautiful co-host I choose to disagree why would you disagree with that you're saying that we have nothing to talk about and as much time as possible that doesn't even make that Dan in and Zack the team that could we like to defer them as they could do it all they make me look good well not always that kind of bothers me today's episode is sponsored by honey and rink and I also have a very exciting announcement let's hear it that there's a new teddy fresh

right ela no just in time for the holidays too now let's do a summary of our last episode was a somewhat hallmark episode of the h3 podcast and there was a lot of controversy surrounding it as well we had shoenice after much deliberation wondering should we have should we not have him well it finally happened and overall I have to say that seeing the fallout of this interview mate makes me think that it went pretty well because we got like a good set like at least a coherent isn't really even the right word but I mean somewhat presentable side of shoenice alright I we finally understand where the name comes from yeah I don't know if people knew it I didn't know he's the nice Shoei yeah his last name is chewy and he thinks his family's not nice but he's the nice he's the nice one who hate to see what his brothers are like here we go so let me let me show you guys kind of what happened in the aftermath of that interview but the reception in general was people saying that it was sad tragic entertaining but mostly sad lots of sadness and I mean I'm right there with them I yeah that guy's seen some [ __ ] man he's hit his head a bunch he's got brain damage he's been a he's had been addicted to every like opiates alcohol it sounds like his mom was a drunk yeah I was like he lost his family he's got no one they are long yeah disowning anymore something that dude was shooting from like a motel room and he hung up unexpectedly as they were coming to apparently install a TV but I've never heard of that happening at a motel have you no but I never lived in a hotel I don't know what that's like he's got to get in there somehow I guess no this video he uploaded what's this what's the timeline when did he look like the next day well yeah any morning yes and it wasn't an upload it was actually a livestream right and it was short I don't know how what order you want to tell this all in but this was shortly after I started to receive many emails from him ok so let me give some context yeah he took this video [ __ ] I guess way he took this down after 2 hours and in that time he changed the title five times the first title was we troll to h3 h3 8 and then the second one was h3 h3 podcast aftermath they love me in parenthesis then it took takes a turn Ethan from h3 h3 is a dick fourth one was h3 h3 and Ethan is worse than Ted B what does Ted be Ted Bundy right that that was my son is that like his his poltergeist Ted Bundy I guess that predates me and then finally h3h3 destroys of lives for monetary purposes and eventually so who caught all this changes yeah how did you catch all those because I only saw we troll at age 3 in a variety of ways I mean we were we found the video but then people were also posting it to the subreddit quite a bit and every time they would post it it was getting posted with a different title record yeah téa's did it's a real teamwork with I should before we watch this I should also show you the amount of emails we've got yeah alright the more like then got from him well I was on CC on all of them and but then I mean but there they wrecked it I've been anything else we've got just in the past let's see about a month or so but this bolt yeah but if you look from the 10th then he you got for yesterday and then this week alone looks like you got like 20 yeah it's fantastic [Music] he replied let's watch the video so here is his response to the interview a live stream two of two minutes in direction I present to you shoenice we did it guys we did it moocher old a tree three what a loser what a [ __ ] slob neck disrespects people like me uh uh I went even I went I will always want to get J 3 H 3 cuz that's who I am different I'm a legend and you got trolled a deal with it I will never support your channel or your legal you just disrespect me what did I do I don't understand what set him off I I don't know what he trolled either I thought we had a like these are great questions that we got that he got us to UM have him on and sympathize with him even though he secretly hates us or he hates us but he acted like I do believe this is my question no okay no baby go he's like is trying to create drama may you think so no then why would he be sending us hateful emails because he wants us to believe it hey you I mean it's a it's an interesting theory he's not a dumb dumb he's not stupid he just has a brain damage there's a difference apparently I've been snoring drain the wall day let's continue the loser Ethan fold you're a loser dude look into the eyes of the people yeah you pick on your [ __ ] podcast you ain't no better than the scum on the bottom of your night shoe this is such a joker memory cancer like you Ethan in the YouTube world and I'm so happy that I burned you and the biggest troll ever oh I Spit on your microphone your dogs I won't spin on ela she's beautiful I'll try by the way he always has reference for you after you burned him on Twitter because he wrote us some hate mail it hate email like really vicious hate you know and then at the end he said PS tell ill I love her I think she'll leave you for me someday I just feel like your spirit is further than yours you're straight-up scum Ethan and you'll never ever ever get better I need to until you shut your trap and let people talk when you're interviewing them he had a good night that your buddy was loving where he told me to he said Ethan you're always interrupting people and everyone thought that was like a great moment for sure nice and so I think he's really running with that mm-hmm trap and let people talk when you're interviewing you ain't nobody your eyebrows are just [ __ ] like me I pretend not to blink and you pretend like you can't stop moving your eyebrows hence the pure scum Ethan and I'm hope you I hope you see this video I'm gonna go take a nap but before I do kiss my ass [ __ ] kiss my ass Ethan you're nothing eight three eight Street ah shoenice for life I got you I got you like a [ __ ] scrub neck sick DISA toe so he just came on election for two minutes I don't know what I did I thought we had a good time and not take a nap after that because the emails continued what did I do to deserve this shoe nice but this is the thing with your scrub neck scrub neck total scumbag I love how it goes come back I really do like the way he talks he's kind of eloquent in a weird way he goes your total you're a total scam Ethan like so such disappointment you're a total scumbag Ethan he was beautiful though so are your feelings hurt no but this is why I was worried to have Shu nice first of all besides having him on I'm glad we did the Skype interview but this was why I was so worried to have him in the studio cuz you all joked and laughed at me about bringing him in and a straitjacket like Hannibal Lecter but I just I think he's too unpredictable his moods and his personalities on day to day he loves me and then I get like I get really bad vibes from him on other days so I don't know I mean ultimately this is a man and suffering there's a man in pain I don't know do you think that what do you think should we not be even be broadcasting she oh nice content I do think that it gives him joy in life that he's at least because I mean he's posting all the time on YouTube he's he's craving attention and yeah and views frankly an audience so I think that ultimately it does make him very happy to be included but at the same time he is not well so what do you do about that mm-hmm that's a good question I think it's fine because I mean obviously at least we can keep an eye on him one we keep an eye on him too he makes a little cameo money three you know I feel like this was an act like he's just it could be that that could be till certainly could be he erased the video though why would he erase the video that's part of is a method actor yes so dedicated let's see we got comments on his video he was responding to people good troll next next one ever it took years he said this this may be why he was angry he said [ __ ] don't even offer me twenty dollars for a bag of weed I know that coming [ __ ] got paid of course referring to Whitney Cummings our previous guest who by the way did not get paid shoenice we don't pay our guests but I'd be happy to send you twenty bucks I don't think anyone guess shows like this that's not a thing well people usually are coming on here to promote something so if anything if anything I've heard of the opposite where they'll pay to get on a show definitely is the exposure yeah and moreover I mean I think that basically was our understanding with Shue is that he wanted to come on because he was rebuilding his channel after it right the woman got deleted so I mean at at least at some point there was an understanding that that was the benefit of coming on and he didn't gotta but he got a big subscriber boost from oh he did oh he did yeah did you change over 100k no hmm so why you been striving for a long time you think he was in the immediate after we should buy some cameos from him and see how those go you should buy a meal he spoke he continues Ethan is the most annoying dude with a microphone on YouTube I always hated Ethan my greatest role ever I think to troll you would have have to have you pretended to like me the whole time he never has changed that soon Ethan has destroyed so many YouTube channels but never touch mine next time Ethan ela come on my [ __ ] podcast there you have it folks thank you nice up to his regular antics you know I will say on a positive note I was looking through Sean Isis old backlog and I have to give it up to our boy shoe I found this video and and Zach this is gonna make you blush is gonna make you feel insecure our boy shoe nice slams 20 ounces of mayonnaise in less than a minute and I thought this was very relevant to what we do on this show so one shoot I say got we got a walk basically I'm gonna bring back some of the stunts that nobody could ever be me at one of them was slamming mayonnaise either way this is 20 ounces I'm gonna put the tap back on I'm gonna skip ahead to the a spoon for you add 20 ounces back watch closely now in 24 hours no I'll start look how he just takes it down boy like that's that I ever seen that's the best food dude that's shoenice right there dude that's so gross he's just pouring it in his mouth and like he's basically not even swallowing it's just it's just pouring down his throat a whole non-stop stream and I like how it cleans up his like chin as dude I mean what are you guys how are you guys feeling to this I'm not watching come on what I watched the first 20 seconds and I've had enough all his grunting come on you're not even sporting it in your mouth the least you could do is watch Zach are you feeling insecure I mean all the crazy [ __ ] this guy does it looks like you struggled the most with his vanity like with the Half Dome oh I think it's pretty inspiring to be honest yeah I don't know what to say I mean if he just keeps going and eating crazy [ __ ] I think I think people will always watch but he just he goes on all these weird tangents of like shoenice ASMR I mean I'm serious he did a shoenice ASMR Channel he did like I mean what is this thumbnail Twizzlers candy eating h3 inspired no blinking you guys know what this thumbnail is what is that does anybody know is that him oh maybe it is paper clipping maybe he was in a newspaper my god he was like a handsome young man he looks jacked well he was yeah that does look like him actually shoenice to whistlers candy eating h3 inspired no blinking you guys want to watch this everyone shoot ice again well basically I'll join your minotaurs miss gatina you guys get kid yeah there you go he still hasn't blinked his eyes are watery no looks like he's just chewing on a organ cuz it's all been red and bloody yeah okay so shoenice so I don't know I mean I've I do I want to keep including Shu nights in the in the podcast I think he's an interesting addition but ultimately I guess we'll have to wait and see what are your thoughts either I don't take it seriously when he liked that stream and those emails but I don't know hard to say like that take some there was lots of memes on the subreddit regarding I feel like when we saw him during the interview that was the real him right I hope so I think if anything that that being mean is the acting she nice is at home like finally somebody understands me he's getting deeper and deeper in love with you you know but he claims he trolled to you guys how did he control you Adam unclear on I guess the troll is that he hates us anybody yeah that he secretly hates us but he didn't say it but then why wouldn't he just say it when he was on the podcast right that would be a troll of yeah in the end he put up us well it wasn't live so he really couldn't troll us if it was live he could like put up a sign that said like some awful something awful I don't know could show his dick it was live there was meme reactions of course on the subreddit reddit.com SAR slash HDTV productions this is a picture of Ian looking revolted me during the shoenice interview this was my favorite YouTube since these little surveys on videos what did you think of this video it's the shoenice episode please tell us why it says calming and life-changing I love that like they even have life change yeah life can't think of one YouTube changing except the shoenice podcast these things and this episode too is life-changing Theodore last time Ethan upload on the faint gentle baby Yoda Theodore now really it's been like five months shoenice on the podcast fans ethan trying to salvage the episode h3 starter pack chomp chomp slurp munch ela I'm over it dan do we have chips sorry to interrupt Zach Arby's yes Ethan I gotta pee so bad kawaii F shredder and Alfredo there was a special moment in that last episode with shredder and Alfredo fighting in the back of the the couch I didn't see it but I heard it was very cute they do do that all the time Ethan tries to understand why shoenice is laughing uncontrollably shoenice it you wouldn't get it it's like - so what keeps you up at night me the picture is nice dying on the Reese's that was like I think it's farcical I am so that was one of the best look at that face somebody wants to know what how Oliver tree is been breeding with little chickens because they have bold cuts that really beautiful bowl cut this this one I'm gonna need your guys's help to figure this one um this one was on our subreddit with 12,000 points and as far as I can tell it's not related at all to h3 h3 and I frankly don't even understand what's so appealing about it never forget when Akon performed in Africa and didn't want to get a bowl it's just him in a you know a bubble he's in a bubble and he's getting likes crowd surfing in a bubble and they have any context I I got no clue this had 12,000 points I looked it up this happened in 2014 it's not even like a recent occurrence I mean it's funny it's funny but it just I don't know if it's 12,000 up votes funny but and also how did he even get like the first hundred because it's just what so I mean irrelevant but wait is that a true story I don't think they get Ebola he's just performing I've seen other artists do that bubble thing it's just they just do it for fun I would assume that people in the audience do not have Ebola hope that would be it that would be bad well there you have it that wow there's more there's a whole nother folder it this I don't have this article is real but what do you got there EULA confirming that he did that he said specifically because he didn't want to get Ebola yeah I don't think that even makes sense because it's not a closed ecosystem unless he would run out of oxygen I come performed in a bubble Africa to avoid contracting Ebola but still what's the relevance it's you know despite being born in st. Louis Akon considers Africa to be his home so when he performs in large outdoor spaces I feel like this is not this campus I see I see a few articles for that one debunking that though I can't imagine like even if that was just aa process there's no way he would give an interview like yeah I just I'm doing this so I don't yeah this article that I found it has links to other artists doing the same thing oh not in Africa is there anything in the comments about wises here no I don't have the thread why did everyone why was it run okay with that being there and I didn't erase it either cuz like you know I don't want to rain on people's parade it was obviously performing so well yeah I had the same experience I saw it when I had like 9,000 of folks yeah I went to remove it I'm like but I don't know I hate when mods do that where it's like something's blowing up and they're like irrelevant yeah it's kind of like this one really doesn't make sense anyway there's more memes back me up here guys the guys the comments that was when we were talking about looking at Instagram people had a curiosity in the comments back from me a big time you guys left me in the trench taking grenades time to sleep yes it's a disability mobility scooter I guess they here's Ethan that's poor me Dan Zack and kicking me while I'm down comments coming to give me a hug oh yeah he'll is giving actually kicking me sugar girls one there I wipe my ass with soap Zack rest again whatever so this is some kind of should we move on I feel like you seem to get really dull so in the comments on that thread they were just talking about it there's no nobody acknowledged that it's on our subreddit how many points does it up now it's almost 13 okay it really doesn't have that many comments for how many it's just bizarre all right let's move on barely gotten through this episode like I got out of the [ __ ] that talking about for example McDonald's fights we got to set the record straight we've been giving Popeyes a lot of [ __ ] for we've been saying oh they're so violent well Dan of course the devil's advocate came out the Woodworks is like well actually people fight at McDonald's too it's true now for I have to say you didn't really change my mind that Popeyes isn't the most violent because these you there's like four clips here over like decades I've got 10 there's a subreddit dedicated of Popeyes violence in the last two weeks that's fair but I do want to point out i those i found that in all of like five minutes of looking like that's how easy it was but not that's probably mcdonalds fights because the papa power violinist [ __ ] the popular thing is new so this one's actually too violent to show but it's in a McDonald's and there's a quite a few of them on our actual there's actually a hundred people and I'm wondering why is there so many people McDonald's it's like a total street brawl inside McDonald's with the real cube this one is the guy who pulls out a red yeah yeah and then and then somebody I'll show the raccoon part it's just yeah it is very violent areas see here I'll just show you guys the part with the raccoon but you can see look how many people are McDonald's what the hell I've seen remember in New York the McDonald's was always like that packed hmm I guess you're right yeah if it's in like a really urban play yeah but even that damn man how does so many people get in a fight at McDonald's anyway homie on the Left cruises in without some kind of any sharing I wish I could show this to guys but it's honestly too violent to even entitle man gets punched that that ones honestly just too violent to see they're not that oh so these are pretty violent yeah the only one that I think we could watch was the regular day at McDonald's which I did enjoy this one let's enjoy this one together shall we they're just throwing like a french fry tray at each other back and forth it's also they're not fighting they're just the rowing of like french fry tray at each other so I pick those french fries buns everywhere it's pay off it's just it's just one [ __ ] week one worker and one get off we're having like ultimate PD yeah just do another tray on a Mac like ten employers proffered somebody will be better at a fish with Popeye dan you can't talk Popeye Samoa stabbed to death there I mean you're skipping some of these no the next one is a guy gets punched through a [ __ ] glass yeah that one was intense here I'll play it so that you got a hit here just the audio alone so I'll describe what's happening so apparently the the employ the McDonald's employee was starting beef with with this guy and the guy throws him through a window though McDonald's yeah the guy actually pretty great like this guy thinks he can take him and he starts pulling as he tries to push him and he realized - he's way out of his league like watch he doesn't even move in then he goes for his hair he's just balling his hair and now he just the roses asked to a [ __ ] window that was a clean knock out that was a clean apparently nothing happened like that maybe was ruled self-defense cuz the other guy attacked him what if he just got the work kept working at McDonald's no not the employee though but do you think he kept his job oh that's a good question I would think he would get fired for that so there you have it then you got your I'm just saying you like the new kid on the block but this is all because of the sandwich that we're seeing this this surge I know McDonald's has been here for decades people don't people who die over Matt over over Big Macs honestly hmm no you wouldn't he look oh I just started well I just remembered I was watching this documentary about the CEO key it was really interesting on Netflix he's like started hot yoga and he was just like raping all of his students Bikram yoga yeah yeah yeah yeah he's like the gnarliest dude it's really interesting not funny but it's funny cuz it's so shocking because everyone's like dude every time there's this guy who's like I'm the Messiah and yeah the guy that you need to listen to he's raping somebody every time just know that going into anything if there's this big personality he's got all these followers all these worshippers he's raping somebody there [Music] it's really interesting don't want to I didn't get to finish it it's interesting Allah said McMuffin and then that like jumped in your head right that was like your first thought yeah didn't know why - with getting fat and then maybe that somehow associated with yoga trying to lose weight all right it's a break time it is we'll be right back guys after this commercial break short quick entertaining funny hilarious don't skip their surprises throughout we'll be here take your time watch every minute go to link buy the [ __ ] that's there teddy fresh calm in time for the holidays see you guys in a minute that's ring comm /h 3 additional terms may apply we are back we are back back back back dan just fat shamed me oh wow how dare you I didn't we're ordering veggie grill I've been so good I've been losing weight people everybody's telling me that I look skinnier I do think you're losing weight well I've been vegetarian for two weeks but on the feeding window for a month I think I really started losing it when I went vegetarian interesting but I like being a vegetarian but anyway we're all done from veggie girl for everybody and Dan goes I ordered the impossible burger the mondo nachos and the Far East Bowl because I couldn't decide what I wanted and then goes Wow dude really [ __ ] you Dan bro you don't know me I want a feeding window my window is open you're characterizing it that you couldn't decide wow that's not that's why I got all three that's the thing we sometimes we like to get backup options backup if you don't like something it happens to me so many times well order food and then I don't like it and then I'm just starving the backup option is real you don't know anything about me Dan you don't know what my eating habits are like and by a way must I remind you that the feeling window is currently open on when it's closed there's no food what Eva said makes sense but you you said you got the burger last time and it didn't do it for you yes on you so right so don't have anything you would not like but I think if french fries my dad had a friend though his name was mondo what's his last name nacho mondo is that an Israeli name it's the weird one Israel it's weird maybe must be a NIC shirt for Armando I don't think there's not an ID on't know that one Hispanic person actually you had a Hispanic cousin true he's adopted right yeah but Armando is not really a name you come across in Israel no fair enough well even if he's adopted his name's probably like each mila what's his real name what's a classic is really named Alec I'm not gonna be I mean dude Cybertron oh I also have good news about the weight loss pursuing that the bidet I've been using them a day and I don't wipe anymore don't use toilet paper I caught you in action today we were getting ready for the podcast and we were late and I and I know that anything was supposed to like be ready and I hear all this water I thought likewise taking a shower now yeah how do I show this and then I realize it's Debbie day I don't know if I can't show this whole thing but phenomena pian you know record me without me knowing the water was so loud yeah we can hear it but we didn't hear Ethan's response because he talked over according I thought we were just having a laugh go violate it a little bit but here's the thing and your brother raised his points me and I thought it was smart well how I was using the bidet before is that I was wiping and then when I would usually go for a baby wipe I will go for the bidet he says when you wipe you're basically just smearing [ __ ] all over your [ __ ] if you go with the chunks intact the bidet is more effective because it just kind of cuz you're basically painting your [ __ ] right over this though well I agree made me a little something I agree but he was right he was right and so I went and I sat on the bidet like full chunks that's too gross I agree it's disgusting but this you need to hear the thing about the bidet in our bathroom is that you can you're facing the wall so you're looking at the drain you could see everything going down the drain and you can see [ __ ] chunks going down the tree this is not our bathroom anymore it's your bathroom and I don't even step in there ever since you're using the B day well you have your own bathroom I can't even walk into that room I invited you to use it I'm surprised you're so grossed out I don't know it's just the whole earth what's wrong with those [ __ ] today dude but yeah there was [ __ ] I could see SH like [ __ ] chunks it's [ __ ] crazy and then I didn't actually ask me if I want to see him in action well that was after I was already I just wanted you to see the posture that you don't want to see it no I'm just gonna leave the door open to watch but anyway I did that I didn't wipe and I just sat and I let it go obviously I'm not gonna go about my day after that I need to make sure the clean was efficient I got a baby wipe afterwards and I went in and it was clean man it was spotless so the baby wipe I was a test that was a just a test but it was spotless mm-hmm it was pretty amazing man I didn't have to put my hand in my [ __ ] at all at any point during the poop transaction exited my body and there was no hand to ask that's the thing about soaping the butthole I just don't I know a lot of people voice their concern that I'm that that's a common thing to do with the voice the the soap in the bot hole I just don't see the need to soap the [ __ ] clean there's no purpose for soaping the [ __ ] clean folks it's better not to put your hand there at all you're the one I can't believe that you feel that way after you're the one that's been saying for years now that it's like you have to wipe like 50 times I'm never putting my hand in my [ __ ] do you understand the baby wipe it's go tween my hands but I'm never dude I the baby wipes is between my hand and apparently the soap is between no that's your bare hand on your bare [ __ ] that [ __ ] just gave you can cause bear if it's covered in soap from what I understand you use the soap no that's ridiculous you can't you can't just take a bar so people said they use liquid soap oh yeah that's what I'm saying you can't take a bar soap and like just hit your o-ring alright Zach no be alright people say they use they use a liquid soap okay most people are saying these liquid soap is that or is that not hor yeah we got many responses from mostly European fans you know those normal you know those little things that like I use them a lot for Theodore's bottles it's like a little thing it's like a little metal hook with bristles so you can get in tight places that's what I use my [ __ ] you know what I'm saying like a little hole and you got to that's what I use maybe too much you're laughing though I am I said lady but I'm not sure that it's too much I don't get the liquid soap I just don't but regardless I didn't wipe I exited clean no need to [ __ ] soap my [ __ ] I shower every day I'll soap my [ __ ] at that point but I don't need to touch my [ __ ] can we just say less [ __ ] like butthole oh ring just don't say it oops exit poop chute lube it garage poop the poop hangar the poop the poop Park the poop coaster so that I thought was interesting and important information to share so with that being said let's move it on cyber truck what do you guys think about the cyber trucks truck this is very device I get it this [ __ ] was honestly I wasn't sure if it was a joke or not is this the truck that they've been teasing yeah oh so there's no pickup truck it's just the cyber suit oh I see why people are disappointed because they want it was trying to say man they all wanted a pickup truck but they got this this is the pickup truck but who said that that one is not coming this is it well this is it I mean they've got the truck bill for a year and yeah the event so well let's take a look let's order it and I like how long it is so I was looking for some exciting car you know and there it came just as I was looking only a hundred bucks that's that's crazy so if you get the tri-motor it's seventy thousand dollars five hundred mile range fourteen thousand pounds towing capacity though like I could tell you yeah that's like 3 mese I think and 0 to 60 in 2.9 seconds I don't know man it I like it I'll tell you why I like it ok it's different every truck on the road looks the same so boring the cars today are so boring they've got this electric technology they could do all this crazy [ __ ] I like the cyber truck I like it that's what I said I like it I feel like it no matter your budget there's not that many interesting options to to go with a car and you know I've heard a lot of people saying that the the rednecks or whatever you want to say that people who are stereotypical truck drivers wouldn't want this but I disagree this is like a badass Humvee military-grade vehicle that you can [ __ ] [ __ ] up in and run all our hippies like Danone please I don't think so I think that would have been a good strategy no cuz it doesn't look like a military vehicle at all looks like a cyberpunk like Eadie's sci-fi movie of the I like it I'm in I appreciate their doing something different I think people are gonna learn to love it too you think you're misunderstanding Zack okay so Zack genuinely hates it I don't actually hate it but I think that the target demographic of who they would want to sell this to is going to does when they want to sell them what do you like I think people are gonna want this [ __ ] thing III understand and appreciate the whole it looks different it's a new aesthetic most cars look the same this is striving to do something new I think that's cool absolutely but on a practical level this is a terrible it's electric first of all because it's supposed to be a pickup truck no I'm gonna buy a terrible pickup truck I'm gonna buy this how do you know you could probably remove the back so yeah because that would make it a lot more useful well it slides open but if you if you pull it up the angles around the truck bed you see how it slopes videos like if this piece was gone and it was just an open bed that would be cool or I think yeah completely but they big more to the problem they must have that option available you know to my car isn't gonna come out for a few years so they might end up yeah changing it yeah I think you should be able to have the option to include this piece or not because if you remove this and you have really have a badass I want that piece you want Eva wants then it looks like a DeLorean SUV okay like a Back to the Future as everybody agrees that Laurie is the coolest [ __ ] car ever whoa but like it looks like a concept car like it looks unfinished I mean someone had a great finish to me you know this episode of Simpsons where Homer got the designer that's what everybody's comparing it to Homer Simpson car you know that episode EULA Helmer find out he has a twin brother who's like a prolific car maker and then he lets Homer make a car and it takes the company classics yeah that's basically you on lost its beholder that being said I will buy this car here this was funny they were saying that it's got a miniature boat windows and this guy threw like a softball man he didn't wind up you could tell but I don't care about that that's something they can work on well I don't know how they [ __ ] up how did they oh he threw it again and it broke let's go down on this now okay this guy's hating by the way whose Twitter feed on he barely threw it he loved it do a demo you better goddamn make sure so I wanna [ __ ] that if you're gonna do this don't do it at the top of the demo so that is just sitting there for the next 45 that's something that will be easy to fix them a window ya know if you're dead know using this in no write them until until it comes out oh this is the man I traded window yeah that's easy to fix dan why are you hating on a window what it is fine but Ian likes it oh yeah and what do you think about it I mean I think it's really cool there you go and uh he decides what's cool I just like the the fact that this conversation is happening makes me like the car I like things that make people talk and it's not boring like every man that Kanye West exactly yes after your easy this is impressive though you have to admit sledgehammer stainless steel one more time now why really wind up the people not audience or such fanboys whoa if you get like a pain on that like they put paint a black color white one it's gonna [ __ ] up the pain yeah but I think that's like it's supposed to come with them yeah I think it's supposed to come all [ __ ] like rough metal I like the rough metal I do too yeah there's homework because I was looking you know our conversation about vintage cars I'm just looking for something exciting and but when I keep looking at when I kept looking into those old cars everything that comes with it it's gonna be such a headache like going to a gas station example and then we'll that's the Lisa words fixing it making sure it works all the time okay that is like no oh look at that mutt that bike dude wait wait yeah it was open there yeah was open Dan no it's not the top that opens it's the side panels you see how it comes up on the side I'm gonna keep it don't move what do you mean like on the truck bed it keeps moving Danny now a normal truck bed it's like flat but this has the triangular piece that's going up on the side well that's it so you can't easily load it from the side which is so like I feel like that probably they probably would make that so you could fall they could address that I see what you're saying though but most people voted from the back No yeah I'm just not a truck you but knowing their cars it's all about function so yeah they'll figure it I feel like that would be the fact I when they revealed it I thought this thing was about to come out I've since seen that this is not gonna be out for another two years it's probably gonna change significantly especially since it got quite a bit of backlash not real I mean it was trending number one and trending in the world like everybody what do you think I mean talking about it sure hello let's split I saw people loving it and I saw people hating it I agree that a lot of people are liking it I just I wonder how many people that actually buy and use pickup trucks are the ones well I am going to put a deposit so it's got a hundred on it it's only a hundred reserve little scam on fit bucks like that's that you'll never get this here's the thing too is the whole cool thing about the Tesla's originally is that they made it kind of like a sports car right and it and it sold a lot of people that were iffy on electric cars I'm like it made electric cars sexy and now they make this pickup truck and you'd think they'd want to do the same thing for pickup truck drivers which you know or like farmers or workers and those kind of people but people like big [ __ ] trucks they put nuts on the back you know what I mean it's like [ __ ] you truck I could be wrong but I just don't think that that mountaintop and call it a day have you seen the let's talk about the people that are here in the room that are going to buy it I mean I think would not want a truck how about that right I mean it could yeah I think Dan I think we like a truck I think in LA you'll see a lot of goobers in it but I agree in the country I don't know I don't know if people in the Midwest are gonna be interested in this that's all I'm fine I think they might so fortunate because those people think that electric cars are stupid and I it would have been cool if they have made something that could sell those people on an electric car and I don't think this is gonna sell him it did tank I was the stock is not doing so hot today actually buy the diff can get a 30 day honestly today might be the day to pick up some Tesla season are misleading but you know they probably were aware of that and they thought well if we just make a normal pickup truck I think people aren't gonna want to compare we have to do something different something revolutionary we need to take the pickup truck and send it tomorrow take it back senator senator to the center of the universe Elon Musk it up forget about it but some armored doors and windows on it and then all of a sudden you know they got this roadster coming out yeah if they have made the Roadster look like that like a sick like a tease but futuristic version of like a DeLorean or whatever I'd be totally awesome this is just a shitty design for a pickup truck the roadster well this one does start at 40,000 though 40,000 that's incorrect I did some compare it's okay it what surprises me electric it's electric yeah but the towing capacity for an equivalent priced you know traditional combustion engine pickup truck it's not very good how much do you pay on Gaston hmm sure but I'm just talking you know again this is people that actually use their trucks for work so if you're towing stuff and you need to tow something really heavy well it this isn't necessarily the best option either I guess it's it's yeah that's true but it is electric that is a big thing and the one that goes I mean one does go 500 miles or something on a single charge that's pretty that's what they say I mean right now the biggest better they have goes you know 370 mm but this doesn't come out for two years so they're like they did that on the on the Roadster - they're like this will have a thousand mile charge it's like yeah where's the thousand mile charge dude but you know I have to admit when I first saw this I I mean I'm still not 100% convinced that this is a real car I mean so there you have it you love it you hate it or you think it's okay but I do take you seriously that she'll buy this I am I believer you'll put the adorn and it's like now I will probably be cool but I just don't think that ELA Kline was like who they had in mind oh so maybe but I'd be I mean it could be like you know in LA you see everyone riding around those Mercedes G wagons exactly it's gonna be exactly like that but that's gonna be able to wrap I mean that's good for them because that G wagons are successful car for Mercedes yeah but that one is designed to be it's not trying to be more that's a high beast car right exact nobody tows anything in that car right even though it does have incredible capacity what do you know it's that one that you like I was like I like that car it was like I like that car and I'm like yes it's pretty cool let's check it out and I'm like dude it's a hundred and seventy thousand dollars yeah but video and it gets like 50 billion is what I hate is that that you're gonna have to go to the gas station like once every three days mileage on that thing is insanely bad dude we don't go to the gas station I've been in a gas station in like three years dude that's pretty sick yeah on top of it's a really beautiful car too but anyway that's here I'm ride-or-die Elon Musk I'm Mustang shout-out to heal on he's probably got a huge one to like he's probably got a huge one dude [ __ ] rock just looked up the G Wagen has a 26 gallon tank for gas that's [ __ ] insane what's the mileage on the G Wagon yeah it's something it's laughs 13 dude yeah 13 yeah I guess you need that big tank with the kid 14 13 that's pretty bad actually it starts at 1:30 but you know with all the options and [ __ ] it ends up well they make one with a supercharged engine that's the G 63 oh well G 63 wagon so that one's gonna have even worse mileage in 63 around 200 okay thing as [ __ ] though what's the mileage on that dirty [ __ ] oh it's apparently has better mileage fourteen one killing it for comparison my Tesla has a hundred for comparison wait 100 what like the equivalent oh em gee yeah yeah pretty good yes I agree Dan how many miles can you go and your test like 303 a mile the nuance now Cove 3 370 mines 3 years old for the new ones now they upgraded the battery pretty cool I'm not I'm not even a Tesla hater I like them your card I'll cater I get it of course awesome I just am NOT uh not impressed by this thing but like you said if you slap like a machine gun on the back or something sure yeah dude you just dropped that in Iraq see people have already edited it to be like a warthog from Halo it's pretty awesome that's true I see the resemblance well let's move it on we will follow this story very closely we're gonna have a hundred dollars invested so I'm gonna hold his feet to the fire okay we got news guys half life is happening they released the trailer half-life 3 except it's not three because valve is such an [ __ ] they had to go back in time to make a prequel the half-life 2 to avoid making half-life 3 mm hmm because their whole legacy is that they don't they will never make a 3-game they've only ever made up to twos and so they've gone completely out of their way to avoid making half-life 3 but goddamn it there's a new game out half-life Alex and this is NVR only the trailer is I got so hype dude I mean dude oh this is gonna be so intense I mean unless you've played a modern VR system like vive I mean it gets so intense in there I can't even imagine I think I'm just gonna lose my mind in this thing I don't know if I'm gonna be able to complete the game because I'm I think I'll have a heart attack okay afterwards seriously let's watch the trailer so you'll see the hand like that the the valve penny called the index it actually tracks your fingers and the [ __ ] yeah good so what's the plan this takes place between half-life and half-life I'm with you every step of the way traffic to the mania don't worry it's unloaded it's unloaded now a plastic valve only this is me so Oh they've got dad they're gonna find out what he knows and then they're gonna kill us about the graphics I think it's hard to get it it's hard to really get a feel for it but I think it looks great you have to appreciate that this is a 3d world so it's even hard I know hard yeah it's kind of hard until you see it that way I guess but when you're rendering an entire 3d world at the same time it's even more difficult to make it in a way that runs smoothly because there's so much more going on you mean because of that it's VR yeah there's just there's more to process sure in a 3d world I think the art direction looks great me too I'm like the I I'm a huge fan of the half-life game so I mean this is crazy though people are gonna like so you need an empty room you need of index which cost a thousand dollars you need like a three thousand dollar gaming computer people are gonna be mortgaging their houses yeah you can't use it with with like the oculus and the vive and stuff yeah you can use it but those are expensive vive yeah the windows mixed reality oculus rift those are all thousand-dollar no no I think those are like two or three hundred bucks only the index is the one that's crazy the vibe was it that Orlov five six I think it's come way down in the last year or two I hope the index is Wireless but it tracks your fingers oh oh I can beat off in with a virtual dick in Windows Dragon by Marlies 100 so I guess yeah the vibe was expensive March 2020 that is right around the goddamn corner one of the top comments was so fun and they go up people used to laugh about gamers that would buy a system for an exclusive just for one game now people are buying houses for half-life you know I'm not gonna preorder it though I'm gonna be honest with you guys I'm gonna wait and I'm gonna see what's the reception no one should ever pre-order anything yeah but like I'm not gonna be a day one buyer I'll be like a one week buyer cuz I mean like the difference because I want to make sure it's a good game before I like [ __ ] up my house and get like a view I don't know that though or I mean every valve game that's come out is always like the best game of the century I remember when the orange box came out everyone was like dude this is stupid it had the new half life it had portal all my favorite stuff it had like Team Fortress classic it was so outrageous so maybe they'll do the same thing here you know but have you played the valve games in VR like they had this one the little games you've played them there yeah they're cool there's one where you like they're all inside kind of the half-life poor universe mm-hmm have you played everything you guys played those new this came out like three years ago and even then it's breathtaking yeah and by far I've played a lot of VR games because I have a vibe by far the best VR I've ever experienced was what valve made three years ago so you can bet your ass this game is gonna be like nothing anyone's ever played weeds yeah if we should set it up here I like that idea hang it up here what am I gonna do with that come on we can do something with it yeah you want to somehow make content with it or you just want to share the love just share there Thursday our love she doesn't want you converting yeah I'm like what are you getting at no I just thought we have an extra room you know here I want to play it I want to play it I don't want their eye herpes dude that's the thing I don't think you guys have eye herpes by thank it was like a hundred people Justin was saying at gaming conventions where they pass around VR headsets they were spawning new diseases like eye herpes what cuz people kept taking off and putting on their now goes you knows all these crazy eye diseases going around including eye herpes so there you have it so be careful who you share your headset with what else is there to say about half-life Alex I wonder if like like let's watch this trailer closely really cuz I am I have some concern like four for one I don't like VR when you have to stand up and walk around did we talk about this last time mm-hmm it's got to be sitting but then here they say the movement can be either teleport shifting yeah zoom with point a P like how are you or continuous how are you going to teleport and half-wave like so that doesn't make sense to me I talked to a buddy of mine that has a VR thing to ask him what that all meant and I guess that is common in these kind of first-person perspective I know but it's not good I've played games like that basically what happens is you like find where you want to move and then you like hit a trigger and you teleport right but how the how is that gonna work in half-life why it just doesn't feel right like if you're being chased by creatures you're gonna teleport away it's like well they said that you can do full control with the with like a thumb stick yeah but when you can teleport why would you use a thumb stick for the reason you just said because the teleporting sucks right I don't like it then I don't like it and then here's another thing I'm worried about is it that you wish that you could like fully be walking around no I think it should just be you have to use one way or the other it should say should decide what's the best way to do it oh I see which is probably thumb stick walking cuz that's probably the way I would want to do it it's just that son closest to the traditional way of playing these kind of games so I see that they built it for the hand fees in the game for example like here they're like moving [ __ ] out of the way and grabbing ammo yeah I'm not gonna go for school but a might is that gonna be so tedious that I'm have to be like hitting everything off the shelf looking for ammo I mean to me that seems like the biggest appeal gears can be doing this the whole time not being every really stupid boy you play but yeah but it's just gonna be like the part at the end of the trailer where she like move stuff aside finds a single bullet that's loaded and everything I mean that concerns me Oh to me this was the coolest part of the trailer this is the part where I was like I'm [ __ ] sold it looks cool but it concerns me you know what I mean it just depends on how well it's done yeah and I mean they always do everything especially because they've waited this long to make it I feel like they didn't have any pressure to release it they would they wouldn't notice it unless it was good I think they've been working on this the whole time I have friends who know people involved who have told me years ago that they were making a vr half-life yeah it's been rumored for for a good long time but I think they've they've probably started and stopped it a dozen times at this point and just now they finally felt like hey this works this is good let's go with it mmm can't wait I was hyped this [ __ ] up yep when I saw that ela raised a good point too she likes to watch me play video games so how is that gonna work you can still see it on the screen you see what it's not the same time not the same is there not like an observed I want him to get a second headset yeah that's what I can be in there with me dude I don't think alright that's that what else czn is a thief a criminal and a con did you get the did you get the veggie grill down where yeah I just ordered a good you get everything I asked for but wait what did you ask for again mando nacho we're fun possible burger what did everyone else get everybody else got one item yeah and what did they get either got a burger you get french fries now this nah brah I don't eat french fries what I got her the roasted broccoli and then the Far East Bowl that's again yeah a super taco salad for Zach here cheesesteak sandwich it's like a Philly cheese can you throw one of those in there for me as much for that as ever all yeah Teddy fresh calm new collection is out now czn is a thief and a criminal and we have turned on czn that's the turkish chef that we've been in love with it let me show you what I'm talking about now this is a video that was on our document last week they don't have time to get to his incredible Chinese chef he he's on tick tock I've been finding a lot of interesting Chinese chefs on tick tock and the reason they use tick tock is because it's owned by China and they don't let you use any other [ __ ] social medias what do you really yes they can't use any other they can't use Twitter they can't use Facebook they can't use Instagram they can't even use Google or YouTube so they're like tick tock tick tock Rachel yes the dog Oh pick dog on Americans it was made by Americans it was made by Americans they made the voice tick tock Chinese people are not very offended I feel like we can make fun of the Chinese we love the Chinese here at the HD podcast anyway this guy's awesome he shouts he screams he does it all and this video is incredible and there's no audio there's no audio why the [ __ ] isn't there any [ __ ] audio audio what do you are you hopeful to do is that commuted it cuz there's music isn't that [ __ ] music okay well just lose a lot of the effectiveness without his screaming they don't you want to risk it well let me hear it for like a second let's go oh okay turn it off what do you think about that either that sounds risky it's just like that boom boom boom boom maybe if we talk over it it won't get claimed if we just kind of like yeah here's a mob okay let me watch he goes I'm just I'm imitating him because you can't hear his voice okay now listen wait up up up up here please voice well do what he's talking now what it's music here goes ready and good wait he that he yells that's his shtick I'm not making it up dude you come on you [ __ ] with me come on okay here let's find a moment where before he talks it's a disaster this is good [ __ ] we're on the back end okay Sam you have the music on he said I'm not how am I being Rachel I'm literally saying what he said so I'll just do the voice from okay no addicted the tire off I put it on a rotisserie I've got two rotisserie zon the tires it stopped working the internet went out it went out I think it just coming back starting and stopping it so much what is this okay here we go I'm taking the tire off I'm putting on a rotisserie I've two rotisserie it's rotating now I put a whole [ __ ] and on it and two animals cook it more Shh charcoal in anyway anyway he's turning the wheels they're cooking over an open flame it's pretty cool so how does this work he's pushing the gas yeah someone's in the car I think or you know yeah something like that cruise control it's lifted and now he's literally has a mop look like boiled and he's just brushing it with a [ __ ] motto epic look at that the guy's such a legend he's just pouring salt on it what do you say huh yeah and he's cooking over an open flame it's it's awesome he's the only one in the middle of nowhere in a desert with two carcasses so those will definitely go to 100% waste and now he's sitting on the desert floor just taking bites of a huge animal that looks awful it looks kind of good I'm not gonna I'm not gonna sit here really awful those look like good clean bites but so anyway that was a video that was making the rounds that everyone was a fan of and then all the sudden look who posted a new video just like what yesterday or the day before yeah it was yesterday one day ago is this one half music that's gonna [ __ ] us up he usually does but I don't think yes I talk anyways so it's fun so he pulls up in a tractor and oh what's this he's taking the wheels off here oh and what's this he's putting a rotisserie on Oh what's this he's putting on an open flame down dad I got doesn't smile though he yells oh what's this a giant animal carcass that he's putting ketchup on probably not catch other and it's rotating on the wheel oh my god whoever thought of that so what do you think about czn ripping off re our friendly yeah a little bit of a problem here the fire is like going the other direction did that fire it's totally out of control even tries it out the fire is like next to it it's not and there I think it's indirect flame I think that's what you want if I'm being honest with you on that a guy had under um he even stole the mop like he just a big mop like a bush it's like a branch and I don't know I'm over it you're overseas yet well I just I don't know I don't know to think about this I'm alright that looks good Shh looks so good I feel like that then cook well I know and I looked cooked but I liked the the Chinese guys video way better and there's another instance of him ripping off this guy really yes man wait what's the one where he built the hut wait hold on hold the phone didn't we discuss this there's one where czn no but oh no it was the other guy who cooked the whole camel yeah oh yes seesee and didn't do that but another turkish chef did write that we were repulsed by he stabbed it with a rose so look look who invented the can't cooking a whole camel it's your boy roastmaster chan that's his name on facebook this one doesn't have music beautiful you see II thought I was being racist but I want you want to reflect on the fact that that is actually what he's doing so well yeah I don't think you should try to imitate it because he's got a camel on a mother effing crane dude he builds the whole damn stage didn't I see it didn't we see czn do this build the hut for fur that's what I'm saying this was posted November 7th Oh in that that's easy in video way back oh you know that brand community they all copy from each other this guy seems legit this one looks awful though like it looks wrong what if there's a camel carcass Oh gross yeah it's horrific I mean it really is a dissipation and there's no way anyone else is eating this from Manila nor is it shouted might be feeding a whole village after this or something was how do you get a crane okay goes out in the budget they lowered it with the crane how long are the days here so here they tip the crane out and the camel is honestly just sport it looks completely hard look at those yeah I feel bad for that camel like just taking bites oh [ __ ] I don't know about this one dude yeah there's no way he's gonna get that camel meat to anyone but before it spoils roast master Chen Chan excuse me I don't like it what other videos roast master Chang got improved I don't like animal stuff it's for you it is pretty gross now that orientation to our now that I'm a vegetarian I want to condemn meat eaters world but now they've been a vegetarian for two weeks here's another great one from roast master Chen apparently wah wah he's putting so much is a huge of carcass and just putting so much herbs on it dude like chunks of stuff like what is going on this carcass bro it just keep and then what I don't know what the [ __ ] that is I think it might just be snow okay how's that work we're just an absurd amount of oh maybe he's just preserved keeping it cool yeah is this a good one I'm not sure oh he puts the whole carcass in like deep fries it damn and then I'm just doing this so we don't get claimed anyway oh that's it I hate when they do the cooking videos and then they don't show the meth were on it okay here's an ad from South Dakota they have a meth epidemic and they wanted to raise awareness so here you go here get aware everybody it's called meth we're on it I'm on it I'm on it too so am I so am I [Music] meth is not someone else's problem it's everyone in South Dakota's problem and we need everyone to get on man and that says meth we're on it for the picture of South Dakota it's on URL unethical people are gonna be expecting something else URL South Dakota has a meth epidemic experts say that it's ravaging their their rural state three hundred three thousand three hundred sixty six people were arrested last year because of meth and 13 people died that doesn't seem that bad 13 deaths in the whole state barely anybody lose their population in South Dakota eight hundred and eighty two thousand some more more people in the San Fernando Valley than there are in the state of South Dakota thirteen dan I'm I mean doesn't shock me three thousand I wouldn't make go make a video called meth we're on it well I don't my people died and I'm anymore I'm making money I'm making light it's obviously they they have a big problem there come on Ethan be sensitive is that the lowest population state no North these numbers are just statistics they're missing faces empty chairs ela meth is an epidemic and we all need to pay attention meth we're on it in South Dakota twice as many teenagers 12 to 17 report using meth that's outrageous a 12 year old using meth that's the set of [ __ ] between 14 and 18 the state saw a 200% increase in people seeking treatment for meth addiction meth is filling up jails well that's that is just yeah I shouldn't be straining a law enforcement keeping the courts get ya daddy that's just a war on drugs [ __ ] stop stop charging drug users for crimes and putting them in jail meth we're on it they apparently spent five hundred thousand dollars on that thoughts how much five hundred thousand well does it do anything they have a 1.4 million dollar budget - an advertising agency behind the campaign I don't you to buy a whole lot of meth for 1.4 million they'd [ __ ] us I mean we're talking about it right it was it was effective that's what the that's what the governor said he said hey Twitter the whole point of this ad was to raise awareness so I think it's working okay well he's got got a little bit of a point there I mean I get the ad once you see the video it makes a little bit more sense but as a as a slogan meth we're on well you know what's the most like a billboards around that just say that cuz we're on it the most effective method like anti-meth campaigns I've seen is like the before and after yeah just show what I would say would show months look show some brutal crazy [ __ ] I mean meth definitely ruins people's lives like look at some of these this girl I mean look at that yeah [ __ ] now this drug isn't just odd mmm he's not good a life groaning man look at that sores on there oh that that's not from meth that's like a Firebird maybe she was in a meth fire but I think it's a little misleading to say that's me looks like well you are just looking at Google Images it's not very not scientific very curated no no is there anyone that looks better on meth I'm curious definitely not her oh Jesus he doesn't look better on meth I'd like to find someone that just looks bomb on that let's see she looks pretty good on that she got a little nicer hair style what does she aged 50 years anyway meth is a hell of a drug here this is a crazy before now this is the dude from Breaking Bad turned into uh what's his name wish I wish I mean yes there you have it we're on it we are on meth never tried meth knives not out of math okay that's good don't try it I denied a lot of drugs but meth is not one of them soon all right that's not a meth is like not of there's nothing like recreation about meth it's like you want to ruin your life yeah it's not like let's have a fun afternoon it's like you want to look you want to be in a before and after photo yeah uh [Music] let it it it it it at that Tom you want watch don't know there's too much Tom made a really funny video bird but I can't watch it because it's got music in it I wanted to watch this Andrew

you in the 2020 election what would you say your first call well first I'd say I'm sorry I beat your guy and second I would say the days of meddling in American elections are over and we will take any undermining of our democratic processes as an act of hostility and aggression yeah the American people would back me on this we know that they've found an underbelly and they've been clawing at it and it's made it so that we can't even trust our own democracy the third thing I would say is that we're going to live up to our international commitments we're going to recommit to our partnerships and alliances including NATO and what's going on I want to propose a new world data organization like a WTO for data because right now unfortunately we're living in a world where data is the new oil and we don't have our arms around it these are the ways that will actually get Russia to the table and make it so they have to join the international community and stop resisting appeals to the world order oh I didn't sign up for you let me see preach it he's talking about data data and everyone there is like what you mean the guy start reading my password knowledge come on art yeah he's he's dude he's on another level if he doesn't get nominated it's because the world ain't ready for yank but he's young and I think he'll be back they again didn't really fit your him like by far the least amount of time talking as I yeah but and once again he's leaves the best the best impression thank you Belov the yang I'm excited to have him back on the 20th and I look forward to that very much now as we come oh did you want that you want to talk about Jake Paul crying we have some time here so I have some voice messages and Jake Paul crying to his brothers loss but I was like man who gives a [ __ ] about Jake yeah no but he's such a whiny [ __ ] he's like giving his brother [ __ ] for losing and he's crying and his kid he has ice cubes on his eye I actually don't think that ice cube mean anything is just to like make it less fluffy yeah but why would you do that in a video it's outrageous to what be walking around doing a vlog and putting like he was really trying to like make it like a documentary of behind the scene like Garth Brooks yes making it raw and I watched it and we watch the whole thing I did really well now we're talking about so might as well pulled up to me the worst part was just how he kept accusing Logan's trainer because apparently the trainer said to Logan at one point it's okay if you win or lose and he's very supportive he can't get over the fact that he said that because apparently he's like preparing him for loss because he said that you're following no I totally am i think the trainer was was being the trainer is clearly like what are you talking about if he said that it was probably at the end of the match though it doesn't matter that's just a thing to you just trying to be sweet yeah he's just trying to be supportive like it you made it this far you know at this point this is already awesome so well just listen a bitch-ass Elton John wannabe what when actually Logan kept telling you like the Jill it's fine everything is fine like don't come at the trainer what do you want from him he was just being such ado I couldn't believe it what the well here watch watch just listen why are you crying you weirdo and then his homie Logan's broadcast coast is like it's good it's all good bro he's first of all let me let me set the scene here he's using music dramatic music in his own video and he titled his video Jake Paul cries backstage after Logan Paul loses the ksi third-person but sad music next to a [ __ ] power generator yeah this is raw baby crying this he won't stop talking about that one line that the trainer said to him listen the music boom so after the fight I was super emotional I'm a very passionate person and there's nothing nothing more I hate to see then when my family or someone that I love loses or gets over by something and the whole situation with like the ref Logan getting two points taken away the whole entire like training camp of emotion and like everything just like started like flood through me the dog's best part of the video he was accusing the trainer of being a yes-man why are you blasting his your brother I don't know him but it seems like someone was actually well-known and I had yes men around me I'm far from like I would never do that I'm not here to be your yes-man I was training Logan just doesn't seem like this place to even talk about this stuff I mean he's clearly just trying to get views and it works they got 5 million his views dude his videos don't get views anymore I mean I'm out like they used to just like so he saw the opportunity to get some views because before this I'm in like less than a million you know Mom he gets he gets views from time to time you know but 5 million where do you want me to skip did he do a wardrobe change to Jake Paul do a wardrobe change oh I want to hear this let me go back did he you that's crazy that he's back here confronting them just for content for his channel like bro this guy worked his ass off what do you know about anything showing up like Vanilla Ice and Logan keeps telling him it's fine he let it go show up tonight like we planned in practice I just I did not think that the culture is like what help bro you're just performing the black I'm just saying bro like stop being like that's not what I'm saying I'm saying stop being a yes-man not bro third round he comes to me goes you're what you do I heard that and the fight right around me because I was the one making bread but I never been take you such a tool [Music] hey Dave Sal keeps doing that but then he keeps going back at it he's like I'm not accusing you but why did you say one point he says to him look at the end of the day you're gonna go back to I don't know where he's from let's say Florida whatever you're gonna go back to Florida but tomorrow I'm still a pole this is the trashiest video ever because it's like the fact that Logan lost is bad news for me cuz I'm Jake Paul - yeah Majan how much more revelant irrelevant he'll be his dis marrying tanner mangu made him even more of a douche apparently than he already was yeah maybe take it or leave it but there's however many people in this room and I'm the only one that's going against the grain things the bog is trying to think about it you said I don't need to I need let's talk tomorrow it doesn't matter I think you did great I think you won the fight I think that rap is about the court but he looks like such a fool such a douche seems like you so disrespectful so disrespectful I mean this is you know damn this is like suicide forest levels of unawareness runs in the family this poor guy till you know he just blitz him and recorded him and put it on the guy never had an idea but he looks good and Jake looks like a dumb I feel like they're just I feel like they just hate each other cuz they're on camera and they're trying to look like good brothers I think I think it's weird because Logan handled the loss like better than I did and and I don't know if I don't know why I don't know I don't know if that's a problem or something that I should like try and fix her whatever but I feel like I was there in the ring with Logan and I love Logan more than
