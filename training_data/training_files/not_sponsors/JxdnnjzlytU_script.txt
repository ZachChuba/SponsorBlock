[Music] michaela what are you doing and why am i holding the spoon I'm about to feed a fox pup before we go to that vet appointment so we have to take the coda to the vet because he's been having some problems with his ears and we want to figure out what the issue is - again and then he's due for his vaccines - so I need a dunk this and the honey so she's actually old enough to eat out of a dish but we try to bottle feed them for longer because it's good for bonding and all these foxes are domestic non-releasable boxes so they have to live with people so we want them to love us and fitting in here loves fox pups that's why he's hanging out around we're just going to town on it what type of mixture milk this is fox formula oh yeah we have to special order it she's getting adopted she already hasn't a doctor it's amazing yeah all right [Music] I have a very short amount of time to pick him up and bring him to the enclosure because he only shows interest in me in like the first 30 seconds so I have to be super quick about it hi Dakota okay good boy good boy I even have a tattoo of him I don't know where it is on those there's 15 of them okay so I'm gonna pick him up because he's really bad on the leash and we'll just take us forever I know I'm the only person that can pick him up he doesn't let anyone else do this okay now they're good boy and we'll keep the leash on him cuz it'll make it easier to get them out and safer let's go grab a spoon big all right what is with the poop bag I had a volunteer gather some poop earlier today so yeah right technically yeah so they can take a sample of it and make sure he doesn't have any worms or parasites nice [Music] hello Dakota it doesn't make any sense so his ears have been bugging him a little bit he's been yeah it's shaking his head and so I figured it's best to just bring him in for his annual checkup all right all right sounds good he looks like he's got been some kind of captive genetics you know he's different than our local coyote anyway here it is oh I almost emulated it's okay yeah they're super clean there's a good how old is he um it was estimated he's around seven okay we think he's older and he was captive bred yeah do you have some treats I cannot there we go did you like that hmm [Music] what a good boy one down one to go probably the only animal I've ever brought to the vet that will accept food yeah I don't want to give shots this way right yeah me come in there's a good good okay well I got it good chunk there let me try that come on come here good point yeah hey you just a strange coyote we do have that one long-acting yeah Clairol that we used I think on a number of animals before I say we put that down you know split one between the both ears and then you decide in a month if we want to do a recheck or not okay thank you I just want to make sure it gets all the way down in your okay there's a good boy oh wow I've never heard him bark see that was like an actual bark dog bark do you have them he's permanent resident or is he gonna be adopted as well he is adoptable but we haven't had anybody qualified that's watch him but okay we got Shawn he's a physical exam was pretty good other than his ears and then we treated those so that should do it success Dakota did really good obviously because you guys watched recap the save a fox and a coyote and it's gone and it's cook and a lot of others I think you know come on Dakota come on I might have to actually get in there with him to get him to come out I hope so over here hi okay alright alright you did so good yes you did [Music]
