see psychic the heart of your system [Music] we are back with my new render machine in the last video I told you or in the last video we were first deleting the CPU preparing everything all of that is done I also told you that I have to fix the Dominos extreme because there was a miss placement of an SMD resistor which I just did you just saw that so let's quickly test if the Dominos extreme is working I already mounted this Noctua air cooler which makes it easier for debugging instead of just assembling the full water cooling thing to plug in at least one memory module quickly oh yeah you can already see what kind of memory modules we will be using but we will get back to that in a bit switching on the psu standby power is there yeah so that looks good already previously if I would just hit power it would always go to zero zero and nothing was happening looks good for now you can see memory sticks are initialized also if we go over to CPU code cycling through VGA code right now I should be stuck at d6 because we don't have anything in there to boot there is no MDOT to drive for anything mounted so that looks good I think the dominance is fixed in the next step we will have to mount the water cooler for the CPU and we're going to use the ek velocity WS in the narrow version because there are two different sockets for the socket 36:47 there's the narrow one and the white or the normal one not entirely sure why there two of those sockets I think it's very similar to X 299 where you have to narrow one to save some space for example on a mini ITX port from ass rock they used the narrow socket and there there's a normal one but the Dominus extreme is using the narrow version that's why I had to pick this specific one I think I paid 250 euro for this water block which i think is quite a lot for a CPU water cooler typically you can get a full water cooling setup for 50 euro if you get a typical 50 euro cooler 50 euro pump invests like a hundred euro for your radiator so you get a 360 rod for this price yeah 250 euro hefty price I think we will see how the performance of this thing will be but I think we also have to consider that for this socket 36:47 with a narrow version there is only a small quantity probably that we keep reduced that's maybe an explanation for this high price as I said before we will be using the corsair dominator platinum RGB modules but we will get to them in a bit first let's mount the water cooler [Music] [Applause] [Music] socket 36:47 is a bit more different from what we are used to with desktop sockets like 2666 no 2066 the main difference is that we don't have the ilm the integrated loading mechanisms or this thing that keeps your cpu in the socket applies the pressure into the socket while then you can mount any cooler and the cooler is not directly attached to the cpu for 3647 because it's from the server market originally the cpu is fixed to the cooler I think it's easier to swap CPU and cooling units maybe for servers I'm not entirely sure but originally when I had my first Domino's I was not really happy about this mounting solution because originally I didn't have those hold downs that are fixing the CPU to the cooler the way we have it on here and it's not to our cooler if you're not using those frames it's really a pain in the ass because you have to fix your CPU first in the socket then apply the pressure with a cooler if you remove the cooler afterwards it can be that the CPU faults off and all those kind of things what's not really happy about it but using those plastic frames it's kind of ok you have two different hole sizes on there so the smaller one and a bigger hole size and you can compare them to the socket so there's a smaller yeah thing right here that goes into the smaller hole in the cooler and then the bigger one so it's not possible to misplace the CPU also RMA wise 36:47 you can replace the socket unlike 4 TR 4 4 4 thread Ripper it's pretty much impossible to replace the socket so if you damage your board if you bent pins and the socket is permanently damaged for tr4 it's almost impossible to replace the socket due to its size but for 36:47 you see it's 2 different parts so you have the bottom part right here and you have the top part right here they're split up if any part is broken the top or the bottom part can be replaced in RMA which is a good thing for 3647 that's one downside for example for TR 4 socket so for SP 3 for a thread thread you burn epic it's a bit more problem marek to do that but let's continue mounting the EK cooler yeah usually I would use more thermal paste but for quick testing that was enough [Music] [Applause] [Music] actually not even sure which cooler is heavier this thing is really heavy it feels like a massive piece of copper could be almost the same weight and quality yeah used from UK extremely good quality see the small Finn structure inside there also this additional piece of aluminium right here seems like there is RGB included but I'm not entirely sure which part of the cooler is illuminated but we will see [Music] [Applause] [Music] the UK cooler is not using those plastic mounts to fix the CPU to the cooler so we have to be a little bit more careful if we then remove the CPU cooler again from the socket because the CPU will be stuck to the plate with the thermal paste [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] time to get to the memory sticks I'm using three kids in total using Dominator platinum RGB modules saw the latest memory modules from Corsa right here pretty beautiful memory sticks from my opinion and they vary they fit the Domino's extreme very very well on the Dominator platinum we have those small dots right here those squares and they're illuminated I think in total with 12 LEDs so you can do all kind of effects like raindrop or you can just have them into say all in the same color I think it looks quite cool especially if you populate all DIMM slots and we have 12 sticks in total so that's quite a lot because we have hexa channel on the 3647 platform as I said before I'm using three memory hits 32 gigabyte each so total 96 gigabyte of memory should be sufficient I recently upgraded the memory in my old PC to 64 gigabyte it even that we can completely use with Adobe Premiere that's why I decided to go for 96 gigabyte this time should be enough I think and it's a 34 66 megahertz speed should also be quite fast using them in hexa Channel and latency is 16 18 18 so it's that's an indicator that it's Samsung beta and rated at from 1.3 5 volt I think we should be able to squeeze a little bit more out of them maybe one point four five or maybe 1.5 volt then maybe 3600 is possible because yeah 3600 megahertz you pay quite a lot more than for those sticks and they should be about 330 per kid that's in total still a thousand-euro just for the memory kits and I think that's quite a lot thankfully I didn't have to pay for those stick so thank you very much Corsair for providing those sticks in to my build [Music] [Applause] [Music] before we decide to put this into any case we will perform a quick test with this if you mounted and all the memory sticks mounted because it's always because it can always happen that there is a bad contact to the CPU socket or to one of the dims therefore one of the dimpsons may be not detected not sure why the memory dims are not illuminated in the same way right now I think we will fix that later once we are in Windows and can access the Corsair software but I think it would look even nicer so far it looks quite good I think it's passing yeah until t6 which means that again SSD or any boot media is missing but we don't have like 53 or 55 which would be an indicator that met one of the dims would be plucked wrong or there would be bad contact so far so good and I think it looks also quite beautiful that's it for today's video we are done with the bundle assembly so far so good everything is up and working I think we didn't even discuss yet what kind of case we were going to use I think so I also didn't tell you so far what kind of tubes you are going to use because that will also be a little bit different a little bit more difficult a challenge to me as well never used them before maybe you can guess what kind of tubes we will be using you will see that in the next video and also what kind of case we will be using maybe you have an idea maybe you would like to see something different let me know in the comments what kind of tubes you're guessing and also what kind of case you're guessing we're going to use thanks for joining in see you next time bye [Music] [Music]
