see that that's a tear of happiness for the fact that my mouth is on fire hey what's going on everybody for first we feast I'm Sean Evans and you're watching hot one it's the show of hot question even how to ring and today I'm joined by the bold and adventurous coyote Peterson you can catch you - tremendously popular YouTube channel brave wilderness where people tune in by the millions to see coyote go on strange animal adventures and get bit by dangerous insects all for your entertainment coyote welcome to the show thank you for having me this looks much more dangerous than some of the things that I've encountered in the past 365 days so we'll nervous I'm not used to chicken bullet ants no problems chicken wings you see what happened it's a new frontier how are you with hot food I actually had my very first hot wing just the other day I am NOT a spicy food person so this should be very interesting [Music] [Music] this first one is sriracha sriracha is no big deal okay I didn't think about perhaps sriracha sauce before won't full spicy okay look I think that's the first reaction that a lot of people have when they watch your videos is what's up with this guy so if you don't mind I'd like to get your origin story a little bit what does the coyote nickname come from when I was kid my mom is take my sister and I across the country we travel all throughout the United States we Dalton Utley end up in Tucson Arizona and there's a lizard there called a Regal horned lizard my favorite lizard in the world but they're really really camouflaged so to find these lizards I used to actually follow road runners from now the road runners love to eat horned lizard so like the Warner Brothers cartoon my mom started calling me coyote because I was chasing road runners around a desert looking for these lizards and I never actually found a horned lizard by following a road runner but I guess in the end I got a pretty cool nickname who's your guy that ranks all the systems Brett right there's got to go uh he's like this ranked people's performances and how long they last Brett Baker hot Winker Bieber fan shout-out to Brett Baker a name that comes up over the course of this show often has he been on the show not yet not yet you really should get Brett on the show and I'll bring a bullet in and if Brett gets all the way through then you can get a bullet into rats so someone who's eaten to Carolina Reapers I know that sometimes the consequences of a shoot can last long after the cameras cut yeah I don't even know what a Carolina Reaper is I'm assuming that's a pepper of some shot at pepper in the world how does it that's in my world - twice you didn't learn the first time pan your bulb what is the bite or sting that had the worst aftermath worst biter sting I've ever gotten well there's been a lot of them I'd have to say it's the most recent thing that I went through where I was wearing a bee beard and it was an epic fail Chris we were working with a bee specialist said he's done this before maybe two or three stings okay two or three stings is going to be fun you know a good kind of comedic episode just shave off my fur beard and wear a bee beard isn't what happened was some rogue bees came into the swarm it was on my face and once I got stung once and then another time we started releasing a pheromone that was a fight for a moment and before I do it my face became the target of multiple beestings and 32 stings later I was in incredible pain my face swelled up almost immediately my eyes were watering that said it looked like I was crying it wasn't actually crying I was just like imagine how my face will probably end up by the end of today and it was extremely painful and the after effect was about 48 hours of my face looking like a lump and potato so don't don't do be beards [Music] mm-hmm something's happening something's happening inside of the mouth right now feels like little ants starting to bite me mm-hmm-hmm amazingly brave wilderness is now the most watched digital wilderness channel beating out legacy brands like National Geographic but it's important to pay homage to those who paved the way so what I want to do is bounce some of the most legendary figures in the field off of you and then just get your snap reaction okay good yeah all right let's go because I love that you brought that question because you always have to talk about where you get your inspiration wrong you know I love that all right first one Jane Goodall yes that's what a lot of people don't ever bring up to me with our brand you know we're getting more and more in a direction of how do you promote conservation how do you bring all these animals to a public eye that need help and I think somebody like Jane is a wonderful example of somebody that's driven spear for conservation for costumes and I've been a kid Justin Oh Schmidt oh yeah Justin you know Justin of course I'm actually I think an be working with Justin this summer were birthed participating in a documentary that's being done in Arizona by a student there that is researching this pain sting index and was actually Justin's experimentations with all these luck she's got this amazing chart we found on the internet because I've been some about harvester ants and everybody's like you got achieve this chart with all these other things I know anything about it to time he's been stung by absolutely everything you name it he's been stung by he kind of sets that this is a so-called chart Scoville scale Scoville scale that's what he's done with with bites and stings so yeah I carry his a little chart on my phone all the time it's awesome Steve Steve Irwin well I grew up watching Steve I mean I was the kid that was in my backyard trying to catch snapping turtles pretending that they were crocodiles I had the khaki shorts I had khaki shirts like if you didn't love Steve you don't belong in the animal space period miss them for sure as everybody does and and every single day when we work on our content I just think about the fact that somebody like that inspired us and we're hoping to carry on the torch in a sense for the next generation man waters always got a wolf on there mm-hmm what's cool you ever just drink these like straight out bottles like prepare like in your training no I said no it's never occurred to me to drag yeah I mean I don't go around like grabbing random insects being like tomorrow's the bullet hit a couple more tarantula Hawks Ayana it might work though it might all right so of course people want to hear about bites and stings but for my money your best videos are these ones where you make a unique connection with the wild animal on set when you think about the times that you've established some sort of unique bond while filming are there any that stand out oh yeah well and thank you for mentioning that because yes a lot of people want to know about the Pyke's instincts but it's really only about 10% of what's on our Channel probably the one that stands out the most is the Ocelot which was one of our most phenomenal encounters we've ever had wild Ocelot in jungles of Costa Rica it was young ones just a juvenile but came out of nowhere in the woods I mean we did know that there it had been spotted in that area we're told he kind of walked this trail at night you may stumble upon it and sure enough we were out there looking for eyelash fibers butcher these beautiful colorful snakes these Vipers that live in the trees and we are these paws coming out of darkness I mean I've never jumped so harmonicas you think Jaguar oh no we're going to get that by Jaguar and here comes a slow Ocelot out of nowhere and she was just the most playful incredible creature in the world and Mark our directors like dude we gotta shoot an episode on this right now so we all just start scrambling to be like play with the Ocelot whatever happens just roll the camera so we just kept rolling and they got some phone with us I was like you guys are in my playground like we're going to hang out all night right I got the boy is like 2:00 in the morning really mad like we run out of camera batteries here like we got to head back to base camp in that office I wanted to play non-stop so it was pretty cool experience I'm never going to forget not much good Thank You coyote hot little spider mm-hmm all right coyote we have a recurring segment on our show called explain that Graham and what we do is we do a deep dive on our guest Instagram we pull interesting pictures that need more context I'll show you the picture that you just tell me the bigger story does that sound good yep all right laptop please again with the laptop is this when you've got a Kylie Jenner lip kit or you know we probably could have called that the Kylie Jenner lip challenge I'll see it at this point I was the most afraid that my lips were going to pop I don't know how far a human lips can stretch but they just kept going and going after about 15 minutes when we knew I was going to go into anaphylactic shock which can't happen if you're stung a bunch by bees we knew I was kind of in the clear and then we went to Chipotle and we walked in and I looked like that and the kids work and they were like you kind of look like that guy coyote Peterson and I was like I am coyotes and I've got a starting bunch times by bees and they give spree chapelier it was a great day oh I love that guy you and Jeff Goldblum you're a Jurassic Park guy huge Jurassic Park fan the biggest Jurassic Park fan there is arguably actually brought my little dr. Ian Malcolm toy from when I was kid on Conan the producers of Conan wanted to know everything like that I was going to do and like I start going down this road I think I got some tricks up my sleeve they're like there's no check so soon better just not tell you about my little totally then and what I love about that photo right there is I added my arm around him and he had his arm around me and I kind of he was like kind of squeezing my shoulder I tickled his ribs and I gave him that Jurassic Park lap that he did in the helicopter and that moe he's laughing and then he turns me goes that's my laugh one more for you face-to-face with the Wolverine hmm that was so much work people don't realize how tough it was to convince steve kroschel that I could get face to face with the Wolverine Steve crow shows been raising Wolverines for 30 years and we showed up as I guess t back got to get an enclosure with the Wolverine it's like I don't know what you're talking about I thought you wanted to take pictures we were like no we're no boulder he's like I gotta be writable green so there's this whole panic he put me through some incredible tests and when I find they got to me band who's the Wolverine face to face it was like childhood dream come true most incredible animal I've ever been face-to-face with [Music] ghost pepper and blueberry I have blueberries for breakfast actually if that's going to work in my favor this one is actually kind of blue like a blueberry mmm a little bit of a blueberry kick to it what's the animal myth or falsehood that drives you crazy Asst people are terrified of shark now make no mistake I grew up watching jaws love Spielberg loved that movie but there were a lot of misnomers that came from a movie like that and subsequent movies that have personified sharks as these villains these killers that are just out there to eat humans not not to say that sharks are not dangerous need to be treated with complete respect they certainly do but there's a lot of people to have an unnecessary fear of sharks any kid that's out there I don't want them to be afraid to go to the beach because a shark might come Andy Andy I love sharks sharks are there they're doing amazing things for the environment lips are tingling that's probably a good sign right that last one I actually kind of snuck up after the fact and you know when it hits is like when you're breathing out breathing again it's like that's nice breathing out it's like a dragon's breath that's I do it people always wonder I'm always going like yeah yeah and that's what I'm doing I'm getting a little instant relief I feel like one of the police's dragons from Game of Thrones reigns right in your mouth hmmm how look flavor to it you can tell right away so what starting to burn my face something happening now something's definitely happening there you have whatever told what I want to talk about survival for a second because as the coyote pack knows it's not all just cuddly animals and venomous snakes just so you guys know I'm starting to sweat now mm-hmm all right but then I wear this leather hat yeah okay what's your move if you're hiking along the trail and you find yourself face-to-face with an angry grizzly bear ma'am did you know that we have this situation happen to us this past summer in Alaska do you know that with a bear scare face-to-face with the mother brown bear under three cubs that was crazy so a lot of times they tell you to carry bear spray right which is like a super intensified pepper spray which probably ranks somewhere up in here that spray when it hits the Bears nose and eyes usually will stun the girl what happen to me what's going on right now the bear will go in the opposite direction where you run into trouble is that if a bear does charge you don't have their spray if it's a brown bear or grizzly you drop on the ground you get into a ball and you protect your neck brown bears aren't so much out there to you as they are to just eliminate the territorial threat a black bear on the other hand is another story they can be about three to four hundred pounds and a black bear will eat you so if you get attacked by a black bear you fight with everything you've got but brown bear grizzly bear on the ground plate done Wow look at that deep now this one has look literally has a bomb on it no bomb beyond insanity nowhere it's just a back of your throat with a little dangly punching bag yeah they could get stuck on there and like damn it that's all of that then I'm gonna go legit see that there's a lot I see you doused it right there I'm gonna take some big bite darling don't like reserved right back something's happening right soon as I think I've said that I'm going this was slow onset of life there's a way yeah your body reacts to it responds to it in ways that you never really thought possible happens up until you start clean in the clouds or do it today and then that's along its arm it was really tough to get yourself to force yourself to swallow something that hot you don't really have to clean the wings coyote no moving all the way over I respect it yeah our commenters are always clamoring for the guests that they want to see on the show oh it's so hot right now I can't eat and I imagine that it's kind of the same for you that people are always clamoring for the stunts for the animal faces to face that they want to see what's the one thing now get eaten by a whale everybody wants to see the old Pinocchio yeah I'm down you would be surprised how many people are like can you get swallowed by whale and like it doesn't work like that though like I don't think you can't be swallowed by a whale I actually have it here guys under your type you see that that's a tear of happiness for the fact that my mouth is on fire all right oh gosh all right the sauce will blow you away double bite and on two three well rue barks I know you're watching Brett Mario my gosh write that now oh man you're calm the water whoops that's gonna be a tough one to get down so you've used a lot of strange things and your time on YouTube you've had killer bee honey you had that a durian fruit oh but the regional food in Ohio yeah it might be stranger weirder than all of those things even so what I want to do is bounce some of the regional foods and Ohio off of you then just get your reaction that's not good while my nose is running mm-hmm maybe I don't have like tissues you just you guys want that running this hmm okay I'm ready you had a terminator I have actually tried to eat that once with a friend hold on but there's like it's like there's like a small like that mad dog is in the back of my throat I think it just kicked me on this side over here like a little like flake of something just went tonsil crazy ah yes that burger is so big so big I got the farmers like there's no more bun no more these top is I just tried to like down the meat I couldn't finish it what about Buckeyes yeah yeah yeah ooh Buckeyes all the time those are kind of like Reese's pcs on like I don't know 357 Mad Dog yeah they're awesome have you ever had Cincinnati style chili oh yeah and my editor chris loves skyline chili which is i guess it originated in cincinnati right yeah i don't hang out in the editing suite after chris has been to skylight how's your face - feelin right actually nobody ever asked how you're doing Thank You Kerry I appreciate that looking out for you man so here's I would say is it's uh it's burnin like it does my lips are on fire my mouth is on fire my tongue swelling a little bit very uncomfortable but at the same time coyote I invited uses a show yes I feel like I have to put up a front I have to be professional so don't let that vulnerability show I try not to let that vulnerability show but for you for you that would be like if I invited you out new swamp and I was like hey man let's keep it by snapping turtles and then I was like you just you do it you know what it would be like if you brought me out to the swamp and you're like let's go look at snapping turtles and then you've got a snapping turtle and you freaked out yeah you know what I mean I was older guy doesn't know what he's doing over here man it you guys don't realize like you've watch and you're like huh manatee can't be that hot I didn't think it was dinner I really thought that like you've got other guys you like having trouble just controlling the amount of fire that's in my mouth right now this is Blair's Megadeth sauce with liquid rage it's tradition around here to put a little dab on the last wing is it already on the wing it is already on the wing but I put a little extra for the people out there you don't have to feel I'm happy to do Dereham ever drink it out in bottle seems like a loaded question no oh just bubble did you see that it's just I'm not gonna drink it out of the bottle so I won't be that guy but I will give a good wall talk of it there they're given [ __ ] that's very legit that looks dangerous right there right that's like ketchup I was really confident when we were right here I like this is not a problem we lull you into that false sense of security and then yeah it's like what I'm gonna trip on a really tall flight of stairs and there's no way you're going to stop yourself on the way down all right if I stall long enough all right guess we're going to see what happens we're gonna cheers to visitors see on the other side hmm now wake you up mm-hmm mega jack really legit I have one more question for you whether it's a travel show like Bizarre Foods or a science show like Mythbusters there's always the delicate balance where you're trying to educate but at the same time you're doing everything that you can to draw eyeballs when it comes to brave wilderness what is your response to the critics who just think that you're some macho idiot we should just get eaten by a komodo dragon what's your end game actually love it when we have articles that are written about us they're like this guy's a maniac because we don't get funny I'm really not a macho maniac kind of guy and that does bring people in but then once they find the channel and they find episodes with Manatee and ocelots and conservation projects about little tiny class frogs the leaf frogs when Costa Rican rainforests are like this stuff is actually really educational while we do love you guys watching on YouTube would you watching us I'd explore your local and state parks but really at the end of the day for everybody to walk away knowing that they've gotten some sort of education even the bites thing episodes are dispelling myths and encouraging you to admire these animals from a safe distance let me take the Bison things let me get up close to any animal matter what it is if you admire from safe distance will be just fine and I'll take some time to say that you should admire bleers Megadeth sauce perhaps from a safe distance but not you coyote Peterson don't ever mess around with Megadeth my face right now is like it's like have you ever liked taking a bunch of bottle rockets cut off their stems and like put them inside of a milk jug to see what would happen no never in my life no huh me neither but that's kind of what the inside of my mouth feels like right now you know how it goes this camera this camera this camera lets people know what you have going on in your life well we're continuing to make episodes on the brailers Channel and I'm really excited to announce they're actually just wrote my very first book and a lot of
