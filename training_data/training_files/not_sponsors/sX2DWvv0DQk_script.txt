all right everybody welcome back to another episode of RL crafts we will be going to the end in just a moment but figured fast travel back here real quick and just a couple things also as always to MC pro hosting for always being dat sponsor let's see that's a completely worthless level three-inch Angie's moisturised I love that one I love it I love it when my skin is moisturize moisturize oh yes all right I'm just I mean chanting everything to hoping I can get infinity advanced power three is pretty big that a that's a good that's a good boy right there I would have to say I'm gonna see if I can reforged my bow cuz I didn't realize that was a thing yeah that's yeah you're a smart boy cuz i had nothing on it for a while plus 5% projectile but you said you got 15 right yes but I got legendary you know minus 15 pretty easily apparently % do I do I stop there I guess the dragon loads are harder to get ahold of than the other stuff okay but what I do want to do is I want to try reforging more of my bubbles yeah my bubbles because I just have a move you know a bunch of him plus half heart it's like come on dude or percent attack speed toughness never books where did my brother there lessor sharpness v safeguard +4 % attack speed I have a super fast attack speed now water aspects versatility versatility didn't you have that and you can speak nah oh my god how am I going from 4 to 2 to 1 in 3 consecutive ones or % attack damn damn I'll bring ya bestowment deals extra damage to all while raining I see ooh there we go 6 % attack speed I know it's the best but that's ok alright I'll take you I'll take it we doing big plays out here ok yeah I'm definitely getting that one I can put on breaking 3 on a book heck yeah oh you lucky lucky lucky heck yeah why are you such a lucky boy well it goes back to my family yeah you were born with high luck genes all right can't let you have that one so Wow some corner need to hide it off in some corner Wow you think I'm just gonna come on in between episodes and just steal the stuff that you've made get he does he does that's what he thinks well that's an interesting way to put extensive throwing range a weapon that doesn't seem good at all you know what I'm gonna do okay so a lot of people have actually advised that we bring a waist own with us so can you we sleep really quick so I'm gonna go get the first weigh stone that we came across kind of near our spawn you can stick them up oh I can't pick them up different this is a different series there's a nether star if you have another star to make one do you want to sleep do you want to sleep we're we're getting work done unless you use the nether star as we can't I just I saw some people saying that there can be a bug with the fountain that causes things to happen and it's it can be a concern I don't know if that's something that we need to worry about but rammer says make a way stone and I'd be inclined to think that maybe he is aware of what's going down spell proof I'm just over here making bad books don't mind me that's all good dude it's all good economical for not consume ammo and used I mean it's not infinity but that's the top tier it's a start Oh how much economical did you get for it second it's the top tier economical Oh make a waste Oh in case you wanna live I need to go back oh we're fine now then that's not a big deal I don't release the arf arf arf we already have a way stone over at the place so yeah we have a way stone right there I thought it was I thought it was so that we didn't have to go back through the fountain in the end because there was some bug associated with it they could screw us up but yeah all right I passed on economical that was tough last protection for long cast we already have long cast already mate what else oh you're trying you're still trying to get infinity I need a vanity to be fair one person having infinity is kind of enough for you oh there hey I get another unbreaking 3 though okay what can I use one of my helmet breaks in a Z break oh I got I'm breaking three freezing one in that book what is freezing applies a guaranteed slowness and mining fatigue potion effect on each hit each hit also increases the amplifier of the potion effect and if it reaches eight there's a chance that the mob will be encased in frosted ice I mean that seems pretty useful for a weapon not so much for your helmet mm-hmm yeah you going to be encased in ice huh is range extends the throwing range that's bogus Garbo weightless decreases blocking speed reduction I don't even know what that's supposed to mean okay well I give up there is no so far it's fine you've like 30 arrows dude that's all you need for this and I have infinity so we're gonna be fine okay come Calma Calma remember your pills okay so I will put the books back I'm done and I think I'm gonna put I don't okay fine you know what it's fine it's fine take the bow I'm gonna put it I'm just Bob you later this is you threw me off you've heard I throw you off you pushed me off when I was not ready and here look look look look right there oh nice dude you're always on me like oh wait I guess my helmets probably a good one to do it on because my helmet yeah into my bow bow is not a bad call either always repair my helmet bow is mm-hmm what do you think what do you think helmet or bow all your call I know I'm checking what the shadow really thinks they think that you're silly Oh mmm oh you can make more helmets but you can't make infinity you're right you're right that's true that's a true though yeah that's stay that's a pretty that's a pretty prescient approach okay that's too expensive anyway so can't even apply it but it's fine it's not gonna expire before you there's there's we have XP dude what what are you okay we're in this oh wow that's that's horrible that's tones dang boys I got you dawg you really do you really do here you treat me right on this day some what year and a half

you're gonna you're gonna want that oh god I should have put the levels back into the tome - whoops it's fine it's fine it's fine it's not fine levels aren't difficult to come by I don't think it's fine okay well if you want to panic then go ahead do your little picnic thing get it out of your system I mean how many levels does the book take it's 20 I don't wanna live I refuse to out alive we'll

never actually land on the platform anymore he just he literally just did like like seconds ago did Jesus cry and what is that what even is that I can't move I can't move I can't move because of the rats I can't move I can't move I'm getting slowly moved off the island I can't move I'm getting magnetized I'm getting magnetized off the island I still can't move I still can't move I don't know what

babies a lot of babies 3-quart he's three quarters the way down we got this we're doing okay I know it's panicky but we're okay used to have your totem so that's heaven as weird as it is those pinkies attacking is really useful because that helps me heal up a lot from the house oh the life seal oh yeah it'd be great if life still work for me let me into it oh my god oh my god oh my god he is mad at you you did all the deep sneeze like I know who my enemy is okay is he landing no he's just been at you okay oh my god Jesus Christ I cannot believe I'm still alive I've eaten almost all my golden apples I haven't used any gold apples congratulations got it oh my god that is by far and away the most insane ender dragon fight of all time it's raining stuff hallelujah okay the we want to just bail and come back and regroup Jesus we can figure everything we can figure life out after or do you by any chance I mean it really ah the amount of mobs just seems to have thinned out I do not agree or CH I do not have a torch can we grab one real quick is that possible yeah we go I thought I had a torch but it's fine that's fine I'm good yep okay any other wither skeleton skulls uh oh you need that we need the Dragon Scale right behind you Frick the Frick off a Tercel is a little of an adventure you've never seen anyone panic so much with so much health yeah the problem is with this modpack I think how much time with you actually I think I have every time that I have unaligned recently I have had at least three-quarters of my health so yeah yeah the health is just an average of what you have across all the different parts another weather school but it was like I still have like basically two rows of hearts when I got on your total rocked yeah well my totem deemed one I'm just checking that there are no other skulls dude hi they really did change the the way that the dragon acts though because that thing it was interesting I mean after you I was like okay non-stop it was just going and going and going until I left lux ramen right there for at fricked off levels 568 that's pretty good stuff nice nice whoo why didn't we use the Dragons because apparently they can do weird things that's what I was told oh my god Skippy Skippy no no I'm Skippy 90p Skippy whoa where's my health my health went away out that hurt a lot yeah what oh we went down to three hearts on everything okay what do you mean we're full health but not any of our extra health on any of our like heart containers or anything like that where did you run off to oh are we home where am i okay okay I get it I see where we are excuse me sir that was weird though I think my potion ring is just nullified in the end okay this way that was a that was an experience yeah we I mean we survived barely survived for collecting the totem yeah that was a good it was a good thing it would have been a little more awkward if I'd had an alive I just said I said fork it to the language yeah well yeah I mean of course but still here we are I didn't pass it we did get the Dragon Scale I don't know if they're supposed to drop multiple but I mean needs to start and these guys were just floating floating away in an unhappy sort of way what was floating away are the the region nymphs mmm there's like I'm out um what we could do is we could go to the N City area and we could fly on our dragons mm okay and then we could try to find you know the boats and get an Electra but also what it was being recommended is in order to get better enchantments we disenchant the stuff that we find in the end cities that's not a bad plan let me feast these XP tomes god that was naughty there was a lot of nutty black are you surrounded in that so did you only get one Dragon Scale yeah hmm interesting I think that is been indeed yes yes yes oh you only got one with ourselves and so we can't spot - that's his bomber bomber all right well do we want to go back and put our dragons to use yeah just trying to figure out remember where I put mine there is I have dragon hear him roar I do need a new pickaxe my dog is flying at my feet wet eating my toes this one's graceful which it actually is pretty decent alright seven shots oh what'd you get legendary legendary pickaxe boys nice yi yi sounds pretty good we got it we got him diamonds everywhere really any or you - a small chance to drop my diamonds that's like seems pretty useful but at the same time like diamonds yeah we don't work for us to get I don't think it's efficiency 3 on the other hand there's a lot of inefficient and advanced efficiency ok here your canteen I don't know where you went where'd you go I'm up I'm up the just seeing what in shame and so you can cycle through yeah trying to get int amants that I can put on things to be gone through all the Vice yeah okay I don't know you're no I just there were a bunch of books that were up there before yeah they're all just like level one no no just plain books that I could try throwing into the intro is yes I'm going through I have three of them left okay you look you've gone ham yeah I've been I've been I mean it doesn't cost a whole lot other than books and the the levels that we get really easy so I've been I've been crazy efficiency for unbreaking 354 how do you keep getting on breakings stands who that was that was that was just a shot in the dark there's just like how do you know getting hun breakings like I guess you cool down five rather following three which I get such crap o Lo and I cycle through enchants brains bestowment lucky strike economical okay I notice I think I did just put all those that I was gonna combine back in that's nice advanced fire aspects to isn't gonna help me how you sharp for alright advanced sharpness advanced fire aspect we do give another I'm breaking in here we can literally only have one I'm breaking Wow okay that's the max it can get and I'll do that never mind we won't because it's the finance on there oh wait actually you know with all these levels I should give me a lot of level I should give myself some levels into mining there we go easy now I can use dragon bow and pickaxe dragon bone pickaxe I haven't made one of those that probably should have been what are you to just try it but that's okay I got the legendary now so we're good mm-hmm don't think that's gonna work I have to ask it's like an ender pearl in the book right oh it's to wither bones for a dragon bone pickaxe rip I don't think we have any wither bones yeah that's that's not gonna work is it it's not gonna work hmm wither bones have eluded us I think yeasts can drop them possibly proven elusive [Music] mmm he said sagely one of the things should I level up I wonder I still can't even use a diamond axe so maybe gathering Wow yeah just been leaving that one for for later or what yeah well now I can good farming to level 32 yeah oh oh makes eating a passive task that's that's max level boys that's max level I've also heard that it's not I know it's not that hard for me to eat stuff it doesn't regain though so yeah what I what I want is auto drinking that would be nice there's something something I don't have to drink as much increases your movement speed while in grass path I mean that's nice and all but not not really in many grass paths out there you know laws that drop the components oh I've already have that transmutation i'm lochley be ready for chores fruit okay don't care about that undershirt it's a marked effect twist being a my monster well want a good potion what power do you have on your Bell uh I don't know advanced power three oh you've advanced okay mind I don't care about that those oh I need more skill points all right yar yar rights yeah right and when you're right you're right and you're right hey you know what I can make myself a diamond dachshund diamond shovel now so maybe I should maybe you should maybe it's something you should look into doing finally for yourself you know treat yourself hmm I'm gonna treat myself good good I'm happy to hear that quality worthless this is my life this is my life yeah I found it was more useful to like end up with the good quality stuff oh right don't make a shelter you got versatility that's true whatever it's fine correct don't care oh yeah no that means I don't even need to have that slot my inventory that's good all right I made more books take these pearls on them Clank clink clink how's the reforging going for you there big guy iffy I got 20% of tax fee but this is an act so I really just won mmm Oh legendary that's pretty cool there you go that's a good one I'll tell you like that one yeah all right I've made some more XP tomes so if you have spare levels feel free to help fill them up then I'll continue being the sole person to contribute Wow okay man such condescension and exhaustion I'm trying to pull good and chance dude unsheathing know what that does I'm taking damage the sword will automatically take the spot in the hotbar that's weird I don't like that dude don't like that true strike let's use it penetrate through evasion and searching blade nah projectile prop for it would you would you want projectile prop for by any chance I'm fully intend or chanted on my weapon yeah my stuff's pushing worthless vampirism and stuff I said I've stuck to the I've stuck to the weapon that I know works with that you mean the the Leica Knights mom's right yeah yeah like Knights mobs works differently I guess so it might be worth my doing I don't know man thinking it for a second time about yeah there are a lot of cows in here unbreaking 3 but how is it gonna be the only one though or the top will it be the top and I can undo it let's give it a try let's give it a try it's the top yes I get unbreaking 3 book yeh life seal 4 and it still won't work though oh yeah I had life steel for any other and it didn't work so that's not exciting I hear that extra Banshee out there shooting stuff at me there is I feel extra damage against villagers exciting not sir you're gonna have to come down and fight me if you want to fight me hmm long cast what do you do no fishing rod yeah all right well okay right stuff for now stuff for now dumped on dum-dum I wish that it wasn't winter but otherwise I'm glad we don't have to worry about the weather I agree all right give me dad unbreaking 3 you boy yeah that's what I like that's what I like oh I'm gonna shave my axe though forgot to check that ok there's someone Lucky's fortune 3 on an axe good fortune 3 you could try it and I mean I could get fortune 3 on an axe well oh are you mortality to fortune three spell breaker 2 but it wasn't at the top spell breaker no mortality oz is at the top good deals bonus damage to witches it basically geared this like a a weapon yeah yeah I didn't know you were cranking through golden apples in there I I hadn't used any holy crap we have a lot of leather look good for anything whether item frame campaigns backpacks settles the ravager Oh drop guarantee enemy mobs will always drop at least one item if applicable that might be healthy I have to get to level 20 on gathering for it though should I do it that could help with wither bones though passively supplies arrows to use in bows or long bows there we go leave me by passively like you don't have to do it manually anyway unless that generates in which case cool why oh it holds four stacks of arrows and that's useful we have a secondary red rocket no I gave you I gave you the one that we made for me right I mean I we I think we have this set to put one together if you wanted I kind of want to try and see if the lifesteal will work for me let me see what's so the steamer you don't need so zapping spine darkling skull and red rocket because dark things go bad and we have there's a fin spine I want to be able to use this thing and finally see what the heck it does bass okay finally I can see how that thing works okay so I can make you one it's not exactly the one that I have but I can put you together one what it does it have the proper level on the life scale thing though yeah okay yeah okay so that that and that and that's the leech which is what you're looking for and it has a little tentacle tail that you can enjoy it moves back and forth is the darkling skull the lifesteal yes so has leech on it and what why do you do the red rocket part again it's just a good blade oh okay you can you could do something else but the the leech does require a blade and I don't know if we have any other types of blades oh I see so the Red Rock it's not actually the important part but that's why okay that makes sense what is this tendrils it's the base no no I'm at there's a spectral Spectre tendril level 3 in here that is a base as well you could swap that out for the base and then you'd get that actually might be better than the the vici wonky that you've got ok but you have to take the other pieces off in order to change that because that's a bit so so you take the blade the Red Rock okay yeah it doesn't cost anything though so that's cool no no no you can you can make some match Maul you want oh nice Oh an attack damage yeah decay and everything um yeah hmm so you try that for a little bit see if you like it see how it feels just the tip yeah dude thanks man and then we sleep and and so what's what's next um what's next is we should go back to the end and we show you in city and stuff like that yeah all right get in and get myself one level from harvesting couple-week I like to at some point find ourselves the an ice mob an ice dragon okay I think that'd be pretty dope could be cool could be cool yeah we've only found fire I mean and I don't think they'd be much different other than just you know finding a snow biome and kind of checking it out but I'm curious I'm a curious boy okay so what we we also need to we need to have Steve and baby Yoda spend quality time together oh they can do that now I someone was saying that basically they could have done it but you need to stay and make sure that it doesn't leave the earth the chunk unloads and addy spawns or breaks and so it might be that we I think our egg was like I died though or something it it could be that like but I mean are there certainly we're certainly advocating for a much more responsible situation than previously mm-hmm you know right is lifesteal work on this yeah I think it does we've been great done very alive for many times didn't you grab an extra what a guy and I want it give me that I'm trying to find another monster underground to just confirm for sure that it does work oh you big boy Steve you absolute unit yeah 91 days I feel like it a hundred he goes stage five and I'm so here for it have you been feeding more dragon meals because I haven't gotten more dragon meals no okay no I haven't there's been no change since last we discussed where are mobs why are there no mobs I don't have answers I just want a mob so you can check the lifesteal dude I understand guys I have the underwater temple sea castle that battle tower we found yeah that's nice that actually works cool cool that maybe Wonder stick away from a fling here it didn't feel invisible I've liked it there's a weapon but you know you decided to go other routes and I wasn't gonna argue well yeah now I've learned of the error of my way so nice yeah I feel like a king look out world whoa you can shoot fire with this thing yeah yeah you're right click it's actually kind of annoying you don't do it a whole lot but yeah I'm like I didn't want to accidentally fire on baby Yoda it's in and it uses up your thirst oh so I don't I don't use it a whole lot Oh baby Yoda look at you little tyke okay
