all right everyone welcome back to another episode of eggs or eeeh as flies so check them out thanks to them for sponsoring ok man a lot of new stuff huh yeah we've been we've been grinding real hard the girl such grind off-camera we did off camera work voice off camera work otherwise we'd never get anywhere because we weren't getting anywhere yeah dude tell you off-camera things progress things progress dude it goes so much faster that way it's amazing how like when you're not streaming it's crazy like materials they just come to you so quickly it's insane things come together it is the so is it's crazy yeah I mean it's it's wild dude so so hey quick thing here we've decided to relocate the main way stone to here and it's called home isn't that cool that's pretty cool yeah yeah so okay cool also added just a wireless terminal I guess I have it don't have one for you yet but a wireless why are you not what wait control or not oh right I have to click it on the roller Frick hold on there we go all right yeah wireless grids pretty pretty cool so I can do that the only problem is it appears it doesn't actually have a crafting table in it so I might want to yes I can just retrieve items and then craft a minute crafting table separately but years crafting grid yeah yeah you only got a wireless grade not a what oh that's a monitor their mind it's fine it's fine yeah whatever I misread things so anyway here we are yeah so anyway that's that's the smaller stuff the the bigger stuff Wow off camera stuff Wow look at what you does some crazy off-camera work that you've done right there dude I I put together many things there much iron sheet metal was found off-camera that is crazy that off-camera grinding and then and then additionally off-camera work was done such that we have rocket materials we have rocket material yes yes yes so the rest of the four King owl has been completed for the most part we just have to assemble them and yeah but actually it wasn't a great deal more stuff than we already have it's just some stuff more than we already have I see I see you got a waste stone in here did you go exploring and find that where did you pick it up from yeah dude just went flying a little bit they're not that hard to fine you just freaking slime sling hang glide and then you end up places you know it's pretty wild you dude you dude oh you better believe we got a board computer rammer and that we have the mental house coordinates chillin somewhere I think I know what a mental house that's where we gotta go where did I throw the mental house coordinates I need them but either way I can click on the telescope and get it there they are coordinates to mental s and you you made me a you made me a jet pack so I did yeah yeah we got ourselves some jet pack or rooney's oh the other one is actually forgot to pull it out of the system so it's probably just drained all of our power cool cool but I armored them as well so we can fly you know yeah dude it's very exciting alright so yeah what we can do or any oil what the we can do now which is a very excitement is a weekend a build a spaceship yeas and I need to build up my diesel engine a generator still ok this is all just oil distillation you know you got to process the oil before you can actually use the oil so that's where it's what we've been with you know we've been doing grammar says should we tell him about the real spaceship don't don't do this to me don't do this to me let us bask in the glory for a little all right so what we want to do we want to do do you want to build a spaceship erino oh sure Grabavoy Sereno grab blocks I'm assuming it has to be a floaty boy so we'll make it a mostly we'll make it a sleek black spaceship Arino you know hovering a one block above the ground just in case it has to do that wait you've what do oh okay this will be a shift do you need help are you doing this and I mean if you want to feel free to do that and build like the back part and then we have two thrusters I don't know I don't think we even way to throw we design it like it's we're not following a pattern we just make it's like Archimedes ships okay yeah dude which ways the backside you just don't want it to be like I was thinking back side is where you're at right now trying to make it look like a mini space shuttle boys rammer out you're being like just they get a cube I'm like that's no way to travel through space and time I was gonna break that but that's okay we're we are in danger of ending up with a cube just saying no never it's gonna have wings look at these wings dude look at these look at these wings hmm okay it's beautiful this is no sorry this is this is something it is definitely got ourselves something here okay and then does it need to be like fully enclosed or yeah it does it does oh that's pretty that's a tall boy that's a very tall I don't know that we needed to be that much of a tall boy do you want it to be that big of a tall boy I guess I'm just thinking like the the threat of the thrusting back well we only have two so we can't that's the thing is so a hundred blocks here I can I can put it down you show you we got two thrusters can power like two hundred total blocks so we don't want it to be like crazy as all you know yeah okay what I poop actually should we have them hanging out the back that's kind of cool I feel like you have a vision yeah dude it kind of 20/20 you could say good and then actually so we have a glass elevator right there I have good glass what I'm gonna do is we'll have a couple glass like back here just so we can you know everyone's got a reverse spaceship every now and again right and then basics just barely did they're successful didn't they successfully failed I can crew I don't think so I think they like kaboom something though didn't they I thought they made something go boom I mean they had had in the past it had an accident and had blown up but I know I thought they actually purposefully made something kaboom but maybe I was I was wrong oh well if they did it on purpose in that state today was their test for the crude space shot or screwed Dragon capsule escaping when a when a is if a first stage had blown up so basically he's launching them away from the first stage if there was a catastrophic fail so yeah it was to test it was it was a test in case the in case of boom but they didn't actually make boom gotcha okay okay but ya know it as far as I know it went well and so that's pretty groovy I am I am excited I like reading about and seeing things okay and we have a little space a little dome wait wait dude these are wings way what are you doing these are wings they don't need to be they don't need to be big Wang's you've got the pancake eeeh spaceship ever made like I'm try I'm out here trying to build a structure and you're going to build a pancake I'm trying are you hungry do you want flap Joe I don't want there to be too many blocks so the thing doesn't go anywhere okay okay what wait you know whatever you like this is you know I just I just figured we've ridin in a spaceship not in a pancake bro you are saucer too serious like it's not suppose we flying saucer and milk like you know it's just hmm okay this is unbelievable I can't believe I can't I can't even I get all that if I any jumpin hits my head so I guess it's spacious that's fine friendships a crib you expect to be doing calisthenics at launch bud was that a statement that I made Liz I like where am i gay am I supposed to do my calisthenics yes it does look like it's a statement that you made I there are several things wrong with that sentence I don't know what but I can't help but feel like they're not entirely accurate okay okay we have doors as well though so there will be good getting it out okay you you work on your doors if arena that'll be that'll be adorable it will be actually see I think which one okay that's diesel I gave up on you Oh what are you doing what are you doing you got this I'm working on my diesel generator you you build your pancake and then when you're done you let me know dude I'm adding some purple to it Oh purple yeah I do there we go we're gonna get some purple wings out here boys sure it's gonna be the best ever it is actually this this is the best rocket ship that's ever rocketed I should figure out what blocks I need specifically for this you should do that is a sick ship it's so sick yeah yeah well that's cool I'm glad you like it then we got to have a purple little loop on the front absolutely you can't fly a spaceship without a purple Boop exactly and then maybe a couple little Purple's around the tail actually white to blend in with the thrusters that's what we'll do white rear do the thing engineering about generator block radiator yeah there we go boys there we go a couple doors on the old thing Rooney bingo Rooney yeah dude-- yeah dude-- yep it okay and now no don't do that and then fuel tanks and rocket fuel ski doodles and then I got all the I got all of our stuff over here but I didn't know if it's actually needed also there's teleporter thing that it says is is relating to the rocket travel like in here it's like teleporter you can that is a thing but I don't know if it actually matters at all I'll bring it just in case though you don't need it you only need to tell the pet wait we need to tell a pet are there telepaths there's no telepaths here there's no telepods only I don't know where to put the thing down but so see I need four of those per and how many do I need nine so 36 so fuel we only need like one half of this fuel to begin with cool there is that and then some of the stuff can be used yeah okay oh yes I yeah I needs the more I don't know generators the more generator where did I put the over there there I think I think we need like other generators and stuff or something like that and then because it has to be a source of stuff laced down the teleporter oh I guess it has to be the double one okay okay I didn't know it was up with that so what are you talking about guys we did off camera work I can't leave these I can't believe these are you accused of things yeah dude it's it's quite frankly ridiculous I how could you guys accuse him Ram are you saying it you just placed down this teleport block not the not to up down one not the up gentlemen what's up dawg okay you please tell me both what you can't tell me you placed it down and then do you like I actually a place down both boy they sure you can you just did Oy Vey oops all right I guess hopefully yeah I know you've always done so you don't even need to travel back and forth anyway so I need to bring all this stuff around let's just check and see if this thing frickin works dude all right come here gonna see if it works where every something oxygen tank which I actually don't know if we need or not does anybody know if we need the oxygen tank is that like a thing that's necessary placer yeah cuz you can't you can't fill the thing it just exists oh that's for later okay cool well good thing that we don't need it then nice jet packs cool um alright so I think what we need to do yes that is good then we also need like this it's gonna be a loud spaceship and you gotta have the mental house coordinates put in here freaking let me in okay now we put that in there what is what which place is which oh I don't get to use the computer you placed it so it's thoughts like you oh you can't play you can't do it no it may be you can you shifting I can see the coordinates of the top left so if maybe I could anyway whoa weird well we did it we're out we did it we're somewhere out worked this is Bob where we were that's the most unexpected rocket launch I've ever seen this is a very fit listen it moves at the speed of light and light just knows oh maybe the speed of light yeah then there's the faster-than-light module well hopefully when we exit here we don't get vacuumed out good luck go ahead and am i okay hey oh we're high up very high up high up ah you ain't [ __ ] actually we should have some glass at the bottom I didn't realize the glass at the bottom would be a wise decision just yeah readjust our spaceship there this is very high up I wonderfully maintained the same Y and should I wait my gosh what so yeah interesting I can see the outline of the diesel engine a generator what that I was working on the other one like the the immersive engineering diesel running outline remember the projection the projector that would like be like here let me make the outline of it oh yeah yeah it that that that's there it so are just slightly amused Oh like it maintains the same ordinary yeah yeah I see I see so let's get do we weigh stone I guess we can just way stone it on the ground yeah yeah let's waist down there are they nice man's I they seem fine you know it seemed to be go I kind of wish that I could Goomba something all right yeah that's what that's where we are that's what it's called oh yeah look at our let's see a cake up there cool what did white okay okay we're good alright so next up Menelaos lute with the resources i found on mental house I can create new alloys that will help me to build a better rocket or spaceship oh we got to get quantity at a diem quantitative deduction or ingot quantitative deduction or ingot what is this here here's a little space right here why did my I will check dude I found a space rock is it actually called a space rock why does my why did my what whele setting just freak out and change it just changed so now it's over in the left instead of the top middle what the heck did that happen for you did it change your way oh okay it's my way was okay there's a there's a bit of it a bit of it'll drop mine the casual yet I mean it's chill because we got we got springy boots yeah we don't have to use torches on me since that's where we have rocket ships but not torches we just get off camera work okay we had priorities why is why are people questioning that this what are that well that's a brawler what are this there's a right clears a lot of stuff down here oh this is more the the sand that does the spring be sprung II glow tight crystal block so I guess we need to find a quantitative whoa look at all this down here this a nifty boy what is this what is this I can't it's Hugo mu so what how do i how do we adjust does anybody know where we go to adjust the location of whele it's very difficult is it actually I don't know I think they're pain like where it's at is it huge my cell okay I think there is a it's like a CFG slash CFG whele no that's not there interesting block though anyway let's see I'm not I'm not seen any yet mmm yeah I found some stone cool so we're looking let's see what quanta Quan 2/10 quantanium quantanium beanie dust which no nevermind not that look for one probe in the rare earth yeah yeah I don't know why it's once a known but okay we want rare earth and I don't know how to get it worth Oh Menelaos dirt in a centrifuge gets us rare earth I see hey I've already brought some sand back but we can probably find some dirt I was grabbing some torches some torque truest for cheese there was something i typed in once I did this I was prepping another mod pack I did the CFG for whele poop it was a check event names long gone hmm I do like that there's a wand oops I think that's the the redo yeah there's no CFG whele doesn't have anything okie-doke whoa look at all these all right a frickin Firefly okay well anyway Menelaos dirt let's grab it let's grab it I wonder if you can get it out of Menelaos stone well there's some dirt over here in this archway that I was kind of heading towards any hack for one pro but assuming it's not this isn't just regular old dirt this is a grass block this is regular old dirt the one probe disability tunnel what dirt is zero on the numpad definitely isn't it min allows dirt looks like a dirt colors light brown orange in tan I mean this seems like the stone where's the dirt it's like a spider rabbit that's creepy [Music] just quartz okay um well so far I've found not yeah I can't I can't figure out how to change this location so anyway cool cool I hope did not know oh in jei I see mm-hmm these arches but it doesn't seem to translate Tudor what are you so good huh guys tablo's Oh God Oh Holly crap okay Oh don't ever do that don't ever sit what happened oh geez the the Firefly thing don't break it Oh God the Firefly thing oh my gosh there's like little torch lantern beehive kind of things that they don't break it oh okay that's it that's the one yeah that's definitely the one oh my god oh my god the one what that was horrible oh god I put away oh shoot when I was doing all my stuff I put away my sword I came here without a sword I just nope doubt what this is on there fast why are they fast you know you know fast boys I'm jetpacking don't you worry I'm right here that's what I did is I jetpack the hell away and I'm never going in that direction for you my goodness that's that's a bad news bright there you don't want that I told you not to so you decided to curiosity unlived the the jord mmm where's the mint allow seein dirt I have not found any dirt other than like a regular dirt unless there's some perhaps into ray its it's just dirt it's not can we not find men and Laos and dirt Menelaos Ian quartz does that do anything that just gets us Menelaos quartz there's donut I found met allows dirt cuz I'm good at Minecraft where it where are you I am in a pond of water well that doesn't oh hey I think I see you nope I see another pond of water that I think is at the bar the houses the dirts at the bottom of the water yeah okay I see you so I just flew over the top of you and I'm digging up my dirt now yeah dude yeah dude it's a big one it's a people Oh a blocks don't float cuz we ain't in 1.13 boys jetpacks pretty dope I'ma be honest with you it's kind of helpful it it helps it really need to get around it helps this you're trying to get away from spider and likes the worst horrible things ever ya know what that was but they were the in fact the worst horrible things ever yeah have you ever seen you've seen those videos or someone steps on a spider and like 50,000 spiders jump out of it it was that it was the fighter yeah just a wolf spider is it only wolf spiders that are like that no I don't have to be like yes absolutely but as far as I know I only know a wolf spider to do that we have any Iraq the files around here who are very very knowledgeable as one would be if when we were in Iraq a file mm-hmm I mean I guess you could be a like you know an informed rectifier oh I just like them I don't actually studying in this particular in so much how much of dirt do we need I know not but I'm gonna I'm gonna say this is good and dip on back Wow okay nice and also I'm gonna make this I'm gonna see of whele is still forked over here that's just a mental house thing it just Fort why would Menelaos fork my shorts up you gotta wonder you really do well time to get the future pack that up back I got two and a half steps I don't know how much you got I got like a like a stack a Rooney and a half or any wowza Rooney's all right so I need nine radiator blocks man I can't believe that thing just uh you probably poke it and all of a sudden just badness spills out yeah it's it's terrible I I agree with you on that one I'm gonna go get one of the generators from our rocket because I don't want to make another one no no no why are you even a thing why do you it burrows into the ground it wha no it's ridiculous it sounded ridiculous the way you said it like you said it kind of Regulus alright this spaceship is a slow boy all those things look at that purple on there dude what a cool spaceship I've never seen a spaceship quite like it before in my life okay cool we're still good with that and now go ahead so I need the Redstone engineering and 13 heavy engineering I had the redstone didn't we yeah so I need 12 heavy and that's it engineering did I like my sword somewhere what did I put it the rest of the forking out where did I put me sword I'm so I'm so confused did where did I put my sword me sword oh god it's doing the thing what did I what did I do with me sword make a lightsaber that doesn't exist I mean if I were in an alternate realm I would in fact make an attempt to make a lightsaber myself like I can't I can't blame them for the wand the Frick did my thing oh they don't have a throat inside one of these accidentally because it looks like a block yes I did I threw it in there because I was like a block Wow mad at everybody and it's all you so I need 12 so I need to make six agrees so that means I need well 23 Pistons now right laser poo no it's some Pistons I need some business sleeo oh they're called swords excuse you what did I do no that was just he's like make a lightsaber and they're not actually called lightsabers Wow they do they do damn damn Zell I mean damn damn good didn't you have a sudden way to do a whole lot of cobble what was that saying there's something to sand it was sent okay dude okay I'm actually down dude I'm come down I'll make a lightsaber Annie he's gonna make a lifesaver guys if anybody's curious he's making a lighter right now we've gone to a new planet so ergo the lightsaber is the next step wait I mean is that wrong no no no that's what I was about to say is which I frankly do not blame him at all yeah exactly bruh let's see I was making do this a cobble cobble and then it's everywhere I'm sorry do the math I couldn't do the math on how many Pistons I needed because I needed either at 11 or 12 or 13 or something I don't know hmm I think I need 12 9 so 10 11 12 there we go and then I was made what was I making with the piston of the heavy engineering no oh god it's making noise wait drive more stew plates No all right this one's still broken I'm still hanging steel is that one like it be whatever you're fine at least so now we put you in there and things should happen right that's right you just go very slowly or do you put it in one at a time I was going down time oh yeah right click with the old scruncher ooh that's what I said yeah you said that uh-huh Shh don't get mad at me for your sins your front door it's not even open joke's on you joke is on you all right so I need iron dust can I not use ingots why can't I use ingots okay okay it's not cold coke ingots okay that works whatever and that's there's no no no no no me I need I need plates I need me stole my eye Ron whatever it's fine I have it now don't worry there you go weighted plates I need iron any of the iron back don't call me a Luke Goblin you run around with a little sack of your back going night-night [Laughter] you're adorable we love you for it uh-huh CaptainSparklez you're our hero wait how do I do a shift right-click on it whoa what uh-oh okay what do I have to do here with this what the heck oh he was eight oh it's going it's going okay it's going that's good good you got it okay he hit be doing what it do and making noise so what's wrong with this one Kiwi how much the Commission drawing of Jordan is a lute goblin shut your Frick face [Laughter] he's not gonna capitalize on that merch opportunity than look at suing oh my gosh this is so no mini nope it doesn't nope this is a mystery machine of dumb mystery machine he's a mystery machine of dumb gosh darn it if these would work in this refinement of the storage didn't that'd be great but they don't so it's not great mmm yeah I see it be like that and they do what even is a cold can't see it right now steel mechanical components steel with the recycler and I needed 13 so I need one more each one takes two but it gives me two so I just need Frick where did I put the recycler no more being dumb diesel little just now there it is part press and [Music] that stung goes there these guys go here here do I whack you I need to whack you somewhere there it is you've reached the goal dad for the environment nice hey you know I have reached that goal okay high stood yeah thing is is this needs to output any of the I think I put down then these output I need to get some like a high-end backline that's even more than the flux duct or the hardened so much to do I know there really is I'm kind of I'm kind of feeling like I'm gonna I'm gonna do this sword next time because it's not even it's not even contributing this stuff here dude it sounded like a cool idea but I'm over it I'm over I would usually make this lightsaber and I'm like that sounds like a cool idea I'm gonna I'm gonna do it later Oh rare-earth heyy would you look at that yeah yeah I'm gonna focus on the old Questor Rooney's dude ya know you should like I was thinking that same thing and just wondering when you were gonna get going with it I know you were thinking that and so it's great okay so I've acquired a rare-earth how does one take this rare earth and turn it into quantitative all right I don't see how this is acquired oh my god I don't see how to do right so I fill that up with redstone don't put that in there put these in there and then boom now we have I don't know how much per tick Oh tell me is it and you get a walker iam ingot oh boy it's that thing once we find I see how do we this stupid thing to work you have to be smarter than the Stuber oh it won't accept power I it sounds tough it is I think you got this oh I needed that iron tube or whatever nothing and pipe dumb needs a better core why would it need a better core if it already exists this way why would it not why would I not be able to create it with what it needs ask yourself not why but why not that's dumb okay then dang it yeah you're not you're not using this right now are you all right my lever posit where do you go yeah that's input right blue is input are you not turned on you turned on there's only turn on when there's output maybe that's what it is you turn down real good buddy ah still not working sometimes things don't work the way you want them to all right so that's all working that I need to replace mine why am i literally building a frickin PC right now have you tried downloading more ram max temp 200 I might need to it got three core this is the three core what does this thing need what does it need then what do you want from me apparently we're on different processor infrastructure too much RAM oh yeah it needs a six core what you need to download less Ram I can't some Ram I can't get a six core without getting quantanium the hell dude it's not possible okay oh look when you're taking it oh my god it's a random chance of how many cores oh my god get the Frick out of here I hate future packets trash what terrible mod you get a random chance of how many cores and will you build the damn thing it doesn't work and you have to do a random lottery in order to even get the game the freaking machine to work sounds about right yeah that sounds like what you're up against like from what you were saying that does sound correct this is so dumb get a weaker Ram sure we all know that your machines work better when they have less RAM I mean technically Java does does it really ok standard Ram iron and silicon kind of Java's garbage collection is kind of trashed so when you have too much RAM you can actually end up causing yourself lag because it does the garbage isn't isn't that redundant garbage collection is kind of trash ok Java is garbage collector it's javis collection system is trash not the mm-hmm no it's not redundant you're just simple I'm a simple man and mechanically inclined mechanically in quite at this point I ask for clarification it's like you can't it's a freaking lot is ridiculous this is absolutely stupid and ridiculous I need less RAM give me less I got a 2 - Ram do they have to match I sort of got if they have to match I will end everything well if you don't match it then you don't get then you're a lot less likely to be supporting of dual-channel or triple channel or even quad channel it's still not getting power this should be all feeding from there yeah that's that should be fine so what is wrong with this thing what is wrong with this stupid in God dang Mon what is why did why can't I just make a machine and have it work so I'm sensing you're upset right now yes that has 2 and that's a 3 this is this should work yes Frick this Frick should work should but does it this is the exact same attributes a core 3 standard and a ram 2 there and then this is good 3 core and that's a ram 2 there and its borked wet thank you you what which is the licks very wet licks oh my god what the hell what is wrong okay did that so what I could do this advice - do I have to give it my firstborn because you happily with yeah I'm actually being I am actually being told like cheatin another one because this is actually ridiculous for some reason what guys we can't do that we will not risk the integrity of our series headed that way I have no power to that okay I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do is everyone is everyone okay with this we might need to sleep oh we might be out of power I did see it has nothing to do it this is a separate power system nation okay but we can sleep if you would prefer yes please okay yes I'm doing with power issues which ironically I need power in order to get build these last few things so that I can all wow that was quick night yeah no the core power in the RAM do not have to match as is demonstrated by the centrifuge having two and three this two and three and it doesn't frickin work could be a visual glitch I don't know I don't know but I wanted no one what do you want I'm gonna do me will do it I'm getting new ones I'm gonna get a new one and we'll see if it is actually Borka fide we'll see if it's Borka fine that doesn't sound legitimate to meet my friend okay so this is the earnest it's an experiment to see if wait I don't actually know which the new one was that I gave me okay I must be this one why did it work why did just a new block work what the hell what the hell it was just broken I don't understand I don't understand I must go journey to Mordor and throw in the fiery pits I hate tone announcer hand I don't understand at all well I don't know how the rest of you all but I consider this episode of success I'm going to Mordor okay who are you gonna Mordor I'm ordering the Industrial neon and furnace all right I'm looking for Mordor I know it's somewhere around here yes it looks like Mordor to me okay you actual garbage garbage garbage one collection does not simply not work when it's crafted and in an extreme cinematic fashion it was down it was done I threw it into Mordor oh look at the power come in powerful stuff yeah I don't care about that Ram I don't care about that Ram I can download more it's fine we're here it's their great new Ram good horsepower that's five horsepower RAM and nice that's that's five horsepower Ram yeah dude it's a stock that is a stock two horsepower Ram three horsepower core and everything is good okay nice dude nice yeah what can I turn this on and still be gaining power it's running and I'm still getting power okay so now now I must Center for you on the rare earth you are not on if I turn you on as well am I still getting power with everything running yes I'm net positive power wow did you just make fusion work is it viable oh I'm burning through oil but but but otherwise you know as long as we as long as our oil reserves don't give out the replies then everyone knows we don't have to ever ever have to worry about that we're making it boys we're making it need to go you've to make it do it there we go make I have to reek lick on the generator apparently every time that I want to do this for very good stuff it's unbelievable dis unbelievable I don't like it don't like it at all Walker iam okay three four five three four okay so that's going up barely but it's going up okay we might have decent power generation for a half minute only half minute though and then it goes down well until we run out of oil it's working oh my god I know I have neon blocks for flying boys we're fine don't you worry don't sure I am aware of the presence of them we have coaches we do hey we get walker IAM dude oh this is good disc and then we need that lapiz lazuli lapiz loves you like excuse me it's Lasley you're a Lasley lap 'yes Lasley lamp is lands lean all right we got five walker eum's oh this is poppin dude everything is going so well it is actually going well I'm about to achieve another achievement now the thing that we're going for here is that I hope I really do hope we don't
