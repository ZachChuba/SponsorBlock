say what you will about apple and google and everybody else who makes disposable phones when you buy a higher-end phone usually what you're buying is longevity i ran my iphone 6s plus into the ground honestly i'm not sure if i'm gonna be able to do that with my 11 pro max because there's so many more points of failure despite the fact that the thing is not repairable which is where this comes in this is the terror cube it's well it's something completely different this is something we've been trying to kind of find a spot for for a while now let's just say it's been buried by more glamorous products it's just it's not that interesting from a technical standpoint but i'll tell you what it is it is at least purportedly sustainable let's take a look at their website real quick i have to look at something there's nothing on this box that tells me what it is aside from a phone uh in fact i don't even think it says that it's a phone thank you for making a difference nope nope nope that's it it's a tear cube you gotta know what that is here we go it's the next evolution of sustainable smartphones most smartphones last an average of two years or less i beg to differ but i at the same time i know people keep them for less than two years they offer a four year warranty with this thing as well as four years of support tierracube phones are engineered in service to last up to four years and beyond serviced so let's see game changing four year warranty which is well yeah a lot because most phones come with like a one year warranty in north america here's a list of the things that the warranty doesn't cover defects or damage resulting from accidents neglect misuse or abnormal use so this is the the the apple kit this is where that apple care thing would would come in the flat fee repairs scratches dents and cosmetic damage unless caused by terror cubes so if you sent it back for repair and it came back scratched they would obviously cover that defects for damage resulting from excessive force ordinary wear and tear devices that have the serial number uh removed defaced or damaged okay yeah okay so it's pretty it's pretty standard stuff so it's made with 25 recycled polycarbonate not quite on the level of the fair phone but it is still a good thing to have oh it's got a headphone jack great that's actually great like i i sound like i'm not super enthused but like i've got wired headphones that i can't use with my new phone without a dongle and that dongle is eventually going to go into the landfill as well right so i didn't even get a dongle with my iphone 13 yeah they stopped doing it with stock android with three years of updates okay cameras i mean megapixels don't really matter so i can't really tell much from this it's got pin fingerprint okay face unlock wi-fi they don't say what wi-fi it is 4g not 5g and it's got a usb-c port and a separate micro sd card slot okay what is the best thing anyway so why haven't we looked at this earlier jono yeah there's there's a reason why we're looking at it now we missed the review cycle on this thing by about six months i think maybe nine months might be a baby let's get into the box shall we no it's very unassuming like the box is entirely it's like it's entirely cardboard again that's less stuff that's going into the landfill looks like it comes with a case is that dust or is it like it looks like it's the same color as this so it looks like it's just dust on it but it's not it's kind of interesting it looks like it's like pre-scuffed it's like fatigued or um stressed jeans interesting there's a little pack of snack which you shouldn't eat but you know it's it's what every kid dreams of eating [Music] and that's about it you've got your documentation here i guess and uh whatever this is better for your pocket better for the planet where is the charger what you have in your hand is the world's most minimalistic and eco-friendly smartphone packaging made with 50 less materials recycled paper soy inks while eliminating redundant accessories like the charger you know the less weight you have to transport the less volume you have to transport the less fuel is actually burned per unit that you're transporting if you need one you can get one at their website or literally anywhere and then we have this dear customer thank you for your support in bringing tara cube2e to life tierracube 2e is crafted from 25 recycled plastics i dropped the card and the included case is fully biodegradable if you enjoyed terracube give us a on your favorite social media and share with your friends and family they're actually telling you how to open the back oh and it's got a screen protector on it too oh it wait what the back came off with with the case like the back is literally in here okay yeah it doesn't come off super easily but easily enough and there's that battery it's big and green and there's the sd card slot right there fingerprint sensors there i don't really see a whole lot else where's the sim card slot am i just blind oh no they're there there's two sim card slots right there that i was looking at but refused to recognize in any way shape or form so let's just take that peel off there i am all right let's get this thing back together and get it booted up but first let's talk to you about the reason why we decided to take a look at this this far after its release and that is for team c's team seas is a new initiative kind of like the team trees one from mr beast and mark rober and us and everybody else who got involved and um it was successful to put it mildly and in this case team seas is looking to do the same thing but for pounds of garbage floating around in the ocean um i don't know if you know this about me but i've basically lived near the water for my entire life like i've lived basically on a coast like i live here which is right next to the pacific ocean and i lived in newfoundland pretty much near the harbors and yeah it would be nice to be able to have that for future generations and also to still have that for me to go back to it'll be there it'll just be like piled up with trash yeah and this is designed to really deal with that kind of problem i don't know if this is an official team seize thing or not this is kind of where the sponsor spot normally goes but we're gonna go ahead and say go and donate some money to team seas it's a very worthy cause like there is a massive amount of garbage in the ocean and it is a massive problem like have you noticed that there's a giant garbage patch floating around in the pacific ocean and it's just kind of like swirling out there like a giant toilet and there's nowhere for it to go it's just generally a good thing to clean that up because it's going to affect marine life it's going to affect our food chain like there are many people who depend on the ocean for their food and yeah it's just a really good cause and i think that you should probably look into it jono tells me there's going to be a link below that you can click and find out all about it so i guess maybe it is technically a thing that we're doing not sponsored all right let's let's uh let's shove this battery in put the back on see if it powers up it feels so weird yeah and i mean fair foam was like that too but it was like kind of chunky and the back like you had to really rip at the back to get it off this is like kind of like the old school phones where it's like yeah back just comes off tara cube it's pretty bright it is an ips display and also i mean yeah i can see pixels so if i were holding it up like this and kind of like looking at it yeah it doesn't look that bad come to think of it i had like this kind of pixel density with my galaxy nexus what a fitting wallpaper for this it's not snappy then again it just did just boot up so let's give it a sec yeah it's downloading stuff from google play let's just give it a minute help make chrome better no google i don't care about you anymore i use duckduckgo now i i will say the vibration motor it feels like a cheap phone a vibration motor it's not like punchy it just like it's it's not super smooth i'll tell i'll tell you that much well it's 1.8 gigahertz right or 1.9 um also that screen protector feels kind of tacky like doing this like i can feel it like sticking i don't know i don't know if this is gorilla glass or any kind of fun glass underneath oh there is an update available this update was released in may which should tell you something about how long we've been holding on to this uh you know what i'm going to log into the play store so i can download like minecraft or something and now i need verification oh wait somebody clearly logged me in okay if someone just said yes to you yeah [Laughter] do we not own minecraft on this account what the hell why is it wait what why does it want me to buy it it's in my library i'm not gonna buy minecraft again i'll just install gentian impact it's got environments i've never played that game surprisingly this was only 200 megs so i'm guessing it's gonna need to download more data you actually downloading impact what that frame rate does not look good that's all you wanted to see right that's all i'm going to get unless i log in let's watch the latest short circuit or we could watch you know crab rave we can also test all these speakers that was the idea oh look crab wave right there first history hit yeah youtube app crashed that was cool starting to regret not getting that update i don't care yes it was it sounds pretty crunchy what it crashed again i'm gonna install the update fine there it goes it's one and a half gigs it's going to take a couple of minutes it'll probably take a little longer to install too oh i want to like this thing but it's giving me very little reasons to okay cool okay i was gonna say did the updater just crash [Music] rule 34 oh cool it just finished all right let's try that again crab champions gameplay the contrast ratio looks pretty good even knowing that it's 720p thankfully at 720p that's like rgb ips so that means that uh we're not limited to like pentile resolutions like my galaxy nexus was okay it's pretty good at the um the old treble this is my iphone oh god it's running it's playing i i forgot i hit it once playback speed [Music] uh yeah it's not even close i mean to be clear um this isn't the best i've ever heard a smartphone sound but um this is less than that then again i mean how much is this thing i don't i don't actually know it's two two hundred dollars all right that makes it a lot more understandable oh yeah angry birds i was downloading angry birds let's see if that works um it was smooth until the explosion okay now it's smooth so i just needed to load that asset i guess let's just quickly see how the waifu simulator works i mean it's it's not so much a waifu simulator as it is a waifu collection and like a collect-a-thon it's like i gotta catch them all kind of thing gotta wipe them on like i'm not sure if this is no this is definitely not pre-rendered if it is then that having an inconsistent frame rate is even worse let's try the camera actually that doesn't look too terrible lol what's the selfie camera playing [Music] i guess let's let's try a video and we can get a bit of the uh the microphone as well so uh i don't think it's got any stabilization whatsoever but i'm going to kind of try and stabilize it with the swivel of the chair here like if i try if i try to pan it myself it's just going to be like maybe it's got like digital stabilization but i don't think it has optical stabilization okay that microphone super quiet for one two it doesn't sound so great it sounds kind of scratchy then again some of the speakers at 200 it's hard to fault it that much all the little issues that i have with this phone they're like oh well this is this is what i would expect from like a five or six hundred dollar phone i would expect these things to work and i'd expect them to work well with that being said the idea that this phone will last for four years becomes a little um dubious like it's not necessarily that the phone itself won't last that long it's that you won't last that long with the phone because you're not going to stick with it so yeah i mean i don't want to call it e-waste because like obviously it does have a reason to exist and i'm not the person that this phone is marketed towards however i'm not sure who like this is the kind of experience that i kind of got out of the the linux phones like you can do stuff but it's not there yet you know i think maybe if they gave it another couple of generations they could get there at this price point as it is right now though why i think the process there's a lot of the problem like everything is is ticking the boxes for something that like for a budget phone and a environmentally conscious phone that you're going to keep for a while this chipset this soc is just not strong enough to last that four years i would argue that it was obsolete like at the time it was released that's the terror cube unfortunately i really wish them the best this is a good idea like four year warranty four-year software support like that's great i want to see more of that and i don't want to put that down it's just it's let down by the anyway this was a disappointment unfortunately but not all short circuits are so make sure you get subscribed and follow so you don't miss any unboxings like this one and not like this one
