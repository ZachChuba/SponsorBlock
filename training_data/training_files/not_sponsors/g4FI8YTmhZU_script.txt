hi so we just moved much work now i have to set this room up one week later this is my room after one week at least i have my computer set up two weeks later this is fine this is just fine i realize every time i try to get up and make a video i remember i have to screw something or cut something or fix something or something at this rate i would never be able to make a video so i thought to myself forget about it let's just make a video so i thought let's give you a tour of our new place everyone must be dying to know where this place is that i'm putting so much work into if they knew there was a new place i was putting work into we got this place a while back and did a major renovation on it in fact you have seen a little bit of this place before renovation in one of my old videos this room is actually the same place i found the short circuit inside what what's going on here what the hell is going on here destiny anyway without further ado let's show you around the house this is our fuse panel let's see what it has in store for us wow look at all these breakers it's like the future in north america a bunch of other countries already had these these are what you call rci or they gave us the option to either install these or a main surge protector to protect the entire house and i decided on these i thought these will protect our lives rather than the surge protector that protects devices let me see if there is any other hidden treasures inside the panel there you go oh wait these are like cb combination arc fault circuit interrupter these are different than rci or gfci huh now you don't go ahead and open your fuse panel i opened it because well i can now you see these alternating prongs right and left all the ones on the right are one phase and all the ones on the left are another phase and so you see that for example this top breakers are one phase the second one is the next phase first phase second phase and so on and as you see they typically show one face with black and the other one with red but it seems like here they should have shown both red but one of them is black and on this side pretty much all of them are shown with black i don't know what the standard is anymore and once in a while you see two breakers gang together like these turning on and off both phases these are used typically to power things that require 240 volt instead of 120 volt like dryers electric ovens car chargers and things of that sort now this is probably the first place in north america i live in that has 240 volt within the phases let me measure it for you you see i guess now the house is initiated to electro boom i guess it's never a good idea to take your eyes away from what you're measuring read it is it 240 volts let's put this back together if you remember when i was living in an apartment the voltage between the faces was 208 volts because they were 120 degrees out of phase we didn't even want to change this fuse panel and house wiring you know how expensive it is to change all these we were forced it will be probably another month or so before i can put all these in order so much for my hobbies but at least if and two audible originals do it now this is gonna pay for my stupid fuse panel anyway in houses we have a single high voltage phase which is that wire at the top which is around 10 to 11 kilowatts i think i wish i could access it to measure it accurately it would be my last day though the high voltage line feeds into these transformers that converts it down to 220v volt ac 180 degrees out of phase and each one of these transformers seems to be feeding like every six to ten houses so each one of these transformers reduces the high voltage by around 100 times so for example if each house needed like 100 amps it would mean only around one to two amps on the high voltage line so if the high voltage line could do say 100 amps it could easily feed over 50 houses so it seems in apartment buildings they take three-phase high voltage and using a three-phase transformer convert it down to three-phase 120 volt ac with 120 degrees out of phase which means 208 volt between phases and take two of these phases and feed into each apartment like i measured in my previous home they have to cut that tiny bridge but in houses they connect a single high voltage phase into a transformer like this the secondary has a center tab connected to neutral and each side of the winding creates 120 volt ac that are 180 degrees out of phase which means there is 240 volts between the two phases of course 240 volt ac means there is 33 percent more power available compared to 208 volt ac so i'm in good shape but what does my afci breaker actually do and more importantly would it interfere with my tests a combination afci breaker provides protection against parallel arcing lined to neutral series arcing a loosen broken or otherwise high resistance segment in a single line ground arcing from line to neutral or ground overload protection and short circuit protection each year in the united states over 40 000 fires are attributed to home electrical wiring these fires result in over 350 deaths and over 1400 injuries i guess this is very good that i have afci it would have detected that short circuit that i found before the renovation but does it mean that i can't make arcs anymore that would be a disaster you probably remember my super dangerous high voltage microwave oven transformer it draws around five to eight amps i think from the power lines always makes me nervous it draws that much current at no load but it doesn't trip the breaker now if i interrupt the power to it [Music] clearly it's not tripping the afci although i can see arcs what kind of arcs does it need then maybe it needs arcier arcs let's give it a try still not tripping never ever try this at home but it's good for me it means that i can continue with my tests but would the afci pop if say water pour on my live wires and shorted them so to test that i have some salt water here to short my live wires and create some arc hopefully oh there you go arcing in there definitely tons of currents don't try this at home what for the love of god what kind of arcing should i have to create before this afci pops i have to go research on it a little bit i think maybe if i just keep it long enough damn the water is boiling now and those arcs could create fire i don't know man i'm confused well let's see if the afci works like gfci at all tripping on fault currents running from live to ground probably not gfci trips at fault currents above five milliamps so i'm gonna put 18 kilo ohms between live and earth and it doesn't trip now if i remember correctly rci or rcd which is the same as gfci that protects the entire house trips on fault currents over 30 milliamps so i'm using a 39 kilo ohm resistor between live and earth still doesn't trip you know what let me just directly place my lamp between live and earth live and neutral are connected where's my earth the hell is wrong with my wire oh well my wire is broken trying again with another wire 18 kilo ohm for over 5 milliamps nothing 3.9 kilo ohms for over 30 milliamps still nothing 2.2 kilo ohms for over 50 milliamps it popped hey there it is so it does pop if the fault current is too high so it does kind of work like gfci tripping at currents over 50 milliamps so you will receive a massive shock before it trips in any case we didn't want to change our fuse panel it's a stupid funny story let me tell you you see these ugly bulky baseboard heaters they run on hot water that's heated by my gas water heater i was going to replace all of them with electric baseboard heaters yes gas is much cheaper than electricity but i was thinking of the planet i thought if i could afford it now maybe in the future the price of electricity will drop or i would install solar panels and could afford it easily those electric baseboard heaters would look much nicer and slimmer too but then we hit an obstacle most old houses around here are supplied by 100 amp maximum and to go with electric baseboard heaters i had to upgrade to 200 amps install a new electric pole and new wiring and everything it would be over 10 kilohertz i mean thousand dollars so i thought sorry planet it's too expensive the best we can do is to go with very efficient gas water heaters it is so quiet here i can't yell see the house wires connect to the city power lines and run through air with these wires all the way to the side of each house our power wires were running all the way to the side of my house here the city inspector came in and said hey these are so close you can grab them it can't be like that so he forced us to install this new post then the wire must run all the way into the ground and run all the way under the ground and then go into the house so after installing the water baseboard heater we still had to spend the money and install a new electric pole and everything go to audible.com electro boom so i thought now that you forced us to spend the money upgrade to 200 amps too i could use 200 amps and that's the story why we ended up with a 200 amp system but kept our stupid gas baseboard heaters well maybe at some point i'll buy an electric car and also all the lights in my house are led edison lamps edison lamps edison lamps edison lamps the only thing these light bulbs borrow from the old edison lamps is their shape otherwise they are led and run on modern silicon technology these light bulbs are typically made dimmer than this type but they also use half the power so efficiency is the same wherever the light bulb is exposed we use these ones because they are prettier otherwise we use these ones because they are brighter see every one of these led strings is made of a bunch of tiny leds in series and last but not the least are these safer power outlets trying to mimic uk power outlets these guys have tiny doors on their live and neutral hole so a stupid kid can't shove a metal object in them how do you open them though the stupid kid would have to shove two metal objects one in each hole to open them up i'm a little bit baffled about how this thing is any safer i mean if you shove something into live you will very likely survive especially with gfci or other protection but if the stupid kid insists on opening those doors and shoves two things in there he will put live and neutral across his chest and gets electrocuted in uk you have to shove something into the ground hole to open those tiny holes worst case you place your body between life and ground rcd pops and you're safe can someone please clarify why the north american ones are safer than before i suppose it stops babies the best listening to their favorite audiobooks and thanks for watching
