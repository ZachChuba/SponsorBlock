hi today I want to take some popular kids toys and make them more exciting for me at least I asked about which toys to use on Twitter and got tons of answers from people who also think children have it too easy and need more stimulation these are some popular harmless toys and that's what's wrong with them because no pain no gain you will strive to do better when you know the punishment for losing is severe and you will enjoy your win much greater when you see the pain in your opponent's face so let's just jump right into it turning these into some safe and execution devices then I'll play with my daughter the first game I didn't even bother to buy it's a fun game you can build at home you just need to bend some thick wire then you just drill two holes in a piece of wood then you shove your bent piece of wire in the holes and boom you're done now we loop another piece of wire around the first one that will go around our wire maze like this now we put some electric tape around the base of the wire to create an isolation area between the two wires and boom we are done connecting the two wires acts like a switch now we need a circuit that this will close to show us that the wires are touching if you don't know what a circuit is watch my last video where I almost set my room on fire for my circuit I simply connected the switch in series with a light bulb and power lines that I can plug in now all we need to do is to avoid touching the wires and if we touch them the light will turn on and let us know I'm doing so the proof-of-concept worked too well it shocked me and it blew up and it's lethal so don't try this at home we need to run it at a much safer voltage like a 9-volt battery we just need an LED series with a resistor and now when I connect them together it just turns on harmlessly now we need to find a sweet spot between harmless and lethal my idea is to use a circuit that creates harmless electric shocks those circuits are super simple their main character is a transformer with much more secondary windings compared to primary now all you need to do is to momentarily charge the primary of the transformer by switching the supply across it and that creates magnetic fields in the transformer now when you open the switch those magnetic fields collapse creating a super high voltage across the secondary this is what's used in those novelty stocking toys exactly like an old car ignition coil with common primary and secondary and if I connect like 2 volts across the primary and let go oh this was strong really with just 2 volts Wow does it mean I can get shot with a single double-a battery went through my entire body this has great potential see I'm measuring the output divided by 100 and I get spikes that jump 40 volts which is like four thousand volts on the output well you get the idea but let's not use our own homemade taser for this because this video is sponsored by expressvpn and we can't risk killing anyone in a sponsored video but you can have a safely protected internet or get access to the contents that's not available in your area just go to expressvpn comm / electro boo and get three months of free service on a one-year package it's like less than seven dollars a month check it out check it out so since I want my toys to safely shock people let's use what's commercially available like this toy electrocuting gun rather than my homemade taser you can see how bad it shocks it's getting shot this is pretty painful too let's try it one more time how I hate it let's try it one more time well this one was giving me a single strong shock but this one is giving me a milder shock what repeats it fast and continuous so it's pretty painful too now if we open the shocker we'll see that there is the tiny transformer here and the circuit that switches it on and off a battery and a switch and the output is connected between the conductive trigger and an external metal plate there is also an LED for fun so all we need is to use our toy as the switch to turn the Shocker on so I also added a wooden handle for this and the two sides of these Tiny's - each one connects to this wire and the other one to this wire and the output connects to these two wires that I connect to both sides of this wooden handle here we are my beautiful contraption is done and I added aluminum Falls to both sides to make sure if you pick this handle you definitely touch the outputs it is also a good idea to add a switch on this to make sure it turns off otherwise the batteries will die quickly okay ready let's try it out [Applause] [Music] Oh works I guess it's better than Russian Roulette next toy the jack-in-the-box is my daughter's suggestion but it's a baby's toy I don't know if I want to chuck babies I guess I could modify it so that when this guy jumps up it shocks the baby or even better I can make it jump up at a random spot in the music so that gets surprised too I don't think I want to scar babies for life I'll just connect the output of the Shocker to the handle and shock my daughter and we will bond over playing these games so here is the jack-in-the-box contraption you just turn it on and anyone touches the handle will be shocked many people suggested the game operation it's a simple game you just have to remove stuff from this patient without touching the sides otherwise it'll boss and you lose so this metal connecting to that metal would be the switch to turn on my shocker so I wrap electric tape around the tweezer and I wrap one of the wires around the tweezer metal for switch and the output of the Shockers I'll wrap them around the electric tape something like this now we just wire up another one of these suckers and we are good to go done what I had to disconnect is alarm circuit because it was interfering with the Shocker circuit but who needs an alarm when you get shocked let's remove something a bit challenging now yeah I think the surprise factor makes it hurt more and the last game is Rock'em Sock'em which team will be Rock'em Sock'em this is a simple boxing match played by two people and when one hits the other the losers head pops up and that's when we want to shock the loser there you go aluminum foil to the rescue now when the guy gets punched the two methyls contact and the switch closes okay one side is done with electrodes on one handle only not between the two handles because we don't want to run electricity through body now let's see if it works how yeah it works now I have to just add the same thing to the next player and we'll be done hi today we are with electrocute and we want to try a few games so which one should be start first my favorite day why are you thinking yeah go ahead you know I try see it's so simple you just keep going like this yes I have to turn it on no wait wrong Church get the merge you have to be very careful it's not too hard so you just have to avoid touching the other wire and their wings where did I touch here yeah pouch ok your turn go right at the beginning okay let me try oh okay let me try again [Music] oh this one was bad ouch that's right sure go ahead let me turn it on you have a new contestant yeah try this do you think it's a good game to play in a holidays with family not you want to do that do you want to do this jack in the box turn it on okay go ahead I feel like it's okay it's good now why are you dumping me because I made it so it always apps you exactly wouldn't but Jack person jumps out is it good no I think that's fine you play I played you just get zapped you don't know get fine that's played once the whole time down hold it forever oh oh oh let me see if I can get numb but hold no I can't hold it okay next game is the Rock'em Sock'em the best modified game in the universe ready lucky ok again again at the same time nice okay one more time what is it score you're ahead huh okay let's do it again three three one more time because I have to beat you let's get the car it's a long way the first one to four wins or two you win yeah what do you think of this game that was lucky though next time you lose you won't like a game to watch so let's play the next game there's no operation yes just go first take out the person who takes more out wings one two three four this is so easy five this game is for kids six obviously seven I did seven let's see how good you do [Music] [Laughter] there you go I still lost though Oh [Music] my turn again I feel like every time I get shocked I jump up and limits harder than you do does it mean that I'm more sensitive than you [Music] after all the shocks I've received a develops just tune your turn 3 you still win ok we're done now between all these games which one was your favorite operation why but this one was my favorite because it's shark's harvest and this is the only game that I wore [Laughter] you know maybe they grow to hate each other well that was fun for me at least your original location so check them out and thanks for watching
