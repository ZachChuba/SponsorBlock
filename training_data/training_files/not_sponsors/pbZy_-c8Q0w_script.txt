[Applause] this video is brought to you by Squarespace so last week we were all given a look at Joaquin Phoenix's Joker for the first time and the footage was everywhere we didn't even get a full trailer just a screen test with like less than a minute of footage but that was enough to kind of set the internet on fire for a few days with even people well beyond the usual comic book movie crowd weighing in on the Clown Prince of crimes new look and the reason for that is pretty simple I think the Joker just means a lot to people whether they grew up reading him in the comics think of him first as Mark Hamill's voice or were first exposed to him in the Dark Knight he's a character that's managed to stay relevant since 1940 and I think it's pretty hard to argue that any other comic book villain comes even close to topping him in sheer popularity so today I'm gonna take a deeper look at the Joker and touch on many versions of him that have graced screens both big and small in the past to try to talk about the new movie and try to explain exactly what about him resonate so much with people since 2008 Heath Ledger's version of the Joker has been pretty inescapable online from fan films to memes to just about anything else you can imagine and after 10 years of that I think it's actually become a little too easy to take for granted just how effective that performance really is he's only in the movie for a little over half an hour but in that relatively small amount of time he developed a take on the character that all iterations of the Joker sense kind of exists in the shadow of but while a lot about this version of him was new most notably the stripped down greasy look and the creepy body language that Ledger perfected the Dark Knight's Joker still gets at what I think is the simple universal appeal of the character and you know forgive me if this is kind of obvious but he looks at the rules and structures of society and he just laughs at them he makes most authority look really really dumb and on top of that he has a really great time doing it and even if we know that the Joker is evil and are ultimately cheering for Batman to bring him down that's still a really fun trait for a villain and maybe even more importantly it's a very malleable trait yes that dark comedic anarchy works great in the Nolan Batman universe but a less brutal version of it works really great in kids cartoons comics games and pretty much any other adventure story imaginable there may be a ton of differences between Ledger's Joker and Cesar Romero's Joker but that sense of mean-spirited joy is the same and that's kind of always what made the Joker cool because really there's nothing more cool than not caring what anyone else thinks about you it creates a kind of mystique okay not that kind of mystique but still and I think that's a huge reason why both kids in the 40s and adults in 2008 latched onto the character how well they pull this off really separates good and bad versions of the character and yeah by bad I do mean the Jared Leto version between the forehead tattoo the teeth and Jared Leto just being Jared Leto the strain and effort that went into making this version of the Joker seem edgy and cool is apparent in every scene he's in Suicide Squad is almost beating you over the head with it telling you whoa get a load of this guy he's crazy and I don't think the character really needs that in the Dark Knight Nolan doesn't shoot the Joker really any differently from any other character there's not a lot of Dutch angles to convey his badness or anything like that the performance is allowed some room to breathe and to speak for itself and where Ledger's take feels very lived in and real Leto's Joker feels more like a collection of gimmicks and facial tics but let's move beyond ledger and Leto and talk a bit about Phoenix's Joker this might be kind of controversial but I have to say I really like the look it's not comics accurate but really after so many different takes on him through the years does that even mean anything anymore he's got a lot less going on than Leto's Joker and he looks like a clown you'd see like on the poster for some soon-to-be closed circus I don't know I think it works still I'm very interested to see how they tackle this origin story we're talking about a character that hasn't needed the definitive origin in almost 80 years so it's kind of hard to make the case that he absolutely needs one but I don't think that means the movie is absolutely doomed to failure anything it looks like they're building off the killing jokes comedian origin story and maybe even getting some real-world comedians like Marc Maron in the film which I think's pretty promising and if they go with the Joker is kind of an unreliable narrator it won't be hard to get people to accept this movie as one self-contained possible Joker origin story especially and probably most importantly if the script is good there's a reason people care just as much about a new Joker as they do Batman Doctor Who or James Bond well he might not be the lead of the franchise well okay I guess he is now but traditionally anyway taking on the Joker is just a huge risk not only are you filling the shoes of some legendary actors there's also no real way to go understated with it The Joker is many things and subtle isn't one of them so any actor hired really has to go big every time even if their take on the character is nothing like say Jack Nicholson's and it's exciting to see different actors try out that high wire act inhabiting that character we all know while also trying to bring something new to the table and the stakes are pretty high to a mediocre Batman performance isn't gonna attract all that much attention it'll just kind of be bland but a mediocre Joker performance is worse than planned it's kind of embarrassing I'd be surprised if that's what we got from Phoenix though I've seen some fans online kind of get upset that he's not going super method with it like ledger or Leto did and I think that's kind of goofy different actors have very different processes when you look at Joaquin Phoenix's movie choices in the last 15 years or so it's pretty clear that the guy isn't just chasing a paycheck very often I mean I liked the master but it wasn't exactly ever gonna set the box-office on fire I think he's a guy very committed to his craft so even if playing the Joker is just another job for him I mean he's really really good at his job so I'm not gonna criticize him for that so I have some hopes for this one I really think this movie might surprise some people I displace it a fitting end for you Joker really though whether any of these movies pan out or if they're all terrible Batman's nemesis will always be a cultural icon because the mannequin deranged joy that he brings to any situation from the straight-laced 40s to the campy 60s to the angry 80s to today will always be appealing and even though he's constantly slightly reinvented as the times changed that core is always there a core that has made the Joker the single most iconic villain in the history of comics one thing I really noticed when making this video is just the sheer amount of Joker fan art online I don't think any of the other famous characters I've covered have come anywhere close and a lot of it is really great too but going from a hobbyist to domain that link will be in the video description and the pend comment below already join captain midnite new 19:40 play patrols you'd better hurry up and
