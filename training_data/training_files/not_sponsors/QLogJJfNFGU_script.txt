Squarespace the best way to make an amazing website hey guys it's max today I am super excited to be bringing you guys a comparison between the brand-new 2020 MacBook Air in the mid 2019 base model MacBook Pro there has been an excellent value macbook that we have been highly recommending and we're gonna figure out which one of these machines is the best value for most people now we're not only gonna be talking about specs and performance for the CPU and the graphics which are important we're also going to look at things such as the keyboard the speakers webcams microphones displays we're gonna look at video editing performance some gaming and also we're gonna look at thermals and I'll show you guys the insides of these two machines we're gonna test how hot they get and what is their performance under loads so let's get right into it now as I stack these up I do want to say that we have links to both of these down in the video description below both the new models and also very good discounts and also some refurbished ones so if you guys are looking to buy definitely go and check that out and I hope support our channel helps us to keep making videos like these ones especially when we're stuck at home being quarantined here so you guys can see that these machines basically look identical if I just stack them on top of each other the footprint is the same and if we look at the back over here and it really looks identical now what is different is when we look at the front the MacBook Air has its classic wedge shape that I personally really like whereas the MacBook Pro has its standard kind of more of a boxy squarish design and then if we look from the side over here you guys will see that a little wedge cut out and that makes the MacBook Air a little bit more comfortable in the hand to hold and makes it feel like it's kind of thinner and smaller that was a very smart design just design decision by Apple when they designed the first one whereas the MacBook Pro definitely does feel chunkier now as far as weight differences this one comes in at 3 pounds the MacBook Pro whereas the MacBook Air it got slightly heavier for 2020 2.8 pounds so in all reality there really isn't much of a difference on the exterior now both these models also have two Thunderbolt 3 ports that run at full speed 40 gigabit per second and then also a headphone jack if you take a quick glance at the insides you might not notice a difference right away but the MacBook Pro even the base model does have the touch bar and you know some people like them a lot of people don't like them personally I don't use mine that often other than the built-in commands both these machines do have touch ID built in which works very well and then if we look down low where you'll see that the MacBook Pros trackpad is slightly larger now I have no issues with the MacBook Airs trackpad it is plenty big enough it doesn't limit you whatsoever so that is not a complaint and then looking above you might notice some differences in the keyboard now this uses the same new magic keyboard as Apple calls it from the 16 inch MacBook Pro and I absolutely love that keyboard now I wasn't a huge hater of the butterfly keys they are larger than the previous ones they're more tactile they're very stable now basically what Apple did is took this design and then put in a scissor mechanism with better travel so this is the best of both worlds from Apple's old keyboards and the butterflies combined and what most people care about is long term reliability and you definitely know that you're not gonna have any issues with this new one now I will say that this MacBook Pro does use the latest version of the butterfly keyboard and I have not heard any issues with that both of these laptops use 720p FaceTime cameras and this is the quality from the new 2020 MacBook Air and this is the base 2019 MacBook Pros webcam and microphone quality you guys go ahead and let me know down in the comments section below which one looks in sounds better if you guys could tell a difference now let's talk about the displays both of these are high quality high resolution retina displays we have the same exact size the same resolution but we do have some differences the MacBook Air gets around 350 to maybe 400 nits of brightness whereas the MacBook Pro can output 500 nits and that will help out if you're in bright rooms maybe outside you're battling some reflectivity now there's one other difference and that is the color gamut the MacBook Air can do very well for srgb so if you're doing standard JPEG photos you want to edit those you're gonna have a good color accuracy but the map Pro can actually display dcpip three colors which means it's just more colors that can show off you guys see this logo right here is actually showing up whereas on the MacBook Air that color cannot be displayed so we're not seeing that how big of a deal is that well I think for most people it really doesn't matter personally if I was doing things like video editing and especially for HDR where you're gonna be doing 10 bits I would say definitely you would want the MacBook Pros display now it's time to compare the speakers you guys put on your best pair of headphones and I want you guys to listen to both and let me know what differences you hear down in the comments section below [Music] [Music] [Music] so I'll give you guys my opinions the MacBook Pro does have the better speakers it is louder the bass sounds better and the highs are much more crisp and sharp if you want the best speakers definitely go for the MacBook Pro but I will say that the MacBook Air is not a slouch the speaker's still sound good better than most Windows laptops that I've tested it's gonna be interesting comparing it to the surface laptop 3 because that has a great speaker system and I absolutely love that Windows laptop so make sure you guys are subscribed with notifications enabled if you guys want to see that comparison now we are going to be moving on to performance test this is gonna get very very interesting but first let me give a shout out to our sponsor Squarespace if you've

Pro so it has 128 gig SSD at the read performance is very similar but the write performance the macbook air is man almost three times faster now that is because we do have a 128 gig if you went out and you got a 256 gig version of the MacBook Pro then it would be pretty much matching up as far as SSDs and now let's get into performance so I'm gonna go ahead and start this Geekbench 5 test and as it's running I'll give you guys the specs now this MacBook Pro is the base model has 8 gigabytes of low power ddr3 has a 1.4 gigahertz quad core i5 processor and that goes up to 3.9 gigahertz now with this MacBook Air because Apple dropped the prices and they're giving us a better value I went up to an i5 from the three that gives us a quad-core processor that starts at one point one gigahertz and goes up to three point five now I would say for almost anybody that's buying a MacBook Air spend that extra $100 because your performance is going to get much better not only that but graphics as well so it's well worth it now the other difference is that the MacBook Pro uses an eighth generation Intel processor whereas this MacBook Air is the first Mac to use a tenth generation processor and here we have a results and I was not expecting this now as far as multi-core score the MacBook Pro which has a higher frequency processor and better cooling this gets 22% higher multi-core score which I was expecting but what I wasn't was that the MacBook Air would get a 26% higher single core score this MacBook Air has a faster and higher single core score than my 12 core Mac Pro it is it is really good and this means that if you're doing simple tasks like web browsing opening up tabs new applications it's gonna be very snappy and now let's switch over to the graphics I'm gonna be running the metal test if you're getting the i5 processor you're gonna get the same exact graphics as the i7 version ok wow I was not expecting this big of a difference both have iris plus graphics this has 10 yet the MacBook Air is basically scoring three times as high as the MacBook Pro in metal man that that's getting me very interested in the final cut test but first this is Unigine Heaven using the extreme preset and this is gonna get interesting because it's gonna be putting a lot of heat on the GPU is a more consistent load and Wow another thing that I did not expect so for gaming when you're pushing the graphics to the max for an extended period of time the MacBook Pro graphics are actually faster we've got 10 point 6 FPS compared to 9 point oh that is interesting and then if I look at the graphics temperatures this one the MacBook Air is running at 81 Celsius compared to 76 so even though the graphics chip itself isn't getting too hot the CPU is putting out a bunch of heat altogether and that means it has to slow down I think now is the perfect time to get into thermal Worman so first off the fans are not being maxed out on either one of these systems 7100 RPM spray can go all the way up to 8,000 so the fan does run faster but the fan running faster isn't going to make a difference because if you guys look at these shots right here you'll see that the MacBook Air the new one just like the old ones the heatsink is not connected to the actual fan so it does draw air in and the actual cool has been redesigned to have these little chambers but without any heat pipes they cannot do that good of a job cooling down I have seen a bench r20 open here we're just gonna put a huge load on all of the cores with the CPU and then Intel power gadget so we can see what's happening with our wattage with our temperatures and with our frequencies let's go ahead and click start where for our multi core test and right off the bat this hit 3.5 gigahertz compared to MacBook MacBook Pro hitting 3.9 gigahertz and as soon as our test starts we are down to 2.4 MacBook Air is slowing down faster it's already hit a hundred degrees Celsius compared to 78 the i5 10 gen in the MacBook Air is actually a wide processor so it's designed to be ultra efficient low power usage and even though it did spike up to 25 watts it didn't stay there very long whereas this is running right now 26-28 the CPU is running still at 3 gigahertz and the MacBook Air settled at 1.5 gigahertz around 1011 watts so this is where thermal performance and having heatsink that's actually connected to the fan comes into plate that means that even though the MacBook Pro is only 22% faster and Geekbench 5s multi-core score if you're gonna be putting a 100% load on all of the cores for an extended period of time because of thermals the MacBook Pro is 65% faster and now I'm very curious about video editing so I have final cut open in front of me I'm gonna do just a few tests but if you guys want a more detailed video on how the 2020 MacBook Air handles video editing go ahead and check out the link in the video description to my other channel where I'll do a video just on that now starting out here I have two Clips open side-by-side this is a 20 second 4k clip I'm gonna test out stabilization which is going to test the graphics performance for a video editing I'm gonna click here hit start it's been 20 seconds and so far the MacBook Air is ahead at 60% compared to 43 now it is starting to heat up a bit so should be slowing down to live as far as graphics it got done in 35 seconds whereas the MacBook Pro is still at 63 degrees Celsius it's not heating up at all when we're doing this task 45 seconds so 10 seconds slower next I have a 5-minute 4k project open the same clip here but we have some color correction applied I have a lot up light onto here and some film grain so I'll let's go ahead just hit the spacebar I have it set up to the better quality so this is full 4k being played back here and as far as smoothness I mean both of them are looking pretty good and now let's export this five-minute 4k project with effects I'm using the web browser preset in 4k and after 22 seconds we're already at 95 99 degrees Celsius where's the MacBook Air 72 the fans are idling so yeah we're seeing a good trend here so it's been pretty much 5 minutes and the MacBook Pro is at 52% where this MacBook Air is at 26% so basically if for video editing the MacBook Pro is twice a slow once you actually get into it and you are doing some heavier stuff for short bursts excellent very good but for long stuff I mean we could see right here it's it's literally thirty percent sixty percent at five and a half minutes it's not worth so I'm gonna cancel this if you guys want to see me testing out some 1080p video editing and maybe a couple other scenarios that video will be in the video description but I don't want to be sitting here waiting this much longer so let's finish up this video guys and which one of these would I recommend as the best value first off the MacBook Air definitely surprised me the fact that the single core score was 26% higher than this one is EXO and the multi-core score was 22% lower not thus big of a difference that I was expecting in that kind of regarding for regular tasks regular productivity apps web usage email typing that kind of stuff this will actually be snappier date today not only that but the battery life is also better now Apple doesn't give a big difference I think they read this at 11 hours compared to 10 but in my usage I would say for kind of medium loads not just video playback you're gonna get maybe two hours better I would say at least two I mean right now just looking at the bag of life during the test this thing fared way better even under load so that is excellent of course the keyboard is excellent the shape of the bodies great for typing so for those people that are doing regular tasks like simple productivity emails web use the stuff that this machine was designed for this is even better than it's ever been before because it now has way more performance for those regular usages now unfortunately if you're gonna be putting them under heavy load say 4k video editing that's extended gaming it cannot keep up because of thermals in that situation the MacBook Pro is still the king even though it's definitely weaker in terms of graphics now the display is better here it's brighter the speaker sound better and for different things like photo editing video editing stuff like that you're gonna want the better color accuracy and the much better cooling performance so I'll have links to both down in video description below there are some great deals on the MacBook Pros well that brings it closer to the MacBook Airs price you guys can go and check that out thank you guys for wash and click that circle above to subscribe and if you want to see some other videos on the MacBook Air we'll have them right over there the spin Max and I'll see you in the next video [Music]
