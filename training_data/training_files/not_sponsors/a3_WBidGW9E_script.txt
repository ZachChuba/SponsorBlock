I say dr. Roberto it was supposed our fellow above - we made it go back yatta delivery Emmaus fkb way too hard on July 3rd 1940 a Royal Navy fleet opened fire on the French fleet anchored in the North African port of mers-el-kebir in ten minutes of firing hundreds of French sailors were killed and their battleships crippled it was an attack on a nation that days earlier had been a close ally of Britain justified as a necessary step to keep Frances Navy out of German hands [Music] this video is sponsored by the free to premium time we'll come back to this later the chain of events that led to mers-el-kebir began weeks earlier when it became clear to britain that france's days were numbered they were concern that once france capitulated her navy would end up in the hands of the axis though many of france's ships were actually in british port there was a powerful squadron of battleships at mers-el-kebir in North Africa and this worry at the Admiralty if these were combined with Italy's fleet then the actus would have clear naval superiority in the Mediterranean putting Britain's position in the region in severe danger when the franco-german armistice was announced on June 23rd 1940 it seemed to confirm the Admiralty's worst fears it's dated the French war fleet is the collecting port under German and/or Italian control to demobilize now the Germans did promise they didn't intend to use the French war fleet but considering their track record when it came to public pledges the British didn't really trust them a student turned to July distrustful of the Vichy government and gripped by the fear that Germany would use the French fleet to invade Britain Churchill told cabinet at all costs at all risks in one way or another we must make sure the Navy of France did not fall into the wrong hands as a result plans were drawn up codenamed Operation grasp to seize every French ship in the British ports of Portsmouth and Plymouth at the same time Admiral Andrew coming in was to in turn the French squadron based at Alexandria and Rear Admiral James some of it was to present an ultimatum to mers-el-kebir in operation catapult to do this Somerville was given command of force H centered around the aircraft carrier Ark Royal and capital ships Hood valiant and resolution with such a powerful French force anchored at mers-el-kebir the Apple T was taking chances upon reaching gibraltar Admiral Somerville met with the commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Fleet Admiral Dudley north and with captain Cedric Holland a fluent French speaker who had just spent months working as a liaison officer in Paris according to Colin Smith all three men agree that the orders they had just received were deeply misguided their instructions were to present the French commander at mers-el-kebir Admiral Marcel Bruno again soon with three options one sailor with the raw navy against Germany to sail to a British port whereupon the crews would be repatriated to France or three sail to a French port in the West Indies where the ships would be demilitarized and kept there for the duration of the war if none of these were accepted then some of it was a demand that against will scuttle his ships and if that was refused he was to open fire and sink them himself to Somerville and his fellow officers the idea that the Navy should be asked to attack in Port the fleet of a nation that had been an ally less than two weeks before was a grotesque Churchill himself recognized this signaling to Somerville you are charged with one of the most disagreeable and difficult tasks that a British Admiral has ever been faced with but nonetheless the Prime Minister was determined that a quick resolution be had even if it meant opening fire 4ch arrived off mers-el-kebir on the morning of July 3rd captain Hollister ass as the delegate for negotiation so it was ferried to the harbour entrance by a destroyer hms Foxhound requesting permission to come aboard the flagship Dunkirk Holland was surprised when this was rejected Jensen was annoyed that the British had sent only a captain to talk with him an admiral but the next few hours Holland was forced to conduct negotiations by intermediary from Foxhound motor boat moored in the harbor perhaps unsurprisingly again sulla rejected the British ultimatum sating that if the Germans attempted to seize his ships that he would scuttle but he would not do so simply at the behest of the British reluctantly Holland withdrew from the harbor and Summerhill set a deadline of 3:00 p.m. for the French admiral to reconsider his position at 1:00 p.m. to underline how serious they were swordfish aircraft from Ark Royal drop magnetic mines across the harbour entrance at 2:15 with just 45 minutes to go again Sewell played for time finally agreeing to receive Holland for discussions in person desperate to avoid having to open fire some of them extended the deadline to 5:30 p.m. to allow further talks which began at 4:15 for over an hour more Holland ingen Sewell tried to find some kind of agreement around the French ships sailing to the West Indies but to no avail the French admiral was just not prepared to scuttle or relocate his ships unless they were threatened by Germany a 5 p.m. Somerville was urged by London to put an end of a standoff with wireless intercept indicating French reinforcements were on route with no breakthrough in sight they could wait no longer at 525 Holland left on Kirk and admiral gensoul who believed even this late stage that the British were bluffing to make him scuttle and would not really open fire he was wrong at 550 for the battleships valiant and resolution opened fire join soon after buy some of yours flagship HMS hood as the first shelves crashed into the harbor Ginsu ships tried desperately to get underway and temptin escape as dunkirk pulled back from the jetty she was hit four times by 15 inch shells in quick succession which killed a hundred and eighty men rekt most of the engines and blew up one of the magazines for the secondary battery Ratan one of the older battleships present fared even worse after taking several bad hits at least one of the main magazines exploded blowing a massive hole in the ship and calling it a rapidly capsized 1079 of her crew were killed able to see this massive explosion from the fleet Somerville ordered a halt to the firing to give time for the battleship to be abandoned despite suffering serious damage though the crews were not about to abandon their ships and allow Les Anglais to finish them all shouting out of the harbour entrance came first two destroyers latter a blur and Volta they ran straight over the British magnetic mines but suffered only glancing blows as the mines had been set to deep in the water to keep up with the speed of the destroyers behind them came the modern battle cruiser Strasbourg her guns roaring towards the hazy figures of force hate after the Northwest in an attempt to buy time for the stress ball to get away again Suleiman signaled to indicate he would accept the British terms by this stage however Admiral Somerville was having none of it replying abruptly unless I see your ships sinking I shall open fire again due to the thick smoke thrown up from the shattered Britain it was only after sending that message that the Strasbourg his skate was spotted by the British an HMS hood was soon brought round to race out of the battle cruiser meanwhile with the French ships was the colonial gunboat trigger additionally which was trying her best to keep up with the faster ships but falling further and further behind reluctantly the gunboat turned back West and then ran straight into force H's escort coming up fast captained by Lieutenant Louis Prasad the little boat charter of the hurdle by herself and fired two torpedoes in the face of fire from the cruisers enterprise and Arethusa with torpedoes in the water hood was forced to swing away to the north to avoid them losing crucial ground on the strands Berg incredibly the French gun read that made it all the way back to mers-el-kebir without suffering so much as a scratch the light was fading now and after another unsuccessful taut fish torpedo attack Somerville called off the pursuit the attack on mers-el-kebir was at an end safe for another air attack on Dunkirk several days later to make doubly sure that she wasn't seaworthy all told at mers-el-k√©bir France lost 1297 sailors dead with over 350 wounded in an act they regarded as pure treachery it was pathetic albian all over and the funeral for those who died when sulla made it clear that if there is a stain on a flag today it's certainly not on yours it's a characterization that some of you probably would have agreed with he referred to himself afterwards as the unskilled butcher of Iran and in a letter home to his wife he made his feelings clear I just felt so damned angry being called on to do such a lousy job we all feel dirty and ashamed that the first time we have been in action was an affair like this both Somerville and telling him believe that had more time been available than a peaceful solution could have been found as was the case with the French ships that Cunningham dealt with at Alexandria Churchill though was unrepentant arguing that the attack was necessary and made it clear to the world that the British War Cabinet feared nothing and would stop at nothing the implication of this argument is that the action at mers-el-kebir was in part about showing the world and particularly the United States that Britain was not yet beaten Churchill actively wanted to show Roosevelt that he would do whatever it took to defeat Germany and opening fire at mers-el-kebir in such a dramatic way actually served these purposes really well now French acceptance of one of the options would have been probably preferable to the Prime Minister but the time pressure placed on Summerhill to achieve her quick solution shows that keeping the peace between Britain and France was just not as important as ending the threat the French fleet posed and demonstrating to the world Britain to resolve its these aspects that took priority in Churchill's and the wall cabinets mind mers-el-kebir remains one of the most controversial British actions of World War two though barely anyone in the UK actually knows about it unsurprisingly the newsreel footage of French ships sunk by British fire was not shown in the UK as it happens when the Germans did try and seize France's Navy at Toulon in 1943 the French kept their word and scuttled their ships sinking them in 1940 may well have not been needed but of course that the benefit of hindsight depending on your perspective you could see mers-el-kebir as an unpleasant necessity as Churchill did an unnecessary dishonor as Somerville and others did or as a murderous outrage as the French did like with so many other events in the Second World War and history in general the truth is probably somewhere in between all three thank you to war thunder for aircraft as well as three days of premium time and as always I'd like to thank my patrons without whom this video and all of my other videos simply would not exist our last video on operation pedestal was demonetised after a copyright claim for some of the historical footage I used in it so if you can spare anything to become a patron I would greatly appreciate it it really does keep me going thank you all for watching this video and I will see you in the next one [Music]
