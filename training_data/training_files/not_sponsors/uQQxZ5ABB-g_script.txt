hey what is going on you guys it is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new loot video for you all today so today I bring you guys loot from 100 at kalisto killers much more profitable and much more exciting than our previous loot video which was loot from 100 at green dragon killers now this video was all done on the main account but I was also using three other accounts to scout the Callisto spawn locations these locations being the main spawn point the northeast safe spot the southeast safe spot and of course the safe spot all the way to the west so a big shout-out to those accounts but before we get into today's video we do have some quick words from our sponsor raid shadow legends so for those of you who haven't heard about raid yet let me ask you a

today's video I know that ad was a little longer than they usually are and I do apologize for that I just had a lot more to cover but I will be making it up to you guys I do appreciate your support with all this and I do have some exciting news we are gonna be hitting 150,000 subscribers on YouTube hopefully before the end of the month so I will be working on a loot from 150,000 video this will be similar to the goblin video that we did a hundred thousand of last year so if you guys don't see any videos for a few weeks that will be why so I just wanted to let you guys know about that so with all that being said let's finally get into today's video so this guy's amulet of glory pique right here made for the third kill out of the hundred kills that we are doing for this vid and as you can see by this clip you never really know who you can encounter at Callisto or especially around Callisto and I think the best part about today's video is that you're not only going to be seeing me kill PB embers like you did in the Green Dragon video but you're also going to be seeing a lot of different PK errs whether it's solo peak heirs or two-man teams or clan's there was multiple occasions where I was outnumbered and I had to escape for my life so this was a lot more challenging than I initially thought it would be and I did manage to capture every exciting moment on video such as this moment here where this guy was killing a Callisto with a vigorous Shane Mason all of a sudden I attacked him to see an armored oh god soar and luckily for me his didn't work but mine did if you want a PK in a location like this you definitely need a looting bag because inside of it you can fit all of those items that one PK almost adding up to 1.5 mil of course rune light was going to be tracking all these 100 kills which you will see at the very end and all the items were being put into one individual bank tab so the tracking was pretty easy to do the PK though definitely a different story there would be occasions where I would get really lucky really unlucky you know you see a lot of luck involved in the wilderness here as clip was a little weird this guy actually managed to get away and then he ran back up north for some strange reason so we did manage to get the kill there and also ran into a friendly venezuelan so shout-out to him and unlike the green dragon video you won't really be seeing that many gold farmers in this one i think out of 100 kills maybe 15 to 20% of them we're all gold farmers their risk is usually minimal and they're much lower combat so most of the time I can't even attack them they usually hover around the eighties but occasionally you will see a hundreds and usually I always go for them regardless but yeah it doesn't seem like there's that many compared to other hotspots around the wilderness a nice thing about peaking here at Callisto is if you do manage to get a kill not only do you get the opportunity to smite a varrock piece which I did numerous occasions and also if they bring something like dragon boots or a special attack weapon then they might actually have you know no ability to protect all of the rock pieces so you're guaranteed at least a hundred at 250 K there unfortunately varrock did go down in price in the past couple years so you don't really get as much as he used to but you will at least have the chance of getting something and not only that but all the drops that these people do manage to get from Callisto if you do actually kill a PVM err you will receive those as well I feel kind of bad there i smite of that person who is on mobile and you will see them again actually later on to the video and there would be occasions where you know you would run into people who aren't necessarily in varrock didn't counselor a lot of people who were just using range you know people who would bring welfare gear with a rune crossbow and then there would be people who would just be bringing a crossbow maybe they're on a wilderness Slayer task or maybe they're just hunting for the Callisto bear pet either way no matter what they're doing they have to be careful because one simple miss click if you get frozen at the wrong time and as you can see in that previous clip and actually many clips throughout this video Callisto will turn on you very quickly and he will probably kill you if the PKR doesn't elicit ofir's no one and he hits very very high I did run into this guy plep a few different times throughout this video he was also solo peeking here a very friendly guy you know we fought a couple different times as you can see this world was a pvp I did manage to kill five different people in PvP worlds but those were not listed on the KTR so it's just kind of like five extra kills they were accounted by moonlight but for the most part pvp wasn't that active I didn't really see that many people there when I was checking on all my scout accounts and if you remember that mobile player from earlier there they are again if they were ever subscribed to my channel well I don't think they are anymore and this kill here really represents the power of the ballista sometimes when I would actually use it I wouldn't even bring a secondary special attack weapon because a lot of these people would always pray melee because they always expect you to Dragon Claw or AG aspect them but not a lot of them expect you to use a ballista so a tactic that I had early on was using a Nessie helmet and a ballista for a spec web and this always got people off-guard and I did manage to get a few nice kills with this method and as you can see I did die here in this clip unfortunately this team did know what they were doing had plenty of supplies but I was not expecting them to have vengeance a great thing to bring if you're anti peeking or you know just peeking in general and speaking of great things there is our 30th kill of the video which happens to be each dragon 2 and err it's that girl managed to get herself a nice drop I'm not too sure why she didn't Bank it here we have one of the few fire capes that we did PK this was in 32 wild I did attack a group of varrock errs but only one of them did try to kill me luckily though I did have the upper hand and I walked away with 1 mil just another prime example of the power of the you know peeking here throughout this week one thing that I did learn is that if you ever want to tank a PK or a team always invest in a bulwark Boatworks are popular at revs they're popular Advan in Addis but they're not that popular at Callisto I don't know why more people don't bring them as you can see it would have been really helpful to this person in this situation but you know I was in a good mood and I thought to myself not this time and I guess karma did pay off because the very next kill we did get was a smited ballista so it's nice to see I'm not the only one who P K's with a ballista around this area I do however seem to be the only one who doesn't bring a blighted superstores or blighted anglerfish these new wilderness food and wilderness potions I think I'm just gonna never use them and always include them in a loot video if I continue to do these in the wilderness they're really just not my style you know and targeting so many different people in the wild we did have to change the username so we did go with elf mage 42 a nostalgic name used by many different PKS throughout the century or decades whatever not too sure where the 42 came from now get ready for this next clip because it does go fast as you can see he's luring Callisto he gets hit by him my ballista does not one but two hits for an unspeakable amount of damage and overall I think that he may have lost the infernal cape and I say this because we were past 30 wild and I did receive a lot of GP I know that there's a way that you can protect these items in deep wild and he might have done this but either way it was a huge coin stack you don't see too many infernal capes here you definitely don't see too many zamorak helmets here with a full set of varrock as well not too sure what this person was doing frankly I don't want to know what they were trying to do you know I did mention those safe spots earlier on in the video where you can kill Callisto and it is important to note that the north multi safe spot the one right next to the fountain of rune just south of it is used as a popular baiting location now I'm sure most of you know what this means but for those who don't essentially a team of peek errors will have a dedicated account PBM inge at Callisto in hopes of a PK or a small newbie team to attack this account then they all log in right away and since its multi a war pretty much starts and it quickly ends this is a popular method especially in total level worlds I did see this happen a lot which is actually why I avoided total level world's a lot throughout this video I did also keep a scout at the northeast location with a dragon spear the whole entire video and this account would actually get attacked quite a few times by peak heirs who sometimes knew what they were doing and I was outnumbered and sometimes they had no clue what they were doing and I would instantly run up there on my main and take care of business two out of three of my Scouts both had dragon Spears and ice barrage but for the most part being on four accounts at the same time was pretty difficult I think I only showed three at the very beginning but when I brought my Ironman along I think passed like 50 kills or so things did get pretty hectic and the hopping world's constantly was really annoying that's the only downside of peaking here really and that's the same thing if you're gonna PK at wilderness bosses in general a lot of it is revolved around hopping worlds and just having multiple accounts logged in so you can spot people I know you hear nowadays in 2020 that there's all sorts of BOTS scripts that tell you where people are located in the wilderness and what their risk is I can assure you I don't have access to any of that so I just got to go the old-fashioned route bond up for accounts and get him hop in every single second of the day this did pay off and in all honesty it was actually kind of fun and especially funny you know moments like this where this guy I guess thought he was going somewhere but little did he know he forgot to charge his glory so I did manage to get the kill and I don't take these things too seriously you know you never see me insult anyone or be toxic or anything like that and for the most part I didn't really see a lot of that throughout this video which was really nice as you can see we have gone through quite a few different weapons from start to finish in regards to the special attack here we were using a Bandos god sword and it was really effective I mean not everyone here uses saradomin bruise so if you happen to hit with a Bandos god sword spec and you will lower the defense of your opponent and then your ballista or your you know magic attack whatever it may be that you're using will hit a lot more significantly and thanks to that 63 special attack we did get our very first glory PK this was one of two that we did manage to get at the fountain of room these people usually were scouted by my account at Callisto from the northeast safe spot and most of the time if anyone who's charging glory sees anyone they log out when they get to the fountain luckily that person did not was getting some feedback from the people that I was attacking in regards - my Bandos godsword but little did they know it is much more effective than the age yes I think it's actually worth more than the HGS these days I don't know if that'll be like that forever but yeah times have certainly changed I would also occasionally bring dragon claws here you know those are a really good reliable special attack weapon but the only downside is once you use the special attack they are virtually useless and your opponent has a much better chance to stay alive if you're only using a range and magic and here I did die again but it was a long fight it really did go the distance and we had a lot of close calls so was a lot of fun not as fun as this was though three hitting a guy in multi dressed as a wizard this was great the mystic at bringing me some luck full tusk really looks great surprised it's so inexpensive sadly not too long after my luck streak did end and this team that I did escape earlier on found me again and they to hit me so that was a little painful I have learned that it's more enjoyable to to hit someone than it is to you know get to hit yourself we did carry on though and you know for anyone wondering if there was any Iron Men accounts here there were occasions where I would see iron men safe spotting and usually what would happen if I attacked an iron man is I wouldn't usually get off them if the risk was minimal or other times they would have their alternate account which was a main account certainly an account that can trade login and start fighting me it's my surprise most of these guys were much better peek errors than I was but there were occasions where I would get some nice kills against them so you got to be ready for anything like I mentioned before you know you do have bait accounts but you also have accounts that you know are protected just by one or two people a lot of these people do take pet hunting seriously or they just are capable of multi logging especially in 2020 a lot of people playing on more than one count at the same time and I've been saying that for years now and Here I am fighting a team with actually a friend of mine who was just kind of watching with a dragon spear and he actually did help me out and thanks to his dragon spear I was able to log out and get away to my surprise though in the next world we did it run into the same two guys and this time we took full force on them and I actually did get a kill and the other one did run away so yeah shout out to him a friend of mine was just gonna help me with the last 20 kills or so and it's clips like these that you will see a lot of close calls especially towards the end of the video you know encounters where I could have gotten a potentially really nice PK especially at the end you guys are not going to believe one of the clips that is coming up here but unfortunately the hit just might not have been high enough where the freeze might not have been fast enough and you know you would lose out on some kills that way and here we have a level 126 charging glories this time the second glory kill of the video right towards the end most of the people that I did see charging glories for any of you low level PK is out there we're all level eights most of them also had 43 prayer there is a tip for you and yet again here is another close call but not the worst one of the video this was just unbelievable though my beads yes always coming through with the first hit but not quite the second one so not too sure what I would have gotten from that person but it happens and I'm sure you've noticed by now but I did not use the normal spell book fire serves to tele block P King once throughout this video just thought it was too dangerous and I would have taken up a lot of inventory space so I stuck with Ancients and my rule was if they got to 30 while they pretty much always survives so it was up to me to make sure I could do as much damage in six to ten levels of wilderness before they were 100% guaranteed to teleport away from me and a big shout out to all the player moderators in old school runescape you know I don't think I'll ever be one myself certainly don't think I can be eligible and he does say vote yes to PvP got to say based on the loot pile I thought he was going with something else there Oh aren't we living in such strange times anyway here is a tentacle whip with a dragon defender combination which honestly I should have used for most of the video you know the staff of the Dead worked really well but the tentacle weapon trying claws were a deadly combination now as this guy dies he says that he has nothing but clearly he has full graceful that's also colored and ring a wealth just the tip to anyone charging ring well sir glories in the wilderness do not bring full graceful unfortunately he did teleport back up and he lost it so yeah as you can see once you're done Dragon Claw specking you know the tentacle whip is a great transition weapon especially in that situation there at the fountain rune I did see this guy dressed to the nines with a fire cape and apparently he lost that so you know graceful and infernal capes fire capes I mean we're losing everything in this video but still no plus-ones no big smites other than a course the ballista but I'm talking some big big smites yeah that zgs was pretty painful but gotta be honest didn't expect to die from his e GS alright so speaking of smites watch this clip here as you can see the BG yes against the H yes I was hitting much higher and the prayer of my opponent had dropped this hit here determines it all and no a GS PK for us three kills left to go and we had the opportunity to not a once but twice PK and a GS and we failed so yeah I was pretty letdown at this point I mean I really wanted that to be the finish that would have made for the most perfect clip but you can't get perfection every time that's why it's perfection you know it stands out from the rest so oh well maybe next time no big smites in this video but this guy Spartacus 99 was our 99th kill of the video with one left to go and I did trust the reliable' Dragon Claw spec to lead us to victory and here we are loot from 100 kalisto killers has been completed whether they were a PBM or a PK er gold farmer or anything in between we did go for them taking just shy of four days to complete now it is time to check out the price check and the loot tab from all 100 people that we did a kill now there is a lot of items to go through but I will try to do this as fast as I can the first three rows was really dedicated to just the drops that kalisto had on the drop table so you're kind of getting an idea of what kalisto drops we got from the PBM errs that we did go for as you can see you know it wasn't that much compared to the other loot but it did come out to be a nice number almost just about 8.9 mil now the second price check this is all of the robes that I did PK all the aether from all the vigorous chain maces in the crossbows just then Etha you're looking at five mil and of course from all the mystic sets and even the food that we did pick up not forgetting a single thing on the ground other than the bones we did walk away with 5.9 mil from that now the third price check this is mainly just the blighted super restores among a little bit of other things does come out to be one point eight mil next price checks a little bit more exciting this is all the Barrows pieces 23 varrock helmets 5 flail and to Brassard x' along with a few arabs pieces one pair of dragon boots and all that coming out to be four point nine mil and finally the last price check all the jewelry and the platinum tokens represent anything that hasn't been in this tab but was tracked by rune light this one coming out to be three point six mils so we go ahead and fast forward the calculator add up all the numbers that we did get from all the items and ladies and gentlemen loot from 100 a kalisto killers does come out to be twenty five point one mil now if we subtract the amount of deaths which I think we died four times maybe five times total loss from those deaths maximum would be five mil and of course all the runes and the food and potions that I use maybe that's another two Miller so I would say you know you're still looking at close to 20 mil profit from 100 kills if you're a better P care and you don't tie as much as I do you're gonna be making more money off your worst peak hair you die more than I do you'll probably lose a lot more so overall you gotta have some basic skills to be able to kill someone who is a PBM or anyone in the wilderness in general I myself I'm not really a peak heir I just like to switch up these loot videos every now and again so all that being said ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for your time today I know it was a long one I owe you guys the world and I really appreciate every single one of you I will see you guys soon with a good video and then after that you will see loot from 150,000 the real question is what mr. no sleep ow
