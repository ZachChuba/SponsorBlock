own beautiful website traveling is something that everybody wants to do what do you want to do when you ro up travel the world we all want to travel the world and seeing beautiful places this video is gonna be all about how I pack my tech minimalist travel bag because I have a new philosophy No More checked bags all my valuables that I need for the trip are in this bag and then my clothes are in my carry-on bag and that's it here's a tip a life hack instead of buying souvenirs while you're there take photos and videos put together a little montage video that's what we do I create these travel films like these short highlight films from our trip and we just recently came back from Switzerland in Italy and I put together the travel film for that I will put that at the very end of this video so you can kind of see what the result is from this tech travel bag and every product an item that I mentioned in this video will be linked in the description below so let's first start off with my headphones because my headphones don't actually go in my bag these are one of the best purchases I've ever made for traveling especially for plane rides these are the Sony WH 1000 MX 3s the audio quality is fantastic these are expensive however when you turn on that noise canceling function it is perfect for plane rides it cancels out all the noise and it helps you get some sleep on the plane or or get some work done these are amazing the battery life is great and it has the ability to go wired as well if you want to do a wired connections so the bag that I prefer to use I've been using it for five years is an Amazon basics DSLR backpack for the price this is one of the best bags it's only $30 on Amazon it's gotten beat up and dragged across floors and airports but it does the job is still holding up nothing has torn so it handles weight really well and it fits the dimensions for most international flights as far as qualifying for your personal items so I literally have this on me at all times as my personal item what I love about it is that it's cheap it's not overly bulky but it still keeps things protected it's got everything that I need so on the side here it's got straps where I have strapped in my gorilla pod my Joby Gorillapod and then on the other side of the backpack there's a pouch here here is where I keep my Rav power power bank so this is one of my most valuable items when I go traveling what this does is it charges my phone that's that's really what I use it for it just plugs right in to an outlet right there like that it can fully charge my iPhone multiple times and this lasted me the whole trip it's got a built-in lightning connector there so you can just plug your phone directly into it and charge it so let's open this back back up and I'll show you what's inside so the back has three main compartments the first is just a simple flat zipped pouch on the front where you can keep passport wallet flat bank bus tickets my iPhone is in there right now my iPhone 8 this is very handy to have it's a headphone splitter allow it it allows me and my wife to hook up to the iPad and watch a TV show that we've downloaded or movie that we downloaded and listened on both of our headphones and then there's a wired connection for my headphones and also have the backup ear pods right there and I also have my first-generation air pods in here as well these are almost three years old I can't believe that these lasted me this long now let's look at the middle section it's a bigger but still flatter pouch and it has some compartments this is where I keep my iPad so this is just like the media device it has videos TV shows books everything on there so I keep that in there and then I also keep my 13-inch MacBook Pro this bag does a pretty good job of keeping it protected I actually dropped this bag I thought I'd broken my Mac with what it was it was fine so this is the 13-inch MacBook Pro fits just fine in there and this compartment also has some dividers some pouches in there that divide things that you can do put like cables and stuff like that so now we're gonna go to the main compartment now what I also love about this bag is that it has these dividers these velcro dividers you can customize the how you layout and pack this bag here is my g85 so what I usually do is I have a gh 5 but I'm filming with both of these cameras both my gh 5 so it's almost the same size the GHI is just a little bit bigger but it fits just fine in this little compartment here and I also have a voice Lander lens but I usually use my 12 or 35 the 12 the 35 is a perfect travel lens if you have a GH by our Panasonic camera but I have the Voigtlander on here because I'm using the 12 35 right now so I have my DJI Mavic 2 Pro drone right in the middle and it keeps it protected these these dividers are pretty thick I love my maverick 2 pro you'll see in the travel film at the end of this video that I used that for the majority of my shots now we're gonna go into the little compartments here this is the battery charger for the G 85 so fits nicely in there this is the extra battery for my drone the first one is already installed in the drone there and then this little compartment is where I keep the this is the DJIA charger for the Maverick 2 Pro these are the filters for the Maverick 2 Pro highly recommend getting ND filters if you have a drone this will allow you to shoot in bright sunlight and still get that cinematic look if you're taking videos or even photos as well this is a useful device to have as well this is a power inverter you can actually plug this up to this cigarette lighter and it has USB ports and it also has an outlet right there too so a power outlet just so if you want to charge your phone or your drone or anything your camera batteries while you're in the car then the other section here I have the rode videomicro microphone and this is just I don't really use this unless I'm talking to the camera or if I want to capture some better quality natural sounds so this is the other lens that I take this is the Panasonic 25 millimeter for my GH 5 or my G 85 it's a 50 millimeter equivalent if you're shooting full-frame so this I just take this because it's a small lightweight lens and it's better in low-light just in case I need it so the 12 or 35 lens stays on most of the time but if I need better low-light I'll just slap this on and it doesn't think of that much room and here's my macbook pro charger and then in this other section here we have the remote controller to my Mavic 2 pro and it fits nicely right into that that spot right there so that's pretty much everything in the main compartment now I'll show you these last two zippered compartments here start at the top this is where I keep my cables so I have my iPhone charger and any other cables that I might need I think about yeah the cable for the MacBook Pro as well this right here is a pouch for your batteries so you don't want to travel with your batteries exposed if it's got places for four of them and they fit in there really nicely so I have extra batteries for my camera and then last compartment here we have this is my SD card holder so it's a holds multiple s SD cards and keeps them pretty protected it's got a hard shell case this right here it has nothing to do with tech but it is essential and I like to keep this on me at all times because you never know when you need to sleep this is a night mask along with some earplugs in this little pouch right here I keep this on me just in case I need to fall asleep in the on a plane or on the side of the road who knows that's always nice to have once you put that night mask on it's a game changer this right here is a USB 3.0 SD card reader reads multiple different kinds of SD cards with the USBC adapter to read memory cards and although the footage--whenever I need to do that this right here is one of the most clutch primals to have if you're taking photos in a lot of videos this is a 500 gigabyte solid state drive USB C and it's pretty durable this thing is amazing I've used this to just put footage on and I've edited 4k videos directly off of this when it's hooked up to my macbook pro and these are just international power adapters so everywhere there's different outlet styles you know if you're traveling out of the country find out what type of outlet they have and buy these on Amazon these are super cheap and last but not least of course you have to have a microfiber cloth to clean anything that may get dirty clean lenses clean your nose always got to have your hanky that's what Nick Offerman has told me and I've learned I've learned that and the funny thing is it's always buried down beneath everything so you're not gonna have it when you need it but it's there so these are all the things that I fit into this one bag this is my tech minimalist travel bag I have everything that I need right here fits beautifully into this and it keeps it protected so now you can sit back and relax and watch my quick four-minute travel film that I put together with everything that you see this is what I use to create this
