hypothetical situation a cop turns his lights on behind you pulls you over but there's a body in your track so that's a problem and you know it's there and the cop comes up to your window asks to see your license and registration but he knows some blood on the seat so he gets kind of suspicious and you're kind of acting suspicious and so he has you get out of the car and he handcuffs you while he searches your car but he's kind of a careless cop so he doesn't stick you in the back of his cop car so you're sitting on the curb handcuffed he's searching a car you know any second he's going to find that dead body in your trunk waterjet channel does not condone the murdering and snoring of bodies and trunks whether it be human animal or alien so you make a run for it and you've come here to this shop inner interwebs manufacturing and water jet cutting can you get out of handcuffs without amputating your wrist that's what we are here to find out today so we have one pair of authentic handcuffs oh yeah those are real okay so the correct way i learned this from a jerk cop back in the day i will tell you how i how he taught me but it was a very it's a hands-on experience you got to slam it real hard to get some bruising and it flings around and then you tighten you got to squeeze it you try to get it in between that bone so it locks in there and hurts no matter what on both sides so you and then behind your back also you sound like you've been through this before uh if it doesn't leave some lines and bruising they weren't on right so that's how you know it was done correctly well we were gonna stick mitchell's arm in this and cut it with his hand in there but we were told that's not wise osha or something so we found what we think is the perfect wrist analog it's pretty risky yeah it i mean it has the density of her wrist i would say so we'll cuff the sausage and then we'll try and get as close as we can cut the handcuffs off and then because this is smooth we'll be able to see if there's any kind of damage see how much skin you would actually lose doing this okay i'm trying to see if i if i pick up behind my back if i can get it into the front is this a trick you also learned back in the day yeah it was a little more limber back then no i'm not getting anywhere do you need help getting out i would want to get it just like this this is like some max masked magician stuff right here my middle name is if i can see this would be so much easier i need a series of mirrors i'm not even sure if the keyhole's on that side there we go see that's how it's done i didn't eat lunch it bulges at each end so you know you did it right locked and loaded that looks really nice but not as nice coming after me yeah no worries hey time to start operation handcuff freedom uh it moved around a little bit because we forgot to weigh the board down but sorry about that this is our first time doing this so what is the damage uh i think you would have sliced through your wrist arteries oh it's not even it's like mostly there oh we cut the lock mechanism you'd escape it just wore the teeth off just cut all the teeth off it didn't cut through it all the way down there because the board was moving around so every time we went forward and back it was cutting in slightly different place and the damage is if that was the top of your wrist you'd be okay if it was the underside then you might have some trouble i mean it would hurt are you glad we didn't stick your hand in there yeah i told dan that i was willing to put my wrist in there and he wouldn't let me so thanks dude you're welcome what are we supposed to do with this clay dan i think it's been a while oh you were close that's pretty good for six months of not throwing actually i've been practicing for six months so that answers that question if you are a runaway convict or potential convict and you have a water jet in your handcuff you can't escape confirmed is there anything you want to add to that no yeah that's disgusting [Music]
