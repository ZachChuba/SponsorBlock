with polish poppy seed rolls
that's right a real polish poppy seed roll is actually baked in a loaf
and then sliced and served but here i try to do individual roles instead
as well as tweak a few other things so these are only going to be like 50
authentic which is still pretty good because i'm only 25
polish but the more important fact these were 100
amazing so with that let's go ahead and get started by making a very simple
sweet dough and for that we will add some warm milk
to the bowl of our stand mixer along with some dry active yeast as well
as about half a cup of our all-purpose flour
and what we'll do is take a whisk and give this a quick mix until everything
is nice and smooth and then we will simply let this sit out
on the counter for about 30 minutes to form what is generically referred to
as a sponge since with some recipes it actually
looks like a sponge when it's done but this one not so much although will
definitely have thickened up and puffed up a little bit it should be
fairly bubbly and then to our sponge we'll go ahead
and add two large egg yolks as well as a little touch of white sugar
we are also going to drizzle in some melted butter
as well as a nice big pinch of salt followed by some vanilla extract
and please do me a favor and use the real stuff and then once all that's in
there we'll take a whisk and give this another mix
until we think everything is well combined at which point i tossed in the
rest of my all-purpose flour and that's it i grabbed my dough hook
and i started stirring this for no apparent reason
but eventually i grabbed this and headed to the mixer where we're going to need
this for about five minutes or so or until a very very smooth very soft
slightly elastic dough forms and no this is not going to be one of
those beautiful neat dough balls that just pulls away from the sides
this is mostly going to sort of bunch up on your hook and during the kneading
time it's not a bad idea to turn off the
mixer once in a while and scrape that down with a spatula
and continue on and as usual if it seems too wet you can always add in a little
more flour but be careful don't add in too much
okay we really do want this to stay nice and soft
and that's it once we think this is needed long enough we'll go ahead and
remove that from the mixing bowl and transfer it onto a floured work
surface at which point it's always a good idea to give this a brief few
second kneading just to sort of feel where we're at and
if it still feels really sticky we can always knead in a little more flour
but this was feeling just about perfect and by perfect like i already said we're
looking for something very very smooth very very soft but not too sticky and
definitely fairly elastic and then what we'll do once we're very
happy with our ball of dough it's transferred into a lightly buttered
or oil bowl at which point we'll cover it and let it
rise in a warm spot for a couple hours or until doubled in
size and please note rich does like this do take longer to rise
so plan accordingly and then what we'll do while our dough is rising
is go ahead and make our poppy seed filling which we'll start by adding some
butter and milk to a saucepan along with a couple spoons of polish
honey and if you can't get that you can substitute with ukrainian honey
or the honey of your choice and then to hedge your bets we'll also add a little
bit of sugar as well as a splash of water and then
we'll set our heat to medium high at which point we will wait impatiently
for this to come up to a simmer and then as soon as it does we will stir
in a tremendous amount of poppy seeds okay ideally you're going to want to go
to one of those places that sells in bulk
which i'm not crazy about by the way i do not enjoy writing the code number on
those tiny little white twist ties but you will save some money but
regardless of where you get it we're gonna go ahead and cook this stirring
for about five minutes or so or until the mixture thickens up into
what you would consider like a spreadable texture
and then what we'll do once we think our mixtures cook long enough and it
hopefully looks a little something like this is we'll turn off
the heat and then we'll let it cool down to room temp before we use it
okay so our filling is set and we can move on to check our dough
and mine was looking pretty good and it definitely doubled in size
and another clue is when you poke it it holds the finger marks and starts to
deflate okay if those start springing back on
you it needs more time and then what we'll do is go ahead and transfer this
onto a floured surface and then what we want to do is sort of
deflate this but at the same time form it into a tube shape and then once we
have something fairly uniform we will want to sort of roll it back and
forth under our hands until it's about i don't know about 15 inches long
at which point we'll flatten it out and then using just enough flour so things
don't stick we'll switch to a rolling pin and then
attempt to roll this out into a nice big rectangle
somewhere in the neighborhood of like 10 by 18 inches or i give or take
and no unlike certain kitchens where they test things i am not going to pull
out the yardstick do i even have a yardstick but anyway
the point is this is not an exact science
and as long as you get a nice big rectangle of dough about an eighth of an
inch thick i think you're going to be fine and then
what we'll do once that's been accomplished
is go ahead and spread over our now cooled filling and as we do this
we're going to want to leave about an inch and a half uncovered along the edge
we're going to roll towards and then once that's set before we roll
this up we'll use our finger to brush a little bit of water on that exposed
dough at which point starting from the
opposite edge we will roll this up fairly tightly but we do not want to
stretch the dough as we do this otherwise it will get too thin and
traditionally these poppy seeds would be ground in like a spice mill to sort of
break them up okay they say it brings out more flavor
but i figured we're gonna eat like a pound of these things
how much more flavor do we need but anyway you decide
i mean you guys are after all the margaret meads of your poppy seeds
so feel free to grind those up if you want but personally i really do enjoy
the texture of the whole seed and what we'll do once we finish rolling
that up with ideally the seam somewhere on the bottom
is that we'll do a little fine tuning making sure that's as even as possible
and also at the same time kind of bringing both ends towards the center
so that we get something a little more compact with hopefully a very very
consistent girth and then once we're happy with how it's
shaped and at this point i have to admit i was very happy
we will take our bench scraper and we'll go ahead and divide this into eight
equal portions and if you think the ends have a lot of
extra dough you can always trim a little off
and then as far as prepping these for the pan all we really need to do is turn
them on their side and maybe pinch a little bit of the
dough underneath to sort of hold in that filling
and that is pretty much all there is to it we'll just sort of press that down a
little bit but i don't want these two flat so
that's one down and i moved on to the next one and again
what i'm doing here is trying to pinch some of the dough underneath
to maybe hold in the stuff better but because like 50
of this is poppy seed i was not having too much luck
but what that did do is make the top a little more dome shaped which may or may
not give this thing a better shape when it's baked
although having said that it's been my experience with any kind of rolled baked
good once you turn them on their sides like
this they sort of have a mind of their own once they bake and puff
up which will usually result in some kind of variation in appearance
and as you're about to see that's exactly what i got and then what we'll
do once those have been cut and sort of shaped this will transfer
those onto a line baking sheet at which point you can if you want to
let them proof for about 20 minutes to half hour
so they rise a little bit before they go in the oven but i didn't
because that's going to result in a little bit of an area and a little more
puffier product but i wanted something that was just a
touch denser which i thought would stand up better to the substantial amount of
poppy seed filling so i just let mine sit there for about
five minutes before i transferred them into the center of a 375 degree oven
for about 20 to 25 minutes or until they were beautifully browned
and looked like this and yes as you can see those are delightfully diverse in
appearance which is exactly what i was going for he
said with a straight face and what we'll do is go ahead and
transfer those to a cooling rack since we really do want these to cool down
completely before we enjoy them and while those are cooling if you want
we can paint on a simple sugar glaze which is just powdered sugar thinned out
with some water or milk and i'm sure these would have been fine
without it but the actual traditional polish poppy seed roll
is almost always brushed with a glaze but it was kind of funny as i did this
the shinier they got the duller they became
is that a paradox anyway what i mean by that
it definitely shined up the dough parts but as that sugar cooled down the poppy
seed parts it actually sort of took away the
natural glistening those had when they came out of the oven
so maybe next time i won't do that although when you do glaze with sugar
like this it can help keep your rolls moist so
there is that but anyway i glazed and i waited and
once these were just about room temp i dug in
maybe a little bit early but i couldn't wait and that my friends was as amazing
and delicious as it was unique and unusual and because
i didn't grind them or use the egg whites to help bind them
i was kind of afraid that copious amount of filling was all going to crumble out
but you know what it really didn't it actually held together pretty well
and despite not grinding there was no shortage of poppy seed flavor
but anyway i scarfed that one down and then plated another one up
and i took a few more bites without pulling it apart so you get a little
better look at what's going on inside and what's going on inside i find
absolutely gorgeous and the contrast between that soft sweet
dough and the crunch of those seeds especially the exposed ones i found to
be extremely enjoyable and also very addictive which reminds me
if you have a drug test coming up you may want to make these after that
since you will definitely fail it so be careful
but anyway that's it maybe one of these days i'll actually make a proper poppy
seed roll or maybe i won't because i really did
think these were tremendous which is why i really do hope you give
these a try soon so please follow the links below for the
