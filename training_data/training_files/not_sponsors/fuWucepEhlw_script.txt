yo what is going on guardians and welcome back to another destiny 2 gameplay video hey in this video we're going to try to tackle the question guardians have been wrestling with for over seven years now and that's the question why do we hate hunters is it because of their stylish capes or their flashy exotics or does it go deeper than simple jealousy why is it that titans trying to duel hunters always feel like obadiah in iron man we'll answer all of that and more in this video but since we're on the topic of hunters and their general approach of jumping around like a cat to start engagements it seems like an appropriate destiny alrighty let's start breaking down some of the reasons hunters are so obnoxious to play against the very first thing on the list is the fact that hunters seem so often to be completely dead to rights but then miraculously find a way to get away from certain death just when you have them on the ropes they can break the targeting of your weapons and tracking of your grenades and cause your reticle to break its stickiness on them and instantly lunge out of fire into a safe space and if you choose to pursue them they have a wide variety of tools in their kit to all but guarantee their inevitable dumpstering on you for example shatter dive if you pursue them they can throw down an ice wall that doesn't even have to touch you and then smash it for huge aoe damage to one shot kill you and do all of that in less than a second in 0.7 seconds they can throw the grenade smash the grenade and kill you without ever seeing you without ever tracking your movement or predicting where you would put you could go high it kills you you can go low it kills you or in my case i actually love playing gunslinger gunslinger is my favorite way to play hunter and we have options too like the trip mine which will either do massive damage on a pursuer or make them slow down and halt their push to deal with the grenade first and that gives us time to get away or reposition hunters are master trappers it's sort of in their nature it's why they were designed the way they were designed and why they have the tools that they have and they have an impressive arsenal of tools to use against people who chase them specifically dodge rolls that can stop you in your tracks when you come to the corner to chase them smoke grenades to cloud your vision slow your movement trip mines and proximity knives that flinch and deal big damage shatter dives disorienting blows that disrupt your attacks and stop you cold in your tracks there's lots of options for hunters to turn the tables on someone who they thought they had the upper hand on that's one of the reasons players hate hunters the emotional toll of constantly getting a hunter weak only to be killed instantly when you pursue your kill is exhausting for players and it ends up making them even more reckless when they encounter that player again in the future of that match because they really want to stick it to him as we mentioned earlier the ability to roll is the number one most useful non-damage dealing ability in the game and it is not even close riffs and barricades are preemptive abilities that you deploy just before an engagement or after you already won one and need a second to recover but the hunter dodge is both preemptive and reactive a dodge in the middle of combat will turn the tides of the fight immediately if the hunter is losing the fight the dodge will break the aim assist of the other player causing their bullets to miss this often leaves opponents hitting the bottom of their magazine and forcing them to reload or switch to a weapon that isn't ideal for the scenario and it allows the hunter then to return fire unopposed that feeling is so terrible as an enemy player but the dodge isn't only reactive it can also be preemptive as well a hunter has the option to dodge into a lane and avoid things like snipers or linear fusions that may be holding the corner and know that when i speak about these things i do it as someone who plays both sides of the engagement sometimes i'm the player who's aggravated because the hunter the hunter got away or landed a one-hit attack and i couldn't dodge that thing or i'm the guy holding the lane sometimes i'm on the other end of it i'm the guy holding the lane whose shot wildly misses because the game didn't detect a target you know there during the dodge and then i get hit with a hand cannon or something before i can swap to my primary and return fire after the special weapon misses but like i said sometimes i'm the hunter i play hunter a lot i don't play any one subclass exclusively i've been a hunter lover since back in destiny 1 when i was constantly posting videos highlighting the gunslinger's utility one of my first destiny 2 videos ever was me taking the nightstalker into trials of the nine and shredding people with the elaborate movement options that hunter had in conjunction with early popular weapons with great inner accuracy that complemented the hunter's movement really well like the entire p or the last hope so don't hear this video as simply hunter hate instead it's an explanation for why hunters are aggravating to play against presented from a hunter perspective and a titan and warlock perspective both hunter and hunted another tool in the hunter's kit which is absolutely incredible is their ability to change directions on command in an instant both on the ground and in the air other classes can't do this a hunter can jump into the air and then midair and mid combat they can jump again in a different direction that can be unpredictable for the opponent this makes hunters the hardest opponents to hit with projectile weapons like fusion rifles and it's largely why i don't actually use fusions very much at all in end game pvp activities because hunters hunters are the king in endgame pvp and they always have been since destiny 1 first launched trials a fusion rifle lets out a loud audio queue when it's being charged and a hunter hears it and a good hunter will use their directional control to completely throw off that voop if i'm the hunter and i jump into a duel with a fusion rifle i'll simply use my double jump to change where i am while the opponent is charging the fusion that way the shot misses and the opponent has to start charging all over again if i'm on the ground in a duel with a fusion i'll simply dodge when i hear the charge in a random direction this breaks the aim assist of the fusion and if you don't know this you don't use fusions a lot when a fusion rifle doesn't have aim assist on a target it actually causes the projectile spread to be much more severe as we broke down in a different video in other words a hunter mid dodge is nearly impossible to kill with a fusion rifle shot unless the opponent happens to predict the direction you were going to roll and they manually drag the fusion while keeping the barrel down manually as well no other class in the game gets that immediate directional control except top tree dawn blades and even then you have to play a very specific skill tree on one of the warlock subclasses you only get one dodge now before the cooldown and it doesn't break aim assist so warlocks are actually pretty easy to track and shoot during that animation and the only way to use that dodge on the ground involves inputting a different series of commands than when you're in the air to pull it off making it harder for the average player to perform a ground dodge so it's harder to do with less reward and can only be performed on one specific skill tree in other words it's completely inferior it's a great ability don't get me wrong one of the best warlock kits one of the best warlock tools in the kit but it doesn't offer as much as a dodge roll so anyway the hunter can change directions both on the ground and in the air brake aim assist and that makes them very squirrely my survivability skyrockets when i play hunter just because you have the ability to get away from so much more this also includes freezing and slowing debuffs when you break out of a freeze from like from a silence and squall you can dodge roll away from the cloud of ice and get away warlocks and titans when they break free they just get to take you know three slow steps in any direction and still die and so there you have it these are just some of the reasons why guardians hate playing against hunters broken down in a list that's easy to quantify and qualify that frustration if this video resonated with you feel free to hit the like button on the video if you're a hunter main and you feel attacked suggest which class i should break down next for why players hate them and i'll keep this going just remember we're not throwing shade at any players here we're just breaking down the things that make hunters annoying to fight against if anything it's a compliment be warm and well fed my friends and i hope to catch you in the crucible
