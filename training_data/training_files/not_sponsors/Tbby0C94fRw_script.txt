alrighty so this match i decided to completely mix it up and play the opposite way as i usually do as the imposter normally when i'm the imposter i like to kill certain crewmates early on because they're way too good at sniffing me out as the imposter and usually you just have to kill those kind of players early but today i thought you know actually no i'll keep those players alive ak sepi and make him my win condition because if seppy stays alive till the last you know top three or top four kind of discussion rounds i think he's gonna vouch for me and protect me in a way and it actually worked so here's a quick preview on how confused sephie was in the late game discussions actually no i don't get it trust anyone okay so i think it's all right listen uh no i don't like this position like what like to me nothing he did with those dishes how he alrighty so now you know it's time to start slow cooking sepi i can clear daisy that's it it was two kills not and i believe rambo was at the entrance of navigation and went in no i was there was it that i had nowhere i can't tell yeah admins i was doing my download test then i then i wasn't watching the other person what do you mean again i never did it in the first place first time i went to do my card swipe so listen listen first time i went in to do my car swipe and then i went back up to i didn't realize i had a cafeteria test because i don't i usually go speed line straight to the camera room so i went to do that cafeteria so then that's the upload so download is in okay wait daisy you 100 saw rambo go into admin i saw that um but i don't know what blue is dead and blue walked into admin 15 seconds ago i checked it then i left and sephie came walking in i don't think timing-wise if you could have killed him so if rambo walked in how did you see seppie and what they did so i was in cam's i was on i was for like five seconds that the sepika can vouch for me he saw me yeah i saw him there and i and i was just checking where everybody was for positioning and blue walked into admin and i found that weird because he was an admin for two rounds now and now he's dead and if you're saying rambo was an admin that means rambo killed he didn't die in admins he's not an athlete i don't know where red is i found famous body okay and if you don't believe me don had a pet you can go check to see if his pet's in there okay well well actually that's a very good though if it's there then you can vote me but i guarantee it's not because okay i'm keen to check that actually i'm still suspicious of rambo it doesn't look like me too alrighty plan is working out just like we wanted it to so now we just need to look for the next crewmate to kill and i think honestly zan should be the next target just because he's kind of like he's made his way to us which is really good hopefully he does follow me here and uh we're just gonna try to pull him and lure him away so we could hide his body and get out so his body is tucked away and it's late game so i don't think anybody has tasks there anymore and we're going to the o2 to get all the crewmates shifted to the right side of the ship so for now we shouldn't kill anybody just yet and we should probably just show ourselves with the crewmates hopefully keenan has that idea and doesn't kill anybody on the right side where we both were just oh never mind i think keden's going to kill daisy all right i'm probably going to get blamed for this this is really not good honestly i don't know what to do here but i hope it works out wow where was it oh my god it was i was leaving um storage and then it was right there where comms is like right in the entrance and i saw all right i saw sepi doing trash i saw ari leaving but i saw him and i didn't see keaton or rumble this whole round i did see random sorry when i was walking towards o2 he was walking from navi down towards storage that's the only time i saw him around the other side i did go to top with you and i walked past him he did walk past me where did you go uh i walked straight down uh ari saw me walk past him after i walked past you and i went straight to cams so you went past uh coms to get to cams sure but so did ari i saw daisy around storage and she was walking towards o2 i walked all the way up top and then i went to admin that's just my parking you walked across me towards storage that's just literally what happened yeah why do i think it's sorry all right daisy send me a signal please listen okay so i was rambo or keaton lulu just because why is it not you ari because i saw 100 alive when i left her and when i come back i walked past youtube and she's dead now you came back because you're shocked i saw you with her too last round i was not with her i just saw her we were there for like 20 seconds at least listen all the only people that were on the i was the only one on the left side i'm 90 we don't know how long everybody else is on the right we're on that side before i am [ __ ] nobody found any money until now i think we bought rabbits i think people got around you don't vote me you don't vote me i think rambo killed blue i'm ninety-nine percent killed nobody [Music] [Music] okay this is not good at all we screwed up big time the reactor was hit way too early on in the round and by the time we finish the reactor my kill cooldown won't reset to zero which means they're gonna get to the button before i can kill someone and win the game unless i can close the doors and stall for a little bit i just need one more kill and we win the game just one simple kill come on come on wait what why we didn't vote anybody else right why didn't they just double kill someone i voted i think rambo i think rambo what the [ __ ] you know i wouldn't have [ __ ] that up you know i wouldn't have [ __ ] that up ari just tell me why why tell me why blue is dead when he walked into admin and i saw yous what do you mean you did you see his body there ari did you see his pet no his pillow i don't i don't want to cheat and ask him i don't want to ask him but i don't think blue has a pet i think fine man no dark blue has it unless you're dead so i'm not talking about blue isn't dark blue no you could see pets no no rambo you're mistaken he's talking about i'm talking about i'm talking about the color red the player red yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah dawn dawn yeah blue i'm pretty sure he has a pet if but we okay i know that they're about to finish the tasks but i need to play as a crewmate here and not as an imposter obviously that's the goal of the game however i need to really hit the button and pretend like i'm a crewmate i really need sepi to trust me here so i will do the o2 and not stall it i'm gonna do it in front of rambo so he sees that i have good intentions here this is where i really need to work stevie okay i am yeah 99 sure it's dark green based on that camera round two i am pretty sure blue on camera round two yes when you are you talking about you looking at me or daisy looking at me so i was on cams i saw blue walk into admin for the second time and i thought to myself that's just a bit strange so i went to note that as i was walking to go see what blue was doing so you somebody report the body okay or press the button daisy said she saw you at the entrance of admin right so the only person that i found too the only person that could have killed him is you okay and here's where i'm going to counter that hey the margin between you and daisy looking at the camera or and lulu looking at the camera was like there was enough time for him to walk away five six seconds no so five six seconds i leave sepi walks in so it couldn't have been 100 i walk out five seconds because i didn't see him walk out i didn't see blue walk out so it definitely that's where your logic is flawed i just think sepia and lulu are watching for each other for some reason i'm voting you i think he died on the actual swipe and i think vision-wise you're not understanding that nobody can see him if that makes sense if you're the criminal i killed daisy i did not kill daisy uh no i don't like this position okay okay hold on either lulu's out playing us for the third who are you voting for okay so i think it's all right listen why do i think it's sorry because me and sepi said we were going to stay together right and then we stayed together i know all right is clear so if brembo died if rambo died it would have been ari that killed him if all right he died rumble couldn't sleep he would have killed me early in the game i would have killed stephie early in the game he just knows too much when i'm the imposter and vice versa he always kills me that's 100 i just know that was sepi and i saw him i guess i saw him walk in at the time blue died and i i i'm not trying to throw an imposter here but it's i'm my heart says it's one of you lulu or a dark green rainbow the last person i would have to convince them is sepi right so for you to choose ari if you're saying it's me i think it's rambo honestly it has to be one of you two um because so when david died i crossed okay i crossed him and he was next to me we have to vote the vote i voted for i'm sorry why the [ __ ] i think i think lulu's happening i think either if it's not rainbow lulu's playing us again holy oh my god [Music] yeah like i don't know why we didn't vote i knew it was him i had to get you back for that big brain you did on us if [ __ ] youtube video i'm gonna cry you know that right actually already killed me in this spot that my body was completely hidden holy i can't believe twitter so i can find you and get you some cool surprises for halloween you
