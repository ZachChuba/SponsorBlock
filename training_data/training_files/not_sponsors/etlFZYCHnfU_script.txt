alright ladies and gentlemen welcome back to another episode of RL crafts as always brought to you by our sponsors MC drill feel free to check it out thanks to them so alright we back in the mine yeah there's um oh let me uh let me let me spawn some boys here dude I want it you know I'd really love if we could get like some skeleton to drop a bow wouldn't that be cool that'd be pretty cool yeah I think you owe that updated - speaking of skeletons dropping bows if you open up your skills which which skills see the skills through your inventory okay and you go into pretty much any of them I believe okay then down at the bottom and it'll show that you have skill points right we're accumulating those and we're supposed to use those on some of these effects that we choose and are those skill points depending upon the category I know they're global it looks like no it looks like the category because in mining I have six skill points in agility I've - so that's interesting you're right I added everything that's pretty dope dude so fossa bigger hold shift for description adds a small chance to mind - coal obsidian Smasher so these are separate though for the ones that you get when you hit L yes but they have similar weight my L stuff reset why did my own stuff reset oh do those reset when you D monetize I didn't reset you that was I think they do reset when you do monitor yep because I was at on the stone cutting I was at like level 2 and I had prospecting unlocked now I have none I don't think you did much demonization last time so that could be the case okay well then I'm gonna invest the skill tokens that we know we have in here obsidian Smasher highly increase the speed of obsidian mining while using a diamond pickaxe good thing we don't have those yeah the only thing that I like I'd noticed that and learned it and I was like Oh that'd be great but I just realized a lot of these require multiple skill points and so really the only thing that I had enough skill points was fossil digger yeah I have that but since it's not global I can do that and I have 4 there then I go into attack I have 5 skill points so battle spirit de monetizing a monster will give you a short strength buff ok oh that cost 6 though I can't even do that yeah alright we're gonna be you gotta be better than better than what you got there lucky fisherman 8 and 6 don't have enough there what about no none there so yeah it's pretty much the only one that we have oh oh oh I do have perfect recover under building blocks the drop components such as glowstone will always drop enough to rebuild them unlocks the abilities for course fruit to be used as a block transmutation agent which transforms some blocks into others what I'm gonna do perfect recovery sounds good makes sense to me don't have these ha that's a new thing for sure learning little things here and there paying attention to the comments and picking picking up what we got yeah I just need to acquire more points also more torches is another thing that's gonna be thank you for the bandage what a clutch okay see you you have the means to make lots more torches and sir ya just made 44 what the heck is that what is that see you you had a hypothesis this led to some kind of Dragons Den no that was back to us back behind us ok where where all that scorched stuff was I see so do we want to like dig through that I think that sounds like a very fast way to die does it but at least it'd be cool you know getting incinerated I mean you know if you're gonna do something you might as well get incinerated we've had less spectacular ways of getting do you monetize it's true it's true we have okay so and also we've done a lot of mining so it's not only we want to just keep on mining a bunch more right what is that sandstone oh yeah I was just putting I was putting sandstone rocks down so iron ore chunk is apparently something should I have so yeah this ash is supposed to be danger zone I know it's ready I don't know yeah I don't know where or why it is but this hash is supposed to be based off of you know or caused by Dragons okay there's our there's some losers in here though it kind of doesn't look like this goes anywhere though so I'm wondering if you know it's it's a partial it's a partial baby a partial baby yeah I'm it could very well be a partial baby you just you never Knight stop never you never really never I mean I'm just checking or stuff it would there be like a higher spawn rate of ores inside of a one of these dragons and places cuz hangers are the staties thing about how they work okay huh because I'm interested seems like there's more ores happening I think it rolls which ass something we normally find well I mean emeralds could just be a higher spawn right because we're in like some kind of extreme Hills biome sort of I guess that's true as well f3 doesn't tell us a whole lot now does it no f3 doesn't help very much is that more emerald formative you know more emeralds I'm just like wondering if the Dragons they're like small --ga smog smog oak yeah they like acquire resources they like to sit on riches they are supposed to have quite the the riches in there I do believe that's a thing but there's a decent amount of stuff going on chard cobblestone shard stone high-five emeralds now six if you count the other one hey can I have some of those torches perhaps thanks mate much appreciate and it's a cave that dead ends oh no it's one of the evil rats okay it's one of the evil bad rats Oh buddy it's not good it's not good it coming in gonna not good point good point do that oh my god he wants me so badly don't know no he's on fire got it whoa I hate those I hate those dude they're so hard to hit they've such a small hitbox do that sword how much damage does it do 7.5 attack damage okay and then it's got it's it's actually rusted so it's minus 10% but it also has fire aspect too okay kind of cool kind of cool other than other than the part where fire aspect to will light you on fire bro I just want to find the Dragons Den I'm not sure you do like I'm curious too but at the same time like hey my my inner cell says no I found the Dragons Den is there a dragon oh my god come here there yes come hither it's very large it's I don't think we could take it I mean I I don't think we could take it either but the thing is is it can break blocks to you by the way oh really oh yeah how do you know these things I know a lot of things I know many things uh-huh I'm down here hello nice nice there's a couple different ways to get to you so like you got okay okay holy crap yeah also we have mining fatigue for currently I'm not sure if you've noticed is that cuz are you holding your torches in your offhand oh yeah yeah okay you were where you were holding a two-handed weapon Plus yeah yeah I was thinking the dragon gave that to us yeah no that's that's not a good thing and I I feel like you're making bad mistakes there are so many chests down there dude there's so many chanock you're making really bad plays at the moment there's what are all those like honey combs is that gold I don't know that's a large huge what do we how do we owe a grown Enderman okay well that's why is he why is he mad at me oh sorry ain't what Oh easy God dang it it wasn't even the dragon either I well the heck did he frickin Frick how do you how does an Enderman headshot me how far away are you out of curiosity it's quite significantly far and it's nighttime okay what it's like do you have your sleeping bag but I guess you don't know I don't have that also don't have a compass so I can't even quite remember how to get to where we were Oh God what's up it moved I heard a roar and okay is it going I think it's just moving I don't think I've heard it but I don't like it I don't like it so yeah your stuff right it's all in here in the Dragons Den wait it's inside the Dragons Den like I'm inside a Dragon's Den sort of thing like you know it's all in this area okay but it's not like literally in the Dragons game but you know I'm just I'm just saying I'm picking up your stuff I will leave I think I actually know how to get back and so we're gonna be really totally totes totes fine totes mcgoats fine yes that's good oh my god my sense of direction is impeccable you have an impeccable sense of district Direction distraction yes--that - okay can you you want to come to the just in case no we're fine actually there's no monsters sold it up I see your I see your name alright I'm coming to you it's gonna be great I'm gonna get my stuff back yeah I took care of you thanks man I got you I lost my experience which I meant to use in order to level things up but oh well I have I have 15 levels yeah those were my levels thanks dude you took my filled canteen you only had one drink left and I was thirsty oh my god dude yeah you're just like all your everything good belongs to me time don't die to an Enderman okay hey hot bro friends like you I should have just stayed back where I was I took your stuff and I say didn't I put in a chest what do you want from me to an extent I suppose you could call it that what did you give me my pickaxe back either wait do I have your pick no I do have my pickaxe also torches would be cool those would be no that isn't my pickaxe was not broken oh my god bro did you come on come on that was funny I was little oh my oh my god uau omegle old I am mega old listen I'm very hip with the kids these days okay so here's your water and now we can follow the dragon moved a bit from last time yeah stop looking at it don't go near it but stop it stop that is I am like in ultra stressed by that drop I had here I had five charcoal filters as well okay I you had four but they just stacked so I didn't realize that's not me you know just because I know I had one but there we go okay right so we even never come back here again really you don't want to be here even I want to leave and never come back here again what is this your act behind and because I have an axe and that was your furnace so yeah that's why dude I'm disappointed I thought that we were adventure boys no no no not with Anna out with a dragon what are you going fire dragging 455 hit points wow that's big hit points very big you didn't hear it move I did it make big sound it was I I basically build my shorts and then like coward and block up dude why want to be Bilbo okay well you're trying not to make a short joke here Bilbo is my hero okay uh-huh Bilbo is who I strive to be okay and you don't seem to care about my dreams I just you don't have that we don't have a way stone here so I don't know like we have to get back here at some point and we have to we have to steal okay so your your call is just keep on exploring I honestly like my instinct is to go and find a way stone cuz you were just that one right I was but that was a far far away one we should find another one just header can go drop off and and then you know then I feel more free to do whatever and derp up a little bit but at this point I'm down to two inventory slots of things I want to okay well then we could we could go sailing from what I understand the ocean is much more death than anything else oh is that right I'm just a wuss I guess because I say Lee and I'm like nah is there anything they do wanna do do anything you do want to do I was thinking we could go and and make some marshmallows and hide in a corner with walls around us okay so that being ruled out is there anything you would like to do I'm good I'm good what do you want to do you want to go sailing on the high seas I I believe that that would be a poor choice in my opinion like everything what I want is I want to find like a battle tower and try and do something like that where where it's kind of rape more regular mobs bow or but we can but you know not not just instagib like a dragon would be you know mmm that would be ideal to me is this like a dungeon II kind of thing or is this just a case it seems very dungeon II like this is not a a standard situation by any means a couple creepy boys hmm I haven't seen this monster before it's like a reindeer but angry Oh angry deer yeah I I dunno it's hard to explain but yeah right that dragon roar was enough to make me be like like it was it was we got a rat we got in here dude we got a rat this could be a prob don't forget to summon I forgot to summon I got it I got the freaking I got the rat yeah and the rats you got the rat Reaper I did dude we need to get some infernal mobs because the infernal mobs are the ones that drop the really good gear I saw one the green ones yeah I saw one on the way here but I'm sure it's despond at this point but if you want to do we could head back in that direction in the very toasty desert and see we could find it because it was one of the sheep dudes so they're pretty Oh she'll be pretty that'd be pretty handy today yeah do I uh you want to help with a reindeer you want to see what those guys do do you have ingots on you what kind of ingots iron iron yeah I'm in the main the first spot I need I need three ingots cuz my pickaxe broke okay here you want to do you want to try you want to see what these reindeer boys do let me see how much health it has Oh jammer walk 17 health that seems pretty doable that seems doable okay I don't mean coming it's like three three is more than a couple but can do Wow here we go go be be aggressive be aggressive Oh janggu out there watering them he's watering their plants dude oh go on go on Django's go on angry deer is how you describe these yeah they kind of do a play give me a break wow you like overdid the Jing goose hey man I got lots of magic power oh they got some leather so we can make backpacks and stuff with James go on look at them Jane goose go dude look at them Jang goose oh I'm looking at the jinger's go I just don't know I want this to be a dungeon I really do but it doesn't seem to be I guess it's just the normal cave in this biome it seems like a structure that's not that dungeon like just now it kind of here's a thing let's head back up I guess perhaps and you want to try to file let's let's go back to the desert see if that dude is still there probably not but if it is it's free loot for us potentially and then we can continue and try to find a structure of some sort it's so interesting when I'm in my world that I use to take like thumbnail screenshots and stuff there are so many structures all over the place I think we just got a really really like bad spawn place here because that we are having such a hard time finding things that can be explored we did have the battle tower that was back bar because I mean we're we just kind of ran a little way from where our literal originals that's true that's and that had a battle tower right back there and we did come in that direction again we've always gone because that was to the south of us I believe right now with the east and we will spend west and north oh boy we and toasty out here is the only scary bit is that the boy is that the boy no that's not the boy it was down here it's probably not there anymore but we'll see oh that might actually be it is that the boy oh yeah that's the boy right there I think the golden Yale would you like to do it I don't know if anything's gonna happen and I feel kind of badly but you know it's getting really hot I don't that's an infernal I saw good I saw like a thing over it though so no maybe not maybe not okay we got to get out of this desert though is the only issue you did chilling here for okay why i'ts I'm not that hot come on oh no no no no no no no we bad news we have bad news on the horizon don't just don't just don't look at is that it does it actually work that way yeah yeah it does really okay yeah bad oh it's easy I'm gonna summon boys come on boys oh you did when you get what'd you get what'd you get what'd you get other than 50 levels I got five levels okay and I don't think that was infertile egg I think he was special but I don't think it was internal oh yeah you got something hey you got something you got today uh I need to raise my agility um cantaloupe can I have one of the things maybe oh look at that that's a ranged weapon what's it called yeah can I see what it is an iron strengthened the longbow I know that's what I'm talking about and I got a couple arrows but I need what I need a little bit like four levels in order to be able to use these my requirements attack eight agility six where my adds agility five six oh I'm agility six now an attack is 11 I could use it Wow okay hey I'm just stealing that from me that's fine I don't even have arrows really so let's see all right four arrows dude we out here I mean it's actually like pretty good to have a ranged weapon I'll take it not gonna complain in any way you complain a little bit we have a couple feathers and I don't know we have some slips Wentz yeah yeah okay save 120 in case we need it for a canoe fee and that and I had sticks in my industry don't seem to have them anymore give some yes yes gratzi hopefully they're the a they are the normal crafting recipe that's exciting dude any more feathers I thought we had a lot of feathers we have two oh that was it all right cool oh no no no we won't we have more with more oh okay I should I say we haven't found like much in the way of chickens or anything like that all right sixteen arrow is definitely better cool oh my god I'm hot in the cave Wow wow that's uh that's wild that's not gonna be fun going outside at all Thank You summer season for starting and being quite unpleasant I call that being right so it's not but we might as well just go press Ryder we're gonna press right yeah Rai Crestor crest rider or whatever it be whatever it do you know whatever and we got our sleeping bags so we can pass the night wait so is that is that charred stone there as well is that agony a dragon flying through oh not necessarily a den though not necessarily okay so I see if the forest like has the burn to it as well and it's not already like in the ground then it's more just like a dragon kind of burned it from above I believe so I mean I'm not a dragon expert so we started that was where we started oh my gosh I recognize this it's the battles right over here okay cool it's just over this hill yeah I guess we took kind of a roundabout way when we had seen it so that makes it really just like oh I recognize I died here yeah at one time okay boy so but you said breaking the spawners are the ideal way to go that be better yes oh boy oh boy so but we wanted we'd only give them time to spawn so we just basically want to run it we want to rush in you have our boys we gotta have our boys sever boys out and arrows just sitting right there get our boys out dude get our boys out what freedom oh god don't don't head short me got him got it there we go there we go we on the chest stone stuff so it's probably gonna increase in goodness whoever lasting torches are in here nice that's good oh can we break that we can break the torches off the wall yes and there also if they like this one right here on the side you can see it doesn't have the I just put that there yeah that's what I'm saying it's like if you put one of the everlasting ones it yeah like a you know no it has the the cool stuff oh this goes down as well as up interesting oh no it doesn't okay I'll just take that though so we go up over here oh okay all right boys let's get it let's get it going get it Poppins bye baby boys all right Jane COO Jane coos oh God Oh careful careful okay that's not going I'm careful that's not going well I I think I didn't think we were gonna charge in that hard honestly I didn't go careful yeah I've um guys there's a few levels around there yeah I've I've not gone in and picked up your stuff I'm just gonna wait for you to come back I just want to point out that I would have gotten your stuff by now no I thought it'd be good if you just that way I don't combo you're actually like combine your stuff with mine and it's not an issue we're pretty you're pretty close right if zooming I can remember your slits sleeping bag right I'm sleeping bagging do something bag but you don't have a sleeping bag of course no I don't cuz you could weigh stone back and the way stone back just double way stone it's it's fine okay all right all right don't just I'm by the lava that we spawn there okey-dokey send in the Jane coos and I'll try to I guess I'll just try to shift and get oh my god why is it coming down where the heck how didn't even do that oh my god I'm poisoned there's a hole in the floor up there oh ballsacks did you now oh it's behind me oh no oh no no no no no we don't like this we don't like this okay yeah here I'll stomach I'll summon boys my seven boys come on oh god I'm freakin poisoned again he's spiders are the word out behind you mother-fricker if such a small hitbox God dangit I'm so low no stuck at white why in the world did that I'm a little annoyed I'm just a little annoyed because I grabbed a one of the healing things and then brought it up and it was like here choose what you want to heal oh my god there's so many there's so many I'm gonna need you to step up here a little bro I already have spiders coming after me and I poisoned every time that I engage that's the problem yeah sound it sounds like a problem Jesus personally we could we could we could can you put down torches okay so that it they spawn less oh look there's all these other bad guys here um possibly yeah I want to try to seal up the hole in the floor maybe it might help ever-so-slightly god damn it don't the the grinder eventually stops spawning though right yeah know that it spawns stronger and stronger stuff and there spawners my grinders but it's strong a spawns stronger stronger stuff until does it eventually pops that's good can you could you build up and break the spawner from the bottom oh that's a good haul locks that's it right there who I have haste three right now as well from Yale me yep got it dude that's the strategy that's god damn it they could go through one by one of course I can give me all gave me a bandage I need it so badly also apparently I keep picking up string and then placing it on things what okay I got the other spawner I got the other spawner they're coming good good good scuse me behind you oh god Jesus Christ what where do you get it from he fell behind you oh god bro yeah I mean I know that feel but we well Lisa was on the ground floor Lisa was on the ground floor Oh God Oh God okay Frick that's all my stuff freakin Fricker's okay I think my stuff's pretty much demonetized at this point really oh you mean on that oh right on that second floor I didn't realize you weren't able to reap ich it up and there's still a lot of guys up here there's still a lot of guys up here Oh Oh Oh God come down come you out abandon ship Bandon ship they're coming for some reason I could not hit the dude there we go yeah there hitboxes are quite small because they're very small boys it doesn't doesn't really help whoa this has been nightmarish I wonder what happens as you literally that was through the wall that's always but now if I want to go in there wait for you to come back I guess the problem is it's like we're probably gonna end up hitting each other if we're going in simultaneously in a small area I gotta say I've been trying to catch it but I gotta say it's interesting just the difference in sense of urgency that you feel when it's your stuff T spawning versus money brah I lost all my stuff this is not like we're not exactly like in a unique situation where like I I haven't lost stuff before and also I am picking stuff up right now they're all over this place holy mother run run run run run there are so many there are so many a story cool okay hold up I might uh did I pay I paid up a chest plate here come I can give you a chest plate buddy chest plate at the bottom yeah here I'll try to take one out okay I hate when they're in that like partial you can't hit it yeah that's it oh oh they're very what the heck oh there's a zombie yeah what the heck is that what is that oh god now there's zombies coming in do you need to you need a cab back and I can't possibly possibly yes holy cow somewhere lore sewn through this hole potentially okay zombies down that must be the next level up I'm assuming ooh they are dropping the healing sounds though which is nice Oh bezel writers damn grants an immunity to poison boy that'd be nice wait oh it went in gobble spot okay you're out all right I got you there was there was there was there there more coming there more coming careful Garrity oh geez also we got octopus monster oh my god that's amazing oh my god oh he's got intense real fast right there okay Oh like everything fell from the sky and on to me all right you want me to try to you want to try to get your stuff oh god I just got punted holy crap frickin armored zombie just walks in with a fireball in its hand and punches me in the face what the heck I was like I was totally fine and then he's just like no I'm gonna end this right now Oh Halbert boy is on me Oh God he picked up the halberd - oh that must have been why he was so armored he picked up you're picked up all your gear well let's oh oh thank goodness my halberd you're helping there you go okay all right and I had I have full armor okay cool um I have do I have any armor on me right now doesn't look like you- i have no armor I got I got I got I just picked up some armor okay cool that was down there and there you go there's still spiders on the frickin wall oh oh here we go let me take let me let me go in cuz I can I can handle them with the nez or okay all right all right okay holy crap did we did you clear it you cleared it my goodness there's those two that are stoked of us oh it's an infernal one as well careful bait once they drop they all go nuts oh it's it's and then the get that get the infernal one it's up in the corner Manny's got a lot of health whoa there we go oh another bizarre put that in your eye put that in your baubles that green thing put into your baubles an enhanced hammer okay enhance nauseous below us like the two-handed sword and stuff like that that's okay like I mean you know it's week we came here with the idea of this could be death yeah no we've been adventuring what's the next one well I think the zombie spawn I might have actually broken oh oh cuz you just spawned enough um here let me either let me hit you up with some stuff cuz they think some of this meant you although you might have some bandages of mine and some of that itemized bandages by the way oh okay cool yeah yeah but oh actually I had this one okay so I don't know god I don't know no no infernal oh we're good oh he dropped the thing what did he drop iron tax efficiency 2-1 reach distance so not actually that great but you don't want to keep it attacked 9 attack damage though whoa okay there's a lot of going on up there but we are at least oh I can't use that I know oh god I fell down I fell down dolls of the floor it's fine it's fine it's fine I'm okay okay so um catch those up maybe all right let me get my inventory sorted here momentarily yeah do you have a canteen or anything like that because I have one canteen okay but we lost the what sounds like we lost the bucket and my canteen okay we lost I think your armor got lost but do you want to get in one of your pieces yeah so that we be even three apiece Hey hang on okay just fighting over here you won't be dead oh my gosh these guys spawn behind us as variables alright I need to heal for a second cool I think yes I had was it one one part alright so you just want to drink from canteen oh we don't the bucket though so oh god yeah we there's water out here so okay I don't want to do that this has one charge here let me let me give this to you I mean I've got water right here oh I thought you said you had the oh yeah I thought you said you didn't have a canteen I don't have a canteen that's why I came down to the water oh okay go drink from break what what just hit me oh where did you even come from I think he spawned when I killed one of those spiders oh okay um see you've you've consumed so I have your canteen okay and there's yours so you can have that back cuz it's as I lost mine we have the bazaar and there's an imp over there do you have blocks to build or any thank you yeah kind of annoying there's also an infra-red across the river look right here right here yeah oh I thought you were referring to another one wanting to use it no okay what the like what it just hit frickin Jesus they have a they have a ranged attack okay okay well let's try this hoho get pooped on dude get pooped on dude that's what I'm talking about that's what I'm talking about forgot that I am mad dude yeah do you oh are you using a stone sword here here yeah I didn't realize um let me get this let me get this and I will give you a hammer after we tend to this situation oh that's you it's a few all right here Hammer hammer time okay the spawners have destroyed oh that's Spidey boy up there okay I hit it as hey we got a bow in here you dig a bow more feathers - that's good glass all right here bow ball on the ground oh my that's a bets a bet this is a bad time I'm a bad time bedtime bedtime bed well there's gotta be punted there what is with me getting just one hit by zombies I mean I got he chased me down and killed me - anyone hit you in a few levels no no no I took a couple yeah no see that's the thing it's always the one hit with me I don't know what it is about my head I know it's large checking to see if your heads heal I did my head was healed it was good okay I mean if you were if you have ten hearts all right nine and a half then the worst your head could be is down half a heart I wasn't ready but you were you weren't ready and so the good news is I died a little bit lower whoa so I did make it down there's a boy I think I think the zombies followed yeah they probably picked up everything that is a boy over there in the water that reminds me of some freaking subnautica stuff over there oh my god I can't see oh yeah yeah that's naughty I haven't seen one of those before okay yeah so here's the plan you go in you get them on you you run away and I'll pick up everything yeah sounds simple enough oh hi hi he's right there hi he's right there he's right there okay one of them coming down one of them coming down I mean I guess that's one way to do it hey we gotta kill him that's true use what you got which I got my fists and my fury see that's yours okay wait uh yeah okay I got an axe yeah I hear let's split split the weaponry yeah it's give me something that can do damage there is hammer oh and then here is some boots all right there's another thing on the oh there's a chest plate on the ground dope nice okay cool all right was it an infernal one that oh yeah

down careful dude go oh god I'm leaving don't leave it only with him leaving okay oh they're falling down everywhere he's got my bed or though get it get it right behind you okay I wonder if the zombie spawners have at least stopped spawning and like we're just dealing with what is that what is blind I'm blind I'm swinging wildly oh my god you killed it alright one guy left he down okay I need to heal real quick if that's a possibility oh maybe boy mini boy good good good good holy crap I got a potato so you do any heals here that's all I got okay that's fine yeah I do a little bit
