so I was wrong I made a video a few weeks ago talking about how my stop signs and stoplights ability was really bad and I was turning it off or I was considering turning it off I was kind of asking and everybody in the comments what they thought and it was pretty split I think more people told me to turn it off but there are a few people who said keep using it so you can teach it it can learn which is you know always a little controversial we were not true that really is well I guess I wasn't exactly wrong because the things I complained about at the time were complaints of mine and and they were wrong but the reason I say it was wrong is because now everything is working way better so some of my complaints are still there like you can't go you know five over the speed limit like you could before and at the stop signs you know it kind of stops at them too far back sometimes and you can't really see but let's check out some of the features that now it's doing really well and just a couple of weeks ago I had huge complaints about some of this stuff and now it's been working perfectly ever since last update like like perfectly I have it it's not like it's 90% there and I'm like oh it's good I'm gonna use it it's like ready to go so let's check it out if you end up like in this video please hit like and get subscribed so the few of the things that were really messed up actually one of them worked in the video I have a double stop sign up here that we're about to come to and in the video it actually worked and that was the first time and it worked for me and I was very surprised and now it's worked pretty much every time not sure exactly what that beeping was but I have somebody behind me so hopefully it doesn't break too hard and I'm not sure if these things happened because I did end up leaving it on I did use it I mean it wasn't even that long you know again since I needed that video that we got an update and I noticed these improvements so was it specifically because I left it on there's really no way to know another interesting thing is Andre cap Aarthi who is the lead of the auto pilot team gave a presentation and one of his screenshots was actually from one of my videos and it was my video where they first released the stop signs stop lights update and so he used that clip not too talk about any of the problems I was having but to show you know I had kind of a zoomed in view and whatever he thought it was a good demonstration but the reason that's really interesting first of all it's very cool to see to see that but the other reason it's interesting is because because that is well it stopped at the first stop sign so it used to go through and go to the next stop sign I don't know why I've slept on the breaks art but why that's cool is it shows that it's it's proof Tesla is looking at our videos that we're putting up and they are getting that feedback directly not just through you know the cars learning but also themselves seeing it and maybe fixing some of those problems so that was the first one that double stop sign I was in the middle of talking but it used to just go through that you know you can see in my original video I did it twice and it would go through the first stop so him to go to the second it hasn't done it since the last update even before the last update actually but that was a really big one for me and again was it because there were disengagement s' there did the auto pilot team you know receive data from the car that showed two stop signs and maybe the car had only a certain confidence level and they checked that out or was it somebody saw in the video and they're like hey let's fix this scenario or something like that now coming up to some stoplights here this is a two twofold improvement really for me number one I'm getting less false positives for stoplights that I come up behind so on the other side of the road I have a stoplight that's hanging down in the road but only the back of it is is facing you because it's it's for another direction of traffic and Mike are used to react to it every time and kind of freak out and want me to hit the accelerator and have to use the pedal to go through now it doesn't react to it anymore also for green lights you can see it's gonna detect pretty early here this green light actually this one is a map so it detects a little late but I hit that and it goes through then it's gonna go to the next green light and you'll see right away I hit that and it goes through whereas before I was having a problem where it would detect them back early which you know works pretty well and I'd hit the stock to continue but then as I approached the light it would kind of rethink like oh wait did he really confirm this or I don't know what the logic was there but it would say stopping in let's say 600 feet for a green light I hit this stock which it's gonna ignore for red light and a car in front of me of course and it would go okay we're gonna go through then it would reach rigor at 300 feet or go 300 feet you want to go through and I'm like what the heck and it would be hitting the brakes harder it hasn't done that again at all since I got the update blinking yellow lights are still a little weird they're more consistent now at least I'm finding they they kind of behave the same way they're treated just as a yellow light so the car does try to stop at them but before they would kind of blink in and out of existence and all this weird stuff would happen so that's another pretty big improvement alright so coming up - what was my biggest and kind of most dangerous complaint these overhead signs here would be misinterpreted as traffic lights and the car wouldn't stop at them of course or I may not be here anymore but it would hit the brakes you know pretty good bringing you down maybe five or ten miles per hour and ever since this update I'm not gonna say it's a hundred percent except did it just show it on the screen I think but I would say it's like 95 percent and the only reason is because it has not reacted to these signs once since this left West update but I have seen the message pop up here for just a second and I'm seeing I never noticed this before but I'm seeing a stop line there I don't know if you can see that on the camera I'll try to zoom in or something but it's actually displaying a stop line below those signs but it's not reacting to them which is a good thing and it didn't use to show that line so coming up okay yeah there's a stop line there oh yeah and it showed it showed a green light that's crazy so it never actually displayed it before but it was reacting to it now that's weird I didn't notice that it was actually and it just showed that one on the side of the road but that's okay I don't mind because it's not actually hitting my brakes it has not hit my brakes one time with these signs since it's less uptick we can go under the sign I was head it would happen anyway in any lane I was having this happen but it maybe seemed to happen in this lane a little more which makes sense and again so I think the message just popped up there really quick for a second but no braking by my car no slowing down that was for sure the biggest complaint I had and it's it's gone and so I've kind of totally changed my mind I'm definitely leaving this feature on it's only been like two months since its released and it's already gotten so much better with its smoothness in stopping at stop signs and stoplights it's not perfect but it's way better these bugs that I at least I had on my commute are way better let me know what you think if you're experiencing the same thing I got a couple more but I was to do those later in the day so oh and I'm gonna save this as well so you can you'll have already seen it but we'll see how it looks because I imagine especially with the rain it gets a little confusing and I was hoping to do that for the stoplights as well I hope I got it in time I'm not sure if I hit the button in time but I was curious how it looked you know off this front camera with the rain looking at those lights so I will see you later in the day for a few more examples and then coming from the other direction having the red X's to the left that means the lanes closed so I can't drive in that Lane but I was having more trouble with the system responding to those than I was with the green but same thing I'm not getting any errors here it doesn't pick him up it doesn't even seem to be displaying them really like it was on the other side I think that was due to the rain but just a guess from me but so again just another example that they improved this pretty quickly and now I'm willing to leave it on and use it every day another big thing that's coming in an update soon that's been leaked is turn autopilot off so he can move over is that the car will start to move through green lights without stopping if you have a lead car so again just a couple months later another huge improvement and it's a good step because they need to slowly you know add these abilities as they deem them safe and that's a great way to do it a great way to add moving through the green lights if you have a car in front of you moving through that green light and the car thinks it's green which I've never really seen it get it wrong by the way I've seen where I can't see the light sometimes because something's in the way but I've never seen a green light look red on that display but so a good way to verify that what the car seeing is green is the car in front of you goes through that green you don't have to tap the stock you don't have to hit the accelerator that line that shows up that red stop line will be green indicating the car can move through alright so coming up to this light here you can see this light in the middle hanging above me my car used to always respond to that and now it's not responding to that it's responding to the green it always used to try to hit the brakes for that one up in the middle and it was the worst because then it would get confused with the next light and again it hasn't happened once since this last update all right so this last one we're about to try going under the bridge I actually have not done this yet so we're gonna find out here live together whether this works or not but there's a red light off to my right I'll get over a lane if I can just in case but it was happening even in this Lane where my car would respond to that red light as if it was mine but it's for a totally different lane going this way so there's there's too many cars over to my right so I'm gonna stick here but it would happen in this lane as well so let's see if that's fixed I don't know as we approach that I'll tell you this off anything on their entire website link is in the description ok so going through this red light you can see that red light to the right there and no it's still yeah stopping for that one you can see it thinks that's the one and I have two and it was gonna veer over to the right there so hey yeah not everything is perfect I had not tried that one yet and unfortunately that is not fixed yet so that's it overall extremely happy with my commute anyway things are looking much much better and so I will be leaving this on looking forward to the updates especially going through green lights pretty novel I can't believe it but it'll be really exciting getting all these you know new abilities all the time it seems like they're updating this really fast unlike you know something like smart summon you know sort of something came out and I don't think it's been updated once sometimes it works better than others depending on the parking lot you're in and just the luck of the draw with traffic and all that but yeah I don't know I need to try I need to try that again anyway thank you for watching I look forward to hearing about your experiences with this ability or your opinion on these improvements how quickly they came out from Tesla if this is an ability you would actually use or not because at this point I'm actually enjoying it I guess since we're still here let's just do under this bridge one more time because there are because there are traffic lights up above here so we're good there and then yeah it's still confused like that one is I just use that it's sort of the people turning right there so yeah it so gets a little confused I mean that's a little confusing it's pretty much my lane but anyway thanks for watching this one I look forward to talking you down in the comments and you will see my car in the pirate fire saw autopilot I'm solo no pilot and I are happily driving alone
