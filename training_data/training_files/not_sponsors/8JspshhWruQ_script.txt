you're cruising down the road nice and smooth and then pothole you got a pick if you want a firm shock or a soft shock or off-road shock wouldn't it be great there was one type of shock that could do all that guess what there is I'm talking about Magna ride suspension so you might know that most shocks work because of hydraulic dampening hydraulic dampening is the use of a fluid like oil to impede movement most traditional hydraulic shocks work kind of like syringe tube attached to the frame depresses a plunger component which pushes on the oil the same way this syringe can't depress if I cover the hole in order for the shock to move the oils gotta have somewhere to go so there's holes in the shock that let the oil move out of the way there's two ways to change how quickly this movement of the dampers can occur so I got two syringes here these plungers are gonna represent the dampers in your car the difference is in a shock there's holes inside this so the fluid moves entirely within the shock itself so one way to affect the dampening characteristics of a shock is by changing the viscosity the fluid this is just dish soap you know how about how thick that is right and clean that desk off this is molasses it's much thicker it's got much more resistance great so that's one way we could get different behaviors out of the same structures another way to change the rate of flow is to use the same fluid but change the holes through which it flows this is a fat needle this is a tiny skinny needle this one moves much quicker I got to work on my Grif stream so it's easy to see how changing the size of the holes in the damper also changes the behavior of the suspension traditional socks are white but traditional shocks are set you gotta prioritize do you want comfort at the expense of handling and stopping performance or performance we're gonna feel every little bump in the road there's some cars that try to have both sports suspension and cruising comfort by changing the flow of the fluid mechanically Bilstein develops shocks that will open holes in the dampers pull out less dampening and close them to provide more firmness there's sensors that detect roll forces and compressive forces from the road let's say you're cruising along in a nicely paved road while the dampers are open to absorb all those little bumps then when you turn quickly or brake real fast the dampers close restricting the flow of fluid and this provides firmness reducing body roll in improving handling man I hate it when there's rocks in my socks this type of variable mechanical dampening has been available in some pretty rad cars and it works pretty well with modern computing and processing the shocks can change firmness really quickly but they're still limited by the speed of the mechanical action inside the shock itself what if there is a way to instantly change the dampening without relying on mechanical parts why not use magnets that's a good idea but if you got magnets in there they're always gonna be working hey you talking about my girl I tell you what I go off and on but switch easy there electromagnet I'm just making a science show but he's right if you can turn a magnet on and off you can change the characteristics of a magnetized fluid electromagnet fever just talk see you guys later magnets how they work oh but before we get into some of this stuff make sure you're subscribed means a lot to us and it's how we get to bring you new shows this is where magneride comes in magneride was developed by the delphi automotive corporation for GM throughout the 90s and it debuted on the 2002 and a half Cadillac Seville STS so how does it work Magna ride damper fluid is a synthetic damper fluid plus tiny little iron microspheres when subjected to a magnetic field the fluid greatly increases its apparent viscosity to the point of becoming a viscoelastic solid importantly the yield stress of the fluid when it's in its active state can be controlled precisely by varying the magnetic field intensity in each of the monotube dampers is a piston containing two electromagnetic coils and two small fluid passages through the piston it used to be one coil but we'll get to that in a minute when a current is sent through the electromagnet it creates a magnetic charge of varying intensity that's how electromagnets work when the magnets are off the fluid travels through the passages freely but when they're on the iron particles in the fluid create a fibrous structure through the passages in the same direction of the magnetic field the strength of the bonds between the magnetized iron particles causes the effective viscosity of the fluid to increase resulting in a stiffer suspension if the sensor sends any body roll that communicate the information to the ECU the ECU will compensate for this by changing the strength of the current to the appropriate dampers instantaneously to demonstrate how a magnetorheological dampers we've got these two syringes connected with magnetorheological fluid inside these when things are moving normally easy-peasy this is a magnet we've just created a plug very similar to the way this works in a car suspension there's tiny little iron molecules mixed in here it's not the same proportion as what's in a shock absorber but let's see how they behave yeah call me get over here Luis yeah watch the show isn't it crazy you got it alright let's dig into that viscoelastic solid thing that I said earlier most traditional suspensions use a Newtonian fluid for dampening a Newtonian fluid is a simple fluid in which the state of stress at any point is proportional to the time rate of strain at that point when we talk suspension damper fluid the proportionality factor is viscosity with the thickness of it when magnetized the fluid in a magneride damper is known as a Bingham plastic a Bingham plastic is a non-newtonian fluid exhibiting a yield stress that's got to be exceeded before flow starts after that the rate of shear first shear stress curve is linear and all that means is that the magnetic coils in the damper aren't totally changing the viscosity of the fluid per se they're instead turning the fluid into a kind of plug that limits the flow of the dampening my buddy Adam is always saying that ketchup is a non-newtonian fluid harder you're shaken the firmer it gets that's why it won't come out it's 40 guy Adam can't get through breakfast without him talking about I get it the first two generations of magneride were great they didn't have any of the difficulties of mechanical internal parts that could fail and they didn't have to deal with the lag time of those same mechanical parts when the dampers closed or open but with the magnetic coil there was a small delay from when the ECU turned off the current to when the damper lost its magnetic field this was caused by a temporary electric current or an eddy current from the electromagnet eddy currents also called foo called currents are loops of electrical current induced with conductors by a changing magnetic field these currents hung around of them and slowed the off action of the damper the third generation of magneride introduced a second electromagnetic coil on the piston of each damper these two coils are wound in opposite directions from each other so that the eddy currents cancel out the dual coil system effectively eliminated the delay causing an even quicker responding suspension system BWI also redesigned the ECU in the third generation the new and improved ECU's got three times the computing capacity is the previous edition as well as 10 times more memory it's also got greater tunability cars got track marks street modes in sport mode that means the ECU is giving different outputs in each mode based on the same inputs so now it's not just like you got firm shocks and soft shocks like in the early days but you got like a million different shocks in one that's Magna ride
