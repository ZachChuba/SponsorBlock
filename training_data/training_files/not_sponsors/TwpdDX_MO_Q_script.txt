all right Lachlan what you know how we've been serial in this house because we can decide which goes first milk or cereal versus cereal first but whatever we're obviously it's milk but we move past that okay we'll move past it but it's clearly cereal but whatever I don't even care I don't care either and it doesn't even matter but milk goes first and I'll kill anyone that says anything otherwise alright I think this is why we've been cereal yeah anyway I think I have a solution that we could both live with a solution to our cereal stalemate yes but it has to be done this way otherwise one of us will commit a murder okay well tell me the solution okay instead of milk first or cereal first yes what if we do them both at the same time No yes Lachlan this will break the milk cereal continuum we are scientific pioneers we'll all be madness right so you can just yep both at the same time yeah and that's not illegal oh there's nothing in the terms and conditions on the box does it work with works with anything you might have just changed the world I know I'm gonna paint it so people have to pay me when they want to do it you can't paint in pouring milk and cereal at the same time yes I can can you yeah no yeah of course I would it turns out a car Jackson you know this means what we can have cereal in the house now yes often I solved the cereal conundrum yes all right look I'm gonna make you a cereal oh no that's okay I don't really like cereal what I'm just not that into cereal so I'll pass on that one thanks bro all this arguing and you don't even have a horse in these rights yeah I've actually never made a cereal before you've never made I'm going back to milk first No [Music]
