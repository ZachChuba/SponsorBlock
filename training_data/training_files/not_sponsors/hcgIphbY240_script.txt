Hello~ Solarsido~ Solar here I prepared a special challenge today. I'll be attempting to find the best
convenience store food combination! So, not already known combinations but to try searching for new combinations I bought these myself from a convenience store. Let's look at the footage! (Enters the convenience store) (Ring) I'm going to go where the food is. I like tteokbokki.. Okay, jjolbokki
(jjolmyeon/chew noodles+tteokbokki) Cheese! Ah, should I eat this? There's a combination I thought of. Oh? Protein 18g? I need to eat this (Hahahahaha) I wanted to find my own great combination So I brought 3 combinations. [Plenty] I will really be honest.
If it's alright, I'll recommend it. If it's not, then I will boldly pass. Now I will start with the first meal of the three. Let's get it, let's go! The first great combination. I like tteokbokki. [Tteokbokki is love] I chose tteokbokki as soon as I got there. Today, I got jjol.. Tteok.. Oh, I... What the, I got tteokbokki?
I thought I got jjolbokki 'Okay, jjolbokki' (Who are you...) How do you make this? (Carefully reading) (Got it) (Busy) (Stir) (Tired) The cooking took quite long. (Cheer) [So far normal] [Tteokbokki+cheese=cheating] [Bite] [Bite22] I'm trying it first to see if it tastes alright.
(Cowardly excuse) You pass. [Adding the sausage that passed] [Quail eggs roll in] [(Bibimbap) Triangular kimbap added] Tteokbokki that's like risotto Let me slightly show you the visual.
(Visual bombardment) It's just like an assortment. [If you plate it up] [It's not bad~] The first dish is complete. It just looks like an assortment, but I will try it. [Slurp] It's quite spicy. Almond Breeze. I will try a big bite. (Huge piece) Look at this. [Cheese roll roll] The cheese is quite long. [Trying it] [The type to savor it for a long time before judging] It's really good? It's so delicious . [Her style] [Tteokbokki+string cheese]
But, this combination is one that couldn't taste bad. [If you eat it]
It's honestly a surprising taste. Here, try it. [Share good things] [Full of anticipation]
Please give an honest judgement. [Anticipation to the max]
How many points out of 10? (Cold) 7.5? [Clenching her jaw] 7.5? Your words are quite harsh? I will name this. [Choice 1] "TteokCheSauQuaBap"
[Tteok(bokki) Che(ese) Sau(sage) Qua(il eggs) (Triangular kim)bap\ [One vote says she wouldn't
be able to say it again if asked to] How about a name like this? [Choice 2] No way, this...!
This isn't tteokbokki nor is it risotto, [Choice 2] what in the world is it? [You'd think it was a diary entryㅋ] Then one more. [Choice 3]
Since it's sweet and spicy, "This is Life". I will take votes from the staff here for now. One, two, three. (Immediately decided) This dish's name "This is Life", chosen! (One line self review)
It tasted really good. (One line self review)
I give it 9 points. I will move right on to the second dish. Clink. I really like eating things with milk. So I prepared that type of combo. [Somewhat of an experimental menu]
Yakult plus Jollypong! This is marshmallow Jollypong. It's been upgraded. (Zoom in) I'm going to attempt it. [Hehe...] (Suddenly delighted?) Who wants to try it? (Sample delivery) [High expectations] [Happy] [Shaking angle from dizziness] That sourness from the yakult, Jollypong's sweetness. [Matter of fact]
You can just assume it's that mixture. It's not that good. (Grabbing her forehead) It's good separately! (Slurp) I'll try it again. [One more time] Don't ever eat this. Great convenience store combination, No. 3 The second one earlier... There was a situation. So I couldn't even name it, and I passed by it. The third one is with this square cracker. And 'good job' (Excellent) ice cream. What am I going to do? I'm going to stack it. Whenever you unwrap this, it always felt like I was receiving a
gift, always. (~Reminiscing the past~) So I really liked this ice cream. Because it felt like I was receiving a gift. (Soft mood) [Ice cream placed] [Lid placed] [Size that fits like it was measured] [Brightest facial expression yet]
I will try it once. It's a very mini size~ It's cute. [Bite] [Oing] [Oing again] It's delicious! Taste? (Facial expression slowly becoming brighter keke) [Refreshed facial expression]
It's good, right? Finally, she's smiling, finally! She finally smiled brightly with the third dish. (Touched) She showed her healthy teeth and smiled. How many points out of 10? 9.5 9.5! (Satisfied) I'll take votes again (for the name) 1. Square burger 2. Miniature burger 3. 'Good job~' burger 4. 'Eat it up ♪'  burger 5. Toothache burger Choose when I count to 3. 1, 2, 3! Ah, the opinions again... They're the same. It is, Toothache burger. Everyone, please try the toothache burger. (One line self review)
I like that this cracker doesn't break. (One line self review)
The crumbs mix with the ice cream. (One line self review)
The crumbs do. So that tastes better. Ah... [Only bad thing] Ah, my teeth hurt.
[The menu lives up to its name] Looking for the best convenience store
combination challenge. I tried this challenge of finding Solar's
own great combination. I tried three types of food.
[This is life / (Ya+jo...) / Toothache burger] The best is? Toothache burger. I hope you all try looking for great
convenience store combinations. And I also recommend that you try the foods I had. Excluding number 2 [Number 2 beware] Thank you for watching today's challenge. I will return with a greater one next time. Bye~ It's like, a taste that you have to think about. That's right. You can't eat this for a long time though Can't eat a lot of it It's 7.5... Ah, no no.
