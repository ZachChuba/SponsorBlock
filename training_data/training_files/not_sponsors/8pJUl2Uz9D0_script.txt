hi my name is Sarah I'm a filmmaker and today I'm going to be reacting to chase me and goodnight by dreamcatcher so finally first of all I want to say if you subscribe to me because of my previous to dreamcatcher videos and you were eagerly waiting for this video I am very sorry it took me so long as you can see by the videos that I brought out in the meantime I had a lot of stuff to react to and I still have a lot of stuff my list is super long plus I was also trying to figure out how to do it the best way because it's I think eight videos that I need to watch you know seven I was trying to figure out what's the best way do i watch all of them at the snick all of them and want to go and then divide the videos up as they work anyways long story short it took me a while but now I'm here to finally react to dream capture again I also just want to put a disclaimer out there really quick if I don't get the story immediately or even after I think about it don't be offended I'm not the best at picking up stories going really deep into like meanings of stuff even in movies I'm not very good at that my special skill in filmmaking is looking at something and figuring out how they did it on a technical level which is what I do in most of my if not all of my videos anyways let's get into it chase me by dreamcatcher I'm gonna leave the subtitles on I don't know if I can read all of them while I'm watching the video but I will go through it again and watch them again before I get into this subscribe to my channel if you want to oh so what I know about dreamcatcher so far is they don't have a lot of budget for the music videos they have 7 members let me try really quick to say all the names Gio was a leader Yu Yan who I like a lot sua Xian Tommy kion and Han dong I think I think those are all the names I don't know what to expect at all the thumbnail scared me a little bit it looked like a cult oh okay this is their tube tibia where I think [Music] remember live in the bed of the comet Empire breathing the lyrics second time [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] this is really fast really fast this video oh my god both of the music is really loud so I'm not saying a lot because I'm scared I'm gonna scream [Music] [Music] I get the feeling they're ghosts [Music] holding once [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that looks like a lovely [Music] who is gonna say this has a lot of like [Applause] muscle forgive me with a shining influence [Music] this is creepy [Music] why is he smiling it's making me really uncomfortable oh my god Wow wolf maybe I should have done one video per video because oh my god there is so much going on Wow first of all I like the song it sounds like dreamcatcher to me if they're if they feel like they do have a sound I know that they do other genres as well especially in their b-side tracks but like this sounds like a dreamcatcher song to me Wow so there as I said I think there's a lot of The Shining stuff going on like the hallway with someone standing at the end and then the ax thing I think that's all it's just like small things that remind me of the shining wow that's like a whole movie I don't know if I should say this first or watch the second one first so I know that fly high comes corn and logically before this so I wonder if we see what happens to them in fly high but I feel like they're ghosts like they died or something we're just this is your debut song and you're already dead in the music video my god but then they also have this whole voodoo thing going on also I didn't read the lyrics so let me actually let me read the lyrics first I like that they give credit in the subtitles okay I read through the lyrics [Music] um-hmm damn this is a lot to unpack what the hell you didn't warn me about this I feel like I'm not I feel like I'm not smart enough to understand anything here okay so they did some kind of I saw now the second time that I watch it they did here they did like some kind of ceremony or something with someone lying in the middle this part right here they were doing like some kind of ceremony or like I don't know I feel like this is all a lot so I feel like they're dead because they keep disappearing and appearing and he can like see them only in his horn thing maybe they're not dead maybe they're like maybe they're just like witches of something they hexed him so that he can see them in his mind or something there's so many possibilities I'm gonna talk about this first just so I don't forget anything I wanted to say first of all you hear on hello I love those cuts in the choreography here they're super good the match cuts with the clothing it's really nice I wonder I want to know if this actor became big because I know in day six the one of the actor susan parasite was in the in their debut music video which is fun I don't really know what to say this is just again like a movie I don't know if this had a low budget because it doesn't look like it but story-wise see you think they're doing like a serenade but now they're dressed in black so are they all dead are they trying to resurrect her I don't know what's going on but I could this is kind of creepy okay I think I'm gonna watch the next one I can't really say too much technical here anyways because it's it's very fast like the editing in this chorus part with the match cuts with their clothes color correction is making it very uneasy unnatural looking because there's so much green and blue um it's like a horror movie I said that like feels like a horror movie movie movie this part then is super gentle and like these inserts and this scene is really gentle and like innocent in comparison to everything else I feel like this is them when they were still alive or happy or I'm not sure but I'm not sure what happened to them I'm very interested to see what happened this is low-key very scary oh my god this picture oh my god this is Han dong I only know her with I only know her from one picture with her banks so if that's her she looks really different here but I haven't really seen her a lot it's like dyin I'm not sure it's kind of hard to tell who is who this one except for you here and Tommy I can recognize something even though I don't know I think this is dummy no I'm not sure yeah I think I'm gonna watch the next one because I want to know story wise what's going on so I think good night comes chronologically after chase me so that's good okay so let's watch good night I hope I'm getting some clarification on what happened because I'm very interested now again same thing I'm gonna watch it not read the lyrics probably first time read them again second time and if I find more things to say about the first video then I will but let's watch you goodnight who the sound design the set dressing and all of these is crazy very different music [Music] while [Music] [Music] [Music] that her neck just snap [Music] Wow she's really creepy No [Music] [Music] I'm getting so many different ideas [Music] oh cool [Music] [Music] [Music] I feel like I said didn't say anything during during that so that's gonna come back well how I got something [Music] oh my god Wow Wow oh my god Wow I am highly overwhelmed okay so first thing I have to say again I'm gonna read the lurks soon this is gonna come back this book either someone's gonna find it and they're gonna get in trouble like someone's gonna use it against them or it's just an issue that it's missing this is gonna come back in the story that's all I know I'm very confident on that but that's all I know I'm gonna read the lyrics I like this part of the song a lot the rapping okay okay so as I said I got a lot of different until the very until the part where until the part where she reaches through the mirror to grab the book I thought lives sorry could be two things one so I'm still on the murder thing I feel I still like I was still thinking they are dead so I thought one he murdered them or two he is investigating what happened to them so he's just a stranger and he does or he maybe he knows one of them or something but he's just like like an innocent person who's just investigating what happened to them but then she did this so I'm like okay parallel-world something like the upside down kind of like seen stranger things or something oh my god just too much for me I'm not smart enough for this you guys I'm sorry I'm just here to tell you oh my god look at this shot it's gorgeous which I will do right now because it is gorgeous in this one so my favorite shot in the whole video it's so pretty even though it goes out of focus let me slow it down actually oh look at those cuts oh my god this which the person not just the outfit those cuts are great they did that end of chase me video too unlike those cuts a lot those ones but this is my favorite shot oh it's so haunting pretty she's so close and she's so gorgeous and then it goes out of focus but it doesn't matter but this is what I'm here for I'm here to tell you wow look at the editing Wow look at the shot not oh my god trying to figure out what Soria oh my god I can try but don't come for me in the comments if I don't understand it please please please I'm trying my best okay so something about this book I feel like maybe they are witches because I feel like their day or their powers or something is trapped in this book and now he's opening it and it's like did we see anyone before in the mirror let me watch this again oh my god I mean first of all technical stuff the set dressing is Wow crazy so many details well so many different shots in this music video oh my god so many shots that is crazy so he grabs the book why would you even open that look just look at it he opens a book and then we see her standing in the mirror there so I feel like something was trapped in the book and he opened it and then got released and then he sees these images and that's what happens to them so I don't know if that's like a I don't know if that's the story that already happened how they ended up where they are now or if that is currently happening as he's watching those images that's what happens I think this is a book that tells their story like if they are witches then this book is telling the story of how they were banned from the from this world I got there are so many things that this could be like they could be ghosts they could be witches they could be just like spirits it could be like something to do with voodoo or something I don't know oh my god there's so much it's like her being multiples and then we see her here but there are no multiples it's just her alone then we see this she fought or maybe it's the same girl in the story and they're all went through the same thing I don't know is this Alice in Wonderland I don't know oh my god oh my god so she Falls with books and then she falls with books also it kind of looks like she breaks her neck I'm like did she die then is she a ghost I don't know like that oh my god also yeah I didn't read the lyrics but I feel like both of them the lyrics they're putting the trying to be as literal as they can with the lyrics I feel like and then someone's chasing them chase me is that the guy who's chasing them I don't know but it says before they went to the other realm I don't know I don't know the timelines here this video reminds me a little bit of PT which also is in the same storyline so that's cool really interested to know how the spider in you and I comes into this oh my god I feel like the story's way really complicated and you guys just like said oh just just watch it I'm trying don't smile at me like that new yawn please then it's that there are like some kind of symbols this is creepy as yeah so I don't know how these flashbacks and that's what happened to them already it's a story of how they died or is not just unfortunate that they went through or is that as he watches the page it happens in real time I mean I would say it's passed like this hour these are flashbacks because then she's also in the room I mean could she have died this way I don't know that's just creepy I don't like this this is way too high up this hand just move you and I by the way has the same colors of the house so that's cool like blue is a good strong color in this storyline so far and then we have this again they're like again like a rat like this kind of ceremony thing there's a skull on fire that's cool then this more I don't know what that means so this kind of guesses is like oh we're watching you from the other side he realizes so he drops the book and he's like oh crap I it up and you Yanis like yeah you're a idiot you shouldn't have opened the book with a skull lock like are you stupid the editing as well that's what that was a sentence the editing as well no the editing is very it's amazing in this video because there's so many shots like oh I don't want to see the timeline of this video oh my god there are so many cuts and so many shots oh so here they switch places now I guess so they're in the real world now so they're now in the real world on earth and he's in that weird goes realm and then I forgot about all about this the whole cult aspect of it I don't know my god there's a doll they were like okay what are all the creepy things let put them in their skulls dolls later spiders called witchcraft the fires going backwards they were reversing time I forgot about this part this comes here now so we didn't they didn't switch places yet I guess we were just seeing it from their side they switched places later or they figure out that they can reach into the other dimension and then she grabs the book and though they have power over them themselves power over their powers and then they start a burning something I'm assuming these are the pages of the book and I'm guessing this is the page where I think it's going on was being yeah she was hoping hope held English by these weird thingies so now they're burning in are they reversing time by burning the book I'm guessing because the fire was backwards before is that guy on is that sulla oh my god so many questions another doing something in this world they're like all up like they're just trashing the place and it transfers into the real world this is really cool effect by the way so now he goes again to the mirror like an idiot what's that oh that's the thing said like it was that like his protection but now it's off the wall so it doesn't work anymore or something I'm really trying hard to pick to put together this story so now they switch places and then we have this whole scene with this cult going on and she drops the book well I now that we know there's like a parallel universe going on or something what's this about then because she's standing there I always see she's not because when he looks she's not there but how does this work is the book in this one cuz see this is why I thought he was investigating the case of them because he has like a camera with him and stuff and he has like all these papers and I don't know what he's doing here he's been that but this time travel I don't but then he has like bad dreams about them or something or they can maybe they're doing that through his dreams I don't I mean they're called dream catcher right so I mean it makes sense maybe or maybe she like parrot like this is was it that was the part and she like hypnotized him and now he's think the rest of the story is in his imagination but then what was this whole  like why was he smiling that way he was so creepy look at him he's so creepy oh okay I think I'm gonna leave this one here because I I am just chasing after theories that I have in my head but I have no idea what is actually going on I don't know how long this video was at all I have no idea because I was just speculating the whole time this is difficult because I'm just talking crap I don't know what's going on I'm just so I'm having like an existential crisis right now because of these videos I mean I could read the lyric or the lyrics the comments but I want to try and see if I can figure it out myself here's my final guest for what's this storyline is about so far with the information that I have they are trapped in the spirit world or they were and then this video goodnight they escaped the spirit world let me know if I'm on the right path if I'm not maybe give me a hint but just a hint I don't want anyone spelling out exactly what's going on I'm gonna try to figure it out myself okay let's do that thank you so much for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it I hope you learned something or maybe you saw something that you did before I highly doubt it I was just confused the whole time and I didn't say anything technical cuz that's my problem like I can do either one or the other because I talk so much and I kinda tried to be really detailed with my explanations or my thought process and stuff like that that if I talk about the story aspect of a video I don't really have time or the brain to go into the technical aspect of it so I hope this was interesting me trying to figure out the story of a video opposed to the technical aspects of the video but yeah I hope it was I hope it was an OK video thank you for watching bye [Music]
