Hey so the other day I was at work and I walloped my elbow against the corner something hard and it didn't really hurt the way that body parts normally hurt when you hurl them against hard objects it was a shootie feeling up pins and needles he feeling it didn't hurt so much as it just felt weird tingly percolate all kind of pain and as you may have guessed by now I had hit my funny bone but what is your funny bone and why does it feel so gosh darn funny well the thing is is that your funny bone isn't actually a bone at all I mean obviously you have bones in your arm most notably and mainly your humerus which is the only bone of the upper arm and the ulna and radius of the lower arm but running down your arm near the on the bone is a nerve called ulnar nerve also the owner nerve is also known as a munitions nerve as it controls the fine movements of the fingers so the nerve starts at the spine or in the spine and spreads out through the shoulder and down your arm and ends in your little finger and the finger between your middle finger and the little finger so the fourth and fifth fingers if we're counting your thumbs anyways as the bundle of neuron axons travels down your arm you have layers of bone and muscle to protect the nerve but the problem is that as the older nerve goes down past the elbow it goes behind the sticky-outy bit of the humerus and then through a tunnel of sorts called a cubital tunnel and in that exact spot the nerve is sandwiched between just the bone and the skin without much in the way of padding or protection so when you hit your arm at just the right angle what you're doing is squashing the nerve and when that happens you get that feeling that weird mix of numbness dull pain and tingling and because it's the only nerve causing the pain not the bone itself that feeling shoots down the rest of your arm where the nerve travels and the feeling can spread to your fourth and fifth finger so the feeling you feel is basically your nerve being pinched and now imagine that all day you kept hitting your funny bone over and over again and that is what it feels like to have cubital tunnel syndrome this syndrome is the second most common affliction of its type after the more famous carpal tunnel syndrome the syndrome can develop in certain situations like if the nerve snaps back and forth as your elbow is burned and straightened and ran over and over and over again because sometimes too nerve does not stay in his place and it snaps back and forth over the bony bump in your elbow as its move repeated snapping can irritate the nerve or it can happen if you hold your elbow in a bettin position for too long because keeping the elbow bent for a long time can stretch the nerve behind the elbow and this could easily happen during sleep and pressure being applied to the nerve can cause issues too as I said before the nerve has little padding over it so direct pressure like leaving the arm in ROM rest can press the nerve causing the arm on the hand especially the forth of the fingers to fall asleep a lot of the time people with this condition will be told to just try and not put too much pressure on that nerve for example wearing a splint at night to keep the elbow from bending or simply not leaning on their elbow but in more severe cases surgery may be suggested in order to relieve the pressure on the nerve this can involve releasing the nerve moving the nerve to the front of the elbow and or removing a part of the bill from the handful of times I've hit my funny bone I'm super glad that I'm lucky enough to not have to put up with that feeling all the time it wouldn't be very humorous and not only are the majority of us very lucky to not have to deal with that on a daily basis because that will be hella challenging but we subscription so go check it out and if you like this video give it a thumbs up if you'd like to see more hit subscribe a big thank you to my patrons on patreon and thanks for watching by
