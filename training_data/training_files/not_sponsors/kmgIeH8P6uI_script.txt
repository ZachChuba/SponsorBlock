February 29th 2016 a day that would go down in history as the release date for Minecrafts most controversial update ever I guess it's fitting that on 2016 s leap day we would leap so far away from the combat system that we had known to grow and love in the past and you know what I initially praised the update I'm not afraid to admit it I mean by the time this update whirled around I was playing minigames and custom maps on this YouTube channel and I wasn't doing all that much PvP at all I had no idea how much this update was going to alter minecraft forever my initial assessment of this update was wrong but as the years have gone on I've grown to understand exactly why minecraft 1.9 s combat update was so detrimental to the game and if you've been subscribed to this channel for long enough now you would know just how often I vent my frustrations on the matter at the minecraft creator summit in 2018 I confronted Jeb directly to see if the unintuitive nature of Minecraft Java editions combat mechanics were ever going to be addressed and to my surprise he told me that they were going to be looking into it and today is the beginning of the manifestation of that dream today we'll be looking at the experimental new new combat mechanics snapshot covering the changelog itself and then going over how the update works in practice so without any further ado let's get right into it [Music] so first off let's roll through the changelog as it was written by Jeb on the Minecraft subreddit and after I go through it in its entirety I'll share my opinions on each and every item so Jeb opens up the reddit post by stating the combat mechanics in Java edition have been a controversial topic ever since the 1.9 update we want the mechanics to be the same across all editions but simply porting Java to bedrock or vice versa is not taking us forward we want to find a system that is flexible and works well across all input devices he then follows us up by describing the issues with both Java Edition and bedrock editions combat system first up the Java edition notes reads as following too slow for PvP not exciting enough damage per second is too low to be true generation items and it's too hard to understand for new players and then bedrock edition tedious on controller to which he notes legacy editions of minecraft actually fixed this issue weapons are very similar and armour is not balanced now without getting into too much detail which I will be later in the video I pretty much agree with everything that he said here so now let's look over the changes the changes that Jeb lists are as follows overall much faster attacks attacks only happen when fully charged even if you spam click you can hold it to attack weapons have different reach or attack range when you stop attacking the attack timer will continue charging up to 200% at 200% you can perform special attacks such as crits sweeping knock-back and also these attacks have longer reach sweeping only occurs on swords with the sweeping enchantment critical attacks aka jump attacks bypass shields entirely shields have no warm-up delay like they used to shields now activate when crouching and sneaking and finally if you hit something the targets invulnerability timer will be shorter if you have a quick weapon so yeah from that list alone there is a lot to cover so now I'll break down my opinion on each and every item listed so first I'll start with my opinion on what Jeb defines as issues and then get into the update itself and what I really feel needs more work because this snapshot certainly isn't perfect like I mentioned before I pretty much agree with everything that was said with the listed issues especially the noted flaw with Java Edition wherein the mechanics are too hard for new players to understand you are not visually punished for spam clicking your weapon but spam clicking your weapon incurs a heavy damage penalty that actually makes the game way harder for new players I mean let's look at PewDiePie's first minecraft videos that he's been posting recently he was clearly unfamiliar with minecraft combat changes and he was just spam clicking his weapon and taking forever to kill the most basic mobs that's not how this game should work and I'm really happy to see Mojang finally addressing this but let's see what exactly they're addressing and how that's gonna impact gameplay going into the future so now my opinions on the changes first up much faster attacks yeah sure I'm good with that change next attacks only happen when fully charged even if you spam click to be honest guys I feel completely vindicated reading this specific change this is the exact change I proposed in a video that I released in April of 2018 disallowing attacks during the attack cooldown would fundamentally prevent players from playing incorrectly and now Mojang has done it excellent next you can hold to attack yeah you read this one correctly you are now able to hold your mouse button down or keep your finger held on the screen to attack non-stop no longer do you even have to spam click yeah what you guys see on screen is not me spam clicking the mouse I'm just holding the mouse button down now I gotta be honest with you I'm actually completely split on this one this one's gonna take me a lot of time to determine my opinion on on the one hand some could argue that removing spam clicking takes a lot of the fun away from combat on the other hand removing spam clicking might force us to get used to some other items on this list and might actually serve to make combat more interesting while still allowing combat to be intuitive yeah I can't give my concrete opinion on this one yet I'm gonna need a lot more time months or potentially even years to get used to I'm extremely skeptical but I'm also hopeful only time will tell so next weapons have different reach aka attack range this one might be good and we can already see weapons like the sword hoe and Trident have they're listed attack range on the hover text itself the number that shown appears to be the maximum blocks away that you can be before the weapon will register a hit on whatever you're attacking my only concern however is shorter range weapons will no longer be useful because people who use long range attack weapons will always hit you first if you are using a shorter range attack weapon maybe it'll be an issue maybe it won't be but next up is interesting do you remember the little meter in the center of your screen that used to be for your combat cooldown well now that's for a sort of new feature called a special attack when this meter fills up you can perform attacks such as critical hits sweeping hits which now only occur when using a sword with the sweeping enchantment and reportedly additionally knock-back effects though I'm not really too sure what it means by this this part of the update is why I think holding your mouse button down to attack might wind up being okay in the long Mojang's intention is not to restore Minecraft 1.8 style of combat but it's to make combat intuitive and fun again having a legitimate reason to hold off attacking or having a good reason to really nail that first hit sounds kind of interesting and I'll have more to say about this at the very end of the video because I don't think they actually nailed it with this snapshot so next up is another big one critical hits the ones that you can now only do as a special attack completely bypass the shield like 100% if your target is using their shield and you don't do a critical strike a hundred percent of the damage is absorbed but if you do a critical strike one hundred percent of the damage is dealt now I may have been skeptical about the mouse button changes but this change is flat-out bad and it's bad because while you're crouching which now activates your shield automatically you're actually able to still attack with full power and full speed which means if this is how things were intended to go then PvP was just going to devolve into a crouch jumping at aking spamfest as you guys can see here however at the bottom of Jeb's reddit thread within a comment made after the threat was made he noted that being able to attack while crouching behind a shield is actually bugged right now your shield is supposed to be temporarily disabled while you're attacking with your shield up which presently isn't happening while hearing this is definitely a good thing I want to add a suggestion to the pile but before I do note that there are now two ways to raise your shield by holding your right-click mouse button like you've always been able to do and by crouching currently while holding right-click to raise your shield you actually can't attack at all my suggestion is to try applying this behavior to crouch shielding as well it would mean that there would be a very definite benefit to using your shield and that you could block attacks but there would also be a very definite and very intuitive drawback as well in you would not be able to attack the last three items that Jeb listed all seemed just fine for this update but my biggest gripes with the new new combat mechanics are as follows I think the non special attack weapon cooldown should roughly match how it worked in Minecraft 1.8 in Prior which means I think weapon swings should be a little slower than they currently are with the snapshot and I think the special attack cooldown should also be made about twice as slow as it currently is with the snapshot if motion works on those details and prevents combat from being a crouching jump attacking spam fast then I think these changes could mean a lot of good things for the game and I'm especially happy to see that the new system is at least mostly intuitive and very welcoming to new players but above all else be sure that if you have an opinion that you make your opinion known within the reddit thread that I'll have linked in the description of this video all in all I think this update has a lot of promise but it also has a long ways to go but before I go a quick word from Oh see you in the branch notes so yeah if you guys enjoyed this video please consider leaving a like on it because it would really help out myself the channel and the video quite a lot so I hope you all enjoyed my name is antvenom and I bid you all farewell thanks so much for watching [Music]
