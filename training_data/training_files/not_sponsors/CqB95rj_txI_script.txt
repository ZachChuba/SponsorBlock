[Music] when you misplace your phone you can call it or you can use the find my phone feature and then listen out for the sound that it makes but i've always found that process frustrating like often you can hear your phone but it's still hard to pinpoint its exact location like it's definitely somewhere in this part of the room and you're searching under pillows and under cushions and things like that and it takes ages to find it turns out there's a reason for this problem the ring tone on your phone or the find my phone tone is badly designed for that purpose but it's okay there is a scientific solution so in this video i'm going to show you how to make some changes to your phone so that you can find it instantly it's all to do with the way you detect direction with your ears and to show you how it works i've built this device i mean device is probably a strong word for what this is but anyway i'm going to make my wife wear it and do some experiments okay keep your eyes nice and tightly closed all right hey [Music] [Laughter] so look here's what's going on sound that enters this hole on your left travels through this tube and comes out into the ear on the right and sound that goes into this hole on the right travels through this tube and comes out into the ear on the left so this device swaps your ears around and that's why leanne was pointing to things on the right when they were really on the left and vice versa so our ability to hear where sounds are coming from must be to do with the fact that we've got two ears and it absolutely is in fact there's a few different ways that we can calculate the direction of a sound in our brains but one of the most important ways is with something called interaural time difference so for example if a sound is coming from directly in front of me it will reach both ears at the same time and my brain will receive that same signal from both my ears at the same time alternatively if the sound is coming from off to my left it will reach my left ear a little bit before it reaches my right ear and so my brain will receive a signal from my left ear a little bit before it receives a signal from my right ear and your brain essentially tries to line up the two signals so look the left signal seems to be slightly ahead of the right signal which corresponds to about 0.3 milliseconds and your brain can actually test this hypothesis by shifting the signals around until all the lumps and bumps line up with each other and your brain interprets this 0.3 millisecond difference in timing to mean the sound is coming from say 45 degrees away from dead center the exact angle would depend on the size of your head but here's the thing this interaural time difference technique is flawed like if you present your ears with a sound wave that has a regular repeating pattern like this pure sine wave the whole system breaks down imagine this pure sine wave is coming directly from your left that's a time difference of about half a millisecond this is what that would look like coming into your brain but look when your brain tries to line up the sound waves it appears as though the right hand signal is slightly ahead of the left hand signal by about 0.1 milliseconds which corresponds to a sound that's coming from just slightly to the right of dead center instead of where it's really coming from which is over there on the left and your brain can actually interpret these signals in a few different ways like maybe the left hand signal is slightly ahead of the right hand signal but by 0.2 milliseconds instead of the full 0.5 milliseconds i really want you to experience this effect for yourself so i'm going to play a pure sine wave and it needs to be high pitched because if you think about it if the wavelength of the wave is larger than the width of your head then there would only ever be one way to line up the waves in your head anyway so this effect only works for high pitched sounds and so they go fair warning if you're wearing headphones take them out because maybe this will be unpleasant and as i play this sound just kind of move your head slowly around and as you do that the sound should appear to come from different places around you even though you know where the sound is coming from here we go so regularly repeating high-pitched sounds are difficult to locate on the other end of the spectrum is white noise or essentially random noise that your brain can easily line up and compare because it doesn't have this regular repeating pattern like if i play white noise to you now you'll very easily be able to locate the speaker that's making the sound it turns out that the default ringtone on most mobile phones and the find my phone tone tends to be towards the hard to locate end of the spectrum because they're made up of just a few high-pitched pure tones so if you want to make your phone easier to find just change the ringtone and define my phone tone to white noise i've done that on my phone and the file that i use is linked in the description if you change the default ringtone on an android phone it also changes the find my phone tone so you need to do it once on iphone the two things are separate so to change your ringtone for when you want to call your phone to find it you can set a custom ringtone through itunes and if you want to set your find my phone tone to a custom tone that that's a bit different let me just um no you can't do it on my phone i'm not going to make this video any longer by adding tutorials on how to set custom ringtones on android and iphone but i will leave some links in the description that'll tell you how to do it i found out so many interesting things when i was researching this video like you probably know birdsong means different things like some birds song is territorial so the bird is basically saying you know keep off my land um and that bird song is easy to locate the the structure of the sound is closer to white noise but birds also make alarm calls so if they see a predator they make this sound to warn other birds around them there's a predator nearby and while you want the birds around you to hear this alarm call you don't want it to give away your location to the predator so these alarm calls tend to be high-pitched pure tones so they're hard to find and also they ramp up slowly and fade away slowly so there's no hard edge to them that could be used by the predator's brain to line up the sounds this is a great tit for example and its warning call sounds like this ironically emergency vehicle sirens tend to be made of slowly changing pure tones as well which is annoying if you're a driver you'll know this you hear a siren from an emergency vehicle and you know you have to get out of the way to let them pass but you can't hear where they're coming from so in the 90s in the uk some experiments were done with sirens ambulance sirens that have some white noise in them you can also watch a tom scott video about how the truck reversing beep is slowly changing into a truck reversing hiss i've also got to just tell you about the cone of confusion so suppose there is a 0.3 millisecond delay and that can be interpreted as 45 degrees away from dead center but actually the sand could also be coming from 45 degrees behind you because that would lead to the same time delay in fact there's a whole cone of possible places the sand could be coming from that would lead to the same time difference in your brain and to narrow down the possible locations the sound could be coming from your brain uses other contextual clues like certain sounds you only expect to come from within your kind of horizontal plane like other people's voices for example and sounds coming from behind you sound different because they have to travel through this fleshy bit of your ear things like that but if those other contextual clues aren't doing it then the other thing we do is tilt our heads we kind of do this a little bit so we're changing the location of our ears and we're narrowing down the possible locations that the sound could be coming from from within that cone of confusion you don't tend to notice when humans are doing it but you definitely notice when dogs do it because it's so flipping cute this is my dog django and i can get him to tilt his head by making this noise because it's a strange noise that django isn't used to me making he can't just assume that it's coming from me so he tilts his head to try and narrow down the possible locations of the sound i don't know if you can tell from the video but django is actually a good boy yoshi huge usual membership i hope you enjoyed this video if you did don't forget to hit subscribe and i'll see you next time
