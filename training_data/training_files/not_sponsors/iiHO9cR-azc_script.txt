hello and welcome to another honest cooking lesson by the honest guide and yes we're making fidelity again reason the previous one we made was just so we decided to upgrade it take it next step and because it's christmas it's the only time you can make the special traditional christmas treveling with the recipe from our grandmothers obviously we're going to start with the dough if you don't know how to make it you can watch the previous video or we're going to leave the recipe but since the final touches here are the important we're going to make this quick half a kilo of flour 80 grams of butter melt it [Music] two eggs two tablespoons of icing sugar 250 milliliters of milk heat it [Music] add one teaspoon of sugar and finally add yeast thanks to the comments on our previous video i now know that you shouldn't just toss it in but you should crumble it [Music] yeah what's the next step i gotta go to youtube i'm actually watching our own video of how to make the dung because i sort of forgot it's like inception man and finally as i just found out from some random guy on youtube thing number two mixes with thing number one it smells good and now you mix it dude by the episode 3 we'll be like we'll have our own stand on the charles bridge i can guarantee that and now you let the dough rest for 20 minutes in some warm place [Music] this is my bedroom the warmest place in my house unfortunately you're not allowed in with the camera because it's only for the building to rest here which we're very thankful for so the dough should be ready i am ready in my christmas outfit let's slide the candles and let's roll the dough [Music] here it goes nice looking much better than the previous time we were doing this you can see that we're totally skilled oh i forgot the flower on the board [Music] and of course i can sing you some czech christmas carols if you'd like if you're just tuning in to this video and you have no idea what's going on we'll go back to the start to figure out we're going to take the roller and roll the dough roll the dough i must say that when we were making the previous video i thought that nobody would ever make the link at home that it's so silly but then you guys started sending your pictures in and you have made a global sensation so i hope uh this christmas special trending will get you to your kitchens to your rollers and you will show off once again with your awesome pictures now you're going to use the roller oh we should have preheated the oven now you're going to use the roller and put uh aluminium foil around it [Music] it's like reliving your worst dream once again and the rest of the dough we're going to put on the beer can so we got the xx alternique on the beer can and we got the one on the roller but now we got to add flavoring to it which we'll do by adding cinnamon sugar and vanilla sugar before you roll it in the flavored sugar make sure you put oil on the third eliminate so it will attach to it nicely this time we used much more cinnamon sugar and it already looks much better well it's the christmas tomatoes we told you this will be awesome [Music] wow it's hot man we didn't really do a good job with the can because the dough is sliding down and it's falling apart so let's hope for a christmas miracle so a christmas miracle didn't happen and guess what boys and girls we failed with the other one as well and we failed massively dude this is just horrible it's just so sad [Music] and that's how you make the christmas special traditional third link thank you for joining in subscribe and we'll see you next well we had some dough left so here's attempt number two do you want to say that they're done prayer with me in charles bridge in old town square you are being sold please survive my oven [Music] 25 minutes later let's take the first one out [Music] looking mighty good i was very very very sad when the first one didn't work out but this looks better it looks like a chimney and it's also smoking look at that that's so cute you little pieces [Music] so happy we never have to do this again and believe it or not this was just step one even though it looks epic it looks amazing which you would expect from a third link but we want to make it look special christmasy special and traditional special that's why you may have noticed we have nutella here we have whipped cream and we have some flavorings and some beautiful stuff to put on to make it look colorful so it looks perfect on your christmas instagram photo with your christmas tree so with the big boy we're gonna fill
