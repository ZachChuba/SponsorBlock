hi guys and girls i mapy city event and welcome to 3306 this is what take a look at the news and happenings in and around elite dangerous this week freak area bank jobs are still broke our tenuous atmospheres going to be enough and a new a lead community manager is going to join it this week's frontier livestream the release of the latest fix for the fleet carrier update brought with it an issue that has affected all a number of things but specifically fleet carriers themselves now this is a relatively straightforward problem to replicate and whilst it isn't game break in it won't nonetheless significantly affect any carrier Cosmetics that you have purchased when a player applies a paint job to their carrier the paint job will be instantly removed every time they ve entered the carrier's instance most a paint job can be reapplied it will still continue to be removed from tier have acknowledged and they are aware of this issue but now yet haven't said when he will be fixed from tears charity event with game blasts happened all the way back in February however the effects of the event are still being felt and it dangerous community the M comedian famed for a number of things including some rather stunning embroidered patches donated coffers from these great patches to the event in return they gained the ability to name a few planets in a station within the elite dangerous galaxy the renaming took place up with the arrival of fleet carriers and you can see the name changes made on the screen of right now if you're ever in that regions the galaxy it might will be worth stopping by to say hello to members of the alchemy den now the next subject is something that I wanted to talk about last week but didn't actually get the chance to do it on the PC gamers show a frontier had a small segment to introduce Odyssey the large update that is arriving in 2021 now the trailer for Odyssey instantly immediately in that space legs is going to be a thing but two questions two other questions immediately became apparent the first is it possible to walk around inside ships and space stations for now if that remains unanswered the second question that was aimed at the blue skies in the trailer which seemed to indicate Atmos Raik plenteous well in a very brief interview frontiers game director for any dangerous every briefly touched on that subject confirming net tenuous atmospheres will be a part of the odyssey update so whilst that confirms that atmosphere of some type will definitely be an odyssey it doesn't really tell us what type of atmospheres to expect the word tenuous doesn't have a precise scientific definition when it comes to planetary atmospheres but we could consider this then instead on a spectrum on the bottom end of the spectrum we could place the moon as well as Callisto and mercury now they don't have extremely tenuous atmospheres in real life however they are so thin as to be inconsequential for the purposes that maybe we might want from them when it comes to the game Mars on the other hand that could be on the higher end of the spectrum of worlds with a tenuous atmosphere here the atmospheres are still very thin however things become far more interesting as the atmosphere is at least thick enough to create weather patterns which in turn to create dust storms as well as clouds but even so the clouds here are far thinner than those found on earth so what exactly does a tenuous atmosphere mean for odyssey that question unfortunately remains entirely unknown it's clear that it's going to be enough to create coloured skies hopefully a very time depended on the chemical composition of those particular planets however thick enough clouds of rains and anything of that order seems at the moment at least to be very unlikely what type of atmosphere would you like to see what would be a minimum for you to let me know in the comment section below in many ways if fleet carriers have opened up elite dangerous to different possibilities for me I feel they have introduced some interest in and very useful functions into the game and why stuff spoke in the past about these type of additions I would like to see fleet carriers offer them actually aren't in the game I've also spoken about one thing in particular one of the biggest visual issues with fleet carriers and that is the lack of a hyperspace jump visuals when you're on board your carrier instead you're locked in a small hangar with nothing to see now ready to use a little dazzle little diesel rather is one of the few people who've come out and made some fantastic clips of the arrival of three carriers this one is viewed from the cockpit of their ship which gives a very interesting perspective indeed as I told you can see a short snippet of that for the full clip to head on over to the reddit thread linked in the video description those of you who are new to elite and perhaps some veterans to the collection of various types of materials can be a real nuisance musses plenty of guides and other resources available for this commander Federation hammock or has created a very useful spreadsheet both the spreadsheet itself as well as a related reddit thread are linked below if then you require any additional information on how to locate the various types of materials then this might be a good place to start this week on Thursday at 1800 BST Elise a weekly live stream will be joined with frontiers of new elite community manager Arthur told me who's stepped into the shoes of will Flanagan after will moved on to a new position of product manager now at his recent introduction on the frontier forums Arthur spoke of a number of topics including his enjoyment of elite which he has been playing since 2015 if you want to watch the latest livestream it will be available on Twitch and you can find the link in the video description that then brings us to an end of this episode of 3306 as a waser thanks for watching and I get you
