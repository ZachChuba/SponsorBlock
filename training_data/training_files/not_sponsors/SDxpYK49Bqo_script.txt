it's truly amazing to me how unnecessary your standard phone review has become these days here's a post from user VAR core over on XDA developers from two weeks before Samsung unveiled their latest and greatest s series smartphones the Galaxy S ten es10 and S 10 plus the pros over the s9 are much faster processing speeds bigger battery and display in display fingerprint reader 5g in the second release a bevy of specialized cameras larger internal and external storage and on the high-end model twelve gigabytes of RAM it would seem to have no real competition but there are two glaring cons as well the camera cutouts marring the display and its price yeah okay sounds about right so I should probably just hire that guy or gal and save myself some time but I didn't instead I spent the last few weeks trying really hard to love the s10 plus and its little brother over here so here are my thoughts brought to you by a the link below [Music] it is no big secret that I am NOT a fan of odd shaped displays I mean ignoring the admittedly quite hilarious purpose made wallpapers there is quite literally zero content that is designed to have a bite taken out of it why well I'll tell you why because it's a silly backward step in our otherwise fairly consistent journey towards displays that occupy our field of vision as naturally and fully as possible and it's obviously one that isn't going to last so why be like the TV shows that failed to embrace widescreen and have all your content look stupid in a year or two or like today for that matter and yeah I think that's actually the worst part of all of this Samsung stayed away for this long only to finally belly flop face-first into this unfortunate industry trend right when their Chinese competitors like Oppo vivo and Nubia have already declared it dead all three of those have already shipping phones with no knotch and nearly full coverage displays thanks to innovations like motorized and sliding selfie cams or in what is IMO the most futuristic and cool move the elimination of the selfie cam altogether in favor of using the rear camera for everything something that probably would have been a good move for Samsung this time around I was pretty pleased overall with the rear camera the app needs to go back to allowing both still and video capture from the same screen but for video the only glaring issue that needs to be resolved is the frame skipping when you capture a still during video recording and as for stills regardless of DXL mark scores and what-have-you I would still take an iPhone 10s or a pixel three over the galaxy s 10 but it is a clear step up from my note 9 when it comes to delivering sharp photos of my wonderful but always moving children and managed adequate low-light performance for my purposes no the issue with the camera is the front-facing camera or cameras are you seriously telling me that this was the best you could do both the wide-angle and regular lens deliver at best no improvement over the note nine and at worst some of the most inexplicably poor results that I've seen in a few generations what the heck is this there's just no excuse now honors latest phone that has a pinhole display this on the s10 plus this is an exit wound and you went and put that in my screen for these results these photos you're looking at here were taken under identical conditions on full auto okay so I got that out of my system in all seriousness though I did mostly stop noticing the pinhole after a while so how about we talk about day to day use because there's actually a lot to love here starting with battery life a seven nanometer processor with 4100 milliamp hours in this form factor yes please wicked fast wireless and wired charging yeah I'll take some of that too now some Exynos users have been complaining of higher than normal idle battery drain but it's yet to be determined if that's a widespread issue or just Samsung phones doing Samsung things and many other users particularly of the Snapdragon variety are reporting screen on time in the range of 6 to even 8 hours or more and that honestly is more in line with my experience this thing has been great so far on the subject of the screen we're ignoring the shrapnel wound it's actually been a while since I've been this wowed by a phone display I mean it's so vibrant and it manages to feel just like extra responsive in spite of the fact that it still runs at a mere 60 Hertz also Samsung has really managed to tone down the distortion and the dimness of the curved glass along the edges even compared to the note 9 from less than a year ago if only they had watched my review of that phone because they actually managed to undo some of the progress that they made last summer when they widened the side bezels so like the note 9 the S 10 plus is gigantic device that makes one-handed operation a little bit challenging and Samsung obviously knows this because they've made some helpful optimizations to their Android skin to minimize how often it is that you'll actually need to reach all the way up to the top this there's your brightness slider it's not bad right it's just that as cool as one handed mode is I don't buy a big phone to use it at 50% size and by slimming down the side bezels again they've dramatically increased the frequency with which I accidentally trigger apps or keyboard presses or the back button while I'm reaching across the display it's a non-issue in my opinion on the s10 but it bothered me on the plus and I hope they don't do the same thing on the note 10 another thing that I'm hoping surely in vain not to encounter on the note 10 is the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor now I got the software update that did improve the sub 20% success rate that I was having with this thing see I got it there but it's still not a hundred percent and this is especially true it seems when my hands are really dry making matters worse even when it's working properly it's just straight up not as fast as the optical sensor that's employed by one plus in the 60 like not even close now it's better than picking up my phone and touching the back of it but it does hurt the otherwise great overall responsiveness of this device like it really does feel great in the hand too I can't actually speak for the ceramic version both Samsung and D brand actually sent over the glass backed ones but it's thin and well balanced with pretty much all the things I've come to expect from a Samsung flagship device except better the speaker standout is achieving much better stereo separation on supported content like this is a really loud amplified earpiece speaker in spite of its diminutive size and on the bottom Oh a headphone jack that's a welcome sight oh so turns out you can get ip68 resistance with it it's just more work how about that the one step backward here is the ergonomics of the lock button again this isn't a big issue on the smaller s10 but on the plus seems like what they've done is moved it up uncomfortably far on the phone in order to fix a problem that doesn't exist anymore now that they're finally allowing users to remap the bixby button so you're not constantly mashing bixby when you try to lock your phone on that note I don't actually hate nixb I just don't want her showing up uninvited so I just changed it to a double-click that's also a nice new little option they've gotten there and I haven't had any frustrating issues since then so how did this take you numpties two years to fix when you had all the user feedback it's such an obvious solution yay on that subject here's a few more things for you to ignore for the next 24 months then spend an hour fixing when someone in senior management finally watches a review or to bring back the extra granularity and volume control with the slider please I listen to reruns or music while I sleep and I can't get it quiet enough anymore also what is this locate an app nonsense when I search in the app drawer just let me drag it to the home screen please and finally Samsung do away with this stupid carrier lock crap when you first install a sim if I bought an unlocked phone that's because that's what I wanted I know the carrier's want you to do this but grow a pair anyway I really don't want the thing Samsung has done wrong to distract from what they've done right here I still hate the island not ugly distracting and most importantly completely unnecessary but the bottom line is that the s10 and s10 plus are lightning fast with what is in my opinion the best Samsung software experience yet and a great feel in the hand they have problems but I do tend to find them easier to forgive when I can sit down and write this entire review while listening to music on my thigh OFA 7 is yeah they may have it key caveman wires attached to them but you know what they blow the doors off your air pods and you can have them from me when you pry them from my cold dead fingers speaking
