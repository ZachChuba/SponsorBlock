the game bought the game yeah I just bought the game first person I ran into gave me a quest the quest was there is a I had to head north there was a 2x2 in the woods and the snow there was a bear next to it I had to pet the bear get the key from the bear opened the two by to get a key from inside there then I had to what he called it well and into a compound which I didn't quite understand what he meant by that because I'm new to the game and then I got Aleut from the compound or something now compounds are big bases and you lied to me everything can you give me a real question in this game what what I need to level up that I can use better gear instead of just bows I want to get to what your level is so I can use a crossbow okay like I don't even think I can hold that crossbow until I get high enough level I can't hold that crossbow I can't hold that crossbow until I get to a certain level okay that's what I've been telling ya need to get you to boiling internet our man do you want me to climb into the tower what do I have to do in there you see this box up there I got him okay need to well it what does well went into it Jeremy what the [ __ ] is everyone talking about what they say well um on top of that it's a box go get the box and bring me the loot in that red and white lighthouse stay level up yes yes alright I'm [ __ ] doing it I need levels be right there

holy [ __ ] I can all across right now yeah Wow my god so slow I can't write am i dehydrated okay I'll take the goggles off then I'm still going slide my tank I'll shoot all the shoes wait wait wait wait wait wait wait okay thank you I think I swear I was doing the other quest up north I think I must have skipped over a quest over this quest and because I found the goggles of truth in a box which I think I was supposed to get from you so now I have the goggles of truth I think I can head back up north and maybe finish my other question now go okay wish me luck man also just saying this game is entirely dope I love interacting with actual quest givers it's like the most unique thing I've ever seen in any game yeah I'm getting paid well for that though yeah all right guys thank you so much for the level up and the quest good luck they probably think I'm the biggest [ __ ] [ __ ] going right now but check this out yeah bleah underwater bleep what I was like you know this game so cool now they all looked at each other and [ __ ] like quest givers like interacting with questions is really dope of this game and they all went silent and just started looking at each other I was like these guts just probably pieces themselves laughing right now so we don't need to wear the goggles yet and keep the tank on [ __ ] it we need to get back up north and I think probably more out yeah I think it was this way we wanted to head actually those are for us up there too I think hello amen hello I'm not gonna kill you you doing quests as well quests I'm on a quest right now trying to finish a quest I failed it before I just completed another quest levelled up yeah I got to go up north to the snow the forest in the snow I got a pedobear get a key and the bear and then I gotta go into a two-by-two get another cave then I got a wellin into a compound and then I have to go in there get the loot and that's the finish of the quest so you're not doing the same one as me my friend oh okay damn I must have missed that one all right that's a fine name you have by the way but it was nice meeting you Stalin and good luck on your question have a good day yeah find a friend quest what are
