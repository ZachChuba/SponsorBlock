at the link in the description Denzel curry is a hard worker even though he's only 24 he started releasing music in 2011 when he was 16 years old having grown up and started his career in Carroll City Florida Denzel was one of the core members of the South Florida rap scene that briefly took over hip hop across the world before meeting a violent end he's still young but he's been through more than enough hardship and tragedy pair that with his incredible work ethic and natural talent for songwriting and ultimately you'll get one of the strongest rappers in the game this is the story of Denzel Curie Denzel was born in a small city near Miami he was interested in poetry from a young age but his interest in poetry turned into a passion for rapping when he reached middle school denzel went to the miami design in architecture high school as well one of the best schools in the u.s. until he was expelled in the tenth grade after that he switched to his local school and decided to start making music denzel's first mixtape was released in 2011 it got reposted by Space Ghost purp an underground record producer who works with ASAP rocky among other artists following his meeting Space Ghost purp denzel joined Purps music collective raider clan denzel's next mixtape was released a year later this time he received praise from Earl Sweatshirt and other members of the odd future label he would make one more mixtape with red your clan before leaving the group and deciding to build his own solo career but denzel's early music honestly isn't very good the versions of it that have been uploaded to YouTube are very compressed and even when I try to listen through that the music that is there is still really unpolished but you can tell that Denzel was a promising rapper even as a high school student his rapping was strong and he was working hard to develop his own style but the fact that his early music is so raw is exactly what makes him such a good musician almost a decade later he didn't blow up and become a viral star after one mixtape he had to work and improve his craft over time [Music] [Applause] [Music] Denzel has released three studio albums to date his first album nostalgic 64 was released in September 2013 just a few months after he graduated high school n64 introduced Denzel to the hip-hop world as an underground rapper with hard-hitting beats and a lot to say it was similar to his early mixtapes but a lot more polished and well written tragedy struck between the release of n64 and denzel's next project our March 4th 2014 denzel's brother Trey on Johnson was killed by police after being tased in pepper-sprayed and an incident involving a dog denzel has said that his brother died of cardiac arrest after a freak reaction to the tasing Denzel later talked about how his first appearance at South by Southwest was overshadowed by the death of his brother who we had to go home and bury after the festival denzel's next release was an album but a double EP he divided the project into a double EP to represent two sides of his personality angry Denzel and psychedelic Denzel the project was received positively by critics even if most people had a few questions about denzel's maturity as an artist the most common observation about this project was that Denzel was an interesting and talented young artist who had yet to find his unique artistic voice the double EP is far more polished and mature than n64 it also featured the song ultimate which would go on to be denzel's breakout hit and amass over 100 million streams on Spotify denzel's next project Imperial was his second studio album it's a relatively short refined record with 10 tracks and a total running time of 40 minutes fans of Denzel loved the album but sadly it didn't really make waves outside of his already existing circle and because of that Denzel curry started growing a reputation as an underrated rapper who was actually around this time that Denzel met the younger rappers xxx in Tassie owned and ski-mask the slump got two musicians that would eventually eclipse his popularity with their chaotic distorted beats and emotional raps at the time X was working in a call center and trying to get his music career off the ground Denzel met axe at a house party he was hosting and they soon decided to move in together then Zell tried his best to keep acts out of trouble and for that he was instrumental in X's rise to fame denzel's next album wouldn't come for another two years after imperial and a long two years at that between the release of Imperial and taboo denzel's ex-roommate and good friend ex was killed he left Florida and moved to LA and he released an EP called 13 to build anticipation for the sound and themes he would explore on his third album the 13 IP is denzel's most visceral and SoundCloud inspired work yet it features vocals and production from Ronnie Jay on the track equalizer after beginning 2018 with a hugely successful round of singles to build height for taboo the album dropped at the end of July taboo was immediately recognized as one of the best albums of the year and it would become denzel's most commercially successful project yet peaking at number 28 on the Billboard 200 taboo was hugely successful with critics as well they marked the first time Denzel received mainstream attention for his efforts a pitchfork writer described the album like this but he sticks to the highly personal curries music is devoid of all cliche the power of his performance for a CD of his pen and the color of his wordplay make him an expert by forcing the tribulations of the doomed condition we call being young all of this makes him impossible to place in the broader soundcloud rap domain signs point to an artist who will outlast any single distribution platform or any of the genres named for them all of that is to say taboo is denzel's very first truly mature work of art it's taken him so long to fully realize himself because he's a meticulous artist who clearly sets high standards for himself and works towards them with intention in this way he's the kind of rapper that young musicians should look up to taboo is a lyrically dense and instrumentally diverse album the lyrics focus on themes like politics relationships and broadly the darker and lighter aspects of modern adolescence the title track discusses a relationship that Denzel had with a young woman who is the victim of abuse as a child something that Denzel has also experienced himself the song discusses the ways that people can heal together and the difficulties they might encounter in the process other highlights on the album include sirens a collaboration with ji D and Billy Eilish that discusses police brutality media and terrorism taboo is a concept album as well it's divided into three sections light grey and dark the different sections represent different aspects of denzel's mental state he wrote the light part when he was in a good place and the dark part when he was struggling with his happiness the light section is bright and energetic with funk inspired instrumentation soulful singing and a positive atmosphere the grey section is more inspired by a traditional hip-hop style and Denzel uses it to show off his rapping ability songs like Super Saiyan and switch it up feature some of denzel's best rapping yet the dark side of tableau provides a showcase of different musical styles while Denzel shifts into a moody angrier side of his personality to contrast the rest of the album on the surface taboo sounds a lot like its contemporaries denzel's vocals are aggressive a lot of his subject matter is inspired by childhood trauma the instrumentals are dark and chaotic but something pushes taboo beyond the Florida SoundCloud style and into a tier of quality totally devoid of cliche or stereotype there's a level of elegance clarity of thought and timeless musicality on taboo that just isn't found almost anywhere else right now Denzel has been busier than ever following the release of taboo he lives in LA now having left Florida a couple of years ago after he and ex parted ways later this year he'll be touring around the US with Billy Eilish a talented young singer with a lot of good ideas and the creativity to rival any experienced artist denzel's cover of a well known Rage Against the Machine song was popular among fans as well and further proved his diversity as a vocalist Denzel Curry's music hits the perfect sweet spot between personal and widely appealing he's insightful smart and an amazing songwriter and all of that is to say Denzel curry is evolving into an artist who's going to have a lasting impact on hip-hop that's what he's been doing from the very start of his career so many years ago in Carroll City carefully working on how to be the best version of himself in a genre so dominated by the contrast between old and young old heads in the new generation Denzel Curie exists between worlds he's right there in the trenches with everyone else his age but at the same time his wisdom far exceeds his years while we wait to hear what Denzel does will get two months of unlimited access for free you [Music]
