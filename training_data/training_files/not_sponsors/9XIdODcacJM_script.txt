why aren't we voting chris then oh i can kill her here already two people on it you know she's gonna be mad for wrong but if she if she's wrong no if she's wrong she vouched her base and he'd have to be hip so it's her fault either way she's so bad steve now people say never change please change that's so rude oh that's so rude oh off it went up who's my partner here oh yep then i go this way koji goes up poor hopper off who's dead on the balcony not only does she have to play mira she's dead early all the time ouch or double whammy policy are you not enjoying this anymore dk no i am i am i'm just kidding uh halfway's dead on the left door of about stephen is i'm sorry steve it's okay hey sleepy do you know how to read logs yeah that looked like five up shouldn't have been where he was do you uh i didn't look at that where do you think i am i think you've come from the top but i don't think i saw you go up on the logs i went up in the logs i went up i did my card swipe thing not card swipe i put in the thing i put in the shield thing did the navigation all right winter is everyone i'm clearing from this i was gonna say i think there's just no way scott's getting this kill he was so mean and weren't really careful coaching tim you know what i actually pulled on a hot moment i fixed the lights um no they were they've had this on balcony like the timing doesn't like i literally just watched them go back into deconstruct i had to like run down and jump in the vehicle all off them like just i don't think she did this yeah um steve's gone sleepy what were you doing in the beginning you're just standing in the hallway just seeing who passes uh yeah yeah i was just like seeing colors that go by so i know who's going where doing things you know so what kind of permission would you get out of that man absolutely nothing wait why are you laughing super defeated in literally one frame wait let me see the club i'll i'll show you the screenshots [Laughter] my log should be fine right there my log should be perfect there's nothing wrong with them so that's just another person miss reading logs which is kind of annoying i don't know if um actually this one okay um that's gonna get it that's just gonna get called oh [ __ ] hi hi scott is that an admin oh you hate this type of how are you an admin you were just yeah you were just indeed i went down because the lights i fixed the lights i go out and then i find scott's body okay well here's a here's a triple threat the lights weren't even fixed last round you pop up into deacon tam when only the only people that entered were myself and base and then now you're suddenly an admin i walked up with you guys the lights were turning off dk comes down as you guys are going up i stay with dk and i walk back down i walk to five up i can confirm i i i i have a i have to hold his hand base trade where were you after i finished i had crystals that's kind of cool i'm looking for five of them actually i know okay so here's the thing i'm gonna collect her i'm doing crystals i i come like i know bass trade like was stood on top of me when i started it and then i got off of it and i didn't see him here's what i did it's next to the vent okay i'm gonna redeem myself it's dk5 there's no hope for you bro was it you and sleepy that walked up to decontamination up top it means steve you and steve okay are you still two together like you can see each other right now no what is the point what is the point of you both all right it's between well the vision's down the lights are out okay okay the only part for anyone else because i think i just know that bass and i went up through deacon tam christopher during the dark i don't know where steve went after i went over to the left okay hold on hold on hold on hold on it was on me when i started crystals but i didn't see him when i came dk probably didn't do this kill thank you that's all i have i'm in the cafeteria right now chilling i also just think it's weird that chris isn't like using me for a voucher and it's instead i know i saw i saw you when you got on like when i got on it and then i'm off of it and you're not i think it is scared i think base is good i think steve is the wrong one i think it's koji and chris no dk please bro didn't they say on the other round that um like i know how to read logs it's just gonna i'm getting a heart accused for nothing okay so we need to get three kills hmm okay so steve has last one there look how is that is that you base straight i'm behind the lights you didn't want to report the body is there a body on light someone's got the panel open so i can't see you were kind of wiggling about and i'm pretty sure it was your name because it's such a long name and it was definitely your name and you were wiggling about and uh you weren't reporting the body oh cool so did you report it because you were afraid i was gonna see it cause i was on the panel i didn't see anything oh you is it falling over koji i i've just come from cafeteria i went into lights as soon as i came in the doorway there was a report button and i saw base trade wiggling down like bottom near bottom left of the room so like not near the vent and not nearly oh that he's 100 line because i'm on the panels why the lights are on i'm so excited i didn't realize the lights were going so quick the things that i would see my vision was very low but i'm so sure it was your name if you saw me in the bottom left you're 100 lying because i'm on the panel because the lights are the way that can be true is it was christopher in the bottom left of the room and you were on lights panel because it was a long name and it was definitely down in the bottom left of the room you didn't see the color you're sunday i just saw the name i mean the lights were off and i got tiny vision and it i'm so sure it was based right though like social well the thing is i'm still suss of base trade from potentially venting from reactor to kill last round because i did not see him if you were able to see me on you right you would have also seen the vent flap if i had gotten into the vent the foundation but then how do you see me with no lights out sitting on top of you if you if you don't see me because you're doing the thing you would at least you would see the big flap if i moved anywhere through a vent i think this is mr action i think it's christopher 5 but i have no evidence about this it's just my gut feeling um i i know i i'm i'm like pretty i'm pretty confident i think it's still steve i think it's steve more than anyone else okay i'm voting steve wait no i'm voting base trade because i'm pretty sure it's him sure that's right honestly oh try okay ouch chris were you in the bottom left of lightroom yeah i i i killed and i killed and ran away did you vent into d contam that time no i walked in there and i was always talks about how like when you think someone vented they usually just walked i'm like he probably did walk but like i don't trust them i don't know i also on the first round i invented killed hofu but i vented back and just walked the normal like uh logs so it'd be fine i had done every room and i didn't see you and then you were coming down that's why i went to check the logs but it was so far back that i couldn't see whether you were down or up there's the random god i punched my mind this map is hard it's fun interesting one all right wait who's my partner this time who's my partner this time only koji passed bottom left koji offu double kill um hey so i thought i'm pretty sure they're both dead in med bay i didn't walk in further uh so i can tell you i started on gas and then i walked over i checked med because everyone who has because i had mets again as crew for the first two games and it's like what i want to do off the bat yeah so as i walked by and crew can't see who's scanning because of our vision solo it's actually walked in to see and base trade was on the scanner right and then i don't have med scan so i'm like i'm gonna wait so he doesn't just die because like that sucks right and then um sleepy comes along so then i'm like ah he's good i'm gonna go so i go up i see koji i think got admin uh let's go off i fix it right and then uh i check admin and there's two in med bay i'm like that's not good so i walk down there and we're putting dk's body and i'm assuming sleepy's done on the scanner too so okay so the admin logs are um it was koji passed first he was there before anyone else like he's the only one that passed the southwest and north before anyone then was half of after that and then it was chris uh nobody else passed that then i went up to check koji was still there hafu was still up there wait no that's not correct because i was there i walked up there and i waited outside the room for hafu um i was also gonna say five of them chris he was sleepy while he scanned he would have no left right away because there's four people in there i'm not getting double calories four i left a lot a while ago so so christopher was in the room i and then as i'm walking up five up was around the security room i don't know where he was but i know he was around that area okay well i so the fact that he can't see me on the logs though it's a double kill at med scan i did not see you at all it's once comes up to react um he could have ended but i doubt it like okay oh yeah i think this kid is good i think yeah i'm gonna double check logs again i think chris might be bad because you know they're getting quicker i'm going to stab yeah well because you saw them scanning and then my head and that's true yep sure that was weird you mean five up five up was weird why well he knew comms were just going to get stabbed why would he even say that well they probably didn't remember until you said hey sabotage comes hmm so who's the fool wow wait i think five of your logs were wrong though because then you would have seen chris as well i said chris went up there i didn't see bass on there he named everyone except for me and i stood outside the room waiting for you when you did lights not knowing it was you in there yeah and then i think face is good because he's the first one on med scan okay well i didn't see based on the logs but i might have missed it i guess i saw uh you three and then i got off and went up so there's like a defined time that i guess i could have missed it if you think basically okay i i'm not kidding i'm accusing chris i think base is good i think chris is bad chris went into the room when i was like a little bad boy chris that's true i don't i did pop my head in there i was one of the first ones to leave though because i saw so many people that i left where are you where were you right now no no no another reactor test can i get you around last round uh last round i went up to reactor did the two tasks with scott and then steve came in so i like to think between scott and steve i was never alone okay wait how late was deep down that probably that probably works with koji's info then if it was if toast went to go down or steve was one of the econ main toaster weapon reactor yeah and i saw cody admin too yeah i was in admin for that whole round i'm not gonna lie i was just being a big noob and trying to figure out where the admin table was and then i found it i five up i think there's two colors between you chris kojie i think steve is potentially well you thought it was good like because you were an admin five i was just bragging about reading logs earlier mine seems so weird i was the first to cross and i just stayed up there the whole round is that what he said i think there is a fine line where i potentially think it is uh i think it's between chris steve and koji but did you not say that i was like the first the crosstalk oh it's like not coaching yeah i think steven's yeah so you just think it's chris and steve why aren't we voting chris then we got one of those right hmm [ __ ] i forgot i cleared koji i wouldn't expect her to i didn't expect her to like do this and immediately check admin and then go back oh i can kill her here so hmm hafu's dead on download in balcony oh oh where did you just come from s major um i ran from cafeteria and then i did the o2 and then i went up and did the wires and then you came to me coaching i didn't come i was the first one to fix o2 at the top of the map yeah also toast just died in a greenhouse i think is this a double because i feel like the double it's chris is being really weird this round too with the o2 by the way he was just sitting he's been dead for a while um what do you mean sitting in the hallway and toast i think just died why do you think huff has been done for a while the entire time when i was on admin table just hugging it um and there have been there's been one in balcony for for like 10 seconds do you need a hug bro i mean i wonder if i could get one it was i would also like all right doing the bottom of two he just stood there in the bottom right corner if papu is wrong on base i'm gonna blame her so i'm just gonna take it he's probably fine no two people on it she wanted to vote chris yes i know i want to vote chris too i'm saying if face is one of them i'm gonna be mad at her but it's fine wait bass that's just wait what i'm confused to see your information you said i'm standing still i've been running in the hallway the whole time and you said i didn't go to do bottom o2 and there were two people on it yeah you were in the corner you just said my corner by mid that's just false actually i would not in media at all either you're decent or you're hard locked no i didn't say you're in me but you're in the hallway by med bay you're just sitting there while the o2 is going off oh that's a full lie wait but that's a weird lie to come up with but the thing is these are guys before you walking down from the top one why are they doing it and you're not because they're already two people on it and huffle we trust wait that's actually just like a like a very bold lie you know she's gonna be mad for wrong but if she if she's wrong no if she's wrong she voucher base trade and he did have to be hip so it's her fault either way she's so bad all right that's the only way i could play that i'm pretty sure that's like the only way i could have played that they were all going up what the [ __ ] i mean i know steve is on logs right now is the issue so like i have to fake this i actually have to take this entire path because i know steve is just camping admin table right now like i can okay so i'm pretty sure christmas won but we should probably see right no because no sabotage there's no sabotage that was called and i don't think any of those five missed out really you don't think i would mess that up i mean steve you would thank you guys i have phil trust in you steve whatever scott i think you would have smashed it are you gonna be mad are you gonna be mad at me today steve so no i'm not mad at you if anything i'm mad at myself no for trust me don't worry steve i'm mad at you also it's fine steve thank you i'm no longer man please calm down bro please so this happened to me then is did you make the vote that i thought that i think you did yes as did i [ __ ] as did i wait scott did you vote steve or bates i love you five minutes i love you i have to wait and see unfortunately oh wait don't look at me like that i thought are we not crew together are we not bros right now i'm cripp but yes we're [ __ ] to play this way just vote with your heart guys the answer's staring you're right in the face man it really is oh scott i hope we voted the same thing i hope we did too oh um okay all right [Laughter] remember my vote guys cowards oh that's good okay so he doesn't have a button i will pay attention to where people go coach you and okay i'm so i'm like taking note nobody's on admin table right now okay oh i actually wouldn't hey we gotta win we got another one we got the back-to-back mirror ones well done gentlemen well done well done you know what five up you did pretty much everything don't worry chris will always win together don't worry honestly the best play was just to throw me to the bus i don't like mirror for anything so you
