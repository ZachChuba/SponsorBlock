hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with Tuscan onion soup that's right I love history
and I love food which is why I've always wanted to try making Karel bachi since
this is the ancient ancestor of what today we call French onion soup and
apparently it was brought to Paris by the demand cheese like 500 years ago but
anyway I realize you're not here for a history lesson I mean most of are
not even here for a cooking lesson but regardless let's go ahead and get
started with this extremely delicious and very comforting recipe to begin
we're gonna have to slice up a whole bunch of onions and not just any onions
one of the things that makes this soup so unique is we're gonna use red onions
and to do this right we are gonna need a fair amount all right believe it or not
I have about four pounds here as these onions were huge and went about a pound
each and what we'll do after cutting off the ends having it and taking off the
skin is cut this into about quarter-inch slices and as I might have explained to
before there's two ways can do this okay see those lines on the
onion sometimes referred to as the grain okay if we slice these across those
fibers in other words against the grain with the onion turn this way our pieces
of onion will basically fall apart if cook it long enough whereas if we
slice it with the grain in this direction those pieces will definitely
still get soft but they will hold their shape which is why that's how I'm gonna
cut it for this recipe besides I've always thought if cut it this way
there's less tears although like so many of my culinary theories I can't prove
that but anyway no matter how slice them once our four pounds of onions have
been prepped we're gonna transfer those into our largest skillet along with a
few tablespoons of olive oil which we have set over medium-high heat and we're
also going to toss in a fairly large amount of kosher salt and yes if you
want can do this step in a roasting pan in the oven which is a nice and very
passive way to accomplish this step but for whatever reason I decided to go with
the stovetop I guess I was in kind of a stirring mood
speaking of which because I have such a ridiculous amount of onions in the pan I
wasn't actually able to do too much stirring until these heated through and
kind of slumped down in the pan but once that happened I was fine
and at that point we'll reduce our heat to medium and cook these stirring
occasionally for a long long long time is in like about an hour or until they
get very very very soft and sweet and if everything goes according to plan and
cut them in the same direction I did they're gonna probably look a little
something like this and by the way if you're tempted to turn
up the heat to save a little time don't all right for this recipe we really do
not want to brown the onions which will definitely change the flavor profile so
leave it on medium or lower and take your time and then what we'll do once
our onions are to this point is go ahead and add exactly three sage leaves as
well as some freshly ground black pepper and then a very very small pinch of
cinnamon all right just a very small hint and that is the ingredient here
that makes this soup taste so unique and it also apparently makes it authentic as
does the next ingredient a little bit of ground almond and what we'll do is give
this a stir and let it cook for about two or three minutes so that our onions
in olive oil have a little bit of time to absorb those flavors and for the
record those last two ingredients were totally optional and they're often not
even found in modern versions of this recipe especially the cinnamon because
while it is true that does make this unique and authentic
it is also true it could have many people not liking the flavor of this
soup and the reason is when add cinnamon to something it will generally
amplify this sweetness of the dish and since slowly cook onions are already
very sweet to begin with the addition of the cinnamon for some folks is just
going to make this too sweet and not savory tasting enough and by the way I'm
gonna spend most of the blogpost talking about that very issue but anyway like I
said we will cook that stirring for a couple minutes at which point we can
transfer that mixture into a saucepan or soup pot and then speaking of sweetness
to balance things out we will add three tablespoons of red wine vinegar and then
last but not least five or six cups of a good-quality stock or broth which
classically would be a vegetable stock but as can probably see from the fat
droplets floating on the top that's not what I used
all right vegetables don't have fat which is one of my main problems with
them so I went with a beautiful homemade beef broth and by the way they say this
was Leonardo da Vinci's favorite soup since he was in fact a devout vegetarian
true story but anyway regardless of which use we will go ahead and stir that
in and then bring this up to a simmer on high heat and then once it's bubbling we
will back our heat down to medium low and cook this for at least thirty
minutes before serving and about a half hour later my looked a little something
like this and that's it other than tasting and adjusting for salt which is
of course mandatory our care Abacha is done and it is ready to serve
just as soon as we make the toast to go in the bowl which i was gonna say is
optional but it's not definitely make this toast and we will do that by
drizzling some olive oil onto both sides of some slice to tell bread and then
once that's been oiled we'll go ahead and apply some thinly sliced sage leaves
and we don't want too much but we definitely want enough and then we will
finish this up with some freshly grated cheese either some pecorino preferably
Tuscan or some parmesan which is what I'm using so decide I mean guys
are after all the Leonardo da Vinci's of which cheese but both will work
beautifully and that's it once cheese will go ahead and pop it into the center
of a 400 degree oven for about 15 minutes or until beautifully browned and
that's it once our toast is done we can move on to final production so we'll go
ahead and fill up a bowl with our beautiful red onion soup and by the way
the ancient Tuscans would have definitely put the toast at the bottom
of the bowl and then ladle the soup over the top so as to fully saturate and
soften the bread but know what the ancient Tuscans did not have to take
pictures so I'm gonna be putting my toast on top and I'll finish this off
with a little more olive oil and a lot more cheese and I think as long as we
promise to dunk this into the soup and let it soak for a few minutes before
eating everybody's gonna be fine with this approach even ancient Tuscans so
that's what I did I took a few pictures and then submerged the bread and let it
soak for a minute or two before digging in and that my friends was one very
delicious but very unusual onion soup ok very similar to French onion soup for
obvious reasons but what makes it so unique is the way that little touch of
cinnamon really enhances the sweetness of the onions which as I mentioned
earlier may or may not be something you're into and
again we're gonna cover that in the blog post and I think if I was just enjoying
the soup without that cheesy sage bread it might have been too sweet but when
pair that extra savoriness from the toast with the soup
it really does actually work quite well but anyway above and beyond paying
attention to the amount of cinnamon this really wasn't extraordinarily
interesting and complex soup and whether do this or not at least now know
the origins of French onion soup in case it ever comes up in conversation which
it won't but anyway that's it might take Ankara bachi I assume I'm pronouncing
that perfectly but if not please let me know but no matter how say it I
really do hope give it a try soon so head over to food whooshes calm for all
the ingredient amounts of more info as usual and as always enjoy
