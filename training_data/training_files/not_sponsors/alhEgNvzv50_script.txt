you know what Andy fans I actually feel bad for you for ten years you've had to give your hard-earned money to either Intel or Nvidia or both if you wanted to build a top-of-the-line gaming r8 AMD just hasn't been able to get both their CPU and GPU business units firing at the same time but perhaps that all changes today AMD stunned the industry as a whole when they unveiled their GeForce RTX competitor the Radeon seven one month ago and then they stunned me in particular when it arrived in our office on time for their target launch date of February 7th it isn't it beautiful it is and it's got RGB but is it good enough to pressure Nvidia to lower their higher than ever prices for enthusiast gaming GPUs well we'll find out soon thanks to premium tank or aircraft and three days of premium play for free let's begin with the bad news for those of you who like living on the bleeding edge AMD 7 nanometer Vega offering has no support for ray tracing nor does it have any kind of equivalent to invidious deep learning optimized tensor course now AMD has said that they're looking into implementing something similar to D LSS super sampling in the long term using Microsoft's new direct ml API but only time will tell if they get that done and what kind of performance hit we'd be looking at what we've got here is actually if you look closely it's right in the name basically a die shrunk and optimized Vegas sequel but that's not necessarily a bad thing let's take a closer look right out of the gate it's clear that AMD considers cooling to be of the utmost importance while the previous gen Vegas 64 used a blower design the Radeon 7 3 cooling fans on a large not to mention heavy vapor chamber cooler just like it to our TX competitors speaking of which not only as the Radeon 7/8 taller card than the RT X 2080 that AMD has positioned it against it's also got twin 8 pin PCI Express power connectors to allow it to suck up more juice come to think of it that's kind of weird normally die shrinks come with a power savings ah right so as far as we can tell they basically put their entire power budget savings towards cranking the clock speeds up on this thing interesting so ok then an overclocked and evolved Vega I can dig it did they do anything else to differentiate it from last gen oh right yeah they did how does double the HBM 2 memory at double the bandwidth sound to put that into perspective the Radeon 7 has faster memory than any of the GTX Titans or r-tx Titans for that matter but will that massive memory bandwidth and significant core clock increase make up for the loss of a handful of stream processors and will its resulting overall performance make up for the lack of rate singer/dancer course at this price to find out we've brought out both our Intel and AMD gaming test benches to pit it head-to-head against not only the r-tx twenty eighty and twenty atti but also the Vegas 64 to see just what impact those compromises had on the cards performance so as is tradition by now AMD seems to do worse and DirectX 11 titles than Nvidia but maintains an edge or trades blows with team green whenever DirectX 12 is in play which extends to Far Cry 5 and especially csgo where our RTX 2080 gets beaten by a pretty significant margin when we throw synthetics into the mix we see a reversal of the DirectX 11 and 12 performance from earlier which come to think of it is why we stopped using synthetic benchmarks years ago I mean this isn't even this isn't even representative of real-world performance Anthony was the one who brought them back I think I'm gonna have a word with them when we're done this video about just killing them again once and for all anyway moving on to productivity we've got more tradition with AMD's Radeon seven-pole ahead of even the 2080 ti in longer blender renders while falling far behind in v-ray in Lux mark the seventh straight up embarrasses Nvidia across the board but then inspect view perf which gives us a broader look at its workstation chops we've got a game of leapfrog going on so workloads that are particularly memory hungry like katiya energy medical and siemens NX show pretty strong wins for AMD but in some cases again eclipse even the 2080 ti while nvidia takes the crown in workloads that require raw compute strength sometimes again by broad margins when we look at thermals things get a little interesting now traditionally GPU temperatures are measured by a sensor at the edge of the die and this is the temperature we're showing you guys right now but AMD has actually doubled the number of sensors on the radio in seven and both the fan speed and boost controls are mated to what they're calling the junction temperature with a target of 110 degrees Celsius so the TLDR then is that the junction is highest reading out of all 64 sensors and they claim that by doing things this way they can squeeze more efficiency out of the GPU unfortunately that also means that the fans begin to ramp up much sooner than you might be used to at a junction temperature of 95 degrees and he does say though that you can increase this to 105 in their wot man software without any risk of damaging the card speaking of wot men we found that we couldn't really push the core clocks up at all without running into issues with either early thermal throttling or general instability so this supports our pre overclocked hypothesis but we will have to wait for more mature drivers and for partner boards with more robust power delivery before we can say anything conclusively so verdict time then given our results and the Radeon seven 700 dollar price tag we're kind of inclined to agree with Nvidia CEO and curiously dr. Lisa Seussical Jenson Huang it's a bit underwhelming yes for the same price as a reference RT X 2080 you get similar performance in traditional games but and videos overall feature set is simply more robust maybe you don't care about real time rate racing or maybe you don't care about GeForce experience or maybe you don't care about Nvidia superior Hardware h.264 encoder but take it all together odds are you'll care about at least one of invidious features so in our minds then the Radeon 7 to beat the RT X xx 80s price not match it and the frustrating thing is that if it weren't for the massive HBM 2 frame buffer they probably could have the word on the street is that just shy of half of the cost of this card is in that 16 gigs of memory that depending on the game might never be utilized more than 75% now if we had to guess we'd say what probably happened here was that rather than re-engineering a gaming tuned card with eight or twelve gigs of memory and I don't know more stream processors or something am recycled their enterprise compute card the radio and instinct mi 50 which would also explain the excellent productivity numbers whatever the reason though that compromise means that while the Radeon seven is an excellent maybe even ideal card for content creators by day gamers by night or really anyone who uses OpenCL a fair bit the value proposition against team green is merely okay for peer gamers don't get me wrong this gives us a choice in the market for sure and I'm I'm super glad that AMD released it today it's just not quite the price or performance disrupter that we were all hoping for in the wake of invidious stiff r-tx tax and as it stands it looks like we're just gonna have to live with digging deeper into our pockets for our graphics cards from now on thanks to war of premium time as a bonus for registering so thanks for watching guys if you disliked this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video description also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you guys should totally join even AMD's uncle doesn't like it
