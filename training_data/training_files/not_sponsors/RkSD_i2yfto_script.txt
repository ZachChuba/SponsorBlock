keep if would think fun to be around like to be around fun people in truth I'm never happier than when it's just me and a really old dog I sit there for a day think about living alone virtual specialist area we've here here well I liked it it's just the sympathy is the worst thing yeah mates yeah because I don't live with him loved it loved living on my own what was the best thing about living Oh just all of it nothing moved just know think I'm gonna stay up all night the man no one's gonna wake me up no one's gonna come round actually it was tragic remembered what it was like and

just for powers sake is boring isn't it if they're powerful because they've done something like a rhino is powerful rhinos don't do anything no that's what I'm saying I wouldn't shag a Rhino rhino we've done something amazing shanky well John what did celebrate Valentine's well this is my first year I've ever had a girlfriend on Valentine's that's tragically sad loads of birds obviously but February the 13th thrift measure get rid most people would rather play video games than go to the park true or false I prefer a park because can't lose at the park don't come back from the park and someone says how was the park and he goes I went out straightaway with a computer game pay 60 quid for something that is now too hard to do compute the games I switch them on and then I just die what's the point in that they shoot at straight away there's not a level where it's like level one get some breakfast I'm at real life I play video games to feel less five minutes I want to win the World Cup and shoot some bodies I don't want to be crying on the floor in a video game as well as well so if I had to answer for everyone Jimmy I'd say the park would say have like a million I strangest just a friend haven't met yet like about chatting to people online is there are people whose accents I can tolerate and they're people who blah blah and then talk to them online and realize oh can't write can't can't spell can't punctuate and then a male friend will send me a text with an X on it so you've never kissed me in real life he was suddenly getting all flirty on a text bring it next time we're at the park you're gonna be whoa whoa what's this it's annoying thing couples do well let's go to our specialist on this John what is the what is the most annoying thing that loving couples do it's when they finish each other's what pisses me off about my male friends is they what occurs couples great in it when you're in relationship but their men feel this obligation to pretend she won't let him come out when really they just don't want to say to their mates I'd rather watch your film and Shack yeah listen to moan on about your life but they go yeah love to calm down a boozer but sure won't there just say it your relationship is better than your friendship with me I'll take it I don't give it thing is John they're not even watching a DVD or having sex they just rather not go out I watched a DVD because I'm watching through their window can change your phones but I'll still be there whether tell it's been a pay-by-the-hour innit I like to shack I think that's become obvious forgotten who are I'm trying to sleep tonight I just say never check the worst thing can always say it's just the truth just say well know statistically you're probably never gonna find true love best you'll find someone willing to just see it out with but it's not to say you'll be happy someone might stay with but you'll probably never be happy you'll grow to hate oh never mind might make someone at the clinic other men at least romantic thing to do on your honeymoon is Arthur Maine yeah I resent to as a man is been referred to as a thing Sara I don't have to be called a thing Wow way to compliment if you're in a long-term relationship he's always wake up before your partner or your wife right so when she wakes up you're just staring at so she makes out like that and then you're just there go did have a good night's sleep when inherently sound sarcastic even if I mean it yo look nice no John just just for the sake of I just genuine let me make sure looked lovely

number one weird crush as voted for by the British public is Russell her she doesn't mean that way to me number two what a weird crush which is a terrible backhanded compliment yeah saying don't sweat much for a fat girl weird crush is also John's signature lovemaking style as well they sent me a badge I think it says something on it like not quite weird enough what a chart line nice looking for a man who says I'm mental but not very I can't help thinking know there if look at this panel there are two people who are single who might get on quite well [Laughter] you're just not worried enough for me daddy you're gonna feel pretty bad when one week I come in and I'm in a relationship and there's nothing to talk about Sue and I ship well you're one of those couples that talk about what Sue
