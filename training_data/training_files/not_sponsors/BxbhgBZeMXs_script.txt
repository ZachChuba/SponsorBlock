this is a video i didn't want to make i never saw myself having to make here on youtube but unfortunately in the 3d printing review space there is an increasing amount of dodgy behind the scenes behavior going on by companies to manipulate reviewers in a way that makes their product look favorable to you the audience who i value more than anything because like other reviewers here on youtube it's my aim when i review a product to give you the full picture whether it's good or bad or anywhere in between to inform your purchasing decision and the sheer act of making this video public means that i'm actually affecting the future of my channel because i'm going to be sent a lot less review units but here's the thing i care more about the community than some dodgy company that thinks they can't manipulate me so let's talk about the seven deadly sins of 3d printing companies now let me be completely clear i am not attacking one single brand nor am i attacking one single machine nor am i even attacking one single source of machines yes it's true that a lot of these low-cost 3d printers come out of china but i've been at the receiving end of dodgy behavior from companies all around the world that provide 3d printers and 3d printing accessories so don't go out with your pitchforks and torches attacking one brand or one company that because of what i said in this video because it's unfortunately so pervasive in the industry that it's a lot of players that are doing this and i want to put an end to it all together and on top of that if you feel i am attacking you or your company then maybe you should take a long hard look at yourself and your actions and try to rectify them but luckily this is not the norm currently in the industry i have worked with some fantastic companies over the years some fantastic individuals in those companies who have taken on sometimes quite harsh criticisms of things i've brought up and then moved forwards to implement changes and they've done really well as companies so if you're one of those companies and you will know who you are if you're watching this video thank you for doing things right and you guys ready to set the gold standard moving forwards in this industry i just really hope everyone else can meet your standards one day so let's start with sin number one this idea that a free product sent to a reviewer equals free advertising and free positive advertising at that and i can see how this has come about because for example you're sending something that may be worth thousands of dollars to someone and they get to keep it there's this expectation that you'll get free pr out of it and then therefore the company will send will sell more products and often these exchanges are managed by internal marketing teams but more and more recently i've noticed that third-party teams are sort of coming in between brands and influencers to send products through and it's these third-party individuals that are the most aggressive in trying to manipulate their end out the outcome of that review to be positive and in a very very quick turnaround uh space of time every good reviewer has a set of terms and conditions that they send to the company or the third-party marketing agency before the product is received to outline the guidelines of their review and for example tom has a fantastic one that naomi has actually translated for companies to use if you want to go check that out all the links will be in the description but we always send out our terms before companies send their products and we say in them that the review will be as unbiased as possible i've actually made videos on this in the past but at least for me i'll conduct a review as if i am the end user with limited knowledge into 3d printing because i'll get out of the box i'll use a quick start guide to set it up and i'll start printing not judge the machine according to whether it was easy to do if there's any issues any quality control problems and if the print at the end actually looks good and the machine's reliable then i'll make my review and sew it up edit it send it out a good review doesn't just have positives that's called an advertisement and that's very different to a unbiased review again everyone has bias but we try to be as unbiased as possible but there's this expectation that because you have the product sent to you for free and get to keep it that review should be positive and boost the sales from that company which i'm more than happy to do if the product is good but at least for me i always try to have pros and cons in a review and i leave it up to you the viewer to make that choice if you want to purchase a product or not i'll never just go out and say buy this product it's fantastic because for a lot of people it won't be it's only a fit for some people and it's up to you to make that decision sin number two pre-orders kickstarters and beta testing units this is an issue that's been getting worse and worse over time because initially i didn't really have a problem with crowdfunding because in my opinion it's the only way to get some things off the ground where there's a very niche audience and there's a creator that has wonderful ideas but needs that funding to make them happen so for example a niche bit of hardware is totally suitable to crowdfunding if it doesn't exist anywhere else and the creator's just an engineer with a fantastic idea and even if it does fail it's generally assumed that because someone behind it was working hard there might be documentation and ideas that can be used further in that line of research at least that's how i view it but what crowdfunding is being used for increasingly now is just to boost the launch of a product from a very established company again not naming names but a lot of the big 3d printing players are using crowdfunding now even when they could very easily launch a product without it but why do they use crowdfunding well it's zero risk marketing to them they can get the money up front and then figure out how to manufacture and source the components for the printers and whatever and then send them out and pre-orders are much the same although in my opinion less insidious than the crowdfunding because at least there's a little bit of financial protection there whereas the crowdfunding you're basically gambling there's no protections for your money if you don't get an end product or if it's different to what you expect but pre-orders and kickstarters aside it's the beta testing units that reviewers get sent that i really want to talk about i was naive like a lot of people when this sort of thing started to happen but now it's very easy to identify beta testing units sent to reviewers to boost the popularity of a new product and basically get free marketing uh nothing like the backers or the supporters of pre-orders get in the end at a minimum they might be hand-assembled and use slightly different components like different linear rail brands for example but at its very worst reviewers get sent units that are completely fake they're made from scratch to look like a mock-up of the final product if it actually will end up existing and reviewers are basically used because that review means nothing to what the end product will be as a reviewer here on youtube that has talked about products on kickstarter it is incredibly difficult not to because often it's the only way we get access to interesting hardware to show and talk about on the channel but again the reviews of that hardware mean very little to the end product unless the company has actually put some serious rnd into it before trying to launch and that's very rare sadly number three quality control and testing on the user going back a fair few years like 2012 on that you would build a 3d printer from at best a kit or just from parts you'd source on the internet it was up to you to build a machine that was reliable didn't have safety issues and all of that it was really a very much diy hacky approach to building machines but when you buy machines ready to run you kind of expect them to work however quality control issues continue to plague i would like to say low-cost 3d printers but they i've seen them in machines worth thousands upon thousands of dollars so why is this a problem well i believe companies operate on an increasingly fast time scale between conceptualization engineering uh production and then getting the product out there and the faster that goes through the less and less they're likely to catch quality control issues because the thing with quality control is it costs time and money to do good qc you need people full time checking things you need to do a full burning test for example with hot ends in that to make sure the wires don't melt after 100 hours you need to make sure the fans don't have their bushings fail after five [Music] stuff like that needs to be done however as machines continue to get cheaper that profit margin is crushed and therefore companies rely on quantity which means the turnaround needs to be much faster which means the production is crushed and these quality control issues become more and more dangerous thermal runaway is a well-documented dangerous situation with filament-based 3d printers because they use a heat cartridge to melt plastic and that is regulated with a thermocouple however if that thermocouple is disconnected from that cartridge it can't register the temperature therefore the cartridge would just be told to keep heating and heating heating trying to hit that temperature that it never will and it can get so bad that it can actually cause the whole machine to catch fire and there's been several documented cases of that thermal runaway protection has been available in firmware for several years however i continue to run into machines that have it disabled having thermal runaway disabled on a 3d printer that you send to an unsuspecting customer it's not only a quality controlled concern but it's a blatant ignorance to the safety and well-being of people who are buying your products and often means users have to test for this themselves and then implement firmware changes to fix it which takes us to the second stage of this section user testing so if you have quality control issues or machines badly engineered who is going to fix that well the end user there's actually a really big divide between people who just want to 3d print and people who want to tinker and improve their 3d printers and i've often referred to this in the past as wanting a 3d printer as a hobby or a tool both are completely valid but if you buy a 3d printer expecting a tool and then have to keep tweaking it to make it have better cooling to make the print surface work better to make it not lose level after each print to make sure it doesn't burn up because thermal runaway was disabled there's some serious concerns and negligence from that company which takes us comfortably on to sin number four and that is community dependence many of these companies rely completely on the communities of people who have bought their machines to keep them running so if you think with most traditional tech products you can usually get some support now support might not be fantastic there's usually like a big sort of checklist or troubleshooting guide there's usually a number you can call and wait for a while and talk to someone to get it fixed but with many 3d printing companies beyond a really basic troubleshooting guide maybe they often rely completely on their community facebook groups forums and even comments on youtube and people like myself making videos on how to improve and fix existing machines to make them better safer more reliable etc this even gets to the point where people in the community will write brand new firmware for existing machines and this benefits the existing company because then more people will see their machines working well and want to buy them but these people aren't getting paid they're the community who bought machines to you know at least tinker with and have fairly reliable why is it up to them to fix the problems of machines that weren't properly engineered and i know a lot of people don't have any issue with doing this there is something nice about having a community but think hard about it is it actually okay for a company to wash their hands of support completely and leave it in yours what if you suggest something to someone you know as a fix to their machine and then they end up getting electrocuted because they opened up the mains power supply by accident or their machine catches fire because they did something wrong in the firmware update you recommended that's really bad it's up to the company to make machines that work at least okay and fairly reliably and safely out of the box then you might want to i would say like remote control cars add hop-up parts to you know improve them beyond their existing level of already works that's sort of where i see it being okay but anything else than that is really really not i'm gonna have to hold a screwdriver now so i don't flail my hands too much when i get angry because this section is just gross um censorship bribery and coercion this is something that goes on largely behind the scenes with 3d printing reviews that don't go the way companies would have hoped but it also extends to a lot of the tech review genre out there i've seen it many times from different reviewers who uh whistleblow about being pressured or even coerced to take a video down or edit it or manipulate in such a way that the company doesn't look bad because when a reviewer is sent a product that is so terrible so dangerous so with so many issues we want to warn you as like customers don't buy it sometimes products will have a few good features but there'll just be one underlying flaw like thermal runaway for example that makes us really say don't buy this printer until the company's fixed it and a lot of companies do take this feedback on board when i release a review that may have some negative aspects to it often the company says thank you for the feedback we'll take it back on board and we'll try to improve for next time that's the best best reaction and response that we can possibly get as reviewers that means the company's taking it seriously and hopefully in future they come back to us with an approved version so we can say to our community you guys hey yes they did fix things i love doing that i'm always okay to give a second chance but often we get responses like your review shocked us it was full of bad negative words um please delete the video please edit the this section out of your video um we'll we'll pay you to alter and re-upload the video yes sadly this sort of thing really does happen and it's happened to me a few times on the channel in the past and it's one of the most stressful things i've ever experienced i've had companies try to defame me by saying i put out you know unfair reviews uh there's often a response if it's not as as harsh um as extreme as please delete the video oh my god we're losing money it's often um the response is we've changed things since your review therefore it's invalid as if to say the the machine they sent to me was garbage and they knew it was garbage and they've sent it to heaps of other customers but they have changed it since because probably because a lot of people had issues as well or maybe they've just changed nothing they're lying and therefore my review is invalid and delete the video or you know we'll send you extra parts to fix it therefore make another video it's not how it works unfortunately if you stand your ground here it often then descends into attempts of bribery so companies will try to send you money or they'll try for example i have a patreon a lot of creators will have patreons they'll pledge at like a 500 level to message you to try to be buddy buddy to sort of um get you to sort of softly softly uh change your opinion and change things because negative reviews suck um you end up with a video that's that's no good for anyone at least it tells them not to buy a product for example but you waste your time because you end up with a machine that's crap and then the company gets all angry at you and stresses you out and you just left in you just left in this depressive slump of why did i bother and if you're in a vulnerable situation you might think well after all that 500 would be amazing at least i can get something for my time and move on but the thing is if a company is willing to do this to a reviewer then who knows what they're doing to the customer and i always try to keep that in mind if a company is willing to send me a piece of crap then what are they sending you if you buy that piece of crap that i was sent it's probably going to be 10 times worse the bribery aspect also extends to before the products even sent for example this odd exchange that was sent to me by the three print professor where he insisted on retaining editorial control including the type of video he'd make about the product and then as a response the company declined the review because they're worried about sales due to unstable video viewing and companies will often try to position themselves as saying we want to sponsor your content but what they actually mean is a paid review and you just know upfront that because there's already been a value exchange if that product isn't good um if you always have to disclose if a video is sponsored anyway but if a product's bad it's just going to cause all sorts of problems for you so that sort of thing i'm very much against and then there's affiliate links now i've used affiliate links before fairly sparingly but only on products i actually think are decent but if you make a fair video about a product and it isn't very good and you say that then you have affiliate links well hey who's gonna buy it and two it's kind of a conflict of interest isn't it because you're trying to make money off something and then therefore maybe you should butter it up a little bit to make it sound better therefore it's the best printer ever therefore you should buy it with my affiliate link you can see where things start to get a bit a bit muddy and a bit biased and again this is really difficult because content creators don't make a lot of money as an example here's a video of one of my more recent reviews with around 80 000 views which is very high for a regular 3d printing review and this is how much it made in its lifetime i don't really generally take sponsored content on of just random brands if you do that's totally fine i don't generally do that so this meant this video made me this much before tax and keep in mind the printer costs more than this so if i had purchased the printer then i would have lost money it was sent to me for free sure but again what use do i have for another average 3d printer so the pressure is on to try to leverage that with affiliate links and such it's a really really complicated multi-layered topic that can get really nasty and then just a little bit sort of how truthful is it but i think it's really important that everyone in the community knows that this is the struggle that content creators go through trying to monetize the content we produce while staying as unbiased and fair as possible so let's move on to number six product life cycle and market saturation when i first started reviewing 3d printers i could review them a year out from when they came out and that review would stay current for at least another year these machines were on the market for a long time and that that sort of audience build up was slow that meant that a review stayed relevant for a long time it was worth putting effort in and you could really properly test things nowadays it's very different a company will send a early version of a product and expect a review within a week maybe they want to live stream within 24 hours and here's the thing you cannot test a machine like a 3d printer in a week i would say at minimum a month for a proper in-depth review of a 3d printer because going back to quality control some things take a while to break and you need to make sure those things have had that time to um settle in so you can recommend a product to people that when they get it because they're not gonna be buying a machine and printing two benches and saying yep it's a fantastic printer for some people that is their only print and they've saved up for months to get it so when i make a review i really want to make sure that you're getting the same product as i get however with the current life cycle of machines on the market today often once a month's passed the machine is out of date it's either been substantially changed or the company's moved on to another version and this only confuses and infuriates the entire community because you want to recommend a machine that's good to people but then there's this variation there's this pro version there's this different size it's got different things different control boards different this and that and it makes the review you did just worthless i strongly believe a good company only needs a few good products in each category for example a small budget friendly beginner machine and then maybe a larger more pro version and then maybe a super super large uh extra fancy elegant version whatever so why do some companies have heaps of versions of what looks like the same thing with just maybe slightly different sizes than that well it's all about market saturation the more of your brand is on the market the more it's likely to show up in searches more likely it's going to dominate it's like toothpaste in the shopping center you know it's all dominated by colgate because they just have so many variations of what essentially is just toothpaste 3d printers aren't toothpaste we don't need tons of variations on the same form factor each company should be focusing on one good version of that that segment and then just keep making it and then finally the last deadly sin greed it's it is what it is what it comes down to is companies are sending out machines that are not fit for purpose then they are pressuring reviewers to present a artificially positive view of those machines at best they might just blacklist you and never send you another machine again or at worst they might try to publicly slander you or invalidate your findings by saying everything's being fixed but at the end of the day they want to move units and the tactics being used are disgusting and it's just not okay it doesn't matter if you've got a print farm you've been printing for years or you've just gotten your first machine or you're even just kind of looking or you've subscribed to my channel because you like my bird videos it's important that you guys know about this happening not just in the 3d printing industry but in the tech industry as a whole and what we're going to start seeing is as companies blacklist legitimate reviewers because they've spoken their mind and they weren't manipulated we're going to start seeing paid reviews and paid content that's not disclosed it's like a uh it looks like a review but it's going to be very very scripted very very positive with no no negatives and probably trackable links and description it's really really difficult to build credibility and takes an instant to destroy it so i implore all my fellow creators if you're pressured to do this kind of thing and i hope as a community we can come together and stop this where it is right now and bring it back to the fact that independent reviews are the way forward companies can learn from what people have to say about their products instead of trying to suppress it and companies need to learn that maybe quality control is important maybe r d is important maybe they should stop trying to rush products out the door and then punish people when they say they're crap i just want to take a moment to mention naomi wu sexy cyborg we as a 3d printing community owe so much to her and her efforts in keeping companies straight and keeping them actually accountable for their quality control problems and building better more reliable safer products as i mentioned this other video she worked on translating tom's review guidelines which are fantastic again link below because as a whole we need to make sure that we knit this in the bud and she is a fantastic contact we have and if you forwards thanks for watching guys bye
