and it's doing this nicely it's actually going around it's actually swapped lanes it's gone to the oh so close welcome back everybody to taser driver welcome to another autopilot city tour here in the UK today we're going down to Truro all the way down in the southwest now this is the most southwest of the cities and this will be the biggest test of autopilot of the city so far and I say that because do you know what Truro is famous for yeah that's right ancient cobblestone tight streets so hopefully today we're gonna be finding some ancient cobblestones streets we're gonna go down to Truro find the cathedral this was actually made a city in 1877 which is three years before the cathedral even started being built which is a little bit strange I thought the cathedral had to be built for it to be a city but it's a very old place a very small city and it's taken me about four hours this morning to get down here so it's a quite a trek quite a trek sorry and the roads have been really nice so far on the motorway we've had no problems at all on these kind of side roads like this again it's being absolutely flawless so I thought I would show you a little bit of it working very very very well before we enter Truro for some reason when I say Truro I think of dinosaurs and a car rental company anyone able to understand why I don't even know why but that's all off the top of my head going through here some pretty heavy foliage lots of trees around big shadows but the car smooth as butter through this area really nicely so I'm hoping that these cobblestone streets have some lines or at least they have lines before them and we can enter them I'm assuming the roads are all going to be 20 miles an hour near Truro and it's also a very famous place for our what you call it where people go on holidays and stuff vacations and tourism and yada yada yada that kind of stuff a little bit wide back there but it did okay I don't think many people have Auto piloted this road because it hasn't slowed down for any of the corners prior to this but it did pretty well coming into the 40 there as well how quickly does it change change pretty quick 240 picking up the cones as well nicely as we go into some pretty tight bends here is the car going to slow itself down yes it is slowing itself down all the way down to 34 this corner it was quite a tight corner but the card did it well and trust me the roads are going to get a lot smaller a lot tighter than this even down these a roads it is pretty tight but because the lines are so perfect and the corners aren't too bad at the moment the car is doing it really nicely hopefully this Range Rover will stay in front of us as well and keep a slow regulate our speed nicely for us give us a better approach into it so it looks like yeah it looks like we're going into at the moment I've got it set just to go straight into the Cathedral so we'll go into the Cathedral do a little some of the roads around there and drive back and back around and out and we're gonna go back out I think this way as well so it should be quite interesting to see we're hoping then this time that there aren't gonna be any cars parked on the side of the roads hopefully if there are any big roundabouts they are lamed and the car actually works them you can see here it's picking these up as cones and bollards it wasn't 100% sure what to show that's fine if it shows both that's you know that's still good big lorry here the car might brake hard no didn't brake hard for it and this is yeah this is a tough swooping corner here the Range Rover front is breaking and we are know we're not actually slowing down yet okay so we're coming to a roundabout and I've got to say that I don't know what that looks really weird for a roundabout in my opinion but let's see what it does shall we let's see how it works I think I'm going right here apparently yeah okay so I'm going right down this way and I'm going into into this 20 zone okay interesting autopilot on and we're coming down here into this 20 zone I feel like this isn't the right way I like is this really the way that I'm gonna be going I feel like I was on the main road already this is hard to see that was hard for even me to see those those bollards in the middle of the road there autopilots back on it's doing it no it wasn't doing it there and as you heard it literally just touched just touch some of the the flowers oh no and again some of these corners are just a little bit too tight for it okay this is an interesting route that it's taken us but luckily for us all the cars are parked on the other side of the road this is a 20 and you can see how well it's picking up the bollards here sadly it won't slow down for each speed bump but we actually don't need it to at 20 they're not they're actually quite nice new speed bumps this is a really nice road actually to come in on it's definitely not the main way into a true row but it's a good test for us and then sadly here comes our first little hiccup which we're gonna have probably quite a few of and that of course is going around stationary parked cars in fact for this bit here there's no point getting on the other side of the road for a minute so I'm just gonna autopilot down this side of the road just to there and then we'll pull it back in Oh okay so what's slowing down there I thought it was slowing down for the speed bumps but it was actually slowing down for that van ahead of us which is the open reach bTW man Oh dog doing a nice poop we're all watching I hope that gets picked up we all saw okay right back onto a more normal he says a more normal roads as it comes to a pretty strange Road if I'm being honest keeping us on our left which is quite good and then again it's stopping as soon as we get up to these cars as it will do now this is what I was more expecting these kind of roads on their entrance into Truro and then it get a little bit better as we go okay this kind of fronts going way slower than me I guess maybe they know the roads better keep it nice and slow down here and this car in front is slowing us down for the speed bumps which is really good and hopefully as well it's going to keep us yet the car is following this car in front more and it's keeping us on the left side of the road which is which is really good some kids walking across the road there the car didn't pick them up but it didn't really need to that early on and it's doing this nicely it's actually going around it's actually swapped lanes it's gone to the oh so close it nearly actually like it nearly did it correctly and then it kind of confused itself and tried to throw itself back into the left lane little did it know if you don't just kept on on that left lane we actually would have been fine but sadly sadly it didn't okay so we've got this car going in left here and my car is gonna just come in and stop behind this car okay okay okay I've taken control I've taken control my gosh Wow I was literally stopped going zero miles an hour and it was not happy it was not happy with that at all okay so I'm gonna actually bring this down I think to 15 mile an hour for this little bit here nice and slow over this hopefully not too many problems then do a little break there but I'm not hundred percent sure I think it might've been for this van actually down here ahead of us again nice and slow went over there no problems and yeah it's taking us down the middle of the road here so I'm gonna have to take control and put it into the left-hand side yeah this is what I expect it look at these kind of one-way one Street kind of roads it is very very tight down here okay autopilot back on there's the Cathedral over on our left what a magnificent structure it is I can't work that out nicely this is quite a hill and then the lions move across but it did it well it followed the lines across nicely as well and this is actually a really nice place yeah I didn't expect it to be this open and this big even in the center I expected it all to be very small and very tight this is pretty nice so the sat-nav here is trying to take us left but it looks like yeah there's a sign there that says we can't go left for some reason or nearly it started doing that really well and then at the last second it didn't it didn't do too well it pulled us off at the end man there's some big Hills hit put autopilot back on and all this is tight this is really tight let's see how it does this corner I'm gonna bring all the way down to ten four I'm gonna let it go no see again when it can't turn it just en't like once it mmm they're like reaches its max turning it gives up and just go straight which is really really strange obviously okay we've got a cone on the left here and it did go round it but it wanted to get nice and close up to it let's take a actually let's take a right there's not behind us so we can cut across Lane there's no one come in wow yeah this is what this is more what I meant like this kind of like tiny tight Street the bus is having to come onto my lane just to go you know around the simple roads yeah it's pretty it's pretty crazy I'm gonna bring it down to 15 and we're gonna see if you'll do this corner it won't it won't it looks too tight it might curb it and as we do that we've got a car coming around the other side anyway but it felt like it felt it was going too wide anyway if I'm being totally honest and I would have pulled it off myself because I don't think it was gonna make that okay let's just go left and start heading into the city a bit more and we'll try and find some of these cobblestone street because I promise you I read then it has lots of cobblestone streets again can't can't go around that corner just because it's too tight so I had to pull it across and as you saw as a car come round the car didn't like notice it and wouldn't slow down and go around the corner enough again here even pulling it all the way down just not enough I'm trying to leave it as long as I can departing lane I know that's me doing that I'm driving but yeah again as you can see the car itself just struggling struggling on some of these hard corners and again that's just because of our limitations we've got that limiting law that stops how many g-forces or how tight the the car can actually turn the steering wheel and that needs to be changed again here we've got a car on coming to us and our car was very happy just to sit in the middle of the road and joust pretty much yeah pretty much just joust any car that was coming its way again here coming to the stop at the end of the roads the cars not going to stop for us so we're indicate left and down here these are really cool-looking streets but there's no cobblestones and I'm disappointed because I wanted to try cobblestone street maybe they've all been patched up and they were they were bad or dangerous or something I'm not I'm not sure I'm not sure where this goes oh here's the cobblestones down there down here's cobblestones okay this is pretty cool to see the cars doing this nicely it's going around these yeah really nice and then as we come to a come to a stop you can see there the people walking by it thinks that the the triangle is an arrow which technically technically it is oh here's the cobblestone street okay well I don't know actually I'm gonna go right and I'm gonna see if I can yeah there's no way look at this this is awesome oh my god it's not awesome for the car I don't know if I'm going the right way the wrong way I have literally don't have a clip-on oh there's an arrow we're going the right way it would actually it would actually self-drive down down here I don't want this car to go out in front just so I can stay behind him and turn on my autopilot of course so I don't know like for example I don't know if I can go down that way or if I can go down any other routes oh this car start oh sorry I didn't realize this quite wanted to pull in there alright well we're working our way around them so I put the car wrong but there's people walking and again the cars just kind of wiggling about a little bit it's bringing it really slow as it tries to fill these figure these roads out okay I want to go back I want to go back through that but I don't know how to get to it to be totally honest I'm gonna take a right here so oh I actually came up from that road ahead of us that's the road that we came down and we turned right last time so we're gonna take a right this time and go the other way we've got people walking around us and you can see them coming alongside us now which is cool to see there you go as people walk past there is three of them but it's actually just showing one person we need to merge again that's something that obviously the cars got to learn the cars got to be able to merge in areas like that I think if I go right and then right again I might be able to get to those cobbled streets but I'm not 100% sure I know okay so you can't actually I thought we were going to be able to turn turn down and turn around there but looking down I know it's a bus only route okay so that route that I said like I don't if I can go round there turns out I can it's actually a bus only route so I was quite lucky that we didn't go down there I think that could have been that could have been pretty pretty bad for autopilot if a bus came at it then again would it react who knows who knows good test for I guess right let's come off here then so there that was the the center center and as you saw it was very tight it was very small lots and lots of trouble for the car and it definitely wasn't going to Kabul Stoke sorry it definitely wasn't going to self-drive down those cobblestone roads there were no markings at all and yeah it was pretty pretty pretty bad area for it so as we come out here we have got a central divider so hopefully in theory we should be able to change lanes but I know it's not it's not happening even though we've got a very obvious central reservation there the car still won't change lanes on these kind of roads just yet which is a which is a shame this is a lot bigger than I thought this city was as well okay it might have some issues here just because the road gets so wide it might fling us about a little bit no actually that was that was actually a really smooth merge really happy with all that merged in that was really nice again we're getting some really bright lights now it's really shining on hard for me to see out so I'm sure the cameras are having a hard time of it however it's not wobbling it's not giving me any extra warnings so we've got a bus lane appearing on the left here which should push us over let's see if it does oh no no it doesn't it just merges and this is doing all these roads around for a really nicely so we need to get into the left lane coming up is the car gonna pick that ourselves because we have got the sat-nav on so it is navigating us but will it pick the correct lanes will it do everything correctly for us we are in the left lane which is good I'm just going to actually I don't even need to indicate right by the looks of it but however the car doesn't want to go past this bus oh look at that it actually slammed on there while we were meant to be going around this bus I'm keeping this at 10 miles an hour know that the car they're not wanting to turn not wanting I'm surprised actually how much it squirmed at going past that bus because it really didn't want to go past it okay back onto autopilot here on our way up I guess it's gonna take us back up and out of Truro yeah actually so that's what we've done we've pretty much come in done a huge lap of the city gone through the middle and we're now coming back out these side roads here bring it up to 30 I've got to say actually that city was really good pretty easy for the auto pilot on the other areas it's just those single lanes cars on the roads and the cobblestone areas are big big issues for it but obviously we knew that they were going to be issues okay let's see how the a39 is on our way out of Truro for a little bit shall we and you never know we might get some navigate on autopilot coming up this is where yeah so this is where I went left down there so that kind of weird route that it took me but it was actually quite a nice route in the end I quite enjoyed it okay waiting for what's the pilot to turn on there we go autopilot on car braking slowing us down for this corner nicely picking up those bollards again nicely and then accelerating out I do like these oh okay a little bit of phantom braking there maybe because of the trees I think the trees were over our path so it could have been that yeah these kind of roads 40 mile an hour roads with really good lane markings are so nice for autopilot I do wish that the roads obviously whoa braking hard there we're a little bit wider but I wonder why it's braking hard sometimes on some of these corners maybe it's because the roads are just that tight and the sunshine is so bright on the right-hand side that the cars the car the car's right side the camera must be completely blinded so maybe it's just being a little bit careful a little bit precautious going around all these corners but look at how well it's doing I'm actually gonna leave it as well and we get let's soive ready I'm letting go over the wheel or at least I'm putting it so it doesn't feel me on it and just gonna time it and just see how long roughly that is because previously it used to be every 10 to 15 seconds that's 10 seconds and 15 seconds gone there we go so it is around the 15-second mark it does ask for it which isn't too bad a tight corner here but you can see the car breaking really nicely for it not doing any Lurky movements not asking okay now it was as it got really tight at the end there but it already pretty much completed that turn my god that is so bright for the car so I'm just having to put my visor up because that is so bright or another Tesla as we went past there and now we've gone up into a 50 so let's put it up into the 50s and see the corners are a bit too tight I think to be going 50 so it's gonna have to slow down at some of them like this one here for example I'd be surprised if it didn't slow down for it okay it's not slowing down for it there you go it breaks right at the end so there for example it needs to know that it just needs to go a little bit slower around that for it to work we've got some pretty interesting kind of wiggly bends here going through some trees as well with some really harsh light spots really nicely done this is brilliant it actually kind of feels a little bit like a roller coaster down here with the car controlling itself going left right left right 50 is a good speed for this as well a cycle lane should be appearing in a second so we might get some cycle lane appear on the on the road if your notes as well if there was like a definitive cycle lane if it changed the color and showed it as a lane on here I can't wait until they start releasing more stuff for the visualization that really does take in taking control and make the car really improve a lot okay so here we go coming into national speed limit and hopefully it's a dual carriageway it's not a dual carriageway so we're not gonna get navigate on autopilot but we can go up to the 60 and just drive our way out and it's pretty much like this the whole way out so there we are everybody there is true a row not too bad actually not a bad little place I would have spent more time driving around and having more time around here but sadly there are no superchargers yet built this far down and I only have about 10 miles to play with which really isn't that much when you drive when you're driving about 70 to 80 miles an hour on the motorway eats up a lot more miles so I always give it like an extra quarter mileage in my tank or in the battery or this guy's braking the car isn't braking for him yet okay now the car is breaking its noticed he's braking it's gonna have to brake pretty hard if he is going left here yeah it is breaking it is breaking and then I'm accelerating with my foot only because there's a car coming behind us pretty quickly and I wasn't sure he saw that I was braking and sometimes the acceleration on the model 3 on well on all of them on autopilot is just a little bit too slow off the mark I wish it was a little bit quicker this is gonna be interesting actually we'll end it on this here is it gonna pick the left lane or the right lane pause the video right now and put left or right in the comment section which one do you think it's gonna be I think it's going to pick the right lane I don't think it's gonna go into that left lane I hope it does though and I hope I'm wrong I'm not wrong at all it went straight into this lane and sadly because there's no central divider I have to indicate and bring it off myself and get it back into the first lane that was a little bit of a shame but again showing that maybe it's not understanding the British roads were on the left rather than favoring the right lane thank you all for watching and don't patreon really appreciated the links are down below in the description until next time thank you all for watching don't forget drive safe
