in real life good afternoon everybody and welcome to the for axes livestream my name is Pete Murray I'll be your host today I'm joined today by anton stringer league designer of the civilization six new frontier expansion pack hey Anton how are you doing good how are you I'm doing well and driving our livestream today is Albert Briggs from Firaxis QA so Albert thank you very much for coming out to stream with us today no problem Pete so Anton we've got some cool stuff to show off today we're gonna show off the Ethiopia DLC this is the next entry in the new frontier pass our second DLC this summer and we've got a bunch of cool stuff to show up right we've got Ethiopia led by men alike the second we've got some secret society stuff should be pretty good yeah lots of fun things to show today okay well let's go ahead and we're gonna jump into the game real quick and Albert you want to kind of walk us through where we are in the game and what you've been doing as Ethiopia so we are in the late industrial industrial or I'm sorry I'm sorry we're in the late Renaissance area okay and I've been playing as Ethiopia focusing a lot on faith-based wonders and trying to get as much faith as possible yep that's a good strategy yeah and it looks like you have a really nice like nestled start area there with your capital addis ababa and you have quite a few Hill tiles which works on the Ethiopia's bonuses so what is kind of Ethier's Ethiopia's specialization I know a lot of people who are watching have seen the first look at sauna but this is about a sieve that's gonna take some faith and do some interesting things with it right yeah yeah so Ethiopia is very synergistic bonuses are about getting a lot of faith and using it not just for religion but for other things as well so that starts with the ask a might legacy sieve ability which is that they will generate extra faith from international trade routes and they'll also get faith from improved resources in their cities that ability also allows them to use that faith to purchase archaeology museums and archaeologists so a sort of common theme with Ethiopia as I mentioned is using faith to not just do religion but other things you could with that bonus transfer it into a cultural victory for example and then menelik ii his council of ministers ability allows any cities that are founded on the hills which albert has quite a few already to convert 15% of their faith per turn into science and culture so again it's a way to sort of leverage very big faith you know really good holy sites and stuff like that into other areas of the game so that's really cool it also gives you a combat bonus on hills and that doesn't have to even be in your own territory so even if you're off you know off using your Roman cavalry to raid somewhere as we'll see shortly the hill bonus will come into play oh cool so Albert actually I'm gonna get you to toggle on your tile yields real quick so we can check in to see how Ethiopia is doing and I noticed that you've got some some of the rock hewn churches up Anton you wanna tell us a little bit about what Ethiopia's special tile improvement does let's zoom into that one that's by dire dawa up there in the left kind of near in the center of your screen Albert yeah so he's got some nestled in really good locations around that mountain range so yeah as you can see it's a +6 faith which is great and what what The Rock you in church does is gives one inherent faith and then an extra faith for every hill or mountain that's adjacent later in the game that converts into tourism which is really nice and they have a little bit of protection from natural disasters if you're playing any gathering store or expansion they can't be placed next to each other so they're kind of like other improvements like the chateau and that way but they're quite powerful and yeah and again it feeds into depending on which city has ownership of the tile it feeds into that you know like 15% conversion into science and culture as well which is quite nice very good all right so um Albert you've got a pretty good set up here a good start going to things what is your plan what are you going to do next in this game that we're looking at right here so my plan currently is I've pretty much set up a nice faith economy at this point in the game so I'm just trying to accumulate yeah almost a thousand congratulations trying to get as much as possible and then later on and my secret society will come into play and maybe I'll be able to flip ku mana below it yeah it looks like you've got a good spot for it so looks like you've got two of the Oromo cavalry there let's uh let's take a look at those real quick so Anton you said part of Ethiopia's bonus is that they fight well on hills and the aroma cavalry really kind of feeds into that right there even better at it right yeah so part of the aroma Cavalry's bonus is that they get free movement over Hill tiles so that you know not only do they move better over hills but like all Ethiopian units they get a better combat bonus and Hills and they also get to see further that's not really coming into play right here because we already see into Symone bolivars territory there but they make really great Scouts they can see danger coming etc and this ties into a lot of what mental like ii was all about was you know sort of pushing back colonialism and there's this famous military battle where a Roma cavalry played a huge pivotal role and they're very important part of Ethiopian history so yeah very very cool we have a question from chat do the bonuses from rocking churches stack with the mountains or mountains don't have a you know per se but do they do they help the yields do mountains help the yields of the rockin churches yeah maybe I wasn't super clear and explaining it so the way it works is that the rock hewn church itself gets +1 faith for every adjacent mountain so the mountain itself doesn't get better yields because normally unless you're like playing Inca or something you can't work the mountains but it's it's kind of similar to districts right so like just like holy sites get so much Jason see bones from mountains rocking Church will get +1 faith for everyone adjacent mountain or Hill so like if we dig into that that for faith 1 right there they got two mountains to the north a hill to the left and it has one inherent face so that that adds up to 4 okay well let's go ahead and we'll continue to kind of unfold the situation here you've got your warrior amongst looks like there did you get those as part of your religion or did you oh you got those from the Wonder yeah cool nice so some extra military force to our faith yeah yeah so FeO Pia is quite nice you know you it's nice to found a religion and be able to pump faith even more and it looks like you have founded your own religion I can't see exactly where your holy city is but it looks like it's in the North there it's very nestled and protected religion which is quite nice pretty insulated from missionaries and whatnot you've also got one of those magic base in campus sites in dire dawa I guess if you want to expand later on you could drop a really great science district right now right in the creek oh yeah right yeah yeah yeah yeah you could put a campus there unfortunate you already have a holy site there but yeah and then over to the West you have Rapa Nui as the city-state which if you take it over maybe you could you could plot something there but Rapa Nui might be nice to have it as a yeah yeah it would be good to have um but with this can we pull up your the religion that you've built up because I know for this you've actually made some conscious choices with how you're gonna play the secret societies it will talk about in half so you specifically took reliquaries and you did that because of the secret society that you followed right so which secret society Albert did you did you subscribe to so i subscribed to the void singer secret society hey all right so tell us about the void singers yeah so the secret societies in general just so everyone knows it is another of these gameplay modes so like apocalypse mode and when you're setting up a game you can choose do I want to play it with secret societies or without you can choose either way if you want to have a really crazy game then you could have you know secret societies and apocalypse mode at the same time so yeah so the secret societies mode if it's on there are four secret societies and one of them is the Floyd singers there are two different ways to discover them you can discover them for yourself and make first contact by exploring tribal villages early in the game or if it's later in the game and you have enough diplomatic visibility on another player that's already joined then you can discover them that way but what their gameplay is about is their this sort of like dark cults that likes to worship old gods so you know it's fine yeah it's great you know their icon might give you a little sense of like the flavor of what they're all about but in terms of gameplay they are very much kind of like Ethiopia about building up lots of faith and using it to do non-religious things so the initiation bonus which you start out with in the ancient era when you first join up allows you construct the old god obelisk building a powerful replacement for the monument and you can actually see on Albert's game he does have a lot of creepy old God obelisks in his cities instead of monuments oh yeah right there an axon there's the the green glorious fire of the void singers and what makes these old godless special is that in addition to the culture and loyalty bonuses that monuments normally have they gave you +4 faith and they also have it great work slot that can hold anything including as we'll see later these special relics of the void that only the void singers can get access to nice so we'll be able to take advantage of that in a little bit all right so let's let's continue to press on here so as we continue to ship our forces down we're we're near the end of the Renaissance era and we're getting ready to shift into industrial and at that point Albert is that one will be able to kind of get the next the next promotion for our our void singer governor yes okay and Anton these governors that come with the secret societies they don't have to be assigned to a specific city right there's sort of Empire wide in the way that they affect you correct yeah so yeah the secret society is linked to a governor effect and they have this sort of shadowy personality but they don't mean to be assigned to a city so that makes them a lot more powerful than normal governors because a their bonuses aren't specific to a city they kind of apply for your entire civilization so once you unlock the old ghan table so you can build it in any of your cities the other nice thing is that they're immune to spy shenanigans so if you have you know spy enemy spies running around trying to neutralize your governors in your cities they can kick them out and kind of put them out of commission for a while but other than that you know like because the governors for secret societies are sort of off the map in that way they are immune to that nice we did have a question which was what happens with the unique society buildings when they conflict with the unique building of the civilization so right now yeah so the intent is that you can have these secret society building is sort of the ultimate over right right so depending on the society you're going for and the civilization you're playing as the secret society thing will sort of like ultimately Trump whatever normal unique building that you have so if you're playing for example the Hermetic order and you have a new unlock the alchemical society you that would sort of take the place of the madrasah that arabia has um and how that works mechanically is that once you unlock it you get sort of like a free upgrade for any of your buildings so if you have madrasahs or if you have universities they will instantly become alchemical societies for free and then in your build list only the alchemical society will be available so yeah it is sort of like a bit of a conflict and it there is there is some strategizing around which see if you're playing as and what secret society you want to sign up for so Albert here because he's playing as Ethiopia which has you know a lot of really great faith generation bonus ISM is already able to leverage faith into other game systems the void singers are a really great synergistic choice because that increases the faith generation with things like the old God obelisk and it also allows him to use faith to purchase the cultists units that are coming up in the industrial era yep and we do it or remind everybody that the secret the secret societies are the kind of game mode update that is coming with this next DLC so if you have ordered this season or if you've ordered the new frontier pass or you've ordered Ethiopia you will have access to the secret societies and you can toggle these on and off and they can be used with things like the apocalypse mode from from previous so from last month last two months so if you want to have both cultists and soothsayers god help you alright but this also has a new district so we've got the diplomatic order here so you want to tell us about this a little bit absolutely yeah so the diplomatic order is a new district it is not tied to the secret societies game-mode or to playing as Ethiopia anybody that buys the eat this Ethiopia DLC or has the new frontier pass will unlock the diplomatic order so it's available even if you're only playing the base game but what it does is it's a powerful diplomatic district that you can only have one of in your Empire and it holds two buildings the first ones the consulate and the second one which Albert's about to build here is the Chancery and what it's about kind of early on is you know there's this mechanic of sending delegations and embassies to other players and it sort of starts off the right foot for diplomatic relations but it didn't have a lot of like economic gameplay to it so we wanted to have the base diplomatic Court or district reward culture for each of these delegations that you've set and we sort of like the art team and a lot of fun representing that with like the little flags in the middle of the district there and the buildings as you level them up and you build the consulate and then the Chancery also start to get into some espionage territory because diplomacy and espionage are sort of very closely linked in history and and also in our civilization 6-game so what it does is you'll also get some inherent defence for districts that are near the diplomatic quarter and any of your cities that have encampments and then with the Chancellor you with Albert's working on right now you'll actually get science bonus for each enemy spy that you catch in your territory or killing guys so it's a nice sort of like counter to if someone's really you know chasing after you at spies now the diplomatic quarter is pretty strong so you can only build one for Empire per Empire right it's like the like so it's similar to the yeah the government Plaza which is only in rise and fall or later yeah it's somewhere that but again it's available for everybody in the babe you know going back to the base game very good all right so people have been asking if if I've joined a secret society and then I come across another secret society and then I decide I want to join with them can I do that and the answer is no once you pick a secret society you're in that forever yeah yeah so you can keep discovering them and there is some gameplay benefit to that because as like so Albert's the void singers here but if we go and we visit like if we go over like we're playing I should take a brief detour to talk about who are playing with to because we're also playing not only with Simone Bolivar but with our alternate personas for Teddy and Kathryn so as Albert discovers different secret societies even though he's already pledged himself to the void singers and that sort of like a permanent choice discovering for example the Hermetic order lets you see what other leaders are pledged to that hermetic order so you can kind of get a peek at what other leaders bonuses might be so yeah well let's uh when we finished celebrating our advancements through time here let's take a look at Rough Rider teddy so for those of you who have purchased the new frontier pass we told you you're gonna get to persona packs Rough Rider teddy and magnificence Katherine they're actually coming out tomorrow with with the release of this DLC and here's Rough Rider teddy so Anton tell us about how we're treating Teddy Roosevelt now that you that for people who have the persona packs we're kind of splitting him into two Teddy's yeah teddy is I mean like many of our leaders Teddy has a very interesting history in a very annual multifaceted personality and you know when we have him in the base game we really liked his idea of you know like the Rough Rider unit and we had him dressed up in a nice suit and tie very presidential but you know we looking back in his history and looking at some photographs of him early on like it was really cool to see him in his Rough Rider costume on horseback and so we thought that'd be a really cool alternate persona for him as an extra bonus for people with the new frontier pass and so what we've done here is we've had him dressed up as a rough rider himself and we've given this new persona of Teddy a lot of the old bonuses so he so this rough rider teddy is the one that gets the Rough Rider unit and he also has a little bit different mechanics around how he uses city states and then what we've done with the old suit and tie more conservative Teddy is he's the conservationist teddy so he has a lot of brand new gameplay associated with him and that's tied to things like national parks and a lot of parts of his sort of like you know historical you know legacy from when he was president in the US if you don't have the new frontier pass and you don't have the persona packs you'll still get the same old teddy that you've known and loved and been able to play with so far so they'll get a second time with Rough Rider today yeah exactly I do notice that he is a member of the Owls of Minerva so you could Society so he has not in the same secret society that we are in he is not and because he's an AI player and that's the case he's gonna like us a little bit less which we see is sort of like an unfriendly modifier there so yeah the Isles Oh Minerva are about spies and sp and governments they get a lot of free policy slots as they level up so yeah that that could be particularly good for teddy especially because one of their early benefits is a diplomatic policy slot and with America's civil 'ti that will convert into a wild card which is quite nice for him that's pretty cool all right let's take a look at magnificence Catherine she's the other persona available she's pretty cool and she is all about getting those luxury resources in doing cool things with them indeed yeah so this again like looking back at Catherine de Medicis history we had represented her as the so-called black queen with dressed dressed in mourning attire for the base game but we wanted a you know to visit a more fun kind of colorful part of her personality for this alternate persona so this is the magnificence Catherine and this kind of refers back to parts of her history where she threw these grand elegant balls and so how we represent that in game play is that she gets extra bonuses from duplicate luxury resources not just the first one and that sort of ultimately expressed with this city project that she can do it will sort of get even more bonuses based on how many excess copies of luxuries she has and we can also see she's a member of the void singers like us so we might be we might be buddies in this game well we'll talk about more about how you can use the the secret societies with other civilizations and other leaders as we're going through all along but let's let's jump back into this so if we were playing against men alack people have wanted to know a little bit more information about his agenda can you tell us kind of what he's trying to do when he's playing again for sure so mental ex leader ability I mentioned is all about hills so its founding cities on hills will convert your faith into other yields and units that are fighting on hills with a combat strength and his historical agenda reflects that it's called ethiopian highlands so the AI behavior is to focus on building cities on the hills tiles as you might expect that's quite advantageous he will like civilizations that build cities away from hill tiles because he sort of sees the hills as sort of his territory and but if you do start building on Hills then he's not gonna like that so that's what his historical agenda is about it's tied to the sort of hills terrain and whether your cities are on it or not gotcha all right so Albert where are we in the game talk us through what we're what we're about to get back into so we do enter to the industrial era and I have unlocked the next level of my secret society nutzy let's go ahead and we'll promote our governor then and okay tell us about tell us about what's going to happen in our nation yes so what this lets us do is unlock the cultist unit its union its purchase with faith uses charges to reduce loyalty in foreign cities and generate as I said those relics of the void a quick aside on sort of how these governor promotions work to we thought it'd be fun to preserve some of the mystery so if you don't want spoilers maybe don't look at the promotions just yet but yeah so there's some really fun kind of smoke effects in the UI and stuff like that each of the societies has you know it will unlock a new promotion based on the game error that you're in so ancient era the medieval era then industrial era which is just now and then the final one is in the atomic era and they have this progression that from initiation all the way up to master plan if you are super curious and you want to strategize all the promotions are visible in the civil appeal so especially if you're like you know you're playing a civilization like Arabian you want to make sure like hey I really like my boat Raza I want to keep madrasahs then you can you know see that the Hermetic order is the one that gets a replacement and sort of plan it all out that way gotcha well we really do want to get our hands on those cultists so let's go ahead and we're gonna start purchasing those with those you know tens of thousands of faith points that we have so a couple things about these like every other religious unit they've got charges associated with them so they did not you know every time they use a charge it reduces the loyalty of an enemy city but was that correct they cost for goal to turn they do have a lot of maintenance yeah so you'll see as Albert's purchasing them they do have an escalating faith cost but you know he's got tons of faith on the bank so we didn't because you know we did a lot of play testing around cultists and tuning up their numbers about how much faith exactly do they chip away at enemy cities and things like that and one of the sort of determinations we made during play testing was having a huge standing army have calls us just like ready to go with the drop the Hat was quite powerful so you wanted to have a drawback to that strategy so they do have a pretty steep maintenance cost they're meant to sort of like be trained and go out on the battlefield as soon as possible and one of the advantages to that or one of the you know their active ability that's really fun is to chip away at the loyalty of a city it can potentially cause it to become a free city which you can then take over with your own loyalty or with military force but really like the sort of like best long-term benefit of the cultists are these relics of the void so whenever they perish whether it's from using up all of their charges or from getting squished by an enemy military unit either way it's a win-win for them they sacrifice themselves so they're older god and they are happy and they give you a relic of the void which gives you some faith and some tourism and especially with Albert's early reliquaries pick will be quite nice for his sort of like long-term culture victory strategy so you can think of them as like you know they're about going out and causing chaos and disorder if you get a free city out of it that's great but even if you don't you know it's still good you got some relics yeah and then Albert actually you had it part of the advantage of working with the QA team is they think of the things that you I generally don't think of as a oh yeah I'll say not elite level so player but Albert you were pointing out these the cultists actually move around as as a support unit technically their support unit and so you were telling me it is possible to kind of protect your cities by by using support units as blockers correct yeah so like for example weren't we're heading towards um Grand Columbia there but if he I think he has some comandante a generals and some other support units some other maybe even military units that could sort of like try to block the way if he sees what's coming right well we'll start we're gonna very slowly start marching these down and then we've had fun because we've been talking about civilizations that could make good use of you know how shall we say encouraging people to explore the freer side of their their existence as Free Cities so you could use somebody like a like eleanor of aquitaine to kind of yeah pop she's eight yeah she's another great pairing with the void singers because her ability of you know just causing negative loyalty pressure through great works you know a relics are great works no I believe those still apply I haven't played with that particular combination myself but B yeah you just like with cultist adding to the strength of all that it could be quite a fun game to play so Albert you were able to move that cultist over the border correct I mean you didn't have to declare war to get him in there so that's interesting is this similar to how religious units work where you can sort of you have free reign to move into other people's territory but you're also putting yourself at risk because you could get squished don't stuff like that on the other hand free relic yes if you squish me strike me down I'll only get stronger yeah so there's a whole bunch of relics of the void that you guys have created right about how many are in there I believe there are about thirty in the game so we picked this number so that you know there'd be enough variety we have a couple different art pieces to represent them and a lot of different names to represent them Oh Simon Bolivar to us we're not actually moving our military in Havana's just hanging out on the border yeah this is for possibly taking this free city if we manage to flip it yes yeah it's a it's a pre-emptive peacekeeping force that's uh yeah in the event you can't control the city will be happy to to help you with that holy crow look at that movement that's awesome for the Oromo cavalry that's really cool yeah ignoring hills and having a lot of roads there too definitely helps so a bunch of people have been asking is this out now no it's actually coming out tomorrow it's coming out tomorrow at her scheduled to go live at noon Eastern and I believe that is math is hard 5:00 p.m. British time and yep yeah and could we call out this is earlier than a lot of our and there are a lot of previous releases I think previously we've gone at midnight Eastern Time so for those of you that are you know like and your day on Thursday and wanting something to do after the work day or whatever it is this will be available then so you know food up your steam and or windows in the form you're playing on and go ahead and you know look forward to playing this in less than 24 hours in the stainless sirens song of the void as you reach out and make touch with ruinous powers Welling and unknowable dimensions beyond the comprehension of normal minds sorry what were you talking about okay so teddy is is literally kind of giving us a backhanded compliment with we've done something with it it's funny that that Bulevar actually likes us because we're about to you know we've just stolen sooo serenity of Rapa Nui from him and now we're going to try to flip from Jana on him that's gonna be fun as well - oh that's frustrating there's a car bearing down on barding there so so it's what are some of the other secret societies we talked a little bit about them so al zaman over there they're a spying based one and you said they get they get extra policy slots yeah so Alison Minerva R I kind of pictured them as the sort of you know shadowy figures whispering in the ears of governments or you know corporations and stuff like that I mean these were a lot of fun to just sort of like pick fun fanciful conspiracy theory type stuff but this secret society they are about you know empowering governments trade routes and spies so there are a little bit their passives their bonuses are a little bit more on the passive side than other societies they only get one unique unlock which is the gilded fault no so in the medieval era they get a bank replacement and the gilded fault in addition to all the bank stuff it provides its gold adjacency bonus of the commercial hub as culture so it does a little conversion there it gives you an extra trade route capacity if it's in a city that has a harbor so that's the unique unlock that they get but at level 1 and level 3 they get an extra policy slot which we know is quite powerful and I was misremembering I'm actually it's not a diplomatic policy thought that was an earlier iteration that was not quite as they actually get an economic policy slot at governor level one so as early as the ancient era which is quite nice yeah in the industrial they get an extra wild card extra spy capacity and their counter spies in addition to you know catching enemy spies will give some loyalty and amenities to the city that they're protecting even if they're not on the counter spy mission as long as they're sort of like in your territory and then at the final master plan level on the atomic era offensive spy missions we'll give you some of the gold faith culture and science of the targeted city in addition to all their other effects you could go disrupt rocketry somewhere and then you'll get some other yields as part of it as well and you'll also earn some gold interest based on the gold that's sort of like in your in your Treasury so they're quite powerful yeah and like the way we like to think of and balance these you know each package of secret society bonuses you know there's four levels and similarly civilizations gonna have four different types of bonuses you like Ethiopia has its leader unique ability its Savini Cabella t its unique infrastructure the rocking church and its unique unit which is the Oromo cavalry so we try to think of secret societies kind of in the same way where they have for quite powerful bonuses you don't have them all right away but they sort of unlock over the course of the game and in terms of strength we did want to kind of experiment because it's a mode because it is more fanciful hey what if the bonuses of a secret society defined your civilization and your play style while this mode is active almost as much as your civilization itself and it's AMA see you know opinions of other AI leaders you know will reflect that as well they will you know be really buddy-buddy if you're in the same society and they will be suspicious if you are not when will your monuments or your banks turn into your secret societies unique building when you when you unlock them when you get to that appropriate level okay so all of our monuments immediately turn dark and glowy green fire yeah so if you're places oh man you like you know you conquer half the world and you have like 20 cities with 23 monuments and then you're like oh what's this void singer thing I haven't heard about that before and you just like join it really late in the game and you people call obelisk and like industrial error because you're really behind boom yeah now you got old got obelisks everywhere nice full free nice that's fantastic and somebody had asked if you can play multiplayer if some people have secret societies and some people don't know all the players in the multiplayer game will need to have that in order to use that ability so there you go alright so it looks like looks like the cultists trying to positions and yeah trying to really get those cultists in position around the city Albert so the exhibit is the city's gone for us you know it's a low population it's on it's on the fringes of grind calling me as Empire so it's not gonna have as much loyalty strength return as some of the workhorse of these the disadvantage is you know you still do you know the cultists only do 10 oil to damage return and you know so you might need like a partial or a full surround now he's got four cultists yeah surrounding it there so yeah I forgot to the loyalty lens looks like perfect 8.7 per turn and each charge will do 10 damage so basically we got to do one charge just to kind of keep pace and then frame or charges will bring it down by 30 or so so yeah and another thing about the void singers is once you get to the atomic era and you get that final master plan bonus what that does is it unlocks a city project for your cities and once the project is complete it will increase the amount of loyalty damage that all of your calls us to do by 2 so instead of 10 it'll go up to 12 and then I'll go up to 14 12 to 16 and it'll cap out at 30 so it's late game you know it takes a lot of investment to make it work but if you are able to do it it makes your cultists particularly powerful I bring it down cities in the late game and while it's active it's sort of like converts production into faith which you know is useful for buying more cultists and stuff like that mm-hmm and on somebody's asked how the diplomatic quarter buildings affect yields from the city-state do you do you remember how that works off him right so the way that works is that before we had you know the the sort of second and third level of city-state envoy bonuses were yeah if we go to the city-state tab we could we can see that in action so yeah the the second-level envoy bonus will give culture for the buildings but it will also apply to the consulate building so the diplomatic quarter is sort of like is a supercharged hub of getting receiving bonuses from all different types of cities so like the culture one its art museum archaeological museum concept quitting but if we go over to the militaristic city-state right below that you know the consulate building is also recipient of debt plus to production towards units so it's sort of like the wild card recipient of a lot of envoy bonuses the reason we likes this is because you know the the emphasis on having a number of buildings up spread all the way across your empire and like the more archaeology museums in the more you know future square districts you had the better your city-state bonuses were we thought that balance was a little bit off so we took this opportunity to again if you have this DLC and if this diplomatic corridor district is in the game it's sort of like a what folks in a five or even early sift six we'll remember sort of like a wide versus tall that sort of thing so the diplomatic quarter is sort of like a more of a tall strategy where like if you really invest in this powerful to climatic quarter you unlock the you know the civics that will allow you to build those buildings it becomes this powerhouse of city state bonuses not sure okay so we've been chipping away slowly at the the loyalty of come on on there which is that which is fantastic we'll continue to do some maintenance on this side this is this is fun I'm hoping that it will get a chance to see some of the relics of the void as we as we continue to yeah our hour later more fun coming up with some of the names there's some there's some fun Easter eggs in there for sure baby yeah we were yeah we were doing the test for the live stream we were be relaxing at them as well too with some some good choices okay come join us in the for yeah exactly yeah yeah all right one more turn one more turn and we'll be able to - I know it's gonna be fantastic so Alberto actually we've have not mentioned one of the other secret societies so we talked about we've talked a lot about the void series we talked to us about the Hermetic order or we've talked a lot about the Al's of Minerva but we haven't talked about the Hermetic order once you tell us about those yes the Hermetic order is my personal favorite actually in terms of gameplay and in terms of the flavor they are these sort of like mad scientists and alchemists of the world so they have like really strange theories about where energy comes from and about how you can transmute one thing into another so what their first bonus is is I think it's particularly cool they actually unlock a unique resource there's this pseudoscience out there where you know there are people who like the energy the earth man it like converges at these different points these ley lines so what we did for the goal there's there's our first point instructions for the come on thong yeah I'll let you all figure out what that is really disturbing yes so while we're racking up relics of the void yes so the Hermetic order for their first promotion on the governor will unlock ley line resources and they are these sort of like glowing lines on the map that are generated when you know when the when the map first is generated and they give a standard adjacency bonus to all specialty districts and they will get stronger over time so like later in that romantic order they'll also get extra deals for every great person that you've earned so the Hermetic order sort of becomes around about you know like settling near lay liens constructing districts next to ley lines and really capitalizing on that part of the map and other players who have not joined this society like why are you all like going around this weird desert tile like I don't understand so it's funny if you don't see what's going on and yeah it's quite fun and they get the alchemical society University replacement which I was talking about earlier with the madrasah yep so we've just managed to completely flip the loyal to that city it should revert to being a free city this turn we also got to see some of the cool here it is artifact Wow but it looks like bolivars exerting enough pressure on it that it's probably going to be able to recapture that if we just let that be but we are now up some relics so Albert if you pull up the great works menu for a second people will be able to see those those relics are in there so yeah next year's dreams of dead names on display because of course so they'll start generating you know faith and tourism for people which is which is pretty fantastic and it's going to be that's going to be the basis that we start building on for that so Albert let's take us back into the game real quick you have your monks and you have your Oromo cavalry and you've got a knight unit ready to push into kumano but do you want to maybe we should do you want to push this on or should we kind of jump forward a little bit in time and show people how things might look by the end of the industrial era yeah I think it might be good to jump for it all of it okay so we'll take a minute and we're gonna get set up for this next save and again I want to remind people you're watching the Civilization six new frontier past stream we are playing the Ethiopia DLC that's coming out tomorrow at noon Eastern 9 a.m. Pacific 5 p.m. British time I this is inevitably the time of year where we've gone to daylight time and I can't remember where they're not your classroom is weird cuz Titan like days blur together we're all working from home and streaming from home so yes that's what the old gods tell us that's I think you've been I think the void singers have been getting to you so I'm joined by Anton stringer who is the mountain signer for the new frontier past and driving today is Albert Briggs we've got four axis is in the channel as well trying to get your questions to us and our usual driver Karl is there in chat as well - hi Karl sorry you couldn't be with us today so are we okay we're back tell us about what we've got going on now Albert so unfortunately it seems come on I was able to get walls up so I didn't have any seed units at the time but I was able to man I think this is going to go very very well that's the capital no wonder come on Oh wasn't gonna fall from our loyalty it's got a lot of pressure coming it's a I'm sure it's got a lot of loyalty on its own - like how much loyalty per turn is it making you know it solves solves loyalty $0.35 chance to the old gods that's true he does have a lot of cultists and tentacley appendages songs in in unspeakable tongues yep okay all right well let's go ahead and let's see if we can we can flip their flip their city well or at least if not flip it and make it make it not Simone's anymore all the loveless ones it's great so because this is their capital this is going to take a fair ly concerted cultic action - to get this up and running right yeah so what Albert's doing is making sure you kind of like can maintain enough of us around on the city so we can get as Max six charges in every turn because I think three and a half just to get back you know just to keep it steady then gonna keep it by the way again cuz we don't have that old God summoning or dark summoning a ritual City project that comes in the in in the atomic era yeah so we're having to make do with our 10 per charge and and and you know other processes like you know standard espionage you know loyalty reduction things like that that's true yeah spies can definitely help out and to push the needle a little bit more alongside cultists and as we mentioned before Eleanor could be quite useful in that as well yeah that's um I really want to try that I like I know we've been talking about that but now I really kind of want to want to try it no I'm on a high difficulty I just kind of want enjoy the process of funding on so um one of the things that's that's come up that people have talked about is that you know some of these abilities seem really strong but that's that's my design correct it is yeah um you know this is sort of a fun experiment for us and you know we do really value the balance of our game and we have play tested secret societies a lot I think you know we have these long email threads between you know me and the designers and Albert and Cara Lynn the rest of QA going through five or six different versions of all the bonuses of you know all 16 bonuses of the secret societies making sure that they carefully you know balanced each other that they had sort of counters that were interesting against each other that they have interesting synergies with particular civilizations and play styles but like I said earlier you know their strengths I would say you know the goal from early on was that they by the time you get the fourth promotion which again only comes in the atomic era they are you know they're the full package is roughly the same strength as a full civilizations bonuses and we thought that that would be really fun and that you know we have done systems and things in the past where the bonuses are a little bit smaller to kind of you know not disrupt too many of the other systems but secret societies is a kind of mode where if you're playing with it it does sort of take the spotlight a little bit and again that's why one of the advantages of having it as a mode is that you can try it out if you really like it you know play multiplayer with your friends with it but if you want to go back to more of a you know more of a traditional approach then you can turn it off so yeah they are stronger on the stronger side by default kind of an by design but not all the modes are like this right the apocalypse mode and this secret societies mode are quite dramatic but a lot of the modes coming up are not fantastical at all and they are designed to be kind of left on in the background and effect you know turn to turn historical traditional game games in a much more sort of like Universal way I guess so yeah I make sense so got a couple of things people have asked how do you defend against Cultus I mean you can declare war on them in which case they're not going to be grinding away at the loyalty of your cities but when they do die they're still going to be generating those those relics so you know to some extent you can't keep a good cultist down because that's gonna translate just into you know additional culture and faith right yeah I say that yeah the best defense is a good offense declaring war and making sure that the cultists don't come to your city gates also just having a strong a loyalty game is pretty strong as the capital here so like you know you can see how how much of an effort it is for us to kind of put this here we'd mentioned earlier that you can sort of like you know kind of preemptively move units in the way to try to keep keep the cultists away keeping an eye on what your neighbors are doing and what the geography is like you know who is a boy singer who's not it's a big part of it well yeah like ultimately like it you know striking down cultist does give the old gog for the relics of the point but there are only 30 of them in the game so you know like f once that reaches capacity they might not have enough slots even though they have slots with the obelisks yeah so after a while taking down cultists is really just the best way so is this it I mean Robert are we about to flip the city we look like we were down to 20 and then yep let's kick it over let's kick it over that'll be great should mark it yeah excellent I can do other charges just to get closer to really really you know drive the drive the point home as it were so we'll wait till we'll wait till the start of the next turn when the when the game does the calculation and go from there that's uh that's gonna be a lot of fun for that so which society did you say was your favorite Anton my personal favorites the Hermetic order yeah best sort of alchemists I really like the way that the ley lines change how you play the game and where you settle and where you build districts and I'm just a sucker for like a good like you know alchemical society building or Hardeen oh man there goes the capital there goes Columbia's capital we have we have taken Columbia's capital and we've turned it into a free city so that is definitely going to put a damper on bolivars ability to pursue any sort of coherent and game strategy at this point right yeah that's that's pretty rough now Albert what difficulty are you playing on so currently I'm playing on Prince difficulty right but we did this specifically so that we could set up an interesting livestream and not so that we could yeah yeah so that's something else you'll see as well I get you know obviously on Prince but yeah it's not going to put quite as much of a fight up against the cult or some things like that but no higher difficulty levels no more military a little bit more aggressive and so this sort of strategy will be a little harder to pull off yeah I mean no less enjoyable but oh for sure it's still a little harder to pull off well we've got one more secret society and if it happens that's a little bit of a bonus for you guys so is there anything else Albert any ruinous messages you wish to convey from our overlords from beyond this dimension before we proceed your next day I think I think we're good ok having sowed chaos and ruin through this world let's go ahead and we're gonna load it into a new safe where we've got some stuff going on and so we've talked about a secret society that plays with faith we've got a secret society that plays with the Columbus II we've got one that deals with science and great people and economics it's one that suggests that there might be one then has a slightly more violent focus this is true yes this is the sanguine panics and they are the most military focused of these secret societies and so very fittingly Albert started up a grand columbia game since bolivar especially with a commandant a generals early in the game can have a military focus as well so the single impact as their name might suggest is about you know blood and violence and the way this is most directly reflected is that they get access to a special vampire unit this is unlike the cultists this is a combat unit and unlike the cultists you can't train them yourself so you actually get one vampire unit for every promotion that you earn the same one pack so you get up to four so the zoom way in Albert so we can see our counts here and our count is this is beefsteak beefs we have used we have given him a custom name because as you will soon learn there is nothing in the world quite as beefy as our account here yeah so there's a brutal 58 combat strength that beefsteak has so the way that this works is that much like the city defense calculations where a city's defenses based on the sort of strongest melee unit is trained a your vampire unit base strength is based on the strongest melee unit that you've trained across your empire so that's 36 right now because Albert I believe just finished a swordsman but as the vampire sort of stays on the fringes and of combat anytime a unit next to the vampire dies it will contribute strength to the vampire permanently so we see that in the combat preview there we get I think we're getting like an extra +10 combat strength from nearby barbarians that have died near their empire right and that's similar to unit XP it's capped and Albert has already reached the cap so you can't just like farm that over and over but he's also getting in a little bit extra from other you know like major civil units that have died the other vampires so that is a whopping 58 and again this is a testament to our internal QAS prowess and also that we're playing on a lower difficulty just to kind of show off how cool these guys are so Albert tell us a little bit about this game as it has that is has it has progressed in the beginning so I started off kind of opposite to the Ethiopia game where I didn't really have I had a lot of open land and not many city-states to handle barbarians mm-hmm so I was able to get a vampire unit very early and they were able to beef themselves up a little bit and really defend my capital early game and allowed me to expand and I just happened to wander over here through my ex crossed the desert yeah that's Dever into America and I noticed that they did unfortunately did not have walls oh then of course for teddy there's nothing quite as terrifying he's watching an army led by the undead coming marching across the desert and immediately laying siege to Boston but it it looks like he's America here to you like we're playing against Teddy and not against Abraham Lincoln who might hunt vampires you know they're very vulnerable to our shenanigans yeah so vampires pretty tough you cannot combine them in cores of armies correct you're only gonna get a very small number of them over the course of the game correct you only get four you cannot train anymore and yeah they cannot form in a course or armies but what they can view which albert has done here is you know pair up with a Conte general this is like this is just the most hilarious image in my brain of like no-count beefsteak being like calm you must come mr. commandant see general we're going to go fight in the Commandant a general system horseback being like that you know I was just out causing chaos everywhere and once more blood and it's just yeah they're they're a funny Odd Couple pair but yeah the commandant a generals obviously a great pick here because he's giving +1 movement to the vampire and so combat strength as well Gran Colombia is giving some movement as well so yeah it looks like France is gonna try to impede on our conquest of America so looks like Albert we're gonna invade them back yes it's more juicy targets for us to feast on so the the the vampire is gonna sort of gain all that come out from units that die adjacent to it the vampire doesn't have to kill them they don't have to be killed by friendly units they just have to die next to the vampire correct right he just sort of like absorbs the energy from as we'll see here units that die now in this case the vampire is actually attacking into an enemy tile so I don't believe it procs the bonus where he'll get more common strength personally he's more like he'll get strength if he's sort of like conserves of strength on the sidelines of a battle and observes battle nearby so having you know friendly units die next to him or enemy and its die next to him but he's not the primary aggressor another way to do this is depending on how Frances attack goes here at all it looks like the Gopher Boston the vampire could just you know stay on the fringes of to other people fighting and just you know absorb the energy from the battle that would also work you know and as tempting as it might be to leave beefsteak here to kind of you know ask everybody if they've finished with that quirks that catapult is unguarded basically and that's a pretty pretty juicy target it'd be pretty fun to take that out oh man you know ink that's great that's great so he took six damage holy cow but damaging vampires they're like they're not invincible they're tough but they're not invincible I was gonna explain that yeah so there are some downsides to the vampires first obviously you can only have four them and you get one with each promotion so you're not gonna get your second one until like the medieval era the other downside is that they heal much less over time they're gonna have less passive healing every turn they can mitigate that by pillaging every time they pillage they get an extra 50 hit points heal so that's kind of how they can kind of keep moving on the battlefield and then they do have this sort of like limited immortality if they would die they will instead teleport with one HP back to the capital or as we'll see in a little bit to a nearby vampire castle so we only have the first initiation bonus right now and yet Albert's doing some shuffling to make sure that he can retain Boston loyalty but yeah so like but you know they will retreat with one HP if they are destroyed in one of their castles or in the capital it's sort of like driving a stake into the heart they will die permanently you cannot get them back they will also die from comments in the apocalypse mode and they can die from nuclear weapons so they're not bits they are quite sturdy overall yeah and they're gonna be around for a while too so you're gonna if you are going with the sanguine pact you're gonna get one of these guys and you're going to shepherd them lovingly as you march them across the map feasting on the corpses of your opponents if you're into that sort of thing that is an option that is available to you yeah and it takes some you know it takes some effort in is meant to really make the vampires shine as albert has demonstrated here you know playing a military game obviously where you're in combat a lot will give them those bonuses to strengthen them up obviously keeping on the frontier of military development as well because their base strength is based on let's call this melee unit so if you're behind in the science game or in you know the production game for making advanced military units they're not really gonna be that tough and they're not gonna do much good all right and like we're holding on to Boston here pretty well there was something else somebody had brought up oh so many people had asked do you need the previous DLC for the new frontier pass there are elements of the new frontier pass that do require either Gathering Storm or rise and fall and information about what the dependencies are are on Civilization comm and in some of the other things that we've talked about so make sure that you check that out if you if you have been keeping up and you do have the expansion packs you will be able to use all of the features that are there yeah the rule of thumb is that some of the modes will rely on expansion systems but all of the civilizations and all of this new content like the diplomatic order that is available even if you only have two basically as long as you buy the DLC you browse so for this Ethiopia pack Ethiopia even if you'll have the base game if you buy the pack you get Ethiopia and you also get the diplomatic corps the exception is the secret societies move again because we're making heavy use of the governor system and the loyalty system it requires that you have either rise and fall or Gathering Storm in order to play the bow okay there you go all right so how far are we we're getting near the end of the Classical era Albert how many turns do we have left I lost track oh we are we still yeah we are about to enter medieval okay two more turns okay yeah well and once we get some medieval we'll be able to unlock our next sanguine pack effect which is cool and we would do want to make sure that you guys get a chance to snap but is really I'm really kind of enjoying watching through snake front around and just teddy roosevelt's armies it's kind of amazing so we were having some fun with talking about how we were going to show off the sanguine pack and naming all of the really conquests focused Sims and you know what might be fun to show them off with so you know vampires and Macedon you know vampires in Mongolia it's this is really if you are if you are one of these conquest players this will this will work well with almost anything yeah and it's sort of like a refreshing change of pace as a as a conquest player to you know instead of focusing on sort of like the careful sort of tactical shuffling of you know armies and in generals and zone of control having you know it sort of shifts the focus to a more you know like having a few super units and really make trying to make sure that everything feeds into that part of the strategy so yeah it kind of kind of like the void singers do for the religion game it's sort of like you know freshens the approach that you might take for a for a conquest or domination oh yeah so feel bad because by taking that farm there yeah he pillaged the maze and continues like oh please oh you're so mean to him you're so mean oh Boston just reverted to becoming a free city maybe that's not the end of the world yeah that's gonna go back to America and unless we take sure Houston first of all see I was gonna say okay and now in the medieval era and it's gonna be time to promote our governor from the sanguine pact which will be kind of cool because we'll get to show off their next promotion yeah so second promotion so we get a second vampire unit and we get to start constructing vampire castles and then we get a little preview of an the indoctrination thing that'll come later there are some passive combat benefits that vampires will get let's actually let's actually go to our new vampire unit in our capital because you can actually see we've just like for rock bands how they have a random names there's a random there's a random name generator for vampires as well - toad lady portare who you are that's like that's that's crazy I love it I love it there's so many yeah awesome it's almost we pick one we can make one of our shiny news yeah so let's uh let's see how this vampire castle thing works I'm curious to find out it looks like we're gonna have to wait until next turn that's okay cuz beef steak is gonna run around then he's gonna free inquiry sure I inquire what you tasted like oh yeah science to keep on the on the frontier of you know he's gonna tell about ourselves right that base military strength stays high that's awesome I'm gonna shoot me with arrows how cute arrows how quaint all right it will World Congress to start it but we'll throw some some random things in there yeah we want to get back to the actions yeah yeah yeah diplomacy very important clearly clearly not what we're focusing on right now not at this game no no no let's go back to Voltaire here and we're gonna it might be yeah maybe cuz you're on some marshes there and you can oh yeah right here [Music] let's see if beef steak is able yeah so just what while Albert's finding like the right place for to place a castle because it's very important I'll sort of explain what they do so you get as many castles as you have vampires so now that we're in the medieval era and we've unlocked the second promotion we can have up to two castles just like we have up to two vampires and when we place one it will sort of absorb the tile yields from all the tiles that are Jason and that is how many yields that the castle is worth so sort of like sucks up all the things from around it it's quite cool and the cherry on top is that even if you build the castle outside your territory which you might want to do for no respawning reasons the yield of the vampyre castle always goes to your capital so you know I think in one of the earlier play tests Albert had built it right up to the north of Boston there because there are some good deals and was closed as a respawn area for for the vampires which was quite nice so yeah it's quite cool oh yeah it looks like that is the spot we can probably a good spot that's a neutral territory and yeah let's uh let's go back and go back over to that and then toggle on tile yield so we can see just how great this this vampire castle is boom so it's got four productions so a bunch of food because of everything that's around it and if those are improved tiles that will also get the new shields from that so that is not just it doesn't just pull it on the base yields its it's the sum of all of the yields of the tiles around it yeah yeah and this was um this is actually a really good example of how important play testing is to our process because initially you know we we thought hey the segment pack should be a military focused secret society and it was and it was great we had the vampires working and everything but Albert and Carl and the rest of our QA we're like well you know like if you're not at war constantly with everybody which even if you're going for a domination playstyle isn't normally the case you know it's really tough because compared to the other societies there's not really a lot of economic benefits so having this idea of a vampire castle that had a military focus but also allowed for some economic powers as well was a really nice iteration that made the society as a whole so can you pillage this castle I mean these clearly if you come across one of these and you are not playing the sanguine packed I recommend you take it down because yet not only is it giving yields but once you reach the atomic era the final promotion of the single impact allows the player to teleport for like a year lifts between vampire castles so that's way to do you know like turn into bats and then like you know teleport across the map which is quite crazy so yeah so and then if you again you can only have four so if you want to like you know reshuffle be like I don't really want this one anymore I'll undo that one instead you got a go and like remove it manually so what do you get if you pillage of vampire Castle uh you know I actually do not remember I think it's probably gold its it's not like extra juicy compared to other improvements I think but it's more about preventing bad things from happening than it is for like getting something good for pillaging at yourself nice nice alright well that is the sanguine pact and with that we've shown off or we've given you a lot of information about the secret societies you guys have had a chance to see Ethiopia in action we've had a lot of fun with the stream today I want to thank Anton and thank Albert for taking
