sory or wait to the end to hear more hello and welcome to feature history featuring not history but news because in this video I am going to be covering the Kashmir conflict one of the world's current longest-running conflicts and the thing about long-running conflicts is as offered as much if not more history to it then there is current developments so while this topic isn't very likely to come up in your schoolwork it will come up on your telly and you could argue that is a whole lot more important to know about so in the interest of your foreign affairs trivia join me as we metaphorically travel to the princely Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir the Kashmir Valley should be known for radiating beauty and jaw-dropping views but instead the area is most well known for its long history of violence that has run for over seven decades and stolen the lives of almost 60,000 people instead of hosting Taurus Kashmir has been hosting an endless conflict between India Pakistan so people and a little bit of China for extra spice now you could say the entire conflict is just border skirmish after Boras garnish battling to claim over Kashmir's natural resources and access to the vital Indus River but you'd only be half right because the other half of the story is a political and social one and understanding the political and social history could take you back to the dawn of time but for this video it'll take us back to 1845 the British East India Company had been expanding its control over the Indian subcontinent for several hundred years at that point and in the mid 19th century clash with the sikh empire to the north-west after their first war the region of Kashmir was seized in 1858 being cooperated with the rest of India into the British Raj the British Raj then weathered until the end of the Second World War where amongst many other changes to the British Empire the subcontinent would be freed from the British administration the Raj was split partitioned along the religious divides of India the subcontinent would have its bulk claimed by both the dominions of India and Pakistan between the two dominions were 650 princely states they could choose independence or join either Dominion many states would join the dominions in accordance to their own religious demographics Hindus and Sikhs to India Muslims to Pakistan if this sounds aren't organized and very sudden that's because it was the partition of India was chaos a million would die and 15 million were displaced in a time of rampant atrocities and confusion it was in this situation the state of Jammu and Kashmir remained independent the state held a majority Muslim population but with the sizable Sikh and Hindu minority and the Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh it was decided the region would fall to neither Dominion however the tribesmen of Pakistan viewed this as a blatant oppression of the wishes of the valleys muslims and began to swarm the west of the state quickly overpowering harry singh's tiny personal forces but the 22nd of october 1947 the tribesmen had met the capital city of Srinagar and Harry Singh fled to India to request military assistance he would be made to sign the Instrument of Accession on the 27th admitting Kashmir into the Dominion of India and in return receiving the military defence of its army or rather turning Kashmir into the new frontline of a war between Pakistan and India Pakistan claimed Kashmir on cultural grounds India claimed it on legal the British would take the view that the Pakistani militias Neer's be repelled from Kashmir and the question of Kashmir's nationality would be left to its people but neither Pakistan or India planned on that the indo-pakistani war lasted from 1947 to 1948 claiming thousands of lives the war would come to a close entering night 49 with a UN ceasefire leaving 1/3 of Kashmir in Pakistan's control and the rest under India the condition was that Kashmir would soon receive its plebiscite to vote on which nation to join India however holding a majority of the state repute attempt after attempt for the Kashmir is to halt a true free plebiscite instead India believe the state could just be split between the two nations Pakistan refused the plebiscite must be honored because of course they reckon they'd win it and so began a ruthless cycle of political head-butting protests human right violations oppression and conflict over a decade had passed since the partition but much of its consequences remained a slow civilian war silently waged in Kashmir most noticeable in India's administered region but definitely present in Pakistan as well in 1962 India would come under attack from the growing Maoist Chinese power we decided to also throw a bear happened to Kashmir when they seized our sea uninhabited region of oxygen mostly as a middle finger for India's stance on Tibet but that's getting into a whole other topic seeing weakness Pakistan attempted to spark resistance in indian-administered Kashmir leading to a second indo-pakistani war India quickly began to push Pakistan back before both the US and Soviet Union pressured them to reinforce the ceasefire line and end the war in only 17 days in the wake of the 1965 war Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan's president ayob Khan would sign the Tashkent declaration both sides remove their forces from Kashmir and what seemed to finally be a true attempt to cooperate and end the tension in the state however the claims on Kashmir its damage and his grievances all remained unresolved after declaration a third war was a matter of when not if and when was answered in 1971 in that year East Pakistan was an extreme turmoil faced with a conflict between independence fighters and the Pakistani military India and Pakistan's already fragile relationship took a nosedive when India joined the war and supported the rebels East Pakistan was replace with the independent Bangladesh and the two nations bad blood got bad Pakistan in India's rivalry was a constant cycle blowing up into war bombing each other to bits intervention peace talks failure to deliver on their promises and doing it all over again it was tragically predictable 1972 so the Shimla agreement made to reinforce the promises of the Tashkent declaration but just like the original treaty failed this one did too there was a generation of Kashmiris that had grown up only knowing this endless conflict all they knew was the oppression the harassment the kidnappings are tortured the executions in 1987 indian-administered Kashmir was subject to a notoriously rigged election and what little trust Kashmir is had in the Indian government was gone protests that derives and rise led to violence very quickly Indian troops reinforced Kashmir to quell rebellion and it wasn't pretty after these events the conflict in Kashmir was less between India and Pakistan in more between security forces and insurgency it was entering a new phase more violent and more complicated and a more ugly one in 1989 the Muslim majority kashmir valley was witnessed to a new insurgency against Indian administration the insurgency lasted well it's still going today thousands have been killed as a result and India's response to the insurgency has just consisted of ramping up security forces and cracking down on militants hundreds of cases of murders and brutality have been recorded whilst thousands people have just completely disappeared hundreds more are killed each year in human right violations are aplenty Kashmir has been militarized for several generations and any change does not seem to be coming whether the security forces are encountering shootouts with militants or the weekly sandbars protests it's too easy for the government to simply dismiss sees as Pakistani backed fronts for the overall border conflict but needs the explanation often isn't the correct one skirmishes between the two powers are not a rare occurrence on the line of control in 1999 with India and Pakistan nuclear countries at that point Ward over the Kargil district India won that fight but certainly not the war the closest thing to a resolution in recent memory was in 2004 negotiations for demilitarization and peace were held for year after year up until the Mumbai attacks in 2008 a Pakistani backed terror cell shot and bombed one of India's most densely populated cities killing a hundred and seventy four people and in India and Pakistan's relations back to the 80s things have only continued to worsen in recent history in 2016 the death of rebel commander and online viral success Bertrand awanee led to some of the worst rioting in years to this very day both India and Pakistan assert their territorial claims over Kashmir and skirmishes are all too common one only happened in several months before this video the region of Kashmir is populated with many diverse cultures and religions in the prospect of India and Pakistan establishing peace in Kashmir is unlikely but the prospect of a nuclear war between the two countries isn't very likely either instead as it currently sits it seems the cycle is only doomed to repeat again and again continuing to damage and worsen the lives of Kashmir ease and their Kashmir and so the same continues to ring true those that don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it and if you want to you know it something will pique your curiosity I'd like to thank the patrons the sponsor and everyone for your patience with my videos lately I've been working on and off on a big project I like to bring to the channel hopefully this year and it's not strictly history related so keep your eyes out for that at some point at some time and until next time
