the new trailblazer league was recently released by jagex allowing for a totally unique old-school experience complete tasks unlock new areas and relics which further help you on your own unique journey now i wanted to jump on the youtube bandwagon because i really like the look of the game mode i mean i really like the look of the game mode but in this game you either have to be the best [ __ ] me i'm so far behind or you have to be first now my girlfriend will be able to tell you i'm pretty good at finishing first but i think i cannot let the ship sail with this one lance so there i was running the drainer rooftop agility course 30 times to complete a task when all of a sudden i stopped is this even a task i mean people in the game mode told me to do it but i didn't actually check if it was a task luckily it was but that got me thinking with the sheer amount of tasks in this trailblazer league and the sheer randomness of them if i told someone to do something completely ridiculous with the excuse of it's just a task bro how much could i get away with i decided i'd start off small and progressively get more and more ridiculous depending on if people fell for it which brings us to my first task idea the great grain robbery last you wanna green you know what i mean the plan was to announce at the drain of willows if anyone had done the grain task i'll explain there was a task that would involve picking all the grain from the nearby field before it respawns and requires multiple participants hopefully like the fishing spot opposite the willows they'd take the bait right i'm gonna test the waters here mate this if this doesn't work then i don't think this video is gonna work out or not if i can't even just swindle some you know people at willows then what can i do i feel horrible you know i feel a bit horrible we're really in boys and girls we're reeling him there's two there's three there's four no no no i've got this whole league on [ __ ] strings this is the funniest thing ever oh my god it grows back oh my god no [ __ ] i'm a horrible person i mean boys this is my point no one knows all the tasks there's too many tasks this league and that's what i can exploit boys we can make a right fool out of people this is my exact point i then decided to head over to the lumbridge cow pen i i didn't actually have a planner this time i just thought i'm gonna try and make someone do something absolutely ridiculous you're waking me up with the mu task it's a 50-pointer for gryffindor please fall for this please fall for this [Music] [Laughter] you see what i mean boys people that have a [ __ ] clue what's going on mate i wouldn't do that like you're getting negative money then get negative gp like you just fell for that for those that don't know there is a task to kill a lesser demon now there is one you can say spot at the wizards tower and with the hordes of people heading over there players implemented their own queuing system letting people queue up in a fair way so they could complete their task very cute so i decided to head over to the varrock castle which houses its very own caged creature the monk of zamarak now imagine if someone were to make their own queue to kill the monkey zamarak and pretend that it was a task even getting three people from their own cc to act as people queuing in line to complete the fake task with the intention of getting people to queue for said task what kind of person would do that i am that i don't know if he's going to take the bait yeah i'm going to start slashing right stay there i'm going to get some more people i'm going to go to like the bank or something he's come back from his mage gear on that oh my god i feel so [ __ ] horrible he's in the land he's in the [ __ ] line i could think you said something oh he's fishing for another one [Music] i'm an actual criminal i should be in that cell [Laughter] he's here he's back he's back he's in he's in we got another ticket [ __ ] no way i did it yesterday you're a [ __ ] liar that's what you are minionly don't tell me this is a it is loud it is okay while the queue is low mate he's already damaged so it wouldn't count yeah you've got to rekill it you've got to rekill it slowly yeah it didn't take long for me to pull it off yeah i'm quite simple we've got three people in the queue that's pretty good i feel sorry for this guys like oh number one wait this minion this minion league guy's gone come don't feel on thank you timing this is what i mean literally you can tell on leagues you can tell anyone to do anything and they'll do it believe me you're gonna get points because there's that many tasks our salty dog kills kills it and we get a reaction we'll all do it like to count down them all log out at the same time okay [Music] [Laughter] he's about to kill it he's about to kill it right wait for his reaction everyone get ready to log out [Music] all the fools are left behind you're a donut you're so stupid you're so stupid you're stupid dumb after my success i decided to try fish around some twitch chats i ended a few asking if people had done the magic leprechaun task baiting them to come to the tree behind lumbridge used in the lost city quest from there i just made them chop the tree get the leprechaun out and just do some [ __ ] weird [ __ ] boys and a lot of them followed along oh my god he's stacked he's probably just been killing fandoms or somewhere [Music] oh god oh i'm a [ __ ] he's come back with a rude axe is he gonna do it is he gonna he's gonna see the draw is he gonna see the troll i'm sorry mate i'm so sorry [Music] what oh mate he's so nice as well he's so nice oh no he's not [Music] it's gonna spin if he does this spin that's amazing absolutely amazing this is amazing
