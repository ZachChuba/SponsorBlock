Hi, it's SANA here. I'm going to make scented candles today.
(SANA makes scented candles!) Why is it so hard from the beginning?
(It's her first try, so it's not so easy) (Carefully choosing fragrance oil) Okay, okay. I never thought
I would make a scented candle. (Somehow it's tense
to put a cinnamon stick) Why is it so tense? (Laughter) If I take the sticks out,
it'd be ruined, right? I don't know. It's screwed. I don't know how it will turn out.
(Doubtful candle making continues) (#Focus_Sha #continues #putting #cinnamon_stick) Wow, it feels good. It's too short, isn't it? Let's not do it. (Dead serious) (Okay, it's done!) Okay.
(Thump thump) And now... Where to begin?
(Time to pour soy wax again) This side! Okay, let's begin with a grapefruit.
(To the microwave! Go! Go!) (#now #SANA #can_do_it
#candle_expert #Sha_vant) Wow!
(What does it feel like to complete 60%?) (Thinking) It was... ...easier than I thought until now. When I put flowers at the top
at the end, it should be done properly
to make it perfect. I think this orange is edible. (Dried orange hiding in dried flowers) Can I try it?
(Dried orange mukbang?) No? I can't?
(#don't_eat #for_candles) (Waiting again) (SANA, look at us, too) (When will it be done, microwave?) (Staring) Oh, no, no!
No, no! (#Saving_Private_Wax
#before_burnt #successful) Freesia scent.
(Repeat from now on) (Squeezing fragrance oil in→) (Squeezing fragrance oil in→stirring) (Squeezing fragrance oil in→stirring
→pouring down) I hope the bottom of
the wax is not melted, too. I'm pouring warm wax on it. How long has it been?
(It's been one hour!) So you only need
an hour or two to make candles at home, right? (Pouring) (Glancing) I know this grapefruit smell. It smells like grapefruit tea.
(#grapefruit_candle #and_tea #similar) It's the same.
(You know, right?) (It's grapefruit tea.
I mean, candle) (#next_wax_batch #into #microwave) (Candle expert with no hesitation) (Waiting time) (#waiting_expert_Shashasha #just_looking) What do I want to make?
(What else do you want to make?) I had one. I wanted to make a diffuser. Is there something else to recommend?
(Please recommend to SANA!) - Fabric softener, deodorizer, perfume.
- Wow, that's a good idea. Oh!
(Clap)(Clap) I can do laundry with it.
I love it. I like it. I love it.
(#with_scent #anything_is_possible) (Smelling with a wooden stick) (Which one is SANA's favorite smell?) Black cherry or Sweet Pea. (#stirring #really_hard) When it's done,
it will be so satisfying. When the coronavirus is gone,
I want to go to Busan! Together!
(All nine members) (#ambidextrous #real_multitasking) (Last three batches go to microwave!) (Finally, the last batch!) After this, I'm going to watch
"The World of the Married". (Laughter)
(#SANA #into #The_World_of_the_ Married) Who else watches it?
(Ms. Question) Nobody?!
(How could you?) You should watch it!
(Watch it!) You really should. (#what_else #topic #thinking_thinking_SANA) Hello, ONCE. Is your candle going well?
(Are you making candles?) I guess you are not making it.
(#SANA #knows) You're just sitting back and
watching this, aren't you? It's fine. (Laughter) The pollen level is high these days.
(Take care, ONCE) I know you wear masks. Yep, they do.
(#always #worry_about_ONCE) Pollen level is high.
(Take care!) My nose is itching. (Thinking X2) TMI, TMI, what else?
(Finding more TMI) Last night,
(TMT SANA's diary) I went to bed at about 2 a.m. I woke up once at six or six thirty. Then I woke up at nine thirty. I drew the curtain
and laid down for about five minutes. I did laundry yesterday. So I hung them up. Then I washed my face. Then...
(SANA, you can stop now) (Okay, I'm coming) I had to go to fit modeling. So I didn't have time
to put on toners and lotions. So I brought them in my bag
and went to fit modeling. I put on toner and lotion on the way.
(I'm so busy) After that I went to hair shop, to set my hair...
(And then..) (What did I do?) On the way to the work, I thought about what to eat
before shooting. I decided to have rice noodles. Then I had a meeting.
After the meeting, I had rice noodles
and went back to the shoot. It was SANA's TMI. (Laughter) Cotton scent. (#After_TMI #Continue #to #Make_candles) (But here comes another Thinking SANA) BGM?
"Three Times A Day." I personally like it. But I'm not sure it fits this situation. Which song would suit this situation?
(Recommend BGM, please!) I hope it's from our tracks. - "Melting."
- "Melting" is good. Wow, "Melting" suits this situation.
(#candle #Melting #Ms. Question #satisfied) I think I have been really quiet today. (No?) (Last one!) (#it's_almost #done! #♥♥♥) (Second soy wax batch is poured!) Done!
It's not done yet. The top layers are not set yet. When the wax is soft enough,
(Candle making step #9) when the top becomes white, decorate a candle with dried flowers. (#okay #input_complete) Okay! Here we go. Grapefruit candle is pretty much dried... I will start with this. Since grapefruit candle is grapefruit, I will take out this dried orange, and decorate it...
(Since it's grapefruit) with the orange. (Smelling orange, too) It doesn't smell like it'd be edible. (#finding #orange #SANA_likes) Since there are tons of decoration sets,
I can choose one. But if you have only one set, it would be difficult to do so. Pretty ones have really pretty colors. It's pretty like this,
but not pretty ones are... (Browsing) (Am I not pretty, SANA?) It's so different. (Gathers pretty oranges and
begins to decorate) (Laughter) It's okay! I want to make it look pretty. Can I take it out now?
(Wooden chopsticks) (Careful) (Cautious) Does it always just break like this? When I put decorations?
(#decoration #Worrying_SANA) (Doesn't know what to do with the orange) (Here?) (Hmm) (Breaking orange
after breaking cinnamon sticks) (Crack) (#most #serious #SANA) (Ta-da) Grapefruit candle is done! About this long...?
(Nope, one more step to go) (Real last step: cutting wick!) (The scissors aren't working) (Noooo) (Cut)
(Okay!) Grapefruit candle is done!
(Really done!) (Satisfied) Can I do this one, too?
(Wax became white) (Alright! Let's do this!) How do I make it look good? (Laughter) What should I do?
(#difficult #careful #decoration) (First, sorting the decorations!) How can I make them look good?
(Thinking) (Thinking) (#let's #just #put_them) (Plop) (Laughter) As you saw, if I keep going,
(Flower sunk under soft wax..) they will sink.
(#SANA #expert #quick_understanding) We will do it a little bit later.
(Let's wait a little, candle) (SANA's
Scented Candle Atelier) (While waiting,
SANA completed all but two) (Loves to sniff it) I'll do this one first. I want it to be more green.
(#decorating #with_green #suits #scent) (SANA has done so well) (Satisfied) (Q. What's the concept
of this decoration?) Tree? Or woods? Not so bad, right? It has been good so far, yeah?
(#patting_herself #SANA #doing_great) (Okay! It's perfect!) Should I add more or not?
(But always doubtful SANA) (Ms. Question fishing for answer) (Laughter) Ew!
(#SANA #do #what_you_want) (Another flower is added) (Is it good?) (Scratch) (#SANA_not_sure #thinking_thinking) It's okay to add this, right? Why am I seeking approval?
(Glancing) (#super_focused #perfect_SANA) (Mini-size pine corn decoration
Difficulty ★★★★★) (Super serious) (SANA's hand is huge
for the mini pine cone) (*Sigh*) Oh! (Happy) (Laughter) I didn't know I had this.
(You are so late) (#with_tweezers #here_comes #Focus_Sha) Isn't this enough? (Glancing again) I don't know. (#SANA #deco_shavant #looks_like #forest) (SANA also sniffs
the last candle) (One more sniff) (#finding_flower #suits #scent) (SANA found
a leaf she likes!) (Fidgeting) I want to use
a curling iron on it. It's too flat. (#hand_curling #Magic_Sha) (Make it straight!) (Leaves are unfurled
with SANA's magic hand!) (Let me put you inside) (Fits right in) (Perfect) (#TMTSANA's #quiet_moment #decoration_time) *sigh*
(She can finally breathe..) (#but #Perfect_Sha's_deco_TIME 
#not_over_yet) (Flower confetti added
100% made by SANA) (Laughter) (Flower petals don't fall out
no matter what SANA does) (SANA never gives up!!!!!) (#with_tweezers #going_into #candle) (Tap tap tap)
(Not moving) (It's no use) (#SANA #flower_sommelier) (Okay, I choose you!) (Hand made flower snow
this time) (Shashasha) (Again, doesn't move) (Laughter) It's not working.
(You're a hard foe, confetti) (#but #determined_SANA_Kim #keeps_going) I'm pulling them instead...
(SANA works on it until satisfied) It's done! (Get back in the line!) (Excuse me!) (#last_step #get_candles #in_the_line) (Come here) Okay, It's done. (Applause)
(All nice scented candles complete!) It was really...
(SANA made candle for the first time!) ...easier than I thought, but because you have to wait
until the wax sets, it takes time. If you have a lot of time at home,
it's a good activity to spend some time on. If you like scents, it is a good activity
to try it at least once. I made scented candles! So this is the end of SANA's scented candle making. I don't know how ONCE felt about this,
(ONCEs, how was SANA's candle making?) but I hope you had a relaxing time while watching this video. I hope you had a good time, while watching this video. I really think it's a good activity to try.
(#ONCE #try #candle_making!) So this is the end of SANA's scented candle making! See you next time!
