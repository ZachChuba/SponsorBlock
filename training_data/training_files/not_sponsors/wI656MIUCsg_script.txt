recently made a really big gear switch which I think is worth sharing with you because I certainly learnt a lot in the process about a year ago I put out a video talking about the fact that I'd switched from the X 100 to the XT 20 the street photography and a lot of you were very very annoyed with me because you said you've gone out and bought an X 100 because I used one not that I told anyone to do that fair warning if that video annoyed you this one is gonna make you apocalyptic let me give you a very quick overview of my gear history to explain why I've done what I've done recently I started back in the day with a little Canon 550d I had a 350 D before that secondhand but I went out in the first new camera I bought to use more professionally with a 550 D which is a little aps-c crop since I think in the States it was called the t2 I and at the time they didn't have the kit lens for it in the store but they did have a secondhand 50 mil 1.4 which the guy behind the counter says you obviously don't understand much about photography take this lens trust me it's good so I took it off him and that gave me about an 85 mil at 1.4 and so I straightaway got into portraits and started to shoot for food photography and little things like that and a friend of mine was starting a catering business and she said to me I saw some stuff he was shooting it looks pretty good would you come and shoot some food from my catering business which I did and she loved the images and that's what went up on her website and that eventually lent to my first full-time job with a company in South Africa the job for that company was to shoot food and product photography and I stuck with my 550d is from my first professional job I bought a second 550d eventually I got a little 35 mil plastic Prime and a 20 for milk crime which basically gave me my 35 50 and 85 and I bought a 70 to 200 F for the non is one the cheap one because it was great for food as well and portraits I eventually got some money together to start upgrading so I upgraded to full frame and I went with the Canon 5d Mark twos I started upgrading each of my primes to better quality prime lenses and then eventually got myself a 24 to 105 which is actually the kit lens for the 5d just because it's a great versatile lens for shooting products in a studio the 550 DS and the 5d Mark twos were exciting cameras back in the day because they gave us video in these boxes for the first time and because of our ability to shallow the depth of field because of the great lenses we could stick on the front it meant we could shoot much more cinematic footage but out of one box the same box that we were taking stills with the only issue with them is there was no usable autofocus so you had to really slow down plan your shots dial in your focus and stuff couldn't move around too much so eventually I also moved up and bought an 80 D because it had dual pixel autofocus and it really kept up while he was shooting video then about three years ago while I was in the middle of working for companies shooting products in big studios all day I found I was falling out of love with photography because it just became so technical I'd forgotten how to be creative with it and so I started shooting on my phone for street photography and then the next camera that I bought was actually the Fuji x100s wander around and take photos while I was on the street and it was brilliant for that and then over time I realized it'd be nice in my little daily bag to also have a couple of little interchangeable lenses to shoot a portrait maybe and then switch back and shoot Street while I was traveling around and that's why I moved from the fix lens x100 to the xt 20 with a few lenses for that the problem with that is that I built up three totally separate kits for different purposes for my studio stuff I had two Canon 5d Mark two bodies I had a 35 mil 1.4 Sigma the 50ml 1.4 Sigma the Canon 85 1.4 for portrait work and I had my 24 to 105 for the more versatile stuff and that all went in this bag and then for video work I had the Canon a TD is my main body because of the reliable autofocus and I used to use the 5d mark ii sometimes ii angles and then with that I've got the Sigma 18 to 35 1.8 but that didn't really have image stabilization so I couldn't handhold it so I bought the Canon 17 255 2.8 with image stabilization and then I also bought the 24 mil 2.8 pancake lens so that I could mount it on the first generations as I you and crane and get some gimbal stuff and all that stuff went in this bag here then for street photography I bought the Fuji XT 20 is a smaller runaround camera with that I had the 23 mil F to the 35 mil F 1.4 and the 56 mil F 1.2 for porch as I went around and all that stuff went around with me daily in this bag here now I'm a hybrid shooter which means that I shoot as much stills as I do video for my clients and with the amount of travel I had to do it just became such a pain to have to take multiple bags everywhere that I went and I started to wonder is there a way to get a small enough kit that would fit in one bag that will fulfill all my needs across the board but with a much smaller amount of gear before I get into exactly what I've done let me just say a couple of words to the camera brands I've used so far if anyone from Fuji ever watches this you make great cameras I can't recommend you highly enough to people who travel and do street photography and want to run around light and take great quality images the thing I'm really grateful to Fuji for is the fact that the cameras themselves and holding them made me want to shoot more in fact I think I can credit Fuji and the feel of a Fuji in my hand and the convenience day-to-day as being the reason that I've actually got so into street photography in the last few years I thought long and hard about trying to find a way to switch to Fuji totally and unfortunately even with the XH 1 coming out and having more video specs it's still not quite there for my needs but Fuji you make great cameras and keep going and maybe in the future I'll be able to switch back if anyone from Canon ever watches this I have to say that I will always have a soft spot in my heart for you as a camera company I started with you I've built the majority of my career on the back of your technology and I always recommend your cameras to people who want that full frame goodness and beautiful color science but I also have to say that over the last few years I've been very disappointed the reason I started with you guys is because there's a hybrid choosing you were the first camera seriously giving us one box one camera body that produce beautiful Stills and stunning video and over the years I feel like you've slowly start to hamstring those products deliberately not keeping up with the video specs because you want us to both by your DSLRs and by your C 100's and 200 and 300 and 500 most of us one don't have the money to do that and two we're trying to get our kits smaller and smaller not bigger and bigger you are still undisputedly the biggest camera brand on the planet but if you're looking at your market share and if it's slowly creeping down and other camera brands are creeping up this is the reason why we're leaving is because we just don't have the resources little guys like myself don't have the extra money or space we don't have crews and we don't have huge bank accounts to be able to buy everything you want us to buy to get the tech that other camera companies are giving us in one very small body so when I was thinking about what would be the right tool for the job here's the short list of specs that I had one I wanted full frame I understand the arguments about doesn't make a difference and just got a PCSO micro four-thirds that's great for you I don't want to get into it with you but for me certainly as a portrait shooter I want the bigger options for depth of field which is why I want to go full frame I wanted something with embody stabilization so I could handhold for video I wanted 120 frames a second I'd only ever had 60 to get more into slow motion video I wanted very customizable picture profiles and I wanted reliable autofocus and when you put all those things together for me there was only one option I could really afford a one camera brand that was giving me all those things at a price I could actually reach and that was Sony so here's what I've done I've got two Sony a7 three bodies which have all the specs that I've mentioned I have a Tamron 28 275 2.8 which is going to double as my versatile studio lens it's a very sharp lens but it's also with the firmware update it's got great autofocus and can be a run-and-gun video lens because the camera has embody stabilization I've held on to my 18 to 35 mil Sigma as a second video lens as well for when I'm doing 2 angle interviews my Prime's are now still my 35 Sigma with an adapter my 50 mil Sigma with an adapter and then I bought the Sony 85 1.8 and then on top of that I've also bought the Sam young 35 2.8 which is now my street photography lens because when I put this little pancake lens on the Sony a7 3 it's still a really small profile tiny lens I can take around with me every day and all that now fits into one bag when I'm traveling I did this big switch the other day and I had to admit it was a very surreal experience I went down to the store with you know three bags worth of stuff and all the cameras boxed up and handed everything over and I knew that it would take them a couple of hours to process through check all the gear worked and give me prices for everything so I went to a copy shop to sit and wait and while I was sitting there it was very odd knowing that at that moment I didn't really have any cameras and I started to think about this next set of gear that I would get and I thought about Sony as a brand and I'm about to shoot myself in the face for anytime Sony would want a partner but this is how I felt I wasn't excited about moving to Sony as a brand but I was a hundred percent at peace that it was the right decision I haven't snapped for years thinking oh my gosh I can't wait for one day when I own a Sony it's not that at all and I didn't feel emotional about the connection I remember when I went and picked up a Fuji for the first time even though it was a an old second-hand Fuji for cheap I felt excited about the camera because it had a mystique to it it had a bit of a romance about it Sony didn't have that for me at all this was a totally unemotional dispassionate decision as a professional I knew that getting these cameras was the right tool for the jobs that I do and that was it and it got me thinking what is it that keeps us from switching to gear that's the right choice for us I think one reason is brand loyalty last week a few of us did an exhibition in a gallery of our street photography work and one of the gentlemen who came in and spoke to me told me the story of his father giving him his first camera and the advice that he gave him was take as many photographs as you can because it will only make you better but don't get romantic about the camera it's just the tool in your hand and he also said to him don't get stuck with this camera and be so brand loyal you don't move on when it's time a lot of us get emotionally attached to cameras and I'll be honest with you there was a moment where I was sitting in that coffee shop waiting for them to process my stuff where I actually felt a bit sad about saying goodbye to these cameras which I journey with for so long but they are just cameras and I had to remind myself that so me telling you this isn't like I've got this worked out I still have to do a bit of self-talk it's just a box with a brand name on it when I was doing research about the a 73 I watched a lot of videos from people who had switched from Canon to Sony and what their experience was like and one wedding photographers comment really stuck out to me and he said I feel silly that I've stuck with this camera brand for so long I knew a while ago that this was the move I need to make but it took me a while to build the emotional courage to do what I needed to do to get the right tool in my hand to move forward I think another reason we can get stuck and not pick the most practical tool for us is gear snobbishness we seem to think that if we have a fancy or a trendy camera that other people know is a good camera or or has a good reputation they're gonna think we're good photographers but we forget that at some point they're gonna see our images and they're gonna make up their own minds anyway I know a lot of rubbish photographers who use likers and I know some absolutely incredible photographers who only shoot on their phone the brand won't make you a better photographer it won't even fool other people into thinking you're a better photographer only your actual skills will do that another reason people get stuck on particular brands I think and I've been very guilty of saying this in the past is that this camera gives me my look let's be honest both Fuji and Canon in different ways have great reputations for good color science but for all the arguments backwards and forwards online with people saying I'll only ever use Canon because the beautiful skin tones or I'll only ever use Fuji because the colors that come straight out the camera are absolutely beautiful I haven't totally understood what everyone's banging on about for my mind that argument only really makes sense if you don't edit your work but the vast majority of us do I really believe that if I'm a professional you can put a Fuji in my hand or a Canon or an icon or a Panasonic or a Pentax or a Leica or a Sony doesn't matter what the brand is that I can shoot I can light I can raw process and I can edit in Photoshop and put that image and fit it into my portfolio seamlessly because I have control over every stage and I'm not relying on any single camera body to give me the look that I want I mean if the camera brand is doing the heavy lifting for me on the colorscience side what happens if that camera brand goes bust they don't make those cameras anymore then what do I do do my images change overnight and I can never get back to the look I had or can I get myself to the place where my skill set is such and my level of control is such that it doesn't matter what camera brand I have to use tomorrow I can be confident I can produce images that fit with the rest of the work that I've done learn to raw process and edit your own color space and then you will be free to do any camera that suits your needs so will the work that I do change because I've changed gear well maybe I mean I already know the ways that the work that I do is going to get easier because of the tech these cameras have and how it makes it the right tool to do what I do and yes there'll be things which I have to learn things I have to get used to definitely with Sony menu structures which I will have to figure out which will take me a while but I'm not insecure in the slightest that all the work that I produce I will be as proud of I will have as much control of and it will still 100% feel like my work if there are changes which happen to my work which I didn't intend it just means I wasn't a good enough photographer that I was relying on the gear instead of my own photography brain and I still have work to do to get more control over the whole process but the point is traveling will be easier shooting will be easier and with the things these cameras can do they are the right tool for me today and that's all that counts the rest I will make work I've said it before I will say it again it is not the camera in your hand that makes you a great photographer it is your photographers brain no matter what camera you have in your hand and if you get yourself to that stage understanding that then you are freed by whatever camera you can afford which is the right tool for the job at hand so I'm not recommending Canon to you I'm not recommending Fuji to you I am not recommending Sony to you I'm not recommending any camera to you I'm saying that if you get yourself to the place where you have control over your process you then look at your bank account and reasonably speaking say what camera can I afford to buy without putting myself into huge debt that I can't afford get that camera apply your brain to the tool that is the correct tool you have in your hand and then get out there and shoot like crazy to get better remember that every camera is just a light proof box that captures images on a sensor or on a piece of celluloid you are the photographer before you go I wanted to let you know about an event that's coming up at the beginning of October called photo city hull I will be there for three days from the 5th to the 7th of October I'll be giving the keynote speech as well as hanging out for the whole three days and I'll be doing street photography walks you'll be able
