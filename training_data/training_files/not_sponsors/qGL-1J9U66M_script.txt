[The next morning came] [The members are deep asleep]
[Eunha & Yuju / Yerin & Sowon / SinB] [Where is Umji?] [Here!] [Up early in the morning to prepare breakfast] [What's early bird Umji's menu?] I think I should cook this from the outside. [An egg soup that wants to become an egg roll(?)]
Did I add too much? [Shudders / Decides to lessen the egg]
How can I cook something this unpretty? [It starts to look like an egg roll] Look. I heated this part so only that area got cooked. [What does it mean?]
If I heat this part, I think this area will cook. [Here comes the camera to show the situation more clearly]
Only this part got cooked so I'm heating the other part. [Cooking]
I have no choice but to roll it from here. [End of explanation] [Nonchalantly exits after knowing what's going on] [Yerin and Sowon got up early as well]
- Hello, producer~
- Hello. - Hello.
- Hello. [Chef Umji is now adding it onto the plate] I want to place it nicely but I can't. [All that matters is the flavor]
No need to make it nice. [She's the type to encourage well]
They say food that looks good tastes bad. [Umji wants the egg fry to be half-cooked]
Is this half-cooked? I think this is just uncooked. You should cover this with something. [Wait, I'll do it for you] [Pot cover] [Covers it after gathering the eggs] [Warmth +6] [The meal would be ready after 10 minutes]
I think we just have to wait 10 minutes more. [Then we'll wake the other members up]
I think estimating the time is always difficult. [SinB and Umji's room] [Secretively enters] You wake her up. [Rustling noise] [She joined her to sleep instead of waking her up...] [Wake up] My baby~ [My baby, who isn't responding] Open your eyes~ [Just 5 more minutes] This is useless. [Failed to wake SinB up] [Sowon gives up and leaves] [I'm Yerin the white puppy who came to wake Eunha and Yuju up] [Natural light is especially bright in the 2nd floor room] [Let me see..] [The white puppy also joins in to sleep] [Moves] [Found them] [Foot] [Hehe] [Walks towards the younger members who are still asleep] [She just goes on top of them since there is no space] Wow, puppy. [Sowon the puppy also joins in] [Waddles] [A happy wake up time that the white puppy and the Sowon puppy have together] How about Hwang Eun Bi? She doesn't move. - I'll check on her.
- It's fine! I'll check on her. [Yerin goes to SinB's room where Sowon gave up on] [Still asleep] [Remove the pillow first and go on top of the bed...] [Oh, right. She said she'll check on her, she didn't say she'll wake her up] [Chef Umji is still busy] [She uses all the leftover ingredients from yesterday]
We have a bit of ingredients for soup from yesterday.. [Sowon is wearing her mic]
Umji, did you wear the mic? Yes~ When did you? [Umji is a very busy person]
In the morning. [The pork lacks a bit for 6 people]
We do not have a lot of pork. That's fine. I'm not having it. [The best leader who yields it to the other members]
You guys have it. [Her voices sounding sad must be because of the atmosphere...]
I... don't like pork. [The next menu of Chef Umji is kimchi stir-fried rice] [You're here! Hehehe] I believe I should taste it. [Tasting it the way you do on holidays]
It's vague. - Umji, it's too...
- Hm? Is it bland? - Good.
- Does it taste good? [She cooks well]
It's spiced well. Oh the pork really is... [The pork really is little]
- We don't have much of it.
- Yeah. It can't be this little. [Sowon leaves after satisfactorily tasting the food...] [Umji wants to share the pork to everybody]
I better cut the pork equally for everyone. [Using the frying pan to cook the kimchi]
I'll add the kimchi. Please give us the meal~ [SinB came out following the smell of the fried kimchi]
Give us the meal~ [Fries] [I'll come back when it's done / These are baby birds waiting for the mic] I'll now add the rice. [Lastly adding the white rice] [Adds every single grain] Shall I take out the cereal? [Open!] [I want to help as well] Huh? I smell good kimchi. [Everyone comes to the kitchen following the good smell]
Right, kimchi stir-fried rice. - Did you make kimchi stir-fried rice?
- Yeah. Amazing! You're making it look good too? Awesome~ [Hits] [Cute] [Good, it's perfect] [Attention everybody! Here comes the main course] [Go away, cereal] You did so great! [Good job, Umji] [Chef Umji closes her kitchen]
Phew~ I'm done. [Umji's recommended breakfast menu] [Sesame leaf egg roll, and kimchi stir-fried rice] Thanks. - Thank you.
- Everyone, the few pork is hidden. Really? [Looking for the hidden pork / Promoting the pork she hid]
- Really rare!
- It's really few. There really is little. [They're still having cereal]
- You made this with ripened kimchi?
- Yeah. Ye Won, I'll have that pork. Am I having this alone? [The cereal team is on stand by]
- No, I'll have it too.
- Me too. Good. I nearly felt lonely. - Don't worry.
- Umji : If you want more egg fry, make one for yourself. - Umji : We have one more egg.
- Oh, one more. I used the rest for the egg roll. [Feeling happy with the meal]
Do you like me? Of course! Do you hate me? Of course! [Joking] - Then do we have 1 hour of preparation?
- Yes. [Thanks to Umji who prepared the breakfast, they have a lot of time]
- We should get prepped up.
- That's a lot. [How about the outfit?]
Are you all gonna wear this? [Obviously a pajama]
I can't go out like this, alone. Right, it's a sled.. [GFRIEND plans to ride the snow sled today]
I think we just have to wear comfortable outfits then wear the extra clothes. [Since we're done with breakfast, let's get prepped up]
Eco dotted line. Thanks for the meal~ Let's clean up. Sure. But let's do it after washing up. [End of a peaceful breakfast, the start of prepping up!] [After an hour, the yard is still quiet] [Studies diligently] [It's about time GFRIEND shows up now..] Good morning! Good morning~ Oh my! [The morning greeting is heard in 11:30, almost the afternoon]
Good morning~ Hello~ [Hehe]
Hello~ [They're busy greeting and striking a pose]
- Hello.
- Let's go. Good afternoon~ - Oh, it's not the morning now?
- Hello Tera! The weather's great. [Done checking out as they greet the dog]
We'll go now~ [SinB is in charge of driving on the way to the sledding slope] [It's bright] [Yerin the jukebox] [Determined]
Yuju : I'm planning to expose my forehead while riding the sled. - You can't help it when riding the sled.
- Yeah. Tears. I better ventilate the forehead. Let's go~ [To the sledding slope while singing the departure song]
To the sledding slope~ Hello producers~ [Bye... See you in the sledding slope] [About 10 minutes / The sledding slope isn't that far from the accommodation]
Oh, it's really not that far away. What shall we have later? I like buckwheat noodles too. [Objection]
But it'll be sad not to have spicy stir-fried chicken here in Chuncheon. I also think we should try that in Chuncheon. - Then how about spicy stir-fried chicken?
- Sure. [The next agenda]
If it's spicy stir-fried chicken, will we have the charcoal cooked or iron plate cooked? I like iron plate. I think that sounds good. It's difficult to cook it in charcoal. You should cook it yourself. Right. [Unanimity]
- Then the iron plate.
- Iron plate. It's decided! We're gonna have the iron plate cooked one. It's so curvy here. [The way to the sledding slope is quite rough]
Curvy~ [Look]
That must be the ski slope. - Wow~
- Wow! [The ski slope is seen ahead of the curvy road]
- What's that?
- It looks like an amusement park. [Wanna get there fast]
It's awesome. That's all covered in snow. [This place is completely covered in white snow] [Today's first location which was chosen by GFRIEND] [A sledding slope where cute characters greet you] [The gondola can't be missed before riding the sled] Oh my! [Greeting GFRIEND as it shakes a lot] It's shaking too much. [Cute / Happy already despite having rode only the gondola]
How scary! [Making a full shot / SinB is outside the angle]
Full shot! Oh! It's too bright! [The sunlight only shines Yerin]
- Hi~
- So bright. [The gondola speeds up]
Oh! It's fast! [Surprised at the sudden speed]
Oh! What is it? [Continues to go up to the destination that's unseen]
- Aren't we riding the sled? Why are we heading up?
- Is it over there? - Are we riding the sled here?
- Sowon : This is on a whole different scale. Sowon : I thought we'll go to a park near home and use the rice sack.. [Difficult movement] [Umji highly recommends]
Umji : Try using plastic bags instead of rice sacks. Umji : They're really fast. I thought we'll be riding it holding two sticks. What's that? We cannot do that here. [Due to the unexpected scale]
My heart is bouncing. [Look]
How cute! [LOL]
So cute! [Laughs looking at the cute(?) sledding slope] [Time to get off now!]
- What?
- Everyone! It's time! - Get ready to leave!
- Timing! [A low-key nervous moment..]
The timing is the key, everyone. Sowon : If ever I can't get off.. Yuju : No, I doubt people cannot get off. [Hurries]
- You're an idiot if you can't get off.
- Let's be happy in the future. [The camera hurriedly moves searching for Yuju] Yerin : She got off earlier than the director out of fear. [She got off earlier than the director due to nervousness]
You were scared, right? Why did you get off earlier than the director? That was dizzying. [GFRIEND will be riding tube-type and boat-type sleds]
Here's the rafting sled. That must be fun. Perhaps we're riding that boat to slide down. [How exciting] [Having high expectations now that they saw it for themselves]
It must be fun! [Reflectors are everywhere]
- What shall we do?
- We're probably gonna look bright on camera. - For real.
- Do we look good? [Jung Eunha, get my attack]
- I want to ride that snow sled!
- Hey, Jung Eunha! [Screams] [Reloads the next shot] [Hehe]
It's like a ski slope here. [It's your turn now, Sowon]
Sowon! [Throws]
It feels cool to be stepping on snow. [Come here / You!]
It's our first time to walk on snow this year, isn't it? Those two are fighting. Eunha : Oh? That band is so cute. [The jolly sound is getting closer / Blowing flutes]
- The snowman band.
- Where? [Hello GFRIEND]
I wanna be part. [Hi / Wow] [I feel excited] [Are you seriously dancing out of the blue, here? / A kind member who goes along]
Turn! You're too tall! [Yerin and Yuju dances too] [LOL] [Very satisfied]
That was beautiful. [Finally GFRIEND's time to ride the sled after a long wait]
- Because of them.
- Be careful. Thank you. [We filmed it with the permission of the other customers]
- You too, it's slippery.
- Thank you. [Careful]
- Be careful.
- It's slippery! [What is the view awaiting Eunha, who got there first?]
- What? It's quite bigger than I thought...
- I'm scared! [The children's course]
- Wow, I think it'll be scarier than it seems.
- It's like bungee jumping! [The scary course which GFRIEND will be going for]
It's too high! - It must be really scary.
- I'm scared! Guys I'm scared! [Scared at the high and steep course]
No, we can do it. [(Noting it down) Bungee jumping.. for the next trip..]
Hey! I would rather go for bungee jumping! [Do you want to sit at the back if you're scared?]
Do you want to hold onto me at the back then? - Is that better?
- You don't have to look. [I'll think about it after seeing the person who goes first]
I'll see first. [The staff] [So-- Sowon will ride at the back..]
- You better stay at the back.
- Okay. [Yerin rides in front first]
- Wait! Please tell us before you push!
- Sure. [Hehe]
Yerin, you stay still! [Sowon gets ready to ride after gathering up courage]
Okay, I'll stay still. I'm actually scared too! We're not going yet! Yerin! I'm scared! Save me! [The worried eyes of those waiting for their turn]
- Please hold on.
- Scream if you're scared! [Sowon & Yerin departs while screaming] [A speedy fall] [Crowd noises] That's so scary, what should I do? It's scarier than I thought. I cannot ride that! [The sled continues to slide even after reaching the bottom] [And their screams continue as well] [Welcome] [Used up all energy..] [Everything is white here.. Am I in heaven?]
Is this the heaven? [Firm]
No. [Oh, I see.] [The turn of the 97 line]
- Sit?
- Yes you can. It won't fall. [Bright]
By chance, no one rides this while standing, do they? [The weirdest out of GFRIEND appears out of the blue]
- That's crazy!
- Riding while standing is... - Do I sit?
- Yes. So do you hold onto this? I'm scared! [Eunha and Yuju are also scared]
Wow, it's scary! - What is? You just have to ride it.
- I'm scared! [Sleds do not harm GFRIEND]
Save us! Oh! Don't! [Eunha & Yuju also leaves while screaming] [Sliding quickly through the wind~] [So scary :(] [Turns] [A piece of memory suddenly comes into mind..]
I'm planning to expose my forehead while riding the sled. [She's exposing her forehead as she planned] [Eunha & Yuju arrives safely]
Hey, your hat.. [The older members take care of the younger members, who are in chaos] Isn't it fun? [Feels like a roller coaster instead of a sled]
So scary! I think it was scarier than I thought. [Yuju]
Sowon : She brushed the ground with her hoodie! - Is it natural that it turns around on the way?
- Your hoodie is so wet! [Talking about the scary sled with a smiley face]
It's so scary! [Comprehension error]
I think it's fine than it seems. Sure~ It's fine~ [Calm]
Do we sit on top of it? - Ye Won~
- Yeah! [It seems it's scariest before the departure than during the slide]
I'm scared! Mommy! - I'm suddenly about to feel scared!
- You'll go now. [A merciless departure signal] [Screams] [Jumps] [Baby polar bears excited with the sled] [Oh! The smile of the youngest members is brighter than the snow] [The sled of Umji & SinB turns as well] [Claps] Welcome! Welcome, you can now get off. [The youngest members arrived at heaven (?)]
- You're in heaven.
- You can come here. [Screams] - Isn't it fun?
- You look like Super Mario. - I want to ride it once more.
- It's fun. We have to carry this. I'm scared. - Once is enough for me.
- Me too, once is enough. - It was a lot more..
- I experienced it thoroughly. - It was awesome.
- So fun! Let's put it down and drag it from here. It's heavy! [GFRIEND carrying the used sleds back to where they were]
- Should I drag this?
- Yes, please. Let's go! Is that a dog you have? [Mary / Yerin's one-day pet tube "I love to walk"]
Come on here! [Eunha didn't know that the sled would be this intense]
I thought it'd be some simple sled ride, on a rice bag or something. [Walks all the way up here and passes the baton] Please sit here. [Sitting] [Precious Yerin is on the sled] [The three carrying the tube rides the lift, and the other three walks]
- I'm leaving, I'm leaving!
- Bye! [Moves] [Umji riding after]
Good bye. [The last tube is for Yuju]
- Please sit.
- Okay. [Slowly approaches and plops] [Innocent and naive] [Bonus: Mini slide] [Just so happy] - Please stand up.
- Okay! It was so fun! [Stands up] [Umji arrives after Yerin, who responds well] [Wow] [Mario Ppuppu was satisfied] [Staggering] [Take this / Okay] [On the other hand, the walking team]
Please relax! - Relax!
- Oh, how cute. [What happened?]
Kim So Jung, relax! [Cute giant hanging on a tiny girl] It's too heavy. [While Eunha was in pain, Yuju arrived] Wow, that was hard. Thank you. [Exhausted]
That was too exhausting. [All six have arrived, now let's move to the next destination!]
- Let's go!
- Let's go! I will leave. [Dancing to the rhythm] [This time, a sled for all the members together]
Rafting sled. Wow, that sounds so fun! [Expectation arising once more]
- What is this?
- Wow, it looks so fun! Eunha : They won't say that we should sit according to our weight, will they? [No, please] [They ride on the boat with the guide]
- Members can ride number 29.
- Okay. [Hello, GFRIEND] [Sowon got so brave after an intense ride]
I want to sit at the front seat! I want the front seat. Then I will ride in the back. [Yuju, come here]
- I don't care where it is.
- Then ride with me in the back. - I will ride in the back.
- Do I go in the back? [Yuju, Eunha, and Yerin chooses the back seat]
How do I ride in the back? Here! Come here. [Sowon, Umji, and SinB takes the front seat]
I don't think this will be that scary. [The one in the middle]
Please hold onto the people on each side. - Oh, you're supposed to hold onto people on your sides.
- Hold onto me. [Moving around] [Trust grows with the arms linked]
- Trust me!
- I trust you! I trust you! I believe in you. - I will hold onto you like this.
- If I link my arms with Yuju [Tight]
- You should feel comfortable in the middle, right?
- Good! - Wow, I feel safe!
- It's good, huh? I am safe! [Waiting for the drone camera to arrive]
When does the drone come? [Where are you, drone? We should depart]
Drone, please come right now! [Drone flying in a hurry. avi]
- Drone!
- Don't fly so tardy! [The drone is scolded and ready to go]
- Drone!
- Bad drone! Bad drone! Yerin : Let's not yell altogether at once, let's go! Straight faces? [GFRIEND knows how to enjoy it! They depart after making a mission on their own!]
- Let's make straight faces. One, two, three!
- Straight face. [Who was that? Who just giggled?] [Holds the laughter / Me too] Eunha : Isn't this too peaceful a ride? [Best at concepts]
- I won't make any faces.
- Umji : It's a concept! Everyone, make straight faces, this is a concept. I just smiled! Why not? I'm so happy to be with everyone! I'm so happy to be with everyone, why don't we stay happy altogether? Umji : I felt so happy, too. [Feeling somewhat sorry to get down the sled] Now, come here, everyone! [Energetic SinB takes care of all the members]
Now, come here! Please come here! [Argh!]
It's exhausting. [Staggering]
Why are you so strong? Thank you! [Much relaxed than when they rode on tube sleds]
- Good bye!
- So much better than the one earlier! Yuju : The tube sled was so thrilling, this was just enjoyable. Where's Eunha? Oh, here she is. It's me! [Links arms] [Between the intense and gentle, the sled ride ends!] [It's time to move to the next destination / Came back to the gondola] - Jump!
- Jung Ye Rin! [Hello]
I am Jung Ye Rin! [A happy red ginseng / If you are exhausted, please say "Jung Ye Rin"]
- Jung Ye Rin!
- I am Jung Ye Rin! [Hands up high]
That was fun. [Sowon doesn't know what's going on, and Eunha cracks up by herself]
- What, what?
- This moves [Hands up high]
So I was like this. [Sensitive SinB]
Please take care. Eun-hi! [Short for, Eunha, hi!] [For Yerin, Yen-hi! Sowon, Soi-hi!] We are moving! We are getting there! [Where does GFRIEND want to go?] We are going to eat! We're gonna eat! - We're eating!
- We will eat and eat! [The clothes still look nice and clean]
- We don't look like we need to change!
- No, we don't need to change. This is very nice and clean. - Very good.
- Right here? Sowon : I think I have become a little hungry. Eunha : Wow, that looks good! We didn't eat that much in the morning, did we? [The next meal will be spicy stir-fried chicken! Let's go to fill our hungry stomachs]
- Spicy stir-fried chicken sounds so good.
- I need to eat right now. And you haven't eaten the sweet potato yet. [GFRIEND enters through the silent parking lot]
Everyone, I... [Spicy stir-fried chicken restaurant BGM - Waltz with GFRIEND] Let's get off~ Let's get off! Let's get off~ [Slightly tired to walk..] Ah I'm tired. [You worked hard driving a big car] Let's eat! Let's eat~ Let's get off~ [Going straight following Yerin's navigation]
- Straight!
- You worked hard~ Nice job done~ [And if you turn right..]
Turn right! - Straight!
- Oh! This place is so pretty. [An iron plate spicy stir-fried chicken restaurant that seems really good appears]
This place looks really good, I can sense that it's a really good place. [The visual of a good restaurant that stopped hungry Umji] Do you want me to take a picture for you? It's okay. Okay. [Although we don't know yet]
Let me just say I'm touched. [it must be a good deal of delicious spicy stir-fried chicken] Please give us food~ Can we order the menu on our own? Sowon : Do we have to play games to eat? [Another great dish at the spicy stir-fried chicken restaurant - fried pond smelt, buckwheat noodles]
- Fried pond smelt in winter sounds great.
- Right, fried pond smelt! We have to win the buckwheat noodles! Fried pond smelt? [We must have that!]
- I want the fried pond smelt.
- I want the fried pond smelt! I'm curious! I'm going to eat it! [They're more excited after hearing the menu / Gonna play a game for lunch as Sowon said]
- Fried pond smelt sounds good~ Buckwheat crepe sounds good too!
- Then let's play some games. For this time you will do the mission in order just like yesterday's mission. - Okay!
- Is this a group mission as well? [It's a group mission] [Additional lunch menu acquisition game - Chicken and seasoning are prepared / GFRIEND members attempt a great meal through the game] [Three kinds of games are played only once! Every time they succeed, they can win an additional menu. / Menu - fried pond smelt, buckwheat noodles, noodles & fried rice] - Let me explain the games.
- Yes! [The first game]
It's a game to express your emotion. [1. The staff will give a word that represents an emotion to the first member.]
When we give a walkie-talkie to one person [2. The member that receives it must make facial expressions to the next member]
you will need to convey it through your facial expressions [3. And if the last member gets the word right then you win.]
- To the walkie-talkie..
- The last person can tell us the word. We can't use our hands? You can use your hands, and you can get up. - If it was 'Panic' then I need to convey that after seeing it?
- Yes, that's correct. Yerin : Then I want SinB to guess at the end. [Yerin strongly recommends.]
- Me?
- She guesses better than you think. - Right.
- Shall we then? [The rearrangement finishes as SinB and Umji changes seats!]
- Change your seats.
- Only the two of you need to change your seats. [The walkie-talkie for delivering the words is given to the first member, Yuju]
- Oh this is how you listen to walkie-talkies.
- Yuju will listen to this. [Since she's done wearing the walkie-talkie let's play a practice round]
- Let's play a practice round.
- Yes. [Members that are waiting must look the other way.]
Oh we can't see. [Word] [Oh] [Oh no] [Silly / Oh? Is the word cuteness..?] [Okay] [Like this] [Flapping] [This one] Angry. [Not angry] Rage? [Correct answer] [Since she can say either angry or rage] [They must say the specific word to get it right]
We need to make it more innovative. [The tip is to make it more detailed]
That's why I did this and then this.. Sowon : Rage goes without this. [Sowon's version of rage.gif]
Woahhh~ I think you should do this. Yuju : Let's not leave out actions in the middle? Okay! Look at the front only! - It's the actual game now.
- Yes! [What's the menu you guys want to challenge first?]
Which menu do you guys want to try? Fried pond smelt! [Then shall we start?]
- Let's start with the fried pond smelt.
- Yes! [Nervous]
What if it gets so hard? I think it will. Something like 'adversity within difficulty'. [Receiving the word..]
Who's giving you the word? [Try guessing the word too, Buddy!]
- From the outside.
- Guess it well, okay? Look. [Eunha got it!]
- Ah~
- You know it right? You know it? Do it exactly like this! [A bit shy after following her haha] No let me do it again. [Shows it again]
I think it's hard. - Look again.
- I think it's quite hard? [(Sobs) You gave us an easy one for the practice round! :(]
- What is this?
- What? Why did you make it harder? [Eun-hi]
Is it hard? I'm curious. [Yuju laughs out loud because Eunha is so good haha] Isn't it this? - Yes it is.
- I don't think it is. Is it right? [Now Sowon shows it to Yerin]
You have to look at the facial expression as well. [Hello!]
You must make good facial expressions for this. [Smiles] [I have no idea.]
You shouldn't smile.. [Hides her beautiful smile and does it again]
Sowon your smile is too beautiful. [Got it] [We will reveal it to you guys now] [The word is "Awkward"] [Umji got it too!] [It expresses the joy and sorrow of mistaking someone else's greeting as yours] [She almost gets it]
I think I got what it is, while I was doing it. [Feeling frustrated] I can't think of the word. [An additional hint for confused SinB]
Hey I will make it similar. [Ah this is an act representing mustard*!!]
(* = sounds smiliar to "awkward" in Korean) [Our genius Umji] Answer. Awkward. Is it right? [Correct answer] [She hesitated a bit but she was sure after seeing Umji's hint]
I thought of awkward at first but I didn't think it was an emotion. I feel awkward. [As a result of the first game, they acquired the fried pond smelt after winning easily]
But we won this game and acquired the fried pond smelt! - You guys won the fried pond smelt.
- Yes! [We want to eat them all]
But the other two are important as well. [Right!]
We have the important ones left. [The second game is]
Continue a theme. Continue a theme? We will give you a theme. You guys need to say words that fit the theme in order. Oh okay! You guys can change seats, do you guys want to continue like this? First I need to be in the middle. - I felt that I had to yesterday.
- Let's go for buckwheat noodles. Yes, we will go for buckwheat noodles. - Buckwheat noodles are important!
- Ah don't say that! - Let's go for buckwheat noodles.
- Yes. [Anxious chicks]
- Where? From who?
- Ah wait! - Where from who?
- Yuju : I have a trauma from yesterday so I need to sit on the second chair. - Then change with me.
- You two change. - Yuju : The words come to my mind 3 seconds later.
- Yerin : Right, I feel good that Eunha is the first. I'm sorry. Let's do well. Let's do well! I'm nervous! Let's start. [The first theme]
A word that reads the same backward as forward. Chauffeur service! Oh, reads the same backward as forward? Okay.. [That's right.. a chauffeur service's phone number has identical first four and last four digits (referring to an advertisement for a chauffeur service)..] I'm sorry! [Eunha is cute haha]
I didn't hear "word" at the end. [That was funny, so let's count it as a practice round]
- Let's say that was a practice round.
- Practice? Let's do a practice round. [A word that reads the same backward as forward..]
- This is difficult.
- I can't think of anything. I will say this as a practice, jumping! Tomato! - Wild goose! There are words like this.
- I thought of Yangyang. Or can I do "take it with you"? "Take it with you"? [Unfortunately, only words count]
I don't think that will work as it's a sentence. - Wow, awesome!
- Practice round. - Okay, let's say that was a practice round and lower the difficulty level a bit..
- Yerin : Please lower the difficulty level! Yerin : A GFRIEND member's name or something like that. We will give you a theme related to GFRIEND. This could be more difficult. No, no. [The real first theme]
Another member's birthday. - Another member's birthday.
- Oh~ Yuju October 4th. Eunha May 30th. SinB June 3rd. Sowon December 7th. Umji August 19th. Yerin August 19th. [Perfectly done] [Relaxed]
- Okay, so we have only noodles left?
- Noodles are important. [The last mission to gain selfish interests.. I mean, noodles & fried rice]
- In order to satisfy our selfish interests..

How was it? Eunha : The director was really merciful Eunha : so we really played and ate a lot. It was really enjoyable. Umji : I was worried too at first because it was a reality show. Umji : But this time I really felt as if we came out to play just between us. Umji : And I kept on feeling that we grew up a lot seeing Umji : the members driving, like what the others said.

But thanks to this, I think we'll have more strength for our comeback. Good luck! [Shall we end this with our picture in hands and say our cheer?]
