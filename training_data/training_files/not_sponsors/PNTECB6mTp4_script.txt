so let's talk about bird box wait I forgot I wait was that a half-naked girl drugs and a relatable statement in the first 20 seconds of the movie damn son where'd you find this can't do something before you leave [Music] help support the channel it's one click that's all it takes 14 cameras is a horror movie from 2018 and the plot is symbol there's a creepy guy who rents out properties where he has spy cameras installed or as the official description says the lascivious owner has set up adding lascivious to my vocabulary ASAP by the way a series of spy cams throughout the house documenting their most intimate moments and life streaming them to the dark web the dark web huh [Music] I've been there in years number 14 this guy looks like a burnt salamander this villain is the Achilles heel of this movie and I will explain why heavily in the review in the very few positive reviews that this movie has it suffers from a problem that cam had as well that being people over valuing the film because it's a conversation starter I mean the movie immediately tries to break the border between film and reality by starting the film with the autistic on spy cameras and I feel like with that direction the film is heavily dependent on the viewer being creeped out by the idea of being watched but if the viewer is not afraid of that and the movie fails to produce the scares and the villain looks like Bruce Willis got stuck in a radiation chamber you end up with a review from me [Music] the movie begins by showing a couple on vacation while Gerald our villains name is Gerald watches from his spy cams there's one in the bedroom one in the bathroom and even one underneath a leaf [Music] so boy or ism aside Oh Gerald likes to sneak into the properties when he sees that the guests have left for whatever reason you'll go in there sniffs um bottoms and shove your toothbrush in his mouth the power crash by the way I want to make this clear right now I have no real beef with this actor I think it's far from easy to pull off a roll like this and I'm sure he's going off the direction given to him but he is just so damn cartoonish it's laughable instead of giving me goose bumps he's giving me a goose bumps vibe like it was a villain from season one [Music] the whole scene is shot like this by the way because it's art peasant my toothbrush yeah my phone ago girls you can't just use my toothbrush well you know that's why not cuz that's gross it's mine you should like if I were to oh what did you do to this thing the bristle barely tickled your tooth is did you drop it in the toilet or something it tastes like [ __ ] tastes like [ __ ] should probably smell like it too looks like the only thing you're smelling is the power crest a shitty teeth in me now were you guys not content with the couples acting in the opening scene did you drop it in the toilet or something well I got good news for you they're never shown again not even a follow-up they don't even have [ __ ] names in the movie this is pixie chick and this is hipster dude good star Gerald enters another one of his properties and begins to install more cameras which never really made sense to me you would think the cameras he has installed already are sufficient but instead he would rather risk his operations by installing more in the unknown time period that the guest is gone by the way his mouth is always like this do you got a stuffy nose are you constantly amazed by something [Music] yeah this is girls but come on let him drink some milk his mouths probably he'll drive from never closing it he's a thirsty boy you can grow up to be being strong then the guest returns unexpectedly even though is pretty good high chance that they were gonna return while he was there he was taking his sweet-ass time hello PETA [ __ ] Oh looks like it's feeding time for Buster I know you weigh 80 pounds and all but here's a little sippy cup of kibble is that why he has a bandana so he can stick up other dogs for their food put the pedigree in the bag he knows he's not supposed to make a sound for that type of thing right murderers don't yell to surprise their victims they just kill him that's kind of frightening on its own by the way this scene drags on like a second too long it should cut off like mid-to-late years and cut to the door but it's said they let him finish the dude that ends up just being more funny because now it just makes me think of the director during this scene and action Gerald mocks a girl out and to subdue the dog on the other side he pours cough syrup underneath the door and it works like a charm [Music] now we're introduced to the main family of this movie the mother sits there browsing their vacation home on Airbnb I mean vacay swap sweetheart what do you think of this one come here yeah I don't think I want to run from the Unabomber what a weird reference Unabomber who the [ __ ] is thought of the Unabomber in the last decade how dare you make fun of poor man stock image number 39 what do you think of this place see yourself sitting poolside here for a couple of weeks I have to be poolside during my vacation my parents [ __ ] suck ass [Music] you look like the guy from trailer park boys with a severe case of mumps the animal abuser wakes up gently slides the duct tape off of her mouth and just yells instead of getting up and running aren't you [ __ ] good at that there is no way this man is stronger than you even with duct tape on your hands he can barely walk he Whipple wobbles everywhere is there an invisible leaf blower in front of your face stop doing that [Music] you gotta be [ __ ] kidding me the kid does it to just a gaping family it sounds weird I swear these [ __ ] don't do [ __ ] all week and the one day I want to record they're like round the [ __ ] troops we're getting the work let's do it why are you what is that your first question why are you wet not why do you look like a founding father after a car accident or a wagon accident horse gone rogue you walk like you're on the set of Thriller but you look like you're on the set of Thriller if this guy [ __ ] slides and claps I'm losing it no where are you going well you had two lines and they were [ __ ] horrible where are you going this movie doesn't seem to have a whole lot of structure 20 minutes into it there is a couple a runner a family his son I gave what I'm being shown but there's got to be like a bigger picture coming soon right you would think the guy could afford to rent out all these properties and purchase multiple spycams wouldn't be driving cousin Eddie's RV oh don't you go falling in love with it now as we're taking it with us when we leave here next month [Music] stop it there's twitch streamers with better setups in this deaf times for the tier 2 sub I'll be like in the stream times ladies [ __ ] did you check the map on the site is that Anna Kendrick there's no way they got Anna Kendrick nope not her her name is Chelsea Edmondson and she will be getting a follow on the Grimm no we're gonna be stuck with my parents playing board games all week sober welcome to the wonderful world of nothing has a cent until you shove it in your mouth speaking of Danielle Sarah's friend wants to get laid this weekend because she thinks her boyfriend's cheating on her no one's getting laid on the strip speak for yourself what the [ __ ] is he staring at us it's kind of cute oh that's [ __ ] gross no this is 100% the intro to like a stepsister threesome so I've heard also ladies is this a thing you cool with your besties calling dibs on your little bro cuz Sara reacted pretty tame to that also how old is this kid how old are you can someone come check Ariana Juarez over here what are you watching well they don't have cable or Wi-Fi so really yeah um aren't you a little cold Daniela okay thank you geez they really don't want me to [ __ ] their 15 year old son what hard-asses now I've heard about spy kids but this is just bigger this is the angle you set the camera in Gerald what is this amateur hour Oh Lauri oh this is where [ __ ] gets crazy guys cuz now Gerald goes on to the dark web let's pop in once slapping mr. Gigi back in action well that's quite the internet you got there Gerald 14 live streams at once not to mention on the dark web of all places I gotta say if that's what you've been in all about this whole time I don't blame you wait am I looking at this right are her hands duct-taped with a chain in between her wrists meaning she could just do this and kick you square in the face as soon as you open the truck you look like Dick Cheney [ __ ] Beedrill so Gerald tosses Molly and his bomb shelter and we get this scene it's going to be alright I'm sorry do we know you because that sound Q insinuates we do are you this girl are you pixie chick cuz you don't look like her at all this spy cam footage [ __ ] gets old fast by the way so if you don't like it to begin with the next 90 minutes are gonna suck Kyle sneaks out to light up some dank and the girl who wants to bone them surprises him Christ you scared me what you doing I'm just hanging out yeah yeah looks like you're smoking some drugs looks like you're smoking some tanks spoken like a true teenager it looks like you're smoking some drugs what is this a PSA from the 70s you're a narc from Kazakhstan looks like you're smoking some drugs do you know where I get we have the drugs that's not a Kazakhstan accent I'm a [ __ ] idiot don't look to me for accuracy and most types of jokes I'm just saying because I know people really give a [ __ ] when I don't say something exactly to what it's supposed to be like in my last video I was like yeah she pulled out a deagle noise there's a 1911 it's not it's not why would you everything else to deal it's not a deal okay I don't know she did really teach me anything if a garden looks like a Diigo I'm gonna call it a D go again cuz this is funnier to call it a deagle instead of a 1911 I'm probably saying that wrong in triggering all the gun enthusiasts out there on 1911 it's the one 9-1-1 Danielle flirts with kayo and he's just not picking up any of it so he lets her leave while he just what are you too cool to [ __ ] well does he come down here there's two of us we can take him oh no you can't believe me I'm not gonna believe you know this guy's built like ground beef you telling me you can't double-team him he doesn't even carry a weapon you're not the first girl to come down here there was another she tried to make a run for it and she never came back yeah cuz she's probably busy living you guys ready to see the worst character ever written into a script cuz it's about that time it's up to a little guy once after that some sort of a filmmaker or something no third package this week but he'll supplies it's in the box I'm sorry is worrying about my packages in your [ __ ] job description don't make me get quick and Express on the phone to fire your ass you smell that what Oh No honking their bus get a checked out smell that I can't either I don't know all my senses been off ever since I started chewing stoned admittedly not the best happen to have but Taleban could you have made a worse mailman character this is reminiscent of Michael Rapaport from next Friday don't want any trouble with you you don't have to send your posse out here to do 187 in my ass but that movie was a comedy so it was funny this is a horror movie saw him angry who was it delivery guy [Music] shouldn't you care sir considering it's yours and since it appears like you're hiding it from your son time for another episode of Gerald walks around and does weird stuff via spy cam footage cuz that's what the movie is why are you smelling things that are scented doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose once again like I mentioned I don't get this guy's jig I get wanting to stop by and sniff a few panties believe me but why take extra time and extra risk to install more cameras I know for teens a little on the low end but I think it should suffice oh look the face makes sense again I was pregnant when he kidnapped me I thought I'd die in labor and that'd be it but I didn't Oh stupid hanging jaw is her son right wait so if that's the case this guy's been a fairly good dad then Frank I mean he took care of a baby that may or may not have been his I presume the kid looks healthy he's got fruit loops and [ __ ] maybe just a little grip on his fetish that's it Claire here finally plans for them to attack Gerald when he takes them up to bathe because that's when he's vulnerable Junior over here is obnoxiously curious so he locks himself in the back of Gerald's truck to see where he goes and right in the nick of time Gerald's cameras are all out of commission you look like Rumpelstiltskin 'he's dying breath it really doesn't matter he goes to the house flips a switch and turns all the cameras back on it's really just there so jr. can see what he's been doing the whole time do you have something to say to me you wanna hit this you hit this it is your boy Maddy [ __ ] smokes [Music] you have a rock in your shoe you trying to do the electro swing from fortnight so after he takes Claire up to bathe he brings Molly who has a little wooden shank in her waistline tiny get those clothes off this is for making my dog addicted to scissor [Music] [Applause] where're you going Molly he's not dead Molly why did why are you running didn't even put up a fight Molly you could have killed him right there I really doubt you guys carved out these makeshift Spears to just incapacitate him and run I mean wasn't it you that said yeah we can do this that's why your dumb ass deserves what's about to happen so she locks herself in the garage and threatens him to release Claire or she won't open the door so Gerald starts to fill the garage with a gas it works and Claire opens the garage for him and we're not gonna mention how he just happen to have you know a gas chamber at their ready but it works and she opens the garage for him [Music] you look like a deep-fried battletoads molly talked all this [ __ ] just to go out like a [ __ ] you have an ex you have a fighting chance you just stood there like an extra from gladiator you should at least had it pulled back for like a years Johnny situation or at the very least [ __ ] heave hold that [ __ ] and tomahawk them in the chest I don't know something now your [ __ ] ass is just barbecue sauce do you guys want to see the most jumbled scene in every regard in this movie let me give you a quick context cuz I skipped these parts Jerald stole the pair of panties that they bought on the dark web and when Danielle looked through her stuff she thought it was Kyle who stole them so now she thinks he's a nasty creep and Sarah is unaware of the situation and by the way nothing prompts this scene cuz the scene right before this one is this it's 45 seconds long and probably for wanting to show you this it's my [ __ ] videos gonna get copyright claim but it's just bad acting bad dialogue bad direction in this weird order like this scene doesn't even need to be in the movie I'm a hundred percent building it up way too much this is just funny to me but just watch are you serious what's going on I didn't do anything do you want to tell her or do you want to leave us alone I didn't [ __ ] do anything right right hey I appreciate the fine acity kid but I think Danielle's a little out of your league I have a [ __ ] thing for Danielle oh let's just pulling your leg what was that about nice nothing I'll talk see I built it up too much it wasn't that funny it's just it's so so bad yeah my buggin or is this guy actually kind of jacked speaking of bugs I don't want to stay here tonight order a pizza hit the pool to be fine we're not hanging out with them can your mother and I just have one night out by ourselves he's not coming with us I like that that's funny that's been the best part of this movie so Gerald is streaming on the dark web again and someone hops in the chat asking for a price on the girl he offers 100k but Gerald repeats that she's not for sale then the dark web Ian offers anybody in chat 10 K for the address Gerald gets frustrated and tries to delete the comments but then someone takes up that offer for the hundred K to kidnap the girl then someone else leaks the address before Gerald has a chance to block every individual in the chat even though he could have just ended the stream and what do you know the dark web doesn't [ __ ] around oh my god it's a ninja he did not just use that sound effect is this a bait listen to that sound again that's the same sound that cinemasins uses in their videos I feel like this is a bait now Danielle two times this is 100% abate you [ __ ] never thought this was a good movie you were just trying to get covered by cinemasins to help him market your [ __ ] Chitti oh my god and you [ __ ] got me to marketing your stupid [ __ ] oh my god hashtag me too well I might as well [ __ ] finish the film anyways hey that looks like a mini strobe light dance battle to the death what kind of plan was this by this guy anyway you were gonna kidnap the girl then what first of all the guy didn't even clarify which girl he wanted we can take him both drop her off to this random person who probably doesn't even live by you will see you gonna pick her up were you in a shipper there quick and Express you a dark web guy or something what the [ __ ] how long is how long does it take to empty out two dumpsters there's two dumpsters in front of the [ __ ] building two is that their package I've delivered this week there's a third package [ __ ] the skit who tease that skit one in that funny I don't need it you guys got it you guys it's all good so is the garbage looking good from up here so instead of taking the girl Ninja takes a second to marvel at his kidnapping when Gerald [ __ ] his [ __ ] up and the girls were like yeah I'm a hero but then Gerald insinuates he's not gonna help the girls because Sara saw his face even though they don't even know who he is or that he's a bad person he could literally just leave at this point and I'll be caught so Gerald starts tagging and bagging him right but then the parents show up and they're able to save Sara Danielle was nowhere to be seen so Kyle goes over to Gerald's truck hello Danielle I recognize that moan anyway Jerald drives off with her stops at his house and then Danielle grant theft auto's his [ __ ] I know look Junior somehow knew where the bomb shelter was located and saved Claire aka his mom but then oh look the truck breaks down and now this is the climax yeah what were you guys able to follow about cuz unfortunately I did is pretty bad the guy with a double-barrel shotgun and Twizzlers four legs catches up to their broken-down truck and tells junior to come over here and for some reason he ignores the girls and sends off two warning shots which is essentially your entire clip because you have a double-barrel shotgun so now you have to reload and he doesn't scoot up at all towards the people that can drive away that he can probably safely assume are unarmed instead he's just hyper focused on junior and I don't know if the movies insinuating that Gerald isn't even aware that juniors fixing the broken-down truck regardless the boy slams the hood yells now and Gerald still gives them time to throw it in reverse gun it and go what seems like thirty feet even though he's right here he's even near the edge of the truck which gives him like a whole nine seconds to move out of the way then this shot makes no damn sense because look at how cozy is the junior that's not even the trucks length and just like this [ __ ] they don't make sure he's dead they even leave him the gun get in where we're going we don't need toads [ __ ] psychopath bus watching all those people hundreds of thousands of hours on hard drives how many houses like I have several parties he had to break the news to the family over and so the city said you should have seen the look on my mother's face what's her look something like this and three-time houses empty save for some cheap cars chains and soundproofing my god do you think we could fit more exposition in this [ __ ] last scene are you wearing camo pants you couldn't afford a second pair of cop pants that's where you cut the budget off this veteran just brought his [ __ ] from home that's where they said they left him my guess there's some good Samaritan stopped to help so surprise surprise Gerald got away and moved to Mexico oh yeah who's guys huh cuz I saw you I didn't matter if I told you at the beginning of this review that by the end of it this villain would be on one crutch speaking Spanish in Mexico would you believe me cuz you'd have to be pretty [ __ ] stupid if you did but here we are buckle up first box challenge that's the ending that movie was pretty bad and there's really not much else on this movie usually I try to dive into you know some of the behind the scenes or something like that but there's not really any interviews articles podcasts this is kind of there and also if you're familiar with this movie you probably already know this or have already commented it because you're an impatient douche but funny enough while we're viewing the movie I was watching it on Netflix so when I was gonna rewatch it I typed in 14 cameras on Netflix and there I signed please tell me this is a coincidence nope during my entire viewing experience of 14 cameras I had no [ __ ] idea that this movie was a sequel to 13 cameras [Applause] yeah I'm gonna assume I didn't miss much but alas I felt like I had to watch it and I did I did learn one thing this is where Claire is from that's why this scene was supposed to matter she was pregnant from a boyfriend in this movie and jr. was her kid and that's really all you had to get from part 1 part 1 has almost nothing to do with this guy the horror aspect is really brushed over in my opinion the main stage is held by this couple and the cheating boyfriend the movie is a drama with actors not made for drama I was an hour in and granted the guys involved but it's just him doing things from the secret spy cameras view kind of like this movie and it's not worse than the second part because this one actually has a story with the family he's watching in 14 cameras there was no [ __ ] story what was the big B plot these two trying to [ __ ] I didn't give a [ __ ] about that did you if you've watched all my reviews this may not seem true but I honestly think 14 cameras is the worst movie I've reviewed if you watch my other reviews I've probably yelled louder I've probably gone on really long tangents about why the movie sucks I've probably tore those films up but I can't shake the thought that this is the worst film American poltergeist 2 garbage a dime of this movies budget but I don't know no one's at least so [ __ ] that it's funny to laugh at I could get something out of that viewing experience phobia and devil incarnate miles ahead of this movie lowriders know googly-eye me would be ashamed coat of honor Ouija cam and the hatred all sucked in their own special way but this movie takes the cake like a regretful diabetic before I give my usual outro let me quickly say this about my last review because it's been bothering me and it might not matter but I still want to address it I feel like in my cam review I started to emulate a film critic more than I wanted to and that's not what this series is about hence the intro I am NOT a film critic I just like to pick movies apart whenever I speak on a movie or movies in general it's my opinion and I really have no legitimate like knowledge of film to back it up I know I probably come off kind of setting a lot like I do know a lot of [ __ ] but no it's just how I feel I don't want people to think I know more than I actually do I just like them make fun of bad movies nitpick and get these jokes off that is the core of my reviews and I think in my camera view I maybe came off as something more than that the video is also doing very well on top of that so I definitely wanted to addresses and like I said I might be thinking too much into it this really might not matter but like for example when people compare me to a Ralph the movie maker or a YMS I don't like those comparisons because although those are youtubers that I thoroughly enjoy I would never want to be put in the same category as them because that would belittle their extensive knowledge of film sure they may nitpick and make jokes as well but I don't believe that's the core of their content so I do someone appreciate those comparisons but I just want to clarify that I'm no one to look to for film advice this is all my opinion I'm a film Joe Schmo who can just make fun of a bad movie for half an hour I don't know about cinematography I don't know what's the right color palette I don't know what's good lighting what's bad lighting that's not the point of these reviews and it never should be it should be what I set out for it to be it's for the fans and I want to keep it that way if you enjoyed this movie review please leave a like it is the easiest way to support me subscribe because I have more
