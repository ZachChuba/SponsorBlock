[Music] that song is a take on one of the darkest chapters in Illinois history the titular serial killer John Wayne Gacy Gacy sexually assaulted and murdered at least 33 young boys and men between 1972 and 1978 and became one of America's most notorious serial killers the first half of the song tells the story over a haunting melody he dressed up like a clown for them with his face paint white and and while Stevens could have simply sung of what a tragedy this was and ended there he didn't Stephens wanted to find more meaning in John Wayne Gacy he wanted it to be more than just a tragedy and a waste of lives so at the end of the song Stevens tell something few would feel comfortable doing on such a public stage he reaches out and empathizes with John Wayne Gacy jr. and in my best behavior [Music] they just like Stephens asks himself the question how different is he from Gacy in doing so Stephens is forcing all of us to confront ourselves and to ask if we really are who we think we are good people free of sin he suggests that with some reflection you'll realize that you have your own ghosts that you've buried beneath the floorboards for those secrets I have with this song Stephens shifts your experience of a modern tragedy and forces you to question and learn from it and this helps give direction to the rest of the album when soufiane sings about the people places and events of Illinois he doesn't want you just to take them at face value he wants you to ask what they mean to you and five songs after John Wayne Gacy we get a song about one of the places in the state that is most meaningful to Stevens Chicago [Music] [Music] when Stevens was growing up in Detroit Chicago was a beacon for him it was a sign of escape of a bigger world it was the place where he and his friends would drive to see concerts and seek out beauty and that's what the song is about the quest for beauty and truth and the mistakes you might make along the way [Music] all things go all things go drove to Chicago all things the lyrics are met with optimistic strings the feeling of being young and being part of something and as much as the song is about the destination of Chicago it's about the journey to in the van with my friend it was for freedom from myself and from the load the land helped Stevens find freedom from himself and his baggage helped him grow and learn Chicago is a distillation of youth and hope and change [Music] and while we may not all feel this way about Chicago as a city we all feel this way about somewhere about sometime by showing us what Chicago means to him Stevens is helping us reflect on her own personal history and the mistakes we've made that have come to pass it's a beautiful song that teaches us to appreciate the cities that we visit through the meaning they provide to people for the symbol that a big city can be but this song about the optimism of youth is followed by a melancholic take on youth Casimir Pulaski Day the title of that song is a reference to a state holiday in Illinois a day that holds special meaning to Stevens is on that holiday that Steven's lost one of his best friends as a teenager to bone cancer golden rod and the 4-h dog the things I brought it when I found out you had cancer [Music] this song details her death and the ensuing crisis of faith that it brought on for Stephens Tuesday night at the Bible study we lift our hands and pray over your body but nothing Stephens Christian faith can be seen all over his music especially in Illinois but in this song it's cast into doubt a young Stephens has to face mortality as we all do at some point in life and has to ask why these things happened it's a challenge to his belief in a benevolent loving God and so Stephens gives new context to something unique to Illinois Casimir Pulaski day these small moments are what make Illinois such a raw album they're autobiographical snippets that can often hurt to hear and by telling these stories sufen forces you to think about your surroundings at any given time in any given place there are a thousand small stories going on like the ones that Stephen sings and that brings us to the last song we'll look at in this video the tallest man the broadest shoulders I count the days the great frontier forgiving faceless ice the third last song in the album this song is an echo of the third track come and feel the illinois' like that track it's split into two parts and is also filled with references to Carl Sandburg Sandburg was a poet from Illinois who much like Stevens captured life in Chicago in his art the first half of the song looks at Chicago as a starting point of the American frontier [Music] it looks at how Illinois provided a new start for many people but struggles with the realization that this came at the expense of the indigenous population as the song grows it pushes forward in time and the second half of the song is a slew of Illinois references [Music] [Music] these are the dozens of small stories and icons the things that the people of Illinois used to define themselves and find meanings in their life [Music] summer - instrumental pieces so this song ends with the last words spoken on the album oh great Illinois behind a chorus powerfully sings it can only start with you [Music] Illinois's shows us that one state can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people and that's what makes it so powerful and this video is only really brushing the surface do yourself a favor and give Illinois a deep listen pick out the small nuances and the dozens of threads that run through giving us new perspectives and new thoughts on life in Illinois Sufjan Stevens shows us why this place is so important to him and in doing so he helps us find meaning in our own lives and in the places surrounding us Polyphonic to let them know that I sent you and support my channel
