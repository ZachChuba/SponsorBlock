when someone comes up and says something like I'm a god everybody says who does he think is Greek mythology has 12 main gods and goddesses these immortals ruled over the world from the highest mountain in Greece Mount Olympus and from their perch they controlled every aspect of human life but Greek mythology is not just the stories of these gods and their various roles but also the legends of heroes Hercules or narcissus who by the nature of their virtues overcame or succumbed to the challenges of mortal life these stories illuminated the various sagas of life itself and provided wisdom or knowledge to help navigate the overwhelming complexity of existence whether intentional or not with his sixth studio album Kanye West finds himself knee-deep in mythological territory effectively drawing from the themes of his career he elevates them into myth where he casts himself as the central character the mere mortal who somehow became a god morphed into a monster only to succumb to his human nature and by the skin of his teeth make it out alive let's journey through the saga of yeezus and explore what makes this musical Odyssey or the second look and determine whether yeezus places Kanye where he so badly wants to be on the Mount Olympus of musical gods the first four tracks paint his destructive character as a vulgar and tyrannical epital these tracks are relentless never giving us a sense of release no snare drums are present just pulsating brutalist collages with only more accented drum hits in the snares place out of the gate a fight brews within Kanye he stirs up a concoction of synthesizers as if summoning lightning and Kanye begins his descent at the height of his arrogance comparing himself to a monster in love while referencing a second coming of sorts but not towards his messiah complex we gain insight into the ethos of the album his superficial life and sexual conquests [Music] you could care less about what others might think my neck let me show you right now for you give it up he seems to be rejecting his codependency on his audience for approval he throws the first punch on us through a soul sample he doesn't care what we want anymore [Music] My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was nothing but his long backhanded apology he gave us what we wanted Jesus as the Menace he wanted to be he's the Kanye who rushed onstage at the VMAs this record opens with the rejection of dependence on others for approval throughout yeezus Kanye will attempt to liberate himself and us with his messages the question really isn't if will break free of the chains but if we even want to Connie has only been warming up though his egotism has only just begun he adopts this exaggerated persona of a black skinhead comparing himself to an out-of-control ape in a white man's world the hook affirms his harsh lifestyle in the moaning and we get glimpses of someone with no self-control [Music] he's pushing himself into a further disastrous lifestyle that he may not even want to be living perhaps due to the societal pressures of his celebrity he's been critical of the inherent racism against black people but is even more critical of black people themselves [Music] only making it more difficult to want to join his ideology when he a lien Eights himself from his own people instead of leading them he's only losing his unit and building this anger he shouts to the heavens frustrated with the current status quo of rampant racism and society's consumerism but by his last call he's convinced himself that he's on another plane and instead of trying to lead or build anyone else up he's only built up himself Kanye West is dead and Jesus has risen the opening sample introduces and foreshadows the notion of change he wants to take this woman out of her skimpy clothes and put her in a tall skirt to make her more ladylike Jesus wrecks his godhood by flaunting his superficial behavior but it's quickly contrasted by irony my damn massage even as a god he's still relying on others to achieve things his power isn't dignified nor confirmed by the world around it even Jesus proclaims himself both a god and a man he's playing with the dichotomy between God and men Jesus sees himself as a divine creature able to achieve whatever crosses his mind musically he can but in reality he's a man plagued with all of the insecurities and fears of a mortal human he's become the very product his revolution aims to tear down caught in the frivolous lifestyle expected of his celebrity statute and the rest around my damned croissants he repeatedly tries to convince us that he is in fact some sort of deity but remains trapped in his own fame caught between two poles he's been making progress with his message but then relapses he sees himself as better than most sharing a house with Jesus himself I know he the most but I am a close me Casas casa but the alienation is suffocating him and he can no longer contain his vulnerabilities gasping for air he has separated himself from reality and his miserable fort perhaps he even feels judged by God either way Jesus is destined to fall like every other ruler but he's not yet done and he cries out through Justin Vernon [Music] he still believes it's his destiny to create change you see his broke [ __ ] racism that's that don't touch anything in the snow and tries to clear up his messages and his rich [ __ ] racism that's that come in please by mouth he's talking about the enslavement of the black rich towards commodities and the shackles of economic slavery spinnin a bingo Alexander Wang these are today's new slaves bound by gold chains rather than iron ones he finally shows a true moment of empathy for one's fellow man he wants to lead a rebellion against this new form of slavery Jesus would rather be an ethical and express the truth than swallow his own words and he takes the first step towards being this godly leader throwing away the keys to his luxury vehicle I thought he's made back cheese I went my heart honestly I know the remainder of the verse sees him explaining that he lives among others fears as well but he can't really make cultural change happen because he can hardly change his own dependencies the drums roll and we finally get an emotional release he's is still very much a part of the problem and he's conflicted Conti himself would have to leave his kingdom his success in his art behind him if he wishes to practice what he preaches it's a complete breakdown of this character revealing the hurt person under the previous tracks armor he's still reliant on the excessive lifestyle that he uses to cover up what's inside and refuses to let it go he's reached a point where he can't overcome his history self-medicating in the hopes of escaping his rally [Music] the emotional incline of the album begins with a Hungarian prophecy it translates to one day the Sun too tired to shine slept in the deep green sombre lake and in the darkness the world did ale until she came for all our sake it invokes the myth of Helios a God who chariot AddThis unyk Ross the sky each day a God who's been set to give joy to mortals I think this tired son is Kanye who needs to rest because he's been fighting this battle for so long like Helios he's tired of dragging the Sun across the sky every day maybe Kanye is also tired of being a God of his own creation and as hard as he tried he can't seem to shrug off this mortal coil his own humanity seems to follow him around like a lesser God but this is precisely where yeezus gets interesting when Kanye walks down from Mount Olympus and returns to being human only now he's left with a shell of himself torn to ruins from his Icarus like God ascent but the passage foreshadows a woman who is approaching and
