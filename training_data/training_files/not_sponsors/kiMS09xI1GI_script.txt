[Music] in the aftermath of General William house evacuation of Boston on March 17th 1776 Washington had to predict where British forces would strike next he speculated that New York the largest and most prominent coastal city in the colonies was where how would land as it would enable control of the Hudson and would effectively divide the colonies on the 13th of April Washington entered Manhattan and quickly got to work bolstering these substandard defenses that had already been set up unsure of where the British would attack he ordered the construction of several forts and gun batteries around New York how knew he had to move quickly lest the revolution continue to spread across the colonies with fresh reinforcements he left Nova Scotia on June 9th after being reinforced by the recently redeployed Henry Clinton Britain's available forces amounted to 40,000 redcoats and hundreds of warships but how wasn't going to make the same mistakes he had made in Boston he knew he had to proceed cautiously in spite of his overwhelming numbers On June 29th just one day after Washington heard the news of house departure from Canada the British fleet began anchoring in New York Bay within several days the British had over 170 warships present by early July House troops landed unopposed at Staten Island it was an impressive show of force many New Yorkers seeing such a powerful demonstration turned cove as part of house new cautious approach he requested to meet with Washington to resolve the conflict peacefully on several occasions but to no avail the rest of July remained quiet as how gradually assembled the rest of his forces in early August 45 more ships arrived along with general Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis by this time a total of 400 ships were gathered in New York Bay and 32,000 troops were stationed on Staten Island Washington feared the worst writing to Congress the unexpected arrival of Clinton's Carolina army on Staten Island which added to the Hessians and foreign troops under Lord Howe exhibits a force justly alarming when I compared it with that which we have to oppose them I cannot help feeling every anxious apprehension the new levies are so incomplete the old regiments deficient and so much sickness that we must have an immediate supply of men call out to the militia immediately even Washington's most trusted general Nathaniel Greene suggested burning New York City to the ground and retreating but morale was already low and burning down New York City wouldn't have helped to make matters worse both Green and Washington disagreed on where they thought the British were going to land Greene argued Long Island but Washington was convinced that the real attack would come on Manhattan but no matter where the attack would occur Washington felt confident that Nathaniel Greene a man who knew the terrain of New York like the back of his hand would are you okay I guess not Greene eventually got so sick that he had to be relieved of his command by mid-august Washington managed to bolster his garrison from 10,000 to 19,000 troops however these men were ill-equipped and ill trained and on August 22nd when howl landed 15,000 men on the beaches of Long Island Washington was still convinced that the real target was Manhattan the landing on Long Island he believed was a diversion the British regulars now advancing at an alarming rate were met with little to no resistance they halted at Flatbush Washington still not persuaded positioned a mere 1,500 troops of the 14,500 stationed on Manhattan to defend Brooklyn two days later Washington finally replaced Nathaniel Greene with the aged Israel Putnam who was unfamiliar with the area the same day four thousand Hessians landed on the island with a grand total of around 20,000 men Howe was just about ready to execute his plan this involved hurtling two defensive lines the first of which was guarded by General Alexander and 500 of his men in the West at Gowen s Road in the center general Sullivan had 1,100 men stationed around Flatbush past along with an additional 800 who held Bedford Pass the weakest part of the front line was in the east where just 500 riflemen under Colonel Samuel miles acted as sylvans flank guard this outer defensive line was positioned on high ground in some areas it was as high as a hundred and fifty feet exactly twice as high as Bunker Hill there were numerous passes between these hills and most of them were fortified except for one which the Continentals were almost completely unaware of Jamaica pass this path was guarded by virtually no one as it was a route that only the locals knew about luckily for how there was a very Pro British sentiment in the area and the loyalists revealed information about the unfamiliar pass Clinton was the first informed about the route on August 26 and advised how to formulate his plan around exploiting it meanwhile Washington recognized he was heavily outnumbered and thus drew a second line of defense which was held by approximately 6,500 men who were dug in around Brooklyn this was to be used as a fallback position on the night of August 26th around nine o'clock Howe and Clinton began moving troops through Jamaica pass while 5,000 redcoats engaged Alexander's forces at Gowen s road as a diversionary attack at 3 a.m. Putnam was informed of the assault and sent Alexander 1,000 reinforcements to hold the line around this time general Sullivan discovered the 4,000 Hessians who had begun to bombard his position but no attack followed encouraging him to send Alexander even more reinforcements to make matters worse colonel miles who was guarding the eastern flank decided to reposition himself mirror to where the gunfire was coming from exposing both Jamaica Pass and most of the eastern flank by Dawn House men had successfully circumvented colonial forces without being spotted by Putnam however Myles who discovered the British column at the last minute turned around and attempted to hold them off with his small group of riflemen they were swiftly captured Jamaica pass had been secured by the British at 9:00 a.m. how fired to cannon signaling for the Hessians and the remaining British forces to begins their main assaults Sullivan's men promptly came under fire by both Howe and the Hessians and within minutes the line broke though many of his men did make it to safety hundreds were captured including Sullivan who had personally tried to delay the British at around 11 a.m. Alexander's infantry holding the western flank were finally attacked when they realized that they had been enveloped they tried falling back but it was too late Alexander liked Sullivan stayed back and fought a desperate attack with several hundred men of the first Maryland regimen nearly the entire force was destroyed and an Alexander was captured how successfully wiped out the entire front line of defense and captured two enemy generals and now the Continentals were completely surrounded so he did the only thing a sensible commander would do he regrouped and called off the attack historians believe that Howe was so stunned by his losses at Bunker Hill that he did not want to risk any unnecessary engagements how's plan was to now besiege the American forces trapped in Brooklyn until they surrendered the entire next day was dedicated to building trenches and constricting Washington's position but as you know if you're a regular viewer of this series Washington loved amphibious landings and what better time to escape across the East River than a dark and foggy night on August 29th Washington transported all of his remaining forces when the fog cleared that morning Washington had slipped out of house grasp but how was determined he used the next two weeks to prepare his ships to transport 30,000 men across the East River to deliver a final blow to Washington's troops and Manhattan and put an end to the revolution that and
