Hi, Melvin asked me on Twitter if it is possible to make a bracelet that removes the static electricity from body and avoids shock Of course, there are these straps that ground the body and remove static electricity But is it possible to make a cordless one? And surely after I did a quick search, I found that there are these anti-static cordless bracelets like these and my reaction was well, these are scam I mean, how can you remove static electricity from your body without sending... put it in your pocket? You have...how these things sell on the web? under those people How does it work?! It is... See every time your body picks up static electricity say by walking with socks on the carpet the only way to get rid of them is to take Them and put them somewhere else like in the ground and that's what this wire does You can't just put those charges in a container and keep them in your pocket Dave Jones from the channel "EEVblog" which is a great electronic Teardown review and debunk channel has a great video about this and shows that these cordless bracelets are garbage Basically, they've showed the fake bracelet. He got online contained only a single 1 mega. Ohm resistor in it. And that's it Wow, what's the use of that is holding a resistor in my hands supposed to magically discharge my body It is very important to at least understand the tools you want to use for your work and educate yourself and not get scammed Check it out. Anyway, holding a 1 mega. Ohm resister does nothing. Why even 1 Meg when you can hold this your own screwdriver? Hmm that gives me an idea I was wondering if it is possible at all to have a standalone Bracelet that would dissipate charges and one thing came to mind Which is one of those punk rock bracelets with a bunch of spikes on them You might already know that electric charges accumulate on the sharp points in a conductor and so much charge in a time Point results in them repelling each other hard and dissipate into the air and environment You can easily see this when I run my Tesla coil So I thought with those Punk bracelets having so many metal spikes They potentially dissipate charges into the air quicker and drop my body voltage and reduce the risk of discharge and shock So here's the plan. I'm gonna buy one of those bracelets and to test it I'm going to charge myself using my vandegraaff and see if those spikes have any effect at all Granville Street in downtown Vancouver is one of those streets you can find some questionable stores in.Hopefully I can find what I need there Fantasy Factory eh? Let's check that jeez. That was the wrong shop. Let's check the rock shop Hopefully this one has it. This looks like the right store. Oh Oh,there we are Those are the kind of spikes I'm looking for.What in a rest band. That's what is that it holder or something I bought these two for a total of $70. That's a strange expense on my business card Well, I got this not very impressive one row of spikes bracelet But it's the pointiest one they had and then I found this one which is much point here. It's called a choker and They both have metal exposed on the back to touch my skin. Okay, let's do it without the spikes first. I Put my legs up Cars my buddy a little bit and then discharged. Oh That was painful, okay, let's do it the despites now, okay this time with the bracelets One two three, four five and discharge Absolutely, useless. Well, maybe the dome is charging my body too quickly. So let's do it more realistically I'm gonna touch that dose...ouch! charge my body first and then let go and then touch the ground...ah s*** Hate surprises. Okay without the bracelet charging my body One...two...three...four...five and discharged One...two..three...four...five.And now with the bracelet One...two...three...four...five x2 Useless Maybe it's not making a good contact to my body due to my massive fare So I'm gonna use aluminum foil to make sure that sparks are in good contact with each other and my body. Here we go One,two,three,four,five and one, two, three, four, five...S***!...Useless! F*** it,let's use the choker it's not gonna look good around your neck in the lab So I'm gonna put it around my wrist with the foil around it for good contact If this doesn't do it,nothing will here you go the SuperDuper anti-static bracelet Ok 1 2 3 4 5 and 1 2 3 4 5...S*** What the hell? 1 2 3 4 5 ... 1 2 3 4 5 ... S***! Completely useless I really thought this would do it I really thought having spikes on your body should help but maybe their effect is insignificant Compared to how your body already dissipates charges on its own now. Let's put on the Grounding strap and see how well that works One two three four five one two three...nothing Even having my hand completely on the dole. I don't feel any discharge Now instead of this strap I put my bare feet on the tiled ground They given the non-conductive piles the charge better than those stupid fights, well, you know what, It means if these spikes can't discharge you faster than your body's normal discharge rate Then there is nothing out there that can discharge you cordless Li all those cordless anti-static straps are just a pile of junk One note is that even in the corded straps? There is a one mega ohm resistance in series with the grounding wire You never want to directly connect your body to ground because in case you accidentally touch high-voltage you can easily get electrocuted The 1 mega ohm limits the current and saves you while it's good enough to get rid of static charges So make sure you have a properly grounded anti-static wristband or risk killing your naked electronics and start learning new things at skill share and make sure to use the promo code only the first 500 people to sign up get the two-month free access to all the courses so you don't have any excuse not to learn I Personally like to check up my video editing skills a notch because it's taking forever as is There is this course on Adobe Premiere and it seems the entire course is less than three hours.
