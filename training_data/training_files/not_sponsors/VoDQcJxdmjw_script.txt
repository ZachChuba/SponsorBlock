it's Computex 2019 and we couldn't even wait for the show Florida open we're here at number 69 leeta street I think that's how you pronounce it which happens to be MSI's headquarters here in Taiwan and we're checking out a couple of msis all new laptop designs starting with the GE 65 Raider so from the outside this looks like a fairly normal laptop you got to power in you got your SD you got a couple of super speed USB s these are actually pretty cool they light up so you can find them in the dark there there you go then on the other side we've got another one of those mini DisplayPort HDMI 2.0 Gigabit Ethernet oh that's just Type C no Thunderbolt headphone and microphone jacks but that's exactly what's special about the GE 65 Raider is that it looks like a perfectly total normal 15.6 inch laptop but under the hood it's got a shocking amount of horsepower so we're talking up to an 8 core core i9 Intel processor up to an r/t X 2070 max P is apparently what we're calling ones that are not max Q so that's a full power design up to 32 gigs of ram up to 2 nvme raid 0 boot drives in here and of course a wack ton of cooling see that Apple when you've got a bunch of like really high-powered hardware inside your chassis you need room for it to breathe and not only that but you need like a literal like kilogram of copper inside in order to pull the heat away now I don't know that it's actually a kilogram I'm just going based on how have you this thing feels now it's not gonna have a ton of battery life because it's only got like a 53 watt hour battery or something like that but if you want this kind of performance in a form factor that's actually total this is looking pretty sweet it features a 240 hertz IPS display along with of course the hardware to actually drive 240 frames per second as well as a subjectively pretty nice feeling touchpad even if I'm not a huge fan of the keyboard one nice thing I will say about the keyboard though is that in spite of the 15.6 inch screen size you've got slim bezels and a number pad along with a webcam so I hope a soos is taking notes on that particular feature and on the subject of not a lot of battery life this is the upcoming GT 76 Titan so we were blown away when Alienware announced their area 51 M a laptop with a desktop 9900 k-8 Core processor in it well MSI is trying to do them one better with not only a desktop 9900 K along with an RT X xx 80 max performance skew graphics card in here but they are guaranteeing I have cliff from MSI's personal guarantee that every one of those 9900 case is going to be capable of 5 gigahertz all core overclocking out-of-the-box can you even believe how do you even do that in a laptop well tell you how by having 11 heat pipes with the entire bottom of the machine basically a massive mesh with four cooling fans and Counting my friends 1 2 3 4 5 cooling radiators all over the back of the freaking unit it's got a 144 Hertz 1080p or 60 Hertz 4k panel the same keyboard and touchpad combination that we saw on the radar just now pretty decent looking yo but really like none of that is the point 5 gigahertz 8 course all core turbo with an r/t X 20 80 Wow get 10% off your first purchase so thanks for watching guys don't miss any of our videos from Computex 2019 we're super stoked there's gonna be a lot of amazing launches here this year and this is just the beginning man this thing is pretty sick Oh bye thanks
