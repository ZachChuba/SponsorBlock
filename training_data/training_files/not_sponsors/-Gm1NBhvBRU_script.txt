ah man like guys and we do be honest with you I'm actually jealous of all the artwork Michael has in his house in GTA 5 it's pretty it's pretty incredible like this is actually a place in Los Santos you know there's I mean the guy she loves this painting so much it's it's actually there twice I can't believe I've only just noticed the same paintings there twice hey there guys how's it going my name is ollie and today I'm here to talk to you about the casino in GTA 5 opening out in GT online it's pretty damning time but before I do description form try them out use code only 43 alright so I'm here in the campaign a GTA 5 and it's really really exciting because apparently they are making changes to the casino online so apparently this is not all that different here we've been seeing the casino for ages I think I must have made videos about this pretty much since GT online first came out because I said opening soon and I think everyone was pretty excited that it was coming soon honestly it never came out and everyone kind of just saw I did well I guess nothing's gonna happen with it all so it raises a lot of questions with what's gonna happen with you know microtransactions can you gamble real money how is that gonna work is it kind of like because that enters a completely different ball game and makes GTA a gambling game which is like some people might see is super shady from Rockstar or taped to like it's greedy and whatnot I don't know how I feel about them offering that kind of game in here but I guess if it was in-game currency I don't think it would matter too much there's certainly no legal issues with it you know like in terms of like it's just a virtual currency so it doesn't really matter but yeah like I said the issue kind of arises when people can spend real-life money for gambling and here's the thing in GTA online all the cash is the same there is no premium currency however in Red Dead Redemption 2 there is a premium currency there's like the dollars that you pick up and also the gold bars you buy the gold bars and there's only specific items for the gold bars and that would allow if GT online made this transition the ability to have non microtransaction currency playable in the casino which would be really really cool so let's go and check out as you can see this is what it looks like in the campaign was just a random tree so random let's go o EF accepted here hmm I wonder if that's a sign you know different currency anyway let's go and have a look online and see how it's changed okay so I'm jumping on the onto the console because you can't play GTA online with a modded game obviously so luckily we're not hanging here so I won't take me too long to get back but to continue the conversation let me know in the comments section what you think of this and let me just show you the changes they've made hopefully they're still there they may have actually removed them if they have I'll definitely just show you a oh my god is there nothing in my hangar oh no no no no no let me call up my insurance hopefully they know where my stuff is but yeah I would be I'll show you the screenshots that I've seen on Twitter if nothing else comes from it but I'm pretty sure the changes will still be there but it's really exciting to me that GTA online still get in love still getting attention after Road epidemic online came out which I think fair to say let me know if you agree with me on this was a little disappointing like I haven't heard many people that play online it just I think actually honestly it's pretty good from what I played there's a lot of campaign story there it's like either DLC but it's online pretty interesting I like the fact that they're leaning into the story side of it but I just don't know many people personally that I picked up and played Red Dead Redemption online because people just shoot you for no reason and it's the same in GTA 5 the only difference with GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption is people you can't you can drive away in GTA 5 you can be in a tank but in this obviously in sorry Red Dead Redemption you I just on a horse and you just get shot and then you can't go anywhere and it sucks I hate that I hate people that shoot me down in this game that alone you read Deborah damaging so yeah I I'm glad to see them giving GT online some love okay just as I go to land I'm starting to remember why all my planes ah not in my hangar because every time I go to LAN somewhere I do this actually what I do is I just jump out but there we go scared me though okay chicken man let's go and have a little gander as changes have been made I'm still alive took a man why did the chicken cross the road I did it I put it in a video I've been waiting to do that for at least three months haha so as you can see this is so cool so they've removed the opening soon sign however this is why you might want to have a look around because they've made changes so if you go in here they start it and this is what's so awesome and it's kind of like the fort night map little changes are being made and it makes you go okay something's happening here there's no dev blog there's no story there's no reason for it but here we are as you can see this is the most excited I've ever been about signs and walking avoiding things so EF excepted here as you can see this is all a little bit more high-res now credit card exceptional value really really cool so yeah you can see they're starting to do production started do changes here and there's a skip outside so that would make me believe that this is opening soon now let's go and have a look around the back because apparently there's more changes which is exciting be warned security cameras now I don't I'll show the picture I found hopefully I can find it if not okay you'll just have to go back to the other part of video and see what is different but apparently this looks different is it taller than it was before no entirely sure but I think they may be allowing you to drive in here see if we can get in anywhere oh I see it's all like locked under secret top secret in Hannigan's isn't there's nothing else here but yeah it's really really exciting no I like to know that they're working on the casino I love casinos I think they're great obviously they're terrible for people that can't manage money but for people for people that you know enjoy the casino and stuff I think it'd be really cool for them to open this up I'd love to just play some blackjack I'd love to play poker get some friends involved I think that sounds like really good fun oh man really cool so no other changes apart from that but yeah pretty cool but yeah I just thought it was worth showing you guys let me know what you think down in the comment section below and I'll see you for another video very very soon take care bye bye what guys before I go watch this optical illusion I don't know what's going on here but as I get closer where they went what the hell is happening there I'm not sure anyway I'll see you later bye bye should I feel bad that I'd spent ten minutes whatever showing them a signpost no no they should click on this plate
