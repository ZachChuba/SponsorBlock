in the last episode of my pvp locked hardcore iron man i said this i will be attempting this fire cape with the same crossbow i'm wearing right now so here's where we left off the last episode where i said i was gonna get my fire cape with a bone crossbow let's continue on with the progress also below instagram.com ditter underscore bitter okay and this is my master plan which is actually incredibly stupid i'm going to the edge of volcano streets which are the most you know obvious chao streets that i would go to so the chances of me getting found here are extremely high but i can use a looting bag in the wilderness because so my trips will be a lot longer i'll collect a lot more herbs and in the long run as long as i don't die it'll go well looting back for a skill let's keep it going now before we carry on with this video i want to say a quick thank you to the sponsor of this video expressvpn expressvpn is a vpn service that allows you to stay protected on the internet at all times it masks your ip address so it's great for protecting yourself from ddos attacks if someone has your actual ip address they can ddos you and take your internet connection offline which could result in you losing your items while playing runescape and this is a risk you don't have to take while using expressvpn i personally use it to keep myself protected but also all the time when i'm netflix and chilling as there's a lot of content not available in new zealand i can change my countries to others around the world in order to gain access to content i wouldn't normally be able to for example in new zealand netflix there's no harry potter but in canada netflix there's harry potter they've hooked it up before and they're hooking it up again you guys can find out how to get three months free by clicking the link in the description or you guys can go to expressvpn.com you guys can get this on any device you have so i definitely recommend checking them out and once again a big thank you to expressvpn for sponsoring this video 30 range okay i may have underestimated how much food i actually need at this combat level but our loony bag is pretty much full but we have no food i'm gonna run back to edgeville and hopefully there'll be no one there at that bank and then i could just keep coming back because i don't want to log out and let people find out that i'm here okay i forgot to buy my looting bag by mistake so we still have all those herbs plus another inventory okay another inventory done haven't run into any problems yet okay another inventory we're at 38 range almost at 40 so we can buy ourselves green d height in a bit and we got a bunch of herbs more herbs we are almost 40 range as well i just hit a skeleton but we're completely out of jugs of wine so it's time to make another trip hopefully we don't get debuted out there and we can make our way back here okay we got some cash left over so we can buy green di chaps and the vamps for when we hit 40 range okay and this should be 40 range if i'm not mistaken it is we can put on our green d high not now that is a significant upgrade for now all right another inventory done if anyone catches me out here i get one hit because i walk back to edge bank instead of teleporting out i have no food but we got hella herbs stacking up the herbs and the law runes somehow all right it is time to start the herbal training we have a bunch of guano so we're just going to start off with that first okay let's make 81 attack potions okay well herblore sucks because i just made 80 attack potions i'm only at 21. okay next up we have terramin and haralander herbs okay those are all the herbs clean but i actually need 46 olympic routes to make strength potions with this so i guess we're going to go kill hill jides unless there's any other better place to get liquid roots from apparently hobgoblins are better to do and i could safe spot them in edge dungeon too so we're going to do that instead oh my god what what there's a little 54 and i panic tallied bro all right we're gonna be here for a while hopefully no one finds us and we can get like 46 or whatever is limper roots the ultimate iron man locked to pvp will just pulled up on me i don't know if i can trust him or not if someone tries to attack me because they know i'm here it's definitely going to be him but we'll see all right i've killed 80 hog gold ones i only have 10 lymphoid roots i'm at 46 range this is going very slow maybe i should learn how to do farming but i mean it's the only thing we could do right now okay first ten strength parts were made and it was twenty three herb lore okay i'm putting herb and range training on pause for a second because i've just had a revolutionary idea and if it works it's gonna play out well in the long run we are gonna make our way to pyramid go get loads of money and after that i'll show you exactly what we're gonna do to go to the pyramid i'm teleporting to cam a lot and then i am going to the gliders to algorith because i don't want to go to lumbridge and get scouted there okay i didn't see a single scout on the way here so i think we should be able to do pyramid untouched today which is nice let's go and do it oh how far we've come from the first episode which was two episodes ago 85k for one inventory and we're not done here okay up to 150k almost now just hit 50 agility okay we're out of food here so we're going to call it 200k and it's time to move on to the next part of the plan all right now the reason why i've stocked up all this cash is because i need to be buying three different things from three different places i need to be buying emeralds from the gem trader now there's only one emerald in each world and i only have access to the pvp worlds i don't know how long it takes to respond but i only have three walls to do it and i need about 16 emeralds so we're just going to be doing this over the course of the next couple hours as well as buying the other stuff we need it's just a starting three emeralds we are also very quickly going to get ourselves a ring mold as we're going to be making rings of dealings out of these the next thing we need to do is get death runes we're going to get 500 of them for now but we're going to need more in the future i'm trying to save as much gp as possible so we're going to be hopping world after every purchase all right we've got 200 for the lowest price possible we're gonna buy the rest of them later okay teleporting to camelot now we're gonna pray major just run south hopefully no one's waiting for us okay i'm not gonna be doing the next pick with literally two food in my inventory i'm gonna be buying ten buckets of sand and 10 soda ashes from every charter ship thingamajiggy that i can on each world and just stocking these up for crafting xp so i'll be back when we're done with this the good part about this is i can honestly never see myself getting attacked at port gazard because who comes to port hazard so for my rings of dueling which is what i'm going to be making i need gold bars right now i only have five which i guess i got from quest i need a total of 16 or however many rings of deal i'm going to make and the only way i can think of to get them right now is to telegraph them from under the varric west bank in every single world and that will get me four gold bars every single time i come here so now our gold bar collection is up to nine gold bars and while i'm here i'm going to go get some more death runes okay that was 500 death runs we're just gonna buy a bunch of earrings while we're here too okay and that is all the air runes for now now we're gonna go back on our emerald grind so by the time i get back here the emeralds are in stock again so i just have to switch between this and buying buckets of sand and soda ash every now and then okay it's time to go back to the chariot ships get some more buckets of sand and ash and then we're actually gonna start making it into molten glass okay final sweep after this we're making our way to port fatimatis and we're gonna start doing our crafting if i get hit here it's a wrap all right we're chilling so far okay this back is safe but everything outside it isn't i honestly doubt i'm gonna get attacked here because i don't think many people know what i'm doing right now but if i do uh rest in peace okay on the off chance someone does find me here i'm gonna have a camelot telly just to click on so i can use it instead of running back okay so i didn't get attacked at all and i got myself to 20 crafting just for making the molten glass now i'm going to blow it with a blowing pipe and that should get me to 27 crafting if i've done my calculations correctly okay and that is 27 crafting and for the life of me i cannot understand how people do this method for their zenites on their actual hardcores anyway we can now make emerald rings okay i don't know where i have these uncut emeralds from but i actually have way more emeralds than i thought i had which is very very nice let's go do this okay i don't actually have a chisel to cut these emerald woods so we're just gonna use the ones that we have we have nine gold bars and nine emeralds so far so we're just gonna make these into uh emerald rings i think this is how you do it if i'm all mistaken correct okay now i just need to go get them four more gold bars and we can make these ones as well okay time to collect the last four gold bars okay and that is the last four gold bars collected let's make these rings okay teleporting in the foul or i'm literally just gonna have the cami teleport ready if i see a red dot okay we're chilling last four emerald rings made okay level three scout here but that's not the point the point is we ought to enchant all these emerald rings and you guys may be wondering for the past couple of minutes ditter what are you doing and i'm about to show you give me like a minute okay that is all the emerald ring 13 rings for now 13 times eight i don't know how to do that math but i think that's over 100 teleports now you may be wondering why i have all these rings of dealing now i think a week or two ago jax released another shitty pvp update and they introduced the ferrox enclave into the wilderness wherever it is it's like here now there's a ring of dueling teleport to here and all the way west on the west side of the wilderness is the crazy archaeologist now if you guys know anything about iron man and crazy archaeologists that's where people go to get their room crossword drops now hence the name no prey flick i don't know how to pray flick i also don't have prayer parts yet because i got to way too lazy on the herd blood grind so my plan is to go do a crazy archaeologist kill teleport using the ring of dealing to the pharaoh's enclave where there are two altars which replay regenerate my prey and my run so i'm going to literally do one crazy archaeologist kill teleport to the enclave and run back and keep on doing this until i get my room crossbow or well i die but i'm hoping this is the master plan i don't think anyone would have thought of this because even i didn't think of it until like four hours ago so let's do this [ __ ] hopefully it works come on guys it's a master plan also i just realized in the last episode i told you guys i was gonna get my fire cape with the bone crossbow guys did any of you really believe that that was just to throw you guys off the scent okay i know i lied to you guys i'm sorry but i don't know how to do jab bro i'm not doing that [ __ ] with a bone crossbow i'm getting myself a room crossbow sorry okay i need to monk robes because otherwise i don't really think the kills are possible otherwise okay time to do our first ever crazy archaeologist kill because i don't really know what i'm doing dude i'm literally about to run out of prayer i haven't even done one kill oh my god maybe this plan was terrible i don't know was the plan terrible i'm trying to one take prey flick right now it's not working please just kill him please please please oh my god okay we got one kill done did we get a room crossbow no we didn't but we got one killed on so far and i used all our prayer points i don't know if this is gonna work we started with five less power points than we should have though so maybe it will work okay so right now there's no one here in this world which is really good because as soon as someone scouts me here they might figure out what i'm doing and that's when things go bad but as long as no one sees me leaving like this i can just run all the way back there and do a kill like that okay it basically uses our run energy to get here which honestly isn't too bad and we can just start another kill okay i'm still sussing it out but i think our prayers should be just enough to get these kills so i think this plan is gonna work no way dude no way second kill cat roon crossbow oh my god that's so nice second kc runecrossbow the plan paid off incredibly lucky i didn't even have a teleport for over 20 wilderness so if someone did attack me here i was 100 dead friendly reminder hit the us on the road to 100k subscribers all right it's time to start working on animal magnetism now that we have our room crossbow and we need to get ourselves 35 woodcutting okay and that's 15 fletching all right 35 woodcutting it's time to go get our first slayer task of the series we've also been killing imps to try and get beads for im catcher okay time to get our first slayer task we got goals so level one two four brad pitt oh my god bro the level 50 just came to follow me as i got into the bank but one two four must have been with him all right we found the ghouls or whatever i really doubt i'll get attacked here and i've only got 12 to do first toss down we're 12 slayer and we spotted solo mission again good morning good morning teleport to lumber just a little 53 with dragon knights and i guess he has the volatile stuff as well not a very good thing to be looking at right now okay i think i need to put on that toggle for harder tops because cave bugs just aren't cutting it and there is mr solo mission with this volatile nightmare stuff he figured out i was going to vanica so i logged in a little bit to the south just to see if someone would be there and lo and behold solo mission is waiting for me to train slayer what a guy okay considering solo mission and whoever else is hunting me knows that i'm doing slayer right now they know i need that slayer requirement for animal magnetism they're going to find me at ivana and my slayer toss it's way too risky to do right now so i'm going to do something even more riskier i'm going to go back to crazy archaeologists using the method we're using before now you may be wondering why i've already got my room crossbows well i need to get 38 herblore before i can get my first prayer potion but crazy archaeologist absolutely i think has a one in 15 drop rate four prayer pots they also have an amulet of power and red dehydration drop so if i pull any of those i'm going to be happy okay we're in the high risk world for this one because i don't think solomon will want to risk his volatile nightmare stuff if he does try to come hunt me so i won't get one hit anyway let's go do it 54 magic nice okay five prayer points left on that one cannon balls drop i'm not too disappointed with that okay if anyone scouts us our trip is effectively over but there's no one here right now which is very nice another kill what we're getting ourselves silver ore okay i actually had a lot of prayer left for that one and we got some more silver ore awesome i just want the world to know i'm a pvm machine red dragon hide as well we have no uses for that currently but i think that's still a nice draw all right another kill please silver or man akc please give me a prayer pot drop grimy dwarf weed malediction shard to jesus christ uh on this account on a level 43 hardcore ivan i've got the male addiction shark too i think that's the rarest drop can't even get myself a prayer part or an amulet of power drop it's a very nice drop to have i guess though very cool now i don't know if we're ever going to make the full shield out of this because that requires a lot of wealthy bossing but you never know okay just kill one a little haywire i'm not gonna lie um okay we just got it nice and more cannonballs 10kc we're gonna leave it here 300 cannonballs off crazy arc we're back for a task and there's no soul mission in sight yet okay we're good cave crawlers okay there's people in pretty much every world i just gotta trust that these two guys high-risk fighting have want nothing to do with me neither does that level 13 and we're gonna run away and go get to mount that poison some dmm strats coming in there's a super anti-poison spawn here that has a respawn time of like a minute all right let's get cave crawling okay and that is 18 slayer yes we did manage to get ourselves poisoned so we are out of here but we now do have all our animal magnetism requirements okay the first clue scroll of my life ever an easy casket what do we get gothic's page four cool third episode in 10 crazy archaeologists casey with no prayer plots roon crossbow and a male addiction shard acquired all we need for the fire cape now is prayer parts from our 37 runners and bolts for our crossbow if you guys to 100k subscribers thanks for watching and i'll see you guys in the next episode and as always if you have any suggestions on what i should do during this series in order to become a better player or just to progress faster let me know because it may be apparent i don't know what i'm doing
