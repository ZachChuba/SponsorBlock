now this is simple you can literally do this right here but this is probably the number one mistake people make when they start on YouTube tactics without a core strategy will always lead to failure or just short term bursts of success but it won't be sustainable a year later he's growing a hundred thousand subscribers that's vid IQ comm slash influence hey as you heard we are Sean and Benji and we're it fired up to get into this session today so let's dive right into it we're gonna be talking about the rapid YouTube growth plan and breakdown actually how Benji and I have been working on a kind of a side-project channel for a few years now called video influencers now on your table in your bag you actually got a copy of our book called YouTube secrets when you came to this event and so yeah thank you so much and we're excited because we're gonna be going a little bit deeper into some of those principles in this session and before we get into kind of some of the results and you know as we were talking about we've grew this channel to 500,000 subscribers the truth is we didn't start there right and Benji and I actually go back in 2010 we met in a small town an hour north of Seattle Washington at the YMCA and at the time Benji was doing real estate and I was working at my local church and actually we were in one of the hardest times of our lives now a couple years out of the recession and out of like the housing bubble Benji's going through that him and his wife for getting into youtube but they're just bootstrapping i don't know if you felt overwhelmed or like is this gonna work or any of that kind of stuff they're they're doing that on youtube meanwhile we were going through some challenges in my own life our family was facing chronic illness and different things and we connected over this passion for Mayan video and even though we were in a tough time and kind of felt like we had the wind knocked out of us back in 2010 we really had a passion and really just a vision to say man this is gonna be big like this this YouTube thing that's linked in video Instagram all this stuff like this is gonna be major and even though we're making a lot of mistakes we don't really know fully what to do we are gonna go all in to figure this stuff out and it really took us on the journey of the past ten years absolutely and speaking of struggle I just got off a red-eye so if I look a little tired excuse me but I just realized something on that flight only two types of people take a red-eye really busy people or insane people so I'm definitely busy but now I feel insane but you know speaking of struggle you know one of the reasons why I would take a red-eye here and I go back to be the best man at a wedding and then I'm gonna be back on travel for about a month is because Sean and I we love YouTube and so even in a midst of all that struggle we started our channels we kept going so over the last ten years I've been able to basically create a lifestyle around being a family vlogger and my wife and I we put up videos with our family we get to travel the world we get to do what we're passionate about as Owen mentioned I have a Cooking Channel as well Sean on the other hand you know he actually started out working with us behind the lens and he's been able to support other creators and in the last 10 years has been able to build his channel to almost a million subscribers doing this full-time and it was all because we just put in the time and we committed to this thing and now I you know we still are trying to achieve another level of success but we would have never dreamed that we'd get to where we're at but it's because we just put our head down and we focused and we stay the path yeah and it's really this sessions not just about what we've been able to achieve because that could just be kind of in a fishbowl right it might not be replicatable so the principles that we've been after we're trying to figure out how YouTube works also come from now interviewing over a hundred and fifty different video influencers whether youtubers or businessmen business women that are crushing it with video and if you ever want to see those videos those are on our channel call video influencers but even if it wasn't just their success or some of the things that we've done it's also been of course about the community and we've had the chance to connect with so many creators and entrepreneurs just like you and hear their stories and hear what's working and what isn't working because we were so passionate about coming up with a framework really like a proprietary process of what YouTube success looks like so it could be repeated again and again and this is really the question we were asking and you know it's the principles of success that we were after when we're interviewing all these people finding out what their struggles are what made them successful as well as our community so when it's all said and done those book that you have YouTube secrets it's all about those seven principles of success on YouTube so that's what's really important you know there's all kinds of things that's going to help you hack the system and grow faster but ultimately things are always changing one thing I know about YouTube because I get to go to headquarters quite often and they train my wife and I when we're on a special panel called the parent panel and one thing I know is they don't want people to hack the system they want it to be even they wanted to everybody have a fair chance so these are the principles that will outlast any short-term hacks or shortcuts that are in the system yeah and actually if you're taking notes this is a process where you can rate yourself on a scale from one to ten and let's do an overview now these are in the book but these are the repeatable principles as Benji mentioned we're actually today are going to share some hacks like some tactics but if you don't have a foundational strategy you know tactics without a core strategy will always lead to failure or just short term bursts of success but it won't be sustainable so really quick the seven C's of YouTube success or courage you got to punch fear in the face and start and then you have to have clarity you got to start with the end in mind so if you're taking notes we want you to be thinking about your business your brand how clear are you right now on a scale from one to ten on your vision of what the channel is about the brand the strategy the content strategy then of course you have to set up a channel like you're not gonna succeed on YouTube if you never start your channel and so how do you optimize your channel and set it up then content that's the videos that are coming out regularly there but it doesn't stop there you tubes unique cuz it's about community and in business it's about community as well look we do business with people we know like and trust and so it's about actually connecting deeper with your community and then how do you monetize and actually in the book there's 10 different ways and so that's cash and then finally consistency because it's one thing to post one a video this week but how do you sustain it over the long haul and so throughout this presentation be thinking about this framework kind of maybe rating yourself and what we've learned is that if you go honestly I'm like a 3 on clarity right now I don't really know the vision of my channel if you can bring that 3 to an 8 it will change the game for you absolutely raise your hand if you're looking to start a YouTube channel right now and you don't have one raise your hand if you have a YouTube channel and you want it to grow and you want to get more subscribers awesome you know throughout our time on YouTube and interviewing different people and meeting creators and people they're just starting out on this platform the number one challenge people have is fear fear of the camera fear of judgement so that's why we started with this see courage because it's so important to just Lily hit record upload and start learning what it takes so one of our favorite creators that we've interviewed is a someone named John Kohler he's all about gardening literally this guy is so passionate raise your hand if you know who he is yeah probably some of the gardening channels in here right he can literally talk about tomato plants for an hour and you actually want to listen to him like you'll want to like pick up worms and make dirt in your backyard yes you do have to make dirt like that's what compost is right but he's amazing but we love how he started he didn't know how to edit he didn't know anything about thumbnails he didn't even really know how to work a camera so when he first started it was his really basic camcorder that I think he bought used he doesn't even edit he just shoots a straight video that think about that he doesn't even edit and he just put it up to YouTube in I'd say like well five six years later half a million subscribers last year or a couple years ago when we met him and he just grew a hundred thousand subscribers in the last 12 months 6,000 per month in subscribership this is what's awesome about John he still doesn't edit he just records he'll move the camera to somewhere else in the backyard record himself and he just stitches it all together he might cut off the front part but as you can see the the actual length of the video they're really long now YouTube loves that by the way so this is why if you have a passion for something or you're an expert or you're a business person that has a lot of experience and a wealth of knowledge and you can you have the chops to just talk it up for an hour people will watch that are interested in that niche or in that topic whatever it is that you're recording about so that's why we love John and ultimately you know what's important to learn from John is you just got to get started don't worry about your gear don't worry about like what software is best stop overthinking it and use what you have to get started because to this day years and years later John's still doing the same thing but still growing yeah we love the quote from Zig Ziglar that says you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great and so you got to just punch fear in the face punch of perfectionism in the face and then press record but for some of you in the room you're like now I got this you know the courage thing I already started I only got a hundred videos on my channel but we want to challenge you that every single one of these C's has a deeper level and the deeper level of the courage C would be what's the next level of courage for you are you playing it safe have you maybe gotten a little comfortable in your content to us we really believe a power tip here is actually having a polarizing point of view that to stand out online it's important to stand for something and to really actually take a stand if you're just in the middle then you just can get sucked away in the noise and that sometimes there's maybe something you want to talk about related to your business a polarizing point of view related that's opposite of what your industry thinks we would encourage you to lean into that because it really breaks through the noise when you're polarizing one of the best illustrations of this is Benji was able to interview Mariah King who's a fitness content creator and she was you know building her business but she talked about how controversy can actually help grow your channel now this wasn't really a strategy it was just her being herself that's what we want you to do you don't need a beast like somebody else be Utah to be your authentic self and put out what you actually believe what do you believe about the universe to be true what do you believe about your industry that's maybe unique and so for her she really blew up her brand when she put out this image as her brand is fitmom and and after having all these kids she put this out and it was like what's your Excuse well not everybody like that and and some people were like we you know we hate you were so upset how could you do that you're shaming us but the thing is it also attracted her to people that said yeah okay thanks for the challenge and she credited that to being the thing that blew up her brand could there be a breakthrough moment and your YouTube channel your brand in your business by actually standing for your polarizing point of view again if you want to stand out you got to stand for something you don't want to be vanilla right you want to take a stand be extreme in one direction or extreme in the other direction not just for extreme sake but so that you can stand out in the sea of noise online right now and then another example of this is picking a fight is that we've learned especially on YouTube and and sometimes this can be very practical that when you just kind of compare two things or you actually stand in the middle of a polarizing topic it can really help you stand out so on my tech channel I recently posted a video about the new canon g7x and a sony camera and as you can see in the thumbnail Canon verse Sony two cameras next to each other right and it was one of the most viewed videos on my channel recently why because I was picking a fight and I could even speak to both sides I don't even necessarily have to make a definitive statement but she had people in the comments can i names better Sony's better and I'm like I'm getting views man I like this you know we we did this one IG TV came out and we just we jumped on it the day it was announced we were at VidCon last year we shot a video and to this day that video name ranks number one for that comparison because we jumped right into a middle of a fight so think about the next level of courage for you yeah you know and the the next C is clarity now this is simple you can literally do this right here but this is probably the number one mistake people make when they start on YouTube they don't have clarity they don't know who they're reaching out to I mean any of the business people marketers know like it's important to know who's your customer who is it that you're actually trying to reach on social media so make sure you write all this down on a little napkin like it should be that simple for Sean and I it was simply interviewing other youtubers who have had success and sharing their stories on the platform as well as talking about our experiences and that's what we did for five years and that's what got us to half a million subscribers on video influencers which by the way we're not saying this to impress you but to impress upon you that video influencers was a part time thing and it was successful because of these principles so till right now if you have a piece of paper and if you already know this you should still write it down who is it that you're trying to reach what kind of content you're gonna create to reach them and what is your goal what is your goal for them what do you want to help them achieve whether it's entertaining them to make them laugh whether it's solving a problem in their life write all that down so that you have that clarity it's literally just three points and so one great example of this actually recently and raise your hand I have a feeling I know what the answer is but how many of you guys are gamers in here oh wow there are some gamer that's pretty awesome right but recently I met somebody at VidCon raise your hand if you've been a VidCon a lot of younger people a lot of youtubers there's a creator and he has a channel named skip the tutorial and what I love about him is you know he actually met Sean about a year ago and he would kind of like a variety Channel and he wasn't growing he wasn't getting subscribers he was barely getting any views and he asked Sean's like hey you know watch your channels I'm trying to learn but nothing's working raise your hand if you can relate to that you're putting up content you're not getting the views and subscribers so Sean took a look at his channel and his number one piece of advice was have a little bit more clarity be a little bit more focused pick a niche so this kid by the way 17 years old okay in a gaming community that is super competitive and that was the best piece of advice because a year later he's grown a hundred thousand subscribers because instead of just doing every challenge out there all the things that gamers are doing in that community he just said hey I'm gonna pick a niche and his niche was I'm gonna win games with like a weird strategy so he wins gains just with his voice voice commands or he won't use coins on Super Mario Bros brothers I don't play game so I don't know what that means but I guess it's entertaining right so the point is he's growing 8000 subscribers a month uploading about I think 2 times a month and the number one piece advice you can take from that even though he's gaming he's 17 years old sometimes the best advice comes from another niche or another crowd in your industry is pick the niche what is the specific type of content the specific demographic or audience that you're going to try to reach out to because that is actually the best way to start growing fast and getting subscribers and setting yourself apart from the competition and so you need to plan and that's why this is the rapid growth plan and this is what we did for video influencers so we encourage answer these questions let's do the work come on video marketing world like let's actually think through our brands who's your content for what problem does it solve right for us we call this our napkin plan because we just thought okay people that want to learn video entrepreneurs and business minded content creators that want to learn video then we thought okay what is the problem that we solved well how do you use YouTube how do you turn your camera on Wow does the algorithm work endless questions so we thought okay there's the consistent value that we'll deliver but then also when are you going to deliver it and so our plan was one interview video a week and one tip video a week and so it started out just a Skype call it's brought someone on that's benji and timothy delaghetto have a friend that he'd had doing YouTube and just brought him on audio was terrible we'd have any music going on no editing happening we started just a few years ago but we just stuck with this simple napkin plan and just kept doing it over and over sometimes we missed a week whatever start the next week sometimes we missed a couple weeks but then we just jump back on it and we stuck to the plan look at your neighbor and say stick to the plan tell Matt look at the person on the other side and say you really need to stick to the plan I know you you're one of those yeah which brings us to our next C and that is channel so you know obviously there's seven C's we don't want to dive deep into each one but to simply put a channel as this think about your profile picture thing about your banner think about the images the the words of phrases you use because you want that all to line right whatever it is that you stand for you want that to be represented in every aspect of what you do on YouTube but you really need to consider is you're building a brand now if you're a business person I'm sure you're already thinking that way but oftentimes people get in the content you should always be thinking about that as well as a youtuber one of the number one ways I was able to stand out and I actually started originally supporting my wife with her YouTube channel was I knew in the beginning we need to build a brand so that we could set ourselves apart from all the other creators in a very competitive niche so it's really important that you make a first impression that people are gonna remember yeah absolutely and that brings us to the next C which is content now this is the one that everything rises and falls on you need all these other ones to get it set up right and if you're missing any of the C's then it's just not gonna work but content is the heart of the whole thing if you're not uploading videos on YouTube you're not gonna have much success on YouTube right so you actually have to like post videos now we I want to give you five specific tips that you're actually not even gonna find in the book that we've been most passionate about lately and the first one is think of the audience first you know recently I was hanging out with Gary at his office and I just had one question to ask him and we actually want to play a video for you guys to show you what his answer was when it comes to this C which is the content Gary Vaynerchuk gave thing for yeah Gary Vaynerchuk are you putting out entertainment or are you putting out education because 90% of people are putting out selfish content and what was your question started from zero versus somebody that has resources or team or already started building in Islam you know it's kind of one in the same like it's kind of like back to something we talked about before which is like making the best thing for the end audience I have synthesized my thoughts and to entertain an education that has become very clear to me that either you're doing entertainment or you're doing education and I actually do think that certain people like myself when you're doing entertainment and education you can really get crazy but that's what I would say I would say to somebody with resources a four-person team or like look forget about everything else because look I did all I did all my content by myself for seven years people forget that like Oh easy for you to say I'm like I'm like you're not you know it's that iceberg yeah I'm like you see I'm like you know I'm like you see me now I think it's about are you putting out entertainment are you putting out education because 90% of people are putting out selfish content 90% of people are putting out press releases they want to they want you to think something about them they're making it selfish for themselves they wanted to go to Maui and serve so that's the content you're getting but did that bring you any value they want you to think they're cool ninety percent of the content right now are people acting like PR agents of themselves I'm asking people to look like educators or entertainers do you think about the audience first or don't you this all boils down to literally one word that has been the thing that we follow for everything we do which is value what is the value that you are delivering to the end viewer right set aside that they might be a customer or potential client what value are you gonna deliver you know I come from a background of real estate and real and raise your hand if you're a real estate agent because I'm about to clown on you guys a little bit I was one okay so I can do it one of the first thing real estate agents do is hey this is my phone number you can find me in this office and this is what I can do for you rather than actually helping the person watching the video and I was actually able to build a business a 7-figure real estate business off of this concept of delivering value first even on youtube and what I did was I just had tutorials about questions people had for real estate how to price a house how to find an agent how to buy and inspect a REO or bank-owned property that value is what led to the opportunity so many people were trying to promote themselves like Gary just mentioned his book crush it actually changed everything for Shaun and I and the one thing we got out of it was deliver value so ask yourself what value are you delivering in that video that you're posting on to YouTube if you start with that and you end with that you're gonna win yeah tip number two after thinking about the audience first is the title thumbnail content combo like these three things are they got to work together man you got to get these things married and just really gelling together and there's really a synergy between all three so here's kind of a case study from our channel recently and this is the exact title how to make more money on YouTube with less subscribers I don't even think it's fully grammar grammatically correct but there's a reason for doing it and and then there's the thumbnail which also does not repeat all the words in the title that was intentionally designed now we had a guest named Pat Flynn in there and it was make money with a small channel now here's what went into that first of all we always start with research first research before you press record and one of our favorite tools is called vid IQ so they have a keyword research tool that's on the web app and what's amazing is you could take your idea of whatever your you're thinking about researching you put it in there and it'll show you not just the google search volume you could do that with a couple other tools but it shows you the YouTube search volume so very powerful and that'll start give you some of the key words and phrases for coming up with how to title your video that would be step one then from there we actually take it to a really cool tool called the headline analyzer on Co schedule com now this is free and there's a couple out there love this one now what this one is doing for you is it's actually giving you a score based on is there the right power words in there how well is the title written so we foundationally build it off of keyword research but then we want to stop talk to humans more and more and more you don't want to over optimize for the machine because Google wants human optimization so there's the foundation of the keywords and then there is the titles now this is how many titles that I actually planned out in coming up with this video there's 11 different titles brainstorming and then I put them in there and and and and so you see the green ones scored the highest all their nuances now we were actually Pat Flynn was sharing some tips about his new book called superfans so one of the titles was like how to turn your YouTube subscribers into superfans but we're like debating like who knows what a superfan is you know whatever so the pivot to the actual title of the video was was very different than the literal information in the video in fact we wanted to have it be more of a cliffhanger that's a big thing like interesting like how do you actually make more money with less subscribers secondly it's not just the features of something right business owners it's the benefits so what is actually the ambition of the individual watching well of course I want to make more money like do I want superfans well maybe I do I don't know if I do or not so a lot of thought went into the combination right then on top of that write this down the most important part I believe of your video once they get into it is gonna be that first 10 to 40 seconds why we call it the hook because if you don't hook the viewer in the beginning then it doesn't matter if you share the life-changing secret of the universe at minute 7 if they never make it to that that secret of the universe then their life will never be changed so it is a lot of pressure to actually just think deeply about how you're gonna start the video to pitch the value of the video to hook the viewer and so that's then part of the combo and that led us to the final combination of the actual title having done keyword research it ranks for that by the way number 5 recently so it's getting evergreen traffic and it's being viewed and then one mistake we also notice is that sometimes we have a long title in our video and we just repeat the whole thing in the thumbnail don't do that think about how you can compliment what's in the title what with what is also in the thumbnail so we knew that people that you have a small channel that's you're trying to make money we thought well that doesn't fit in the title hey we can use in the thumbnail so see how they play together they don't need to echo each other it's the three-way combination that'll make a major impact look at your neighbor and say do the combo look at your other neighbor and say I'm kind of tired after lunch I'm disgusting that like thing it's kind of tiring okay really quick couple more tips number three number three there's some content tips upload upload time I love what Tim shared earlier I would totally agree you'll hear some varying opinions about this but here's just a real practical way to do it timing is everything right timing is everything in business timing is everything on YouTube timing is everything we love vid IQs tool that actually studies and shows you when your subscribers are most engaged and so if you look on that little graph on the right side of the screen you can actually see those blue kind of population like that's the peak times of when your subscribers are online now some people like to just say hey Tuesday morning at 8 p.m. that's when the video comes out that's fine I don't know you you could overthink this but over the past couple months actually we've been going literally by the time of this now on think media Monday Tuesday when days Wednesdays hot Wednesday Thursday Friday is a little bit weaker and then there's a little bit happening on the weekends and the peak time is 2 a.m. so what I do is I get up at 2 a.m. and I just kidding there's a feature called a schedule upload feature and so we've been testing this it has been insanity why because we're hitting probably an international audience plus East Coast following the exact time we're told to upload but then the video rides throughout the day regardless and so we've been just literally following that tool because we don't even understand how it works it's just cool that the tool is powerful and and then it's been producing crazy results on both channels just following those and trying to upload on the optimal day from when your subscribers are ultimately online why because velocity matters so when you release a video if you can get as much traffic and views on it as quick as possible you have a better chance of it continuing to grow number for really quick double down on what's working and these are all kind of just some quick things that we love coming out of a vid IQ as well but here's here's the thing once you've put out videos who here is put out more than 10 videos raise your hand well actually how about more than 20 raise your hand awesome so in your YouTube analytics it'll always tell you your top videos what we love about that you could just do this basically without any tools it's just go in there and say man what's working why don't I do more of that and then what's you know what are in those top 10 let me do a part two of that or let me go deeper into that topic and there's actually a tool inside of vid IQ called the channel audit tool this is just makes it easier as well literally tells you content to double down on these are the videos getting a lot of views per hour these are the videos that are driving the most subscribers and so even when you're like I don't understand this tech stuff I don't know what's going on it just makes it dead simple so you can make smart decisions about the next video you're putting out and then of course stop what's not working like it has a whole section that like hey these aren't doing is good these ones actually you lost a lot of subscribers on which maybe that's ok with you because you want to put out the video but maybe not maybe you're like shoot I really want data so that's a great resource and if you actually want to check out vid IQ we're an affiliate but we've been using them for years before we ever knew them and we're part of the team absolutely love the tool and you can actually get 30 days free video comm for it slash influence if you would want to leverage some of the power in that tool any thoughts Benji before number five you know this is the thing we come from different worlds and there's so many different types of content creators on YouTube these principles absolutely are working right if all that was a lot for you to take in and we definitely would suggest you apply them the three things you need to remember is this number one it's all about the content so as long as you're improving the content getting better making those watch times longer and longer secondly think about that title like really think like what is a title that's gonna make people entry to click through and then the third one is thumbnail take time my wife and I were vloggers and she will spend like three to four hours editing a vlog but still spend twenty to sixty minutes actually editing the thumbnail because that image is the advertisement for what's in your content there's no point in creating great content if the thumbnail isn't gonna sell it so make sure that lines up with the title and the content and then you definitely will see improvement inside of your guy's views and subscribers yeah and actually because we want to take some time for Q&A let's jump into community benji and we'll skip that tip number five so the thing about community is i learned this from my wife who actually started on youtube was a person that got me into it initially when she first started she actually just stacked a whole bunch of shoe boxes up a little like $50 digital camera and experience and ten years later not only is she one of the first Asian American influencers as a beauty person creating videos and making lifestyle around it probably arguably one of the most famous moms on the platform now we're family bloggers all because of her and how she got started one thing that set her apart and I learned early on and Shawn and I actually we observed this and realize this is what really sets youtubers apart from other types of influencers you know if content is a heart of YouTube then community is a soul and she would literally spend hours and hours after she uploaded and went on social media and like distributed and advertiser content engaging with people replying back to people commenting on other people's comments that community was so important a lot of people you know we're talking up here about gaining subscribers but don't forget about them once they subscribe to you acknowledge them make sure you build that community that is the foundation of success that's gonna get you more likes get more comments and one example of this is my wife early on she celebrated him by the way she's got about two million plus subscribers now between her two channels but even have 400 she was celebrating that and she didn't yeah she probably never thought she'd get to a million subscribers I think she actually was tearing up she was actually crying when she realized there's 400 people that want to spend their time watching my videos so remember that community that is so important and acknowledge them by replying to them leaving comments because that time is precious yeah and then the sixth C of YouTube success is cash so many different ways to monetize but you've got the book now so you can study out those ten different ways and we'd love to maybe talk in Q&A and then the final one is consistency because it's one thing to just start these things but how do you sustain them and make them you know something that you can add to your business without taking over your business over the long haul and our biggest piece of advice is create smart systems like you need a system right a system for creating videos or batching content maybe who does what by when if you're building a team really thinking through some of these things and we actually have a resource if you want to check that out in a video training about how we batch videos Benji and I have been he lives in Seattle and I live in Las Vegas and so we will get together sometimes at events like this and try to shoot five to ten videos we'll shoot them in the hotel rooms we'll do different interviews we use live streaming so it's like how do you actually sustain all this we've got a lot of tips in our entire process that we've been refining over the last decade if you want to grab that if that's whatever the you are smart video checklist calm and just like a PDF and a video training that I think will be very valuable and you'll enjoy that you know we always talk about this you know YouTube's a marathon not a sprint if you don't already know this you're definitely gonna soon find out in business you got to be committed long term don't get me wrong we are all about those short term wins but if you want longevity and consistency in your life in your business you have to be committed and we tell people be committed to uploading for two years without maybe any traction now if you're gonna follow the tips by the way Sean is the best when it comes to ranking videos titling thumbnail likely when I listen to them talk sometimes my brain I'm like wow I can't believe I just like consumed all that information he's like a supercomputer if you put those practices or those principles into practice you are gonna see traction but it's gonna take some time not everybody is gonna be a good editor not everybody's gonna be able to shoot footage the way you know a Sean is or a videographer does but you're gonna learn over time so be committed to the long haul because trust me you know Sean and I actually YouTube secrets funny story we thought that was gonna take six months or write four years later it's Alex right one year after that it's on this table so we were committed even though we thought it was gonna be six months and YouTube is just the same definitely we want you to win in six months but it might take you a few years but it's absolutely worth it because influence is the key and that's why we start our cast raise with influence when you build influence which in this case is subscribers there's so much
