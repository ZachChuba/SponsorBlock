curiosity stream hey so if you've come from Corpus you already know that this topic was not my own idea I'm totally jumping on his video idea as we both thought it will be super interesting to research and it was if you haven't already seen this video you should go check it out links are all down below so cancer is on arguably one of the worst things that can happen to a person I mean a lot of bad things can happen to a person but cancer is just it's just horrible it's very scary it's the number two cause of deaths in Americans second only to heart disease according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but have you ever thought which one is the okay estate if you could ever even think like that so first off we're gonna see which cancer is the least and most severe and then we're gonna have a look at why obviously though every person is different everyone responds to treatment differently some of the same types of cancers can be more aggressive in some people and others there are over a hundred different types of cancer and different types of cancer can vary widely in their prognosis while the stage of cancer at diagnosis is most relevant to the survival of an individual patient the type of cancer does suggest an overall general survival rate of the general public so for now we are only talking about averages so the average survival rate that is associated with a certain type of cancer but let's start with a nice guys so statistically speaking the counsellor is going to do the least damage its prostate cancer with their survival rate over five years of 98.6% and we are going to use survival over five years as a yardstick to how severe a cancer can be it could be argued that breast cancer in situ is the least damaging as it has a hundred percent survival rate after five years but it is not really a true cancer as it isn't invasive but prostate cancer rates are higher in developed countries than in the rest of the world and this is generally because people live longer in developed countries and eat more red meat the availability of screening for prostate cancer by checking for PSA also means that there is a higher detection rate and as with all cancers are quicker you find it the better the so because screening for PSA is relatively common in men over 50 in the UK I mean you can just go and ask for it to be carried up for free it can be detected earlier and not spread and therefore not be as dangerous as some other cancers so it could be argued that the reason why prostate cancers is one of the better cancers to get is because it is generally called earlier if it has spread or metastasize by the time that it is diagnosed then five-year survival rates hit 29 percent which is still better than some other cancers and that linked me on to the bad ones so diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma is a tumor that is found in the middle of the brainstem it is a brainstem glioma and the nasty thing about these tumors is that they grow in the Middle's of brain stem and therefore in the middle of the nerves i'm therefore cannot be surgically removed and this is because surgery would cause severe damage to neural structures a vital for arm and leg movement a movement swallowing breathing and even consciousness so radiotherapy is the main form of treatment for this cancer but unfortunately is not generally effective or as effective as you would like it to be although 75 to 85 percent of patients show some improvement in their symptoms after radiation therapy the tumor almost always begins to grow again it has a 5-year survival rate of less than 1% i'm the median overall survival of children diagnosed with this counsellor is only 9 months which sucks and there are many other cancers that are super interesting to read about - you should definitely look them up if you like learning about health and disease and if you love check it out and tell me what you think and a big thank you to my patreon some patreon and thank you for watching bye
