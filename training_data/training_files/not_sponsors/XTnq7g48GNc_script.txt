what is going on you guys it is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new Ironman related loot video for you all today so today I bring you a video that took just over a month to complete ladies and gentlemen this is loot from 3000 woodcutting Guild intz now the goal for this video was to get as many logs as possible as well as obtaining 99 woodcutting but before we get into that we do have some quick words from a new sponsor of ours game oils essential oils a Wilmes for natural wellness and healing but current products aren't made for gamers now there's a better

that true victory feeling like you'll never know unless you check out the description below and a huge thank you to Rage shadow legends for sponsoring today's video all right so I know that was a very long ad and I do apologize but the support is much needed at this moment so I hope you guys can understand that should only be seeing an ad like that maybe every couple months so it's not too much hopefully but getting into today's Ironman loot video though 3,000 ents and these were all killed and chopped in the woodcutting guild as most of you know ends are also found in the wilderness you know near the corporal beast caves southwest of vin and natus north of the chaos altar you know area like those however since this is an Ironman video I didn't really think it was necessary to attempt any dangerous anti peeking so I just stuck with the ones in the woodcutting guild and the upside of this is that there's no P cares here unless you're in a PvP world so it's a very safely back environment and once I got used to it I could even make it a pretty a of cable experience I will say though the one downside is that these hints you only get one log per one shop and the incent the wilderness you receive two logs per one shop or in other words double the amount of logs so by the time we get to the price check at the very end of the video if you want to compare the amount of logs to what we would have seen if we would have chopped them in the wilderness and all you have to do is just multiply all the logs that we receive by two and it is also important to note that you also chopped the logs 15% faster in the wild compared to the wood cutting guild but since I was such high wood cutting coming into this video starting at 98 and I did have a dragon axe unlocked I really wasn't stressing the speed of cutting the logs and if you are curious as to how I was tracking 3000 nth kills as you might have seen me type out in the chat box basically any time that you kill an int you get about 319 strength XP so I was just going to multiply 319 by 3000 and then I was gonna add all that XP to my strength tracker so that as soon as I reach that XP milestone whatever that number may have been which I think it was like fourteen point two mil then at that point we would know that 3000 ents would have been killed and I made sure not to do anything else during the course of this video so this account was really just stuck at intz for over a month and the reason that it was over a month just to finish off 3000 was mainly because of the chopping part more so than the killing because ends are only 75 HP and even though I was just using a dragon skinny nothing too powerful I was killing them pretty quickly it's just after you killed him you have to chop the trunk for at least I'd say maybe 30 to 45 seconds sometimes up to a minute and that's where you spend most of your time so it's really just the mechanics of how you can get the logs from the in so if you just killed the int and then all the logs were just there noted then obviously this would have been a lot faster but you just have to chop it right after the kill and that's how you obtain all the logs isn't pretty sure you will see that during this video at least at some points and another cool thing you know since it is a tree they do drop bird nests so I was collecting those from start to finish all the seed nests as well as the egg as well as the jewelry so you will see a lot of bird nests being collected and you know ants are not known for their XP I will definitely say this is not a good way to train your wood cutting you will see the wood cutting XP that I gained during this video was very minimal I think we started with just about 80 k XP till 99 woodcutting and you are about to see me achieve 99 woodcutting very shortly and I do think it's really cool to achieve 99 s during a looot video I'm really glad that I stayed at so many 98 s on this account because of that reason because of that I get to have cool moments like this where I get to get 99 s during the course of just killing a monster and here we are with 99 woodcutting on the iron man account big shout-out to the twitch chat i was live-streaming at this point just on the side on the iron man I never really mainstreamed the iron man account it's more so just always in the bottom corner just kind of on its own but yeah it was really nice to see that 99 woodcutting accomplished a last loot video on this iron man account I do believe we got 99 range during it and you might also see another 99 being picked up in the next loop video for this account which is loot from 10,000 and coos and currently for that video I got 7000 killed and 3,000 to go so I'm really liking the trend with all the 99 s during the videos getting back to the ends after 99 woodcutting was accomplished I did switch over from a fire cape to a wood cutting cape because a perk of the wood cutting cape is that you do have more of a chance to get bird nests so I thought that it would be useful for the sake of the video to get as many bird nests as possible and also flex that amazing a green and brown shrimp wood cutting Cape so this point in the video you will see the wood cutting Cape remain until the very end and when it comes to banking you know certain inventories were longer lived than others sometimes I would have up to a thousand logs in my inventory other times I would Bank when I'd have like 200 magic logs max and the reason for this is because sometimes I would just get hit more than others a really big part about killing in sand the wood cutting guild is all about aggression basically when you're there for I think it's up to 15 minutes so they stop attacking you and you have to start attacking them like manually clicking them but for those first 15 or first 20 minutes whatever the amount of time is you do take a lot of damage because whenever you're chopping a trunk you're always gonna have another surrounding in attacking you and you can't really do anything about it because if you start attacking the end and you stop chopping the trunk then you will stop receiving logs and that trunk will despawn though the reason I wore such high defensive stuff for example barrows Armour and a dragon fire shield as well as being a super defense pod it was because these ends hit very accurately they don't really hit too high but they hit very accurately that's why I would also bring so much food during this video and during inventories because you would constantly be getting hit and if you ran out of range of the three to four inch that are near the entrance then they would get re aggro'd and constantly hit you while you were finishing up a trunk so you would be taking some pretty heavy damage a lot of sharks were used in the making of this video and that is why I did go with the dragon fire shield rather than the dragon defender because you know you're not gonna have too much trouble killing these ends but chopping them that is another story completely and another nice thing about the wood cutting guild is that there's actually an altar right outside the entrance to this cave so every single time I would Bank I would always make sure to click on that altar right before I went in and that way I could pray preserve the whole entire trip and my boosted stats because of that super set strength attack and defense would be boosted for twice as long so you always gotta take advantage of things that are around you and to gain access into this wood cutting guild you do need 75% his city is favored as well as at least 60 wood cutting so it is important to keep that in mind really don't need a high combat level to get into this area because you can save spot these ends from the outside branch I don't really recommend doing that because you really can't chop the tree from a distance you can only kill it from a distance so although I did see a few lower levels training there range here really only two to three people throughout a month's time so it wasn't like it this is a popular area or anything and a little bit about the inst themselves they were released into the game June 2nd 2016 pretty much the best time of my life and the combat level does the same around the game at 86 you will find them in the wilderness at 86 and in the guild at 86 the max hit is a 17 and they do use crush you can save spot them as I mentioned before but it is a little annoying to set it up so it wouldn't recommend it and obviously your wood cutting level does matter the higher your wood cutting level is the better the logs you're going to get that's why you see me with the most logs out of them all being magic because I'm 99 woodcutting and I just have a lot better odds at getting the best logs so yeah this is important to note that the higher the wood cutting you are the better the logs the better the profit you get per hour and again if you do decide to take the risk and do these in the wilderness if you're a main I definitely would recommend that because I've got to say I don't think a lot of people PK at the ends I know there are some peak errors around vinden Attis and of course the Kaos altar sometimes the Corp cave but not really around the area of where InSAR so you really can look into that I don't think that a lot of people kill wood cutting guild ends for that reason not a lot of people chasing end killers in the wilderness so it is something to keep in mind and this in general is a very afk able laid-back experience once you get the hang of it and once you know where to click you don't want to click to West and you don't want to click to north because like I said you will go out of range of the ends so I just stay very close to the entrance and even if I happen to get unpadded and I run out of supersets as long as I'm not taking a lot of damage I don't really mind being unpause and just staying there and as I see the strength XP gradually increasing that's how you know we're getting closer and closer to finishing this video this was a long grind you know how to renew my membership twice on during it and that's how you know it took a while although I really haven't been playing as much as I used to I did start this video in New Jersey and I ended it when I moved back here so yeah it's crazy this video was state to state you know it just took such a long time and overall you know every time you do get a log from an entry you only get 25 woodcutting xp so it's not the greatest and when we get to the end of the video you will see just how little xp we did get in a month's time from an hour to hour basis I would imagine that this video took well over 100 hours to make just because of how slow these ends are and all the chopping that took place really does take a lot of time that's why you don't see a lot of people killing ends but again double the logs in the wilderness maybe that would make it a lot more worthwhile I'm not too sure but maybe in the future we can do a comparison video it sure is an exotic way to Train wood cutting and to collect logs especially for you iron men accounts you know it's really nice to see that there's different ways to train your skills even if it's not skilling itself like for example you know you can just kill a tree and get slow wood cutting XP from it then there's of course is all Kano with mining and there's the HISP Ori with farming it just seems to me as the years go by there's always different methods coming out to train at these same skills in runescape you know no new skills coming out yet but there's always new methods to train the current skills so I don't know what do you guys think about that and as we are nearing the price check I do have one slight correction from earlier you do have to have the medium wilderness Diaries completed in order to receive that 15% boost while chopping the intz in the wild so that is something to keep in mind if you apologize that I didn't notice that before and obviously if you were doing wilderness Slayer and you were killing the in sin the wild you would have chances at Larenz Keys as well as you know Scrolls among many different drops so you do have it's a little bit of a different drop table from those ends compared to these but overall in the grand scheme of things we're really just here for the logs to see just how many logs we can get and we are about to find that out because here we are three thousand kills three thousand ents later many many weeks later as well ending the video at just about thirteen point seven four million wood cutting XP so I think we got just over 800 K wood cutting XP from this video or so definitely not the greatest way to train your wood cutting but we did receive a ton of logs we did actually pull off 99 woodcutting and we got a lot of bird nests so open so let's go ahead and check out the bank tab see what the overall result is do the price check and we'll go from there alright so the bird nests first we did get close to 100 seated bird nests as well as 33 with the Rings inside and then just about 5 with some eggs which I'm not too sure if they're ever gonna be hatched into birds one day but let's hope and if you guys were curious yes I do have full lumberjack and yes I do have the beaver pet on this account I achieved both of those things many many years ago but during the making of this video I didn't really think it was necessary to flex those seeds are definitely adding up as well as the cost of the actual nests themselves and of course the jewelry so we'll make sure to add those into their own price check and that can be added on top of the amount that we get from the logs of course those eggs are untradable but the overall amount just from the seeds it doesn't look like we pulled off anything too rare but we did make just about four hundred and fifteen K from the seeded nests so I'll take it you know it's a little extra no magic seed or anything like that but I think we walked away with at least a palm so I'll take it as it goes for the nest that just have the jewelry in them I didn't really price check that because I think it's no more than like 30k or so and it is now time to price check the logs that we did receive from 3000 intz as well as four hundred and thirty K approximately in the amount of seeds as well as jewelry just in the nest we got about five hundred and eighty four K and in total with the logs included we are walking away with rounded up just about nineteen point four mil plus the 400 K it comes out to be nineteen point eight mil from three thousand wood cutting guild ents obviously if you multiply that by to say you did all this in the wilderness you didn't want to come to the wood cutting guild you would have made 40 mil from three thousand wood cutting guild inch or I should say three thousand wilderness sense and yeah of course your wood cutting level does matter it does come into play you're not gonna get a lot of XP from these things but you will get a lot of logs and a decent amount of nests as well so with all that being said ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for watching the video I know it was a long one for more reasons than one but thank you so much for your guys support I will see you soon with loot from 1000 revenant dragons 1000 sire and after that a whole lot of awesome videos so thank you guys and until next time mr. no sleep Oh
