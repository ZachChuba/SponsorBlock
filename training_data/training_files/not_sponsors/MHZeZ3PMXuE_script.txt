As soon as Junhong was about to start his opening remarks... [Nakyung] Oh, It's hot!! Fire!!! [Angelina] I saw it! [Angelina] I think we should give an applause to Nakyung for making the best seafood soup! Seafood soup! Win! No matter how full you are, you can eat dessert! [AleXa] Dalgona coffee!! [Angelina] I think it started in Korea. Dalgona coffee made by stirring 400 times.. Dalgona Coffee Recipe Dalgona Coffee Recipe- 1. instant coffee, water, sugar for 1:1:1 and mix it. 2. Stir like crazy. At least 400 times... 3. Put coffee cream on top of milk or soy milk. [Junhong] This album took a long time to prepare. [Junhong] I thought it would be great to be done.. [Junhong] I have a great feeling of regret. [AleXa] Yes, right. [Junhong] This time, all the singers performed without an audience. [Junhong] I'm sorry about that, but... No audience this time (because of COVID-19) [Angelina] We had this schedule almost every day... [Angelina] So as soon as the activity was over, I felt a little lonely. Angelina was lonely because she had to leave the staff who were with her almost every day. [Junhong] What was the most memorable moment? [AleXa] Um... First comeback stage. [AleXa] First day of Do or Die and first day of Kitty Run. [Junhong] It's actually my first time in the entertainment business with AleXa, but...

[AleXa] Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh [Junhong] Acting? [AleXa] Oh acting! Yes! Nobody knows. The day could come when AleXa gets an Oscar. [Nakyung] I'm finally done! [Junhong] Mine is almost like soybean paste! [Nakyung] What should we do with this? [Junhong] After 46 years, I've been wearing working pants, touching eels... [Junhong] Grilling the meat (actually the cameraman grilling the meat.) [Junhong] Let's have a toast! [EVERYONE] Cheers! [Junhong] Oh?!?!?! [AleXa] It's great! [Junhong] It tastes like Starbucks coffee sold at convenience stores! The perfect Guryongpo night is getting deeper. [Angelina] Um... Now feel it! AleXa & ZB Label you've worked so hard. Eat well, rest well and go back! Thank you for watching Trip? Trap!
