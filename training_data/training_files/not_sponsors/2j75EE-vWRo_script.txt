hey so I'd love to be as cool as not later on and say that you're seeing me and stick figure for him because my camera broke up for the weekend but what actually happened is that I went to a salon in London and I my face looks well like this so there's that so the sounds entering your ears from this video are the result of oscillations from your computer speakers producing sound waves similarly the image you're watching on the screen is in simplest terms visible light waves and these two waves are great examples of both transverse and longitudinal waves in the case of sound these waves are longitudinal waves this means that oscillation movement is parallel to the direction of the wave propagation so when particles are moved left and right in an oscillation or vibration this in turn creates a wave think of a slinky stretched out where there are even intervals between the spring coils now when we start to move one end this left to right movement creates a wave and the waves press through the slinky but the slinky itself does not move anywhere now you've probably noticed that as the oscillations move through the spring there are compressed areas where there is no or very little room between the spring coils this is known as compression and as it's a longitudinal wave there must be areas where spring coils are spaced either side of the compression and this is known as where a faction importantly longitudinal waves require a medium like water rock or air to travel through without this they cannot be produced and that is why in space no one can hear you scream moving on to light light is an example of a transverse wave a transverse wave is one where the direction of the wave is at a right angle to the direction of propagation transverse waves can be represented in the classical two sinusoidal wave an example of a transverse wave would be a water wave where a disturbance on the water surface creates a wave and just like a transverse wave it is only the transfer of energy propagating in the direction of the traveling wave there is no mass transport of particles now unlike a longitudinal wave some transverse waves don't require a medium to travel through like light light waves can travel through a vacuum so whilst no one can hear you scream in space they can definitely see you so there are two types of waves and although different they share the same parts of a wave that allows us to examine waves so let's have a look at that so a transverse wave kind of looks like this and a longitudinal wave kind of looks like this now you might think that they look nothing like but transverse waves are often represented as long as you turn on the waves to help us better understand them so let's take a look at the classic longitudinal wave let's start with the peaks this is the highest point of the wave above the rest of position this is followed by the trough or the lowest part of the wave the distance putting a peak in a peak or a trough in a trough is called a wavelength the amplitude of the wave is the maximum displacement from the rest point now as waves propagate there will be a certain number of waves passing a point each second and this is known as the frequency the unit of frequency is as you probably already know Hertz and lastly the period is the time it takes one wave to pass a point now depending on the wave it will have a very specific fingerprint on you to journal waves like sound waves that the human ear can pick up typically have a frequency between 20 and 20,000 Hertz anything above 20,000 Hertz is known as ultrasound now it sounds the higher the amplitude the louder the sound and the lower the amplitude the quieter the sound and when traveling through air sound has a speed of approximately 330 meters per second and while 20,000 Hertz traveling at 330 meters per second seems a lot it's nothing compared to waves on the electromagnetic spectrum electromagnetic waves transfer energy as radiation from source to the absorber they can travel through a vacuum and air at the same speed the electromagnetic spectrum can be split into seven distinct although continues categories from radio waves that have a very long wavelength low frequency and low energy to gamma rays I have a very short wavelength high frequency and high energy the seven categories are split into radio waves microwaves infrared visible light ultraviolet x-rays and gamma rays and the speed of electromagnetic waves well they travel at 300 million meters a second or the speed of light and we know all this about the electromagnetic spectrum because Heinrich Hertz demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves predicted by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865 Maxwell had theorized that electromagnetic fields travel through space at the speed of light and that light is similar consisting of vibrations of the same medium just at a different frequency although widely accepted experimentation was lacking until 1887 when hertz built apparatus to confirm Maxwell's theory of unlock their dozens of problem-solving courses and that's it if you like this video give it a thumbs up if you want to see more hit subscribe and a big thank
