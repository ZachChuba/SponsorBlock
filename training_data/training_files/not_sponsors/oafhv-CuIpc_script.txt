sponsoring today's video all right welcome to my daily commute in my tesla model 3 using autopilot i wanted to do this video so you can ride along with me and just see kind of how autopilot reacts in certain situations in 2020 this was filmed uh one of my last commutes during before quarantine started so i thought this was a good day to do it because it's kind of dark outside it's early in the morning and it's raining a little bit i remember my last video that i did with featuring autopilot when i talked about autopilot versus open pilot got a lot of questions about how autopilot does in dark situations at night and in the rain especially on my 45 minute commute where i use autopilot most of the drive for you to tell if autopilot is enabled right now it's not enabled but you can see on the screen here i just enabled it right there and the way you can tell autopilot is enabled by looking at that blue steering wheel icon and here you can see it turns blue and when that icon is blue that means autopilot is enabled and is in control of the car so that way you know throughout this video you can see when autopilot is turned on or off so autopilot is turned on and we're driving through the rain i'm in the left-hand lane because i set this speed to a little bit over the speed limit just so i can show you what the automatic lane changes how those work uh upcoming in just a few minutes because this will have to automatically cross over four lanes of traffic by itself and we'll see how that does so you can see it's raining and autopilot is handling it really well and you see the visibility of the windshield is not that great and that just shows showing you how well autopilot does work when it's raining honestly when it's heavy rain i like to enable autopilot because i do trust it more i mean it's it's it makes more sense to have autopilot engaged for me when it's heavy rain because it gives me just extra eyes with all the cameras and if autopilot does run into an issue it will alert me it will disengage and tell me to take over anyway so it is kind of scary when you lose eyesight uh at times like that autopilot can surprisingly handle it what better than the human eye can and there there is an automatic lane change i initiated the turn signal but the autopilot will do the lane change by itself and it will also do automatic lane changes to get back into the slower lane and to the faster lane if you have the full self-driving option which i do have that cost seven thousand dollars so if you don't know the difference between the two so basic autopilot is included on all teslas now and that includes traffic aware cruise control and then also it includes auto steer but if you want to have some of the additional full self-driving capability features such as navigate on autopilot which will navigate you from on-ramp to off-ramp and it will do automatic lane changes and it will take exits based on your navigation that's included in full self-driving and also with some other features including the automatic stop light and stop signs which we'll we'll take a look at at the end towards the end of this video and um here i have navigate on autopilot enabled right there you can see on the screen where it says navigate on autopilot with that blue button right there and there when it flashes blue if you saw that it just flashed blue that means it's asking me to put my hands on the wheel to make sure that i'm still paying attention with autopilot it does require your hand on the steering wheel at all times but if you do take it off it will continue to work uh for you know five ten seconds depending how fast you're going and with rain and at night the amount of time with that with your hand off the wheel is shorter if you were doing it you know just a bright clear day with nobody around so you definitely have to keep your hand on the wheel almost at all times it automatically recognizes if you have your hand on the wheel or not and it will flash and alert you if you don't and if you don't touch your will it will automatically disengage and you will have to take over so it's a good idea to always keep a hand on the wheel when you're using autopilot and here we're upcoming on some lane changes you can see my exit is coming up here in about a couple miles and you can see where autopilot will try to do automatic lane changes see right there it pops up saying upcoming lane change so it knows that my exit's coming up and this is all navigate on autopilot is doing this it's initiating the lane change by itself it's doing the lane change by itself and we're going to have to do this for four lanes of traffic and we'll see how it does so it's initiating the next lane change and it's working perfectly so far and here it's alerting me upcoming lane change again and it's doing another lane change here the automatic lane changes in tesla autopilot ever since version 10 of the software have been really smooth they definitely improved and almost perfected the lane changes with autopilot i mean even when you initiate it manually if you turn the turn signal on it does the lane changes really quickly and it and it does it safely i mean it knows based on the eight cameras the eight surrounding cameras and the 12 sensors and the forward-facing radar all that combined it does work 100 of the time the lane changes i mean it doesn't make the lane change if it's not safe but it does it very quickly and it always stays within lane and you can just see right there it lane changed into all the very right the far right hand lane from the left-hand lane by itself through four lanes and now it's taking the exit by itself based on my uh in my address my navigation autopilot has been engaged this whole time it took the exit and merged it's going to merge here so it's still engaged and emerged onto the new highway and now we're going to get back in the fast lane and i'm going to speed this up a little bit more we're going to go pretty fast because this is just pretty simple stuff when it comes to autopilot it's just staying within the lane and it keeps the speed that i set and i'm keeping in the left-hand lane because i know that i am going faster than most people in the right-hand lane but based on your speed autopilot will go back into the slower lane i thought right here maybe autopilot would go back into this lower lane because usually if it doesn't detect anybody in front of you it will automatically put you back into the slower lane which it did not uh i don't know why i don't know what uh criteria it uses to to determine whether or not it puts you back into the slower lane i think it's because i have my my speed set pretty high and so if it was set lower i think it would go back into slow lane but it kind of knows there are vehicles up ahead that are that i'm going faster than and then you can see somebody merged right in front of me autopilot slows down i've never had an issue i mean it always keeps a safe length i set my follow distance to two car lengths if you put anything higher than that i find that it just people will just overtake and pass you so easily you can see it's not heavy rain this whole time it's it's been drizzling but absolutely not like crazy heavy rain but so far you know this whole time the uh rain has not affected cameras at all and sometimes you'll run into situations where the rain will cover the cameras and really autopilot will not be it'll say it'll give you an alert and say autopilot is not available due to reduced visibility on the cameras so far during this drive that has not happened it has not had that issue at all so that's good and usually it doesn't but there are some times where i think fog affects the autopilot cameras more than rain does usually so you know i'm initiating these uh these lane changes manually but autopilot is taking them is doing them by itself navigate on autopilot is still enabled so it knows saying right now it's going to upcoming lane change and it and it's going to do this all by itself so it initiated that lane change to get into the right lane because the exit is coming up and it does it and here when it gets off the exit it takes this exit by itself and here it's going to say you see it on the screen it says navigate on autopilot ending in 25 feet because i have to go left and it's not merging onto another highway so now i eventually break right here and when i break it automatically disengages autopilot so now we're on a highway that's uh not a typical interstate so this is almost like city driving because there's stop lights and everything but here during this stretch of my commute i don't enable autopilot i just enable the traffic aware cruise control i can set my speed up to whatever i want and it will keep that speed and it will also break and slow down in case the car in front of me slows down and it will also speed back up all i have to do is steer it i do this because on this road as you can see a lot of people go faster than normally and autopilot when you have autopilot enabled it limits your speed to five miles over the speed limit so on this road my my limit my speed limit would be limited to 60 miles an hour on this road because the speed limit is 55 and if you're on traffic aware cruise control like i am it will let you set your speed limit to higher whatever you want right here you can see this truck this bed is definitely within it's in my lane the back of it right there and it's sticking out on the right and autopilot or i should say you know traffic aware cruise control detected that and it automatically slowed my vehicle down you can see right here so right here you can see autopilot starts slowing down it starts breaking pretty pretty abruptly and that's good because it should because it's in my lane if it detects anything and it's lane it's going to slow down to override that i know that i have room i see it i just press the accelerator right there and once i press the accelerator and i'm back and i moved past the obstruction or whatever it's in my lane it will continue on and set its speed back to whatever i have set so now it's back to normal and we're driving under traffic aware cruise control right now up here is a very interesting scenario and this is kind of one of something i wanted to test and why i did it on this drive as well because it turns into a a single lane because of construction and right here is when i enable autopilot right there okay you see the blue icon is lit up so autopilot is enabled and you can see it's moving into a single lane now one thing i do not like about autopilot it will automatically center in whatever lane even though this is a widening lane this is usually a problem on merging lanes when you're merging and the lane is super wide and then then it narrows on the wide part it wants to center itself no matter what so you can see here it turns to the left and tries to center itself right there because it thinks this lane is a wide lane it thinks the yellow line here on the left hand side uh it wants to take up this full lane i wish that it would just keep and hug to the right lane marker instead of trying to center itself in a wide lane because it should just stay to the right it should just stay where it's at it shouldn't jerk to the left right here and eventually that will be fixed okay here's when it's normally a four lane highway and they've condensed it into a single lane both uh both ways and so these lanes are super super narrow and it's going over a bridge so there's a guard rail on the very right and then you got oncoming traffic immediately to the left it's early in the morning there's not much sunlight it's pretty dark still you got shining headlights and here's a semi truck and all these cars following behind it you got this guard rail on the right-hand side and it took it perfectly i mean it handled it absolutely perfectly let's go back i love this i'll let this play out again and you can see if you look at the model 3 screen here you can see the sensors are going off super narrow lane doesn't have much room to work with you got oncoming traffic with headlights and you got this uh guardrail right on the immediate right of it and it's centering itself there is no sway back and forth it stays in its lane perfectly centered in that narrow lane and maybe that's why that's the thing about autopilot and tesla it does a very good job at centering between lanes without much movement it stays really steady so i thought that was a really good example of showing off the impressiveness of tesla autopilot with that single lane uh road narrow narrow road with construction and especially with a big semi semis take up a lot of space and i think i trust autopilot now more than i do myself when i'm going through those those narrow lanes so now we're back on uh tesla autopilot and this is something i want to point out that some people may not know so autopilot's enabled right but i'm actually pressing the accelerator because i'm going faster than i have my set speed like i said earlier autopilot's limiting my speed to 60 miles an hour but i'm going 75 just to show you that when you have autopilot enabled you can press the accelerator and you can go as fast as you want but it's going to show you it's going to say right there on the screen says cruise control will not break accelerator pedal is currently pressed when you're pressing the accelerator pedal when autopilot's engaged it will not automatically break it will stay within its lane but it will not emergency break but i just wanted to point out that you can do that and that's pretty much most of the drive so i drive at least half the trip with autopilot engaged and then the other half with traffic aware cruise control engaged now let's take a look at the new automatic stopping at traffic lights and stop signs okay so this is a video i took recently last week this is after i got hardware 3 computer installed and the new update that stops at traffic lights and stop signs the thing with this though is it slows down at any traffic light that it detects no matter what the color is green yellow red if it detects a stop light it will start slowing down right here look no matter what it is this is railroad crossing it will start to slow down you can see right here it starts to slow down it says slowing through traffic control use accelerator or gear stock to continue so basically when it does this is you just press the accelerator pedal you tap it or you tap down on the right stock to continue through and so here it slows down for the green light you can see that it's green it shows it right there on the model 3 screen it slowed down even though it was green and so i had to just tap the accelerator to tell it hey proceed through this is sort of interesting because this is beta this is uh sort of like tesla owners are training the tesla the neural network okay so with tesla autopilot it uses a combination of ai through its deep neural network and then also with its hardware that it has on board of the computer it uses information from all teslas now here we're approaching the stop a stop light you can see that it just turned yellow at the top of my screen and it just turned red right there autopilot's automatically sensing that and it says stopping and so autopilot is doing this all by itself it automatically stop at the traffic light so now when this turns green again all i have to do is tap on the accelerator or tap down on the right gearstock and it will continue through that's the beauty of this the more that people use this the better that autopilot will become now the light just turned green and i tap the accelerator and autopilot is going to continue through and it's autopilot's driving right now now up here is interesting because it's a flashing yellow light and of course it's going to stop at all lights so it starts stopping uh so this is i'm not sure if i'm going to keep this option enabled i don't know i think it's just more work on my part as a driver this basically means i'm going to have to press the accelerator through any traffic light that i go through with autopilot enabled and i don't think i want to do that i think i'd rather just pay attention and break on red lights now with this enabled it does limit you to the exact speed limit which is another thing with autopilot before this when you had autopilot enabled you could go five miles above the speed limit now it's limited to the exact speed limit so that's another downside to using this automatic stopping at traffic traffic lights and stop science option of course tesla owners we are beta testers a lot of us know that going in i'm not complaining at by any means i'm so glad that tesla is pushing out these updates it really means that they are working towards that full self-driving option that's hopefully coming get 30 off your first bag of coffee from trade
