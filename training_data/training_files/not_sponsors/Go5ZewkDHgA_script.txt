hey guys I go back to my channel so I actually have plan on interacting to this during this catching up on kpop video that of this month however ever since I woke up I kept on seeing a lot of comments requesting me this video so I just figure you know since I'm already you know ready and everything to record might as well just write to this on the day of its release so I reacted to nature's oopsie my body in the posturing in kpop and I think I remember say like it wasn't really my cup of tea or whatever however I liked I enjoyed the music video now I checked the teasers for this one I honestly didn't even know it was the same group because of the concept changed like it it's completely different from what I saw Drake looks in my bad you know so it's darker it's more creepy the sound is definitely full of somewhere I would say but anyways this is called girls there are no captions unfortunately but let's just go ahead yeah the Sun is definitely oh okay yeah this is a suburb of for sure but they made it like they gave a twist with a music video [Music] it's like they put they took every creepy elements and put the best she looks like I didn't know why am i tripping okay maybe I am Wow [Music] the fact that they have like such light makeup oh they're wearing stuff like those would wear right yeah I like the teaser for that honestly [Music] [Music] what [Music] I've missing this type of concept honestly I can't remember the last girl group hood Oh dreamcatcher oh my god forget what I just said it also reminds me a little bit of red Velvets music videos a little bit [Music] gorgeous eat you know what I think if they could have just called barefoot for this like forget the heels just remove the hair okay they're on the floor Wow yeah but the music didn't reminds me of many Brett toughest music video it's sexy creepy and catchy [Music] yeah it really has the insight oh no no no up till then I was like okay that's okay it's not to horror like oh no okay that went that was really low at the end of the music video he just Widow like okay well you know that's that creepy concept every time I watch a dreamcatcher music video I'm kind of like creeped out not not all of them some of them are look very beautiful and aesthetic and everything but like the the PD one for instance I remember watching it and I was like oh hell no miss me with that you know creepy stuff and here I have also this same you know eerie uncomfortable like feeling like you know something bad is gonna happen but you just don't know what yet and as I said the music video there are a few frames that reminded me a lot of red velvet music features like I wonder if this is the same director or whatever but anyways I enjoyed that a lot like a lot more than their oopsie my bad music video in music like this just speaks to me on a different level you know this is just right up my alley and now gorgeous first of all I love the the small rap singing part after the first chorus as well it's catchy is summary but as I said they give it a twist and they get made it more dark and creepy which is something that we see a lot in my opinion especially during this summertime you know so I feel like this was a great and clever move on that and you know because this I feel is the type of musical if you are not familiar with the group whatsoever like myself if you stumble open this music video in this music you like oh wait who is that I personally like this music a lot and so I feel like a lot of other people or of other fans you know could potentially be in the same position as I am right now like that discovering the group through this music and I feel like this could potentially speak to a lot of people you know so let's hope so and with that subscribe to my channel and then we see you the next video bye bye
