ever since the dawn of video games they've been used as tools of both entertainment and education as kids we could decimate wave after wave of aliens at home and then go to school we're different aliens which were to teach us how to type and so it was only a matter of time before the world's most beloved plumber Mario got his teaching credential and tried to teach us all about something other than stepping on Turtles but if professional teachers can hardly make kids care about history then what hope does Mario you have none as it turns out let's get this over with and let's complete Mario's time machine [Music] [Music] we're getting bodied up in here let's go battlefield thanks for watching and enjoy today's video what's up everyone and welcome to an all new episode of the completionist we don't just beat the games we complete them today I'm gonna be playing Mario's time machine now you may remember that I played the other educational Mario game Mario's missing last year and I felt deceived by it tricked bamboozled etc all that stuff it was like when your high school teachers would trick you into having fun by turning a quiz until like a game of Jeopardy or whatever now I've got nothing against learning about stuff as long as I'm genuinely interested in what I'm learning about and I've got nothing against the idea of a Mario game being educational as long as it still feels like a Mario game and Mario's missing missed the mark on both of those counts but Mario's time machine takes a look at history and since Mario on a trip to the past so maybe it could correct the other games mistakes wait yes I'm here from the future and yes this is what most youtube gaming youtubers do when they do a sketch about time machines look you cannot play this game it is worse than Mario's missing both games are bad don't play this game listen to me trust me I give this game my completeness rating up whoa don't tell me that you could change the past I'm sorry future Gerard we complete games no matter what the cost you know that now please return to the future and let me do my job no wait you don't understand I had to swim to get here with that of my guys I get this game my completionist rating of that was weird I'm sure everything's gonna be just fine there are inexplicably three separate versions of Mario's time machine one for ms-dos one for SNES and one for NES they are wildly different games with totally different engines but it was the SNES version that initially tricked me as a child Mario's time machine and Mario's missing had my favorite hard-working Italian on their covers and I rushed home with them expecting classic Mario shenanigans the NES version of Mario's time machine at least features some Mario asked platforming but the same cannot be said about the version I played Mario's time machine for the SNES is even more stripped-down and learning-based then Mario is missing was and that's really saying something the game starts with Bowser stealing artifacts from throughout history using a time machine he built called the Tania leader because Bowser is apparently a scientific genius for the ability to build time machines but time later is a pretty hilarious name so I'll allow it so he's placed these artifacts in the museum and his castle so he can look at them I guess I don't know it's unclear if he's admitting guests to admire these displays or if they're just for Bowser and all his ungrateful children those Koopalings could use a little bit of culture in their lives but even so you can't mess with the flow of time and those historically significant doodads belong in the past so Mario hijacks the time you later to return the objects and save the time stream as we know it because that's his job now apparently seems like the kind of half-assed side quest that's better suited to Luigi but well I don't know maybe he's too busy busting ghosts or something to use the time machine Mario literally has to surf through the time stream itself collecting mushrooms and avoiding whirlpools and yes on a surfboard tennis golf and now surfing there really isn't a sport that the do doesn't excel at but once Mario served his way into a time period with the corresponding artifact he has to take a quiz based on conversation with the locals mario has to fill in the blanks on a paragraph about a historical figure from that time period using multiple choice drop-down options but if you get enough wrong you can get booted back to the year 1993 which is a real bummer and that's it this game involves surfing and filling out historical madlibs which are two distinct Leon mario things to do and I grew up in Southern California so alternating between surfing and half-heartedly taking history quizzes was basically my entire high school experience I'm also gonna be treating the playing this game three times apparently because there are two bad endings for you if you return the items in the wrong order or don't do it quick enough and then one more presumably more upbeat ending providing you do it correctly if you're thinking man that sounds like a waste of time well you're probably right I'm starting to wish I had a time you later of my own right about now [Music] you mario's time machine fails at two things that an educational Mario game absolutely needs to do it's not fun and despite its best efforts it's not educational either if I'm gonna be bored I at least want to learn but I completed this game with the same pathetic amount of historical knowledge that I had going into it Mario's time machine doesn't even know how to teach you how to play Mario's time machine I spent my first 30 minutes or so just trying to figure out what it wanted from me it's all relatively simple but somehow still confusing as hell I'm sure they assumed we'd read the manual but if I felt like reading I wouldn't have to play a Mario game to just learn about history the first time I used the time machine and was suddenly transported to a surfboard I was baffled I didn't know where I was going what my objective was or whose surfboard Mario had stolen there are no on-screen instructions of any kind which is bizarre it's not like surfboarding and time machines go hand in hand it turns out that you're supposed to collect the mushrooms and avoid the whirlpools which makes a tiny bit of sense given Mario's whole mushroom fetish but still doesn't make any sense as a feature in this game if the developers wanted to have a totally non educational minigame pop up each time you use the time machine then why not do what the S version did and incorporate actual Mario style platforming levels also why the hell do the mushrooms keep disappearing when I'm so far away from collecting them just stay there until I get to you damn those surfing sections were boring and irritating and I didn't even get any sweet sweet knowledge out of it and you have to do them a lot every time you travel back in time and even more if you mess up and fill in the blanks incorrectly or serve into a vortex you have to surf again and again and if that isn't irritating enough the music for these segments drove me insane it's the worst-case version of video game surfing music you can imagine and eventually I started turning the sound down every time Mario hopped on that dumb surfboard the music in the various time periods at least has some variation and feels themed so that specific time periods 5 but that might literally be the only interesting thing about any of these segments if you think filling in the blanks in paragraphs about historical figures sounds more like homework than a video game you'd be right when Mario visits these pivotal times in human history there are no blocks to be busted or turtles to be stomped on just lots and lots of conversations to be had since everyone throughout history seems more than happy to share some weird gossip with his little hairy weirdo that popped into their era and immediately sort of asking a bunch of random questions but what's Mario's done his reading it's time for the exam and if you didn't think that reading dry historical dialogue was fun just wait until you're well answering multiple-choice questions about that dialogue and I know learning isn't always supposed to be fun but I honestly retained almost none of the historical knowledge I gained playing this game there are a lot of options for each blank space you fill out but many of them can be figured out with common sense if you feel like skipping some of the preceding convos or you can just I don't know google it I know they didn't have smartphones in 1993 but this game is hilariously easy to cheat at now it's almost irresponsible not to and while I did do my best to not look at the answers the game didn't do anything to help me retain that information like I would have if there had been some sort of fun gameplay element to the learning bits instead it's just rote memorization and as if it weren't bad enough the game is apparently chock full of historical inaccuracies which means I'm not just wasting precious videogame time learning about Aristotle I'm wasting at learning lies about Aristotle hell I can just make up some lies about Leonardo da Vinci ah he looked like an old man just 15 years after he was born he was 30 feet tall his favorite food omelettes see that was easy and that first one is actually in the game this game made me feel like a kid again but in the worst way possible facts were being shoved down my throat while trying to convince me I was having fun at least those typing games in elementary school lets you know what the deal was right up front but Mario is supposed to be my friend not my teacher not Eve that cool substitute who put on that movie while he took a nap even that guy didn't lie to me you know he was totally cool and up for it about how lazy he was and while mario has tricked me into playing plenty of sports games this felt like a whole other level of deception so I didn't learn and I didn't have fun and to add insult to injury I had to go through the game two more times after that so I knew all the answers which made this to go by super quickly but honestly it felt like the game was taunting me I would say that I was bored but it was honestly worse than that I was actively angry for a lot of it and didn't even emerge from the experience with any cool history fact to impress my friends with that parties this game made me angry and I'm not proud of things I do when I'm angry [Music] [Music] [Music] what happened here it's a game if there were two applied reagent [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] this short hop has really thrown together game has taken a heavy toll on me having played Mario is missing I knew better than to expect a masterpiece or even to expect something that resembles a Mario game but I didn't anticipate that it would send me into a blind rage that would ultimately result in Bradley's death and there wasn't even reward for my suffering the bad endings feature Bowser escaping to paradise and sitting in a jungle while the good ending has him escaping to paradise and then sitting in a jungle before getting crushed by a poorly drawn dinosaur foot Oh lame Mario has been responsible for many of my greatest gaming memories and now he has become the architect of my undoing I didn't learn anything about history during my playthrough at Mario's time machine but I did learn a great deal about myself and what I'm capable of when I completed Mario's time machine there were 15 artifacts returned to the time periods that they belong in over two thousand years of human history explored without even a single bit of that information managing to be lodged in my brain countless mushrooms collected via a surfboard because that's apparently just how time machines work nowadays around an hour of total playtime even though it felt like a thousand years and now a lifetime of regret over what I did when this game made me Hulk out wait I can fix it the old me left the time machine here I can take it go back in time and prevent all this from happening because that's how time travel works yeah that all for sure work let's do this [Music] yes there's still time I just have to warn myself well maybe they could correct the other games mistakes wait yes I'm here from the future and yes this is what most youtube gaming youtubers do when they do a sketch about time machines look you cannot play this game it is worse than mario is missing both games are bad don't play this game listen to me trust me I give this game my completion is rating fo don't tell me that you could change the past I'm sorry future Gerard a week complete
