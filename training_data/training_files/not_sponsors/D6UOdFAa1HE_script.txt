a little while back i did this collaborative video with babatunde in nigeria and he participated in a limited budget food challenge and i published that on my channel and then we did a recipe exchange which was really fascinating and just really stimulating exchange of food culture and i really enjoyed that just to update you on babatunde's situation after i published that video a lot of people asked me to set up a gofundme so that they could donate to help babatunde and so i did that and it was a massive massive success so thank you everyone who donated to that it raised over 2000 pounds and it enabled babatunde to buy a new laptop his laptop had been stolen so he's replaced that furthermore that money has enabled him to help other people in need in his community so it's really been a fantastic success and it's a really positive thing overall so thank you to everyone who watched helped or contributed so we're going to do another recipe collab this time in two parts no limited budget this time but i really wanted babatunde to show me something traditionally nigerian and then in a follow-up video in about a week's time i will try to make it myself so over to babatunde now for the rest of the video hi everyone uh i'm babatunde and now for this video we shall be looking at how we cook jello fries in nigeria how we specifically cook jello fries and now in nigeria and i know there are many areas that they cook differently but specifically we're going to learn i'm going to show you how we actually cook it and now specifically in western part of nigeria and i'll be showing you all the ingredients that we'll be using for these our cooking now uh to add to the information now you know some of you might not have seen this before so i'll be showing you the traditional way that we used to prepare our paper using gliding stone you know it's a very very unique way of preparing our paper and i also want to use this medium to thank everyone that actually contributed to my girlfriend i don't know sincerely i don't know how to appreciate you guys i don't know how to say this but i'm very very grateful and you can never imagine the number of families

thank you very much only the heaven cannot i could adequately uh reward you guys thank you i really appreciate it thank you very much foreign thank you uh okay is [Applause] okay wanted okay is um come on all right uh good everyone now today i want to learn how to cook how we cook jollof rice in nigeria now these are the ingredients that usually used to do there so i'm going to introduce all the ingredients one by one all right here we have a scotch bonnet you cannot say that it's known as scotch bonnet i don't know the number of countries that have this and now here we have tomato this is tomato then here we have cucumber this one is cucumber actually i was supposed to use the carrot but when i went to the market carrot was not available so we have to improvise so we'll be using cucumber instead of a carrot then we have a seasoning cube here you can see that we have seasoning cube now we have our tomato paste too i think uh the taste of tomato paste is somehow different from the tomato are vegetables so they taste different so one supplement uh the other okay then we have uh the we have the ginger and the garlic powder here this one ginger and garlic powder mixed together that's what we have here then we have this beans usually only uh in engineering i would actually use this to uh to cook jollof rice usually use this we're going to cook our fried rice green rice whatever you call it so that's all yes and i think it is uh it's used to garnish the food and i i really love the taste that is why i usually love it uh i love it to be present in my food i love it then here we have our curry powder you can see that uh we have curry powder these are it's also mixed out the uh the the milk to be very very tasty then we'll have time dried time you put this to dried thyme then we'll have bay leaves bay leaves so here now we have nutmeg not to make these are just sold in nigeria and we have salt this one is common we have salt then we have our oil we have vegetable oil this one is called devil kings of vegetable oil it's called vegetable oil okay i think this one is still out the time that we have the our turkey that we're gonna prepare uh the meal with all right then we shall start the whole process of cooking a typical nigerian jollof rice now now we have the separation of the stock from the red bell uh vegetable she's separating the stock from it and this is typically done because uh the stock part is not edible all right uh this is our scotch bonnet and i also have to do the same thing separate the stock from the vegetable now we're not gonna use much of this because this vegetable is very very spicy so you need to be very very careful of not using much if not you're not gonna enjoy the food so probably two but it's probably six or seven is actually enough for the food the pepper is very very spicy so you need to be very careful so we have three types of vegetables here we have our the tomato then we have uh the red bell pepper here then we have the scotch we have the scotch bonnet here so the three of them are going to be grounded together using grinding stone but if you many of you have sent the granny stone before so we're going to show you granny's turn on how it is used in nigeria for grinding our food two or three balls of onions should be added it depends on uh depends on how you like to eat onions you could use three balls two balls even one ball is even enough so it depends on your taste you rinse uh the entire mixture because you know our local market here is very dirty so there will have been many particles that are actually uh that are actually attached to the vegetables so you have to rinse it very well so that you know there won't be don't be sand in the food so you have to resist properly so this is the granny stone so she's cleaning the granny stone preparing it for the for the job that is her it has a head so she has to clean the surface to read the surface of any sand particle that can actually you know that can make uh the vegetables to become unusable for the preparation of the meal so she has to wash everything clean rinse everything very very clean so this is the grinding of the pepper as you can see it doesn't have to be you know doing it slowly that is taking the vegetable little by little don't just spark everything on the store like that to take it slowly not many nigerian young girls now they won't know how to use this is very good in fact in africa we have some people that they believe that using this song to grant pepper actually makes the food to be to be tastier and just to be more delicious than using uh western probably using uh grinding machine to grind it or using our blender to do that some people actually believe that i won't use this grinding stone to grind your purple to make your food to be tastier than the other ways but i don't actually believe in that but we have a lot of people that actually believe in that so after grinding the pepper you have to scoop it into a plate so this is how it has been done so to be able to grind the onion you have to slide the onion so that will make it easier it takes a lot of effort especially your your wrist so this is the entire mixture the mixture of the four vegetables that we'll be using to prepare the gall of rice so this is the preparation of the of the turkey so you raise the turkey then after that uh we're going to fry the you boil turkey before frying it so for boiling before frying it so make it uh solid and tasty yeah okay now since uh once the turkey is prepared onion sliced onion will be added to the turkey then after that we will add our season then after that also salt to be added one cube is enough one cube is enough for this cookie so next is our so curry has been added to enhance the flavor now the whole mixture needs to be bubbled everything is going to be parboiled so this should be purple for roughly 20 minutes okay i think the turkey is done now so the next thing is to use seal to save out the stock that is the water that used to bubble the turkey so the stock would be used to cook the rice in order to enhance the flavor of the rice so all right the stock of the turkey is very important so the next step is now the frying of the frying of the turkey now our small slices of onion will be added the purpose of that is so one slices of onion turns out light brown that is so uh we're slicing the onion and also the tomato also this line this is what we use to garnish to to garnish the rice and also uh we'll be using of the green tea too so this has been done right now in order to save time so that when the device devices almost are done to just be added to the rice so the turkey is done so we'll be using the oil that she used to fry the turkey to to cook the soup for the jalapenos and after that some slices of onion will also be added so um till everything is mixed up so this should be left for like three minutes to fry up a little bit so the next thing is for the ginger and garlic to be added to the mixture ginger and garlic will be added to the mixture depending on how much you like your heating garlic so this is a curry powder it has a little bit of curry powder too okay time will now the other time now a little bit of time to also drive the same quantity of our nutmeg will also be added to the mixture to the soup this is the chicken spice and it should be added to the soup in order to make it more tasty this is the four parts of our barber drinks so the rice is to be rinsed now in order to remove any sand or all stone particles that could be inside it so water will also be added for the second round the rinsing of the rice for the second round a little bit of water will be added in now the cucumber should be used to garnish the rice but now be sliced into a bowl so so you make sure you spread everything around the box you spread the rice around the bowl so let's not be concentrated in one spot the soup will now be tested to see if the salt and the seasoning is enough if it is not enough then our mouth will be added and if it is enough then the water will be covered to make it three clips and also another pinch of salt will also be added to make the taste perfect so it's full of butter so wait for some minutes so at this stage the the flame will now be reduced so that the uh the rest will not burn faster the flame will be reduced right to now be cooking slowly as we don't reduce the flame we can make the rice to brown before it is out it is finally cooked my water will now be added because the water will be enough so a little some water will be added it should be gently stirred in order to prevent it it's not to prevent you from so just now for the for the green pea to be added so the water of the green pea will now be boiled away the next step now is to is to wait some minutes so that the the rice can steam up before it is finally done so the rice is 98 percent complete now but it present down okay now the grain of green should be added okay so do not be scared so that everything will mix up so now the sliced onions of the pepper and the tomato will now be added i think it's not looking like african or let me see nigerian jollof rice so the aroma which is now figured out the perfume of engineering dialogue right so after the complete staring part will now be closed in order to make everything together it's not completely done ready for dishing fully ready for it now as you can see it is giving very very it has given out very very nice aroma and i love it i can't wait to eat it hi everyone the project that we're working on this time around is jello fries and it's actually my favorite food when i was growing up i really loved jello fries it was
