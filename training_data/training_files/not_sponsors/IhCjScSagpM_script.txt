[Music] [Music] this here's the dill drugging extreme you're welcome there's Alex get a Canadian soil all over the keyboard can't do that with the MacBook and here's David doing bicep curl there's Alex editing spreadsheets in the shower that's what I call peak efficiency there's David crying openly to the iron giant and here's Alex throwing it in the back of his truck there's David he's gonna fight off a bear at night oh yeah but what has Dell had to give up so at the latitude 74 20 for rugged extreme can handle those extreme conditions and who is this beast actually for is your wallet full of below [Music] I feel like this goes without saying but the build quality of the Dell Latitude rugged extreme 74 24 is beyond exceptional like when I say there's no flex in the chassis I don't mean there's like no flex when you just touch around the keyboard I mean you could literally stand on this thing and it's not going to care but although I appreciate the armour the rugged extreme is still a shockingly thick machine with around 60 millimetres of girth it's not just thick but it's like three times thicker than a thick laptop but like that thickness isn't here for nothing since the rugged extreme sports one of the most impressive assortments of IO I've ever seen which might be kind of surprising given that you can't even see any of it right now this is because one of the rugged extreme ski features is an ip65 rating against dust and pressurized water so every USB port or headphone jack represents a potential ingress point to combat this Dell has locked all of these ports away so accessing is a little different than your average laptop so what nyet standard is 2 USB 3 type-a ports standard headphone jack USB C and power from here you have some options for i/o based on exactly what your knees are our spec has HDMI Ethernet redundant Ethernet serial and a full size DisplayPort and although that's quite a bit over on the right side is where things get really weird so over here we have another USB type-a a SD card reader and a SIM slot a blu-ray player a freaking swappable PCI storage Bay and a smart card reader which can be used for identification and validation of who is using the rugged extreme the rugged extreme also comes with a certification for a large swath of tests like IEC ingress testing environmental testing and hazardous location testing this means it's rated to do a whole number of really silly things like the operational 15,000 feet an extreme cold down to negative 29 degrees Celsius it will shake off 40 degrees shock and won't cause an explosion if you're using it around flammable gas which is pretty great if you're using it on oil platform along with a bunch of other things along on this four-page document as far as performance goes the rugged extreme is no slouch but it also won't blow you away walking a quad-core intel i7 8650 you and an AMD rx 544 graphics it won't be playing the latest games at full details but if you have a moment while out on the field it can run eSports titles reasonably well and aside from games the system feels very snappy overall and should be plenty powerful for doing things like running medium sized MATLAB simulations or editing smaller cat assemblies my favorite stat though is the battery capacity with 250 watt hour batteries you get the exact maximum amount allowed on a plane but even if that isn't enough they're both hot swappable so you can easily just pop it out and pop another one right back in if you're running low and far from a plug like we are right now but one thing well all of those components you'll be creating a fair bit of heat and since the whole thing's waterproof how the heck did they dissipate all that well if you remove the bottom panel which actually is made of magnesium and not the plastic I originally thought it was we can see that the heat pipes go from the GPU and CPU and storage kind of like you'd expect and then through a sealed wall with the heatsink and fan on the other side allowing the heat to get out without letting any water or dust in while we're in here we get a glimpse at the rugged extremes above-average upgradability with easy access to two RAM slots and external access to the batteries and storage if you happen to actually break it though it does come with Dells pro support Plus which gives you talk priority and even mission critical for our parts and labor response although it does say that varies on regions so they probably won't airdrop you an SSD in the middle of the desert but like in downtown Seattle they probably like bike it to you or something now the display doesn't have the best color reproduction ever I certainly wouldn't use it for photo or video editing but overall it's still pretty good it has exceptional brightness for use outdoors awesome viewing angles and will more than do the job when you're out on the job the rugged extreme also supports a touch display and pen support which is conveniently located on the side of the laptop and it's pretty easily the worst touchscreen I've used for years but that's not without reason most touchscreens nowadays use capacitive technology which uses the fact that your fingers are a bit conductive to determine where exactly you've touched on this the rugged extreme however uses a resistive touchscreen which works based on pressure being applied to the display and also just makes it way worse to use with your finger but it also still works when you're wearing gloves and have water or dirt all over your hands so it fits the laptop the touchpad also makes use of resistive technology and feels like it's fresh red of 2006 but once again it has the benefits of gloved operation and honestly after I used it for like a day I stopped noticing just how mediocre it was so I guess it just comes with the territory of something this rugged what is it mediocre though is the keyboard it doesn't quite have the precise tactile feel that other keyboards have like it does have a rubber seal underneath it to keep water and dust out but overall the typing experience is still excellent at this point I'd give it a solid a but surprisingly it has RGB so I'll bump it up to an A+ as for the high double webcam it isn't the greatest I've ever experienced but I really appreciate the inclusion of Windows hello facial recognition and the fingerprint reader both nice-to-haves but it's the Dell Latitude 7420 for rugged extreme really about nice-to-haves like would I recommend this to the average person no not at all it's like $4,500 and it's an absolute bear to use but if you're working around flammable gases not blowing up is way more important than Alcantara wrist rest if you're doing research in the Arctic your computer turning on is a lot more important than a 4k display and if you're wading through a bog in the jungle I would take water resistance above a twenty eighty so if those are the kind of things you get up to the
