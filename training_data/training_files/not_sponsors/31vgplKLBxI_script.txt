hello in today's video I want you to stop doing landscape photography let me tell you why I don't really want you to stop doing landscape photography I think this video can really actually improve your landscape photography before we get next move with Squarespace now as you know there's a lot that goes into making a landscape photograph there's planning as preparation this only Rises those late finishes there's long drives there's also a huge cost involved and that's before we've even got the camera out that's part of why we love it though isn't it because it's challenging and difficult those are the things that fun easy things get boring very very quickly the thing is though life so easily gets in the way landscape photography does not fit snugly into most people's lives and that was certainly the case for me when I lived in London where it's just so difficult to get out as often as I wanted to this has a knock-on effect as well because when I'm with clients I find that one of the things they're often looking to improve is their composition skills I also find that they like confidence in their camera and their ability to find the right camera settings now this is totally understandable because many of us are just not firing off the camera as often as we would like in getting that practicing this thing got me thinking about how much I shoot and it's probably more than most I would think in long terms of landscape photography but I wanted some numbers let's take 2018 as an example then I edit everything in Adobe Lightroom so all the data I want is in there and I've looked through and I've realized I've been out on a landscape photography trip about 30 times during 2018 which is a lot less than I thought it was going to be but that doesn't include occasions I was doing workshops and things that's just when I was shooting out for me videos that you've probably already seen on average I'll take about three images per shoot which I know is probably not that many I don't know a lot of people professional photographers as well take a lot more than that on a particular day but I take about three images per shoot and I've got about 80 photographs from 2018 so 80 images for 2018 which no is just I mean it's not there many times that that camera has fired so let's take an example of a person that might go out once a week and they take five images each time they go out so fifty-two times five is 260 now like me you're 2018 figure is probably a lot less than 260 but even 260 is not much practice in terms of firing off the camera and the problem is is that landscape photography is just so hard to practice because of the effort we need to go to thankfully there is a solution for this and that's to just become a photographer not a landscape photographer just a photographer and I guarantee you the knock-on effect of that will be that you get better at landscape photography photography is a lot like a motor sports where a good driver is just a good driver so in the past we've had numerous examples of where Formula One drivers have got into a rally car and been great and then a rally car driver has gotten to the track and been superb as well it's just the same with photography a good photographer will be able to get good pictures in a variety of situations so when life forces you to stop doing landscape photography just get that camera in hand and be photographer so many of the principles that make us great landscape photographers are the same things like composition lighting understanding of the technical aspects of your camera they're all the same in of their areas of photography a really obvious place to go is to start taking portraits of family and friends yes you are going to probably annoy them a little bit at first but when they start seeing really beautiful work that you are creating with your skills they'll thank you for it and it's a really rewarding experience particularly as you do it for a while you end up with the dreams or backlog of documentary with full of great pictures it's really quite special I'm sure many of you are doing that already but portrait is a really great thing to practice with when I was shooting weddings I would normally deliver about 300 images at the end and on the day I would probably shoot about three times that and it would take absolutely forever to to do that in landscape photography to shoot the camera off fire off that many frames with different compositions it would just take forever and every single time I did it I was learning something and honing my craft sure between each shot it wasn't much consolidation going on but every single frame I fired off has made me a better photographer not just in wedding or portrait photography but in landscape photography as well because you start to build up that natural skill to other the instinct to story tell which is such a big part of landscape photography as well as portrait photography another thing you can try is to set yourself a photography project 365 one is a really good one to do that's where you take a single picture every day for a year and it's actually a lot harder than it sounds I did one when for the first year of my daughter's life to complete portrait shot of her every single day it was really difficult but coming out the other end of that it was an invaluable learning experience you then left with this body of work this years worth of work there's just an incredible documentary now it doesn't need to even be portraits you can sort of tie this in a little bit with landscapes all the outdoors just by every day on the way to work stop and take a picture of something it could be that really interesting tree that you continually drive past every day or try taking a shot of every single street that you walk along on the way to work just keep it simple and accessible so you just keep that practice going and going and going all the time with that camera in hand shooting pictures the options are endless really in macro photography is another place you can go and that led me to win that British photography award from one of my water-drop pictures I'll put a link up there for you to check out water drop photography have you not seen that before I guarantee you this works firing off your shutter as often as possible will make you a better landscape photographer shoots everything in manual as well like we do in landscape photography but it's actually much more difficult to in portrait photography in manual mode or street photography but by practicing doing that in manual mode when you then get into the landscape to do landscape photography you'll find it easier because all those ideas of settings right there so you can just put the camera on the tripod and never ever worry about camera settings in landscape photography ever again which just leaves you free to then focus on that composition focus on that storytelling him focus on creating some really great work a good exercise to help you shoot manual and improve your technical abilities with the camera is to play a game where you just guess what the camera settings would be to get correct exposure in a given situation so say when you walk into a room just imagine in your head what the camera settings would be start with ISO then think about aperture and then think about the shutter speed if you've got your camera with you you can check whether you're right or not and just by practicing that over and over again checking it on your camera you will actually start to realize that there's not actually that many different lighting situations that we experience so there's outdoors in the sunshine outdoors on an overcast day somewhere in between as well there's then indoors with natural light there's indoors with artificial light and sometimes a mixture of both and then really is just some variance in those four things that results in all the lighting situations that we ever experience and it's just the slight of variance in shutter speed and things like that to get that correct exposure do you the great thing about shooting manual indoors particularly is that once you set your exposure correctly you did the lighting won't change so you can just focus on forget about the settings and just focus on getting some great shots what that also achieves is it gives you a consistent exposure across a series of images which if you're using one of the manual modes or aperture priority you don't get that because as you turn your camera around in the room the meter will read it differently and adjust the exposure which means it's more difficult to post-process you might just not be happy with that series of images so if you are interested in other areas of photography and landscape photography a couple of weeks ago I mentioned that I'm starting a new podcast with Gary Gough and Paul Jay Johnson there's now two episodes of that live and I just wanted to show you just a very short clip of episode 2 just to see if it's something you're going to interested let's roll what are we going to talk about today I mentioned what motivates us to get out with the camera yeah okay a plan guys the question we're going to broaches in the broad motivate you yeah yeah a broad subject I also think that when we're talking about this is a gal are people will say I'm losing my mojo when it comes to landscape photography and how do I get it back in a thing out of time yes go soon as well well but for me the answer is very simple you've met my wife so three carries why you say that's pretty much the first minute of episode two it's a good laugh interesting chat I'll put a link down below and at the end and it'll be everywhere that you normally get your podcasts please do check it out really appreciate that so when life stops you from being a landscape photographer just be a photographer it's easy that's accessible to practice and they I guarantee you I can't overstate it enough it will make you better at landscape photography stick around for some extra thoughts on the end screen first purchase anyway like subscribe do what you need to do and I'll see you on another one very very soon I'm Adam this is first man photography [Music]
