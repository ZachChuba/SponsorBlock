we talked about this a couple of days ago and it was chatted about by teammates of Jimmy G McGlinchey or something like that and like emoji Mike McGlinchey an offensive lineman for the 49ers came out and said beforehand that number 10 can do whatever he wants to do he said just because we win with a run game doesn't mean that people should talk bad about how Jimmy G is a quarterback and I agree I think this game manager title that has been handed out to people that has been I think supposed to be slander or a knight every quarterback as a game manager every single quarterback is put into a system and they either manage it in a successful fashion or they don't Jameis Winston was put into a system that is a lot of throwing it's the Bruce Arians offense was he a game manager as well because he managed both the Buccaneers team and the other team because he was managed to give them to ball 30 times is he considered a game manager or is it not because he was able to throw the ball 50/50 five times a game I think this game manager title all started whenever like Alex Smith started having success everybody was like Alex Smith not really a quarterback he's just a game manager every single quarterback is a game manager and every quarterbacks job is to win a game I think this year the San Francisco 49ers have managed to win games in different fashions now they just beat the Packers handily I mean I mean ass beating of the Packers just happened this last weekend and he only threw the ball eight times and everybody's like well they're able to beat the Packers in the NFC Championship without him doing anything you could put a gorilla back there and play quarterback they could just hand off the ball eight times and they'd be able to win I think that's a complete misperception of what's going on in the San Francisco 49ers whenever Jimmy G plays they win when Jimmy G doesn't play they lose that is just how it goes and here's some stats about the old Jimmy G I think that will you know make people ease up on Jimmy G just because they were able to beat the hell out of the Packers without him having to throw the ball which is smart football by the way Cal Shannon told Terry Bradshaw immediately after game why'd you only let Jimmy G throw the ball eight times he was like well they could stop us what do you want us to do if you find a weakness in your opponent you just beat the hell out of that until you win the hit that's just what a smart person just if I play you in ping pong and I realize that you don't have a backhand guess where that ball is going every single time I get is that boring is that yes it might be boring for you it might be boring for people watching but all I know is you're getting skunked and you're getting whitewashed and this game is over at 11 points this is just how you compete and how you beat people and I think Jimmy G has been taking a lot of shots because of the way they decided to beat the Packers here's some fun facts he has the best fourth-quarter qbr in the NFL that's what when your clutch time that is the clutch gene that you talk about a quarterback he had the best record for a QB in the Super Bowl era currently with at least 25 starts 23 and to remember he had that 5 and OH start that's whenever this San Francisco 49er push happened two years ago then he Zig zagged and in towards a Sione was out and they stunk he comes back another Super Bowl faint not suitable favorites but they're in a Super Bowl he is the highest passer rating when they trail in the NFL so whenever you need him to throw whenever he has to make a play normally when you're trailing you go to a throw that's what happened went to Titans against the Chiefs a good one away from the run because they didn't think they could keep up with patch mahomes ryan tannenhill had to throw all over the place that's just one example of what happens when you're trailing after so when the Niners are trailing Jimmy G has the highest passer rating so whenever he has to throw he can do it in that Saints game he wants shot-for-shot with Drew Brees I mean I think Jimmy G is not getting enough credit in this whole thing because of how dominant their defense is because of how dominant their running back running game was this past weekend I don't think Jimmy G's get enough credit or respect with that being said I don't think he can keep up a seeking now back to the magic but I am tired of people setting the Jimmy G isn't good quarterback because he bought into what his team needed him to do to win like instead of being a selfish guy and checking out a runs and calling throws which quarterbacks do which is something that happens especially whenever you're close to the end zone a quarterback checking out of a run to a pass is something that selfish quarterbacks do because they have incentives based on how well they throw the ball instead he just understood that all the team needed him to do that particular day was handing the ball off George kiddo understood that all they need you to do today is pancake the hell out of people that is something called buying in and being a good teammate and I think Jimmy G does not get enough respect for that I was to say that he should be commended praised for how little they run and then how good he is when they do pass because a lot of athletes ISM UK yeah you get a rhythm and stuff like that and you shouldn't be punished for how good your team is at running the football he is getting he's getting he's getting mocked for being quarterback right now because how much money he's making and all this stuff but how good they are running it's like what do you want you to meet you to do you want Jimmy G to tell cow champion to stop devising incredible running plan what do you want the guy to do I assume in the next couple of years at some point Jimmy G will be near the top of the leaderboard for passing on this wall just be something that will say you remember they used to say Jimmy G wasn't good quarterback because how good the run game was it's just like oh if you can beat the hell out of somebody like that why not do that I don't know if it's just a recency bias or what because their run game has one of the last two games and it's been so dominant but no one was saying this during the season like their passing offense was explosive like all yours Goodell yeah exactly and debo Samuel and Emmanuel Sanders like they're I don't know they're not just a bunch of chumps in the passing game and and by the way if you're listening this you might not have been disrespecting Jimmy G so I might you might be like why is he yelling me these are people that are speaking in the microphones other places I don't like the Jimmy G's not getting enough respect to this whole thing
