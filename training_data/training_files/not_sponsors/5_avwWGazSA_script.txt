beautiful website you can do it all in one place with Squarespace [Music] welcome to another studio blog today we're going to the hardware store I'm prepping for our trip to Cambodia I'm gonna be painting a school but I need to go get some house paint but I can test out the layering that I'm planning on doing and make sure it's all good before we go not only getting know I'm getting a small tank of pine wood let's do it come on 2,000 years later I guess I should get magnolias came even though we want to get blushing I'm getting this one is more of a pink this is a more of a yellow we're going to Chris's show and Chris is one of my favorite people in the whole world he's having so solitaries helped me have my first show when he ran the tape my second show was good space he helped hundreds of artists do the same he helped me have my first studio space and he helps me every dang day with my emails my store orders and all that stuff so we're going to support him because he deserves it he's a very talented guy [Music] hi chris was so proud of you thank you so much for all you've done for us at the Creative Suite in the end you're the best yeah we've seen that I did some tests for my mural but I wasn't really happy with the look of the white paint over the colored so I asked around they suggested instead of using a brush that I use for art stuff so sort of these brushes that are really really soft they may not be rigid enough for the house paint that we'll be using to use hardware store brushes so I went and bought some of these this one was pretty expensive this one cost like $20 but it's super super soft so I'm gonna totally good that is and the ladies ones are $2.00 so I want to see the difference I'm gonna do another test on the back of this well as like trying out chalking shapes down instead of just doing it freehand like a board on watercolor [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] first I want I know you guys have you page you get a free trial and a 10% discount say thank you Squarespace let's check what questions you guys said hi shop I mean hey Shaun do you find that you work better with background noise like a TV show playing in the background or music while you work yes and no I do like having things in the background it really depends what I'm doing sometimes it's unwise to me to have stuff in the background though I do I try to concentrate there than I like over the years that I found that I'm very good with podcasts of music for what I'm doing ideation and coming up with concepts and stuff like that and sketches when it comes to creative thinking I'm better with stuff that's only listening but when it comes to long-winded practical work a lot easier for me to work when I have a TV show it helps me zone out and helps that like long night after night after night fill a little bit quicker what are you currently reading so I in my last favorites video if you saw it you'll know that I was reading fight like a girl by Clement I Ford which I highly recommend this week a friend of mine Jess Cruikshank came over she's an illustrator slash letter up and she brought over this book that I had my eye on in the bookstore but didn't end up buying and when I found out she has a please let me borrow it so this is the illustrated dust-jacket 1922 1970 basically this is like old graphic design so like very heavily illustrative additional mediums of painting and traditional illustrations but they are so cool like every single page is amazing I would love to do heavily Illustrated book coverage design which is something that I haven't really done yeah but that's on my hit list for things I'd like to do so this book is gonna help me refresh my idea of what composition can be what book covers can be there's a lot of stuff for the illustration that has been lost over time and this is just like a gentle reminder of how awesome it was it might be in my PG post this month which is late how did you decide to stop doing what you do I'm stuck in a nine-to-five job I don't like and I would rather be drawing I don't know how to get started though my parents worry about steady income I totally understand that from their perspective freelancing is not very stable and if you can get to a point where you live off it you are very very lucky a lot of people that I know that if relaxed creatives actually have part-time jobs and I don't think there's any shame in that so if you can handle doing your 9:00 to 5:00 and then doing drawing the rest of the time at least the beginning that's really gonna help you as opposed to jumping straight in and not knowing what workloads you can hand or what where you can earn extra income and stuff like that so I would just suggest drawing now after hours and on weekends and sharing it online I decided to go full-time freelance when I was getting enough work while while I was in a design job does take a while and I would suggest having a stable income on the side and then having a feel about how you want to structure your drawing work what is your all-time favorite movie definitely moonrise kingdom I feel like I've said that so many times but your eyes Kingdom is the best what is your all-time favorite color palette this by shad hope you're doing well do you have any music suggestions yes Rock and I read the car the other day and on the radio we heard them say that this kid was 15 and well I thought hey let's hear him and it was amazing I think it's by rule and he's like a 15 year old kid but his voice is like James otha mixed with Harry Styles every time I put it on I'm like how is he 15 I don't get it I know you're quite an established illustrator but what advice would you give a lesson or an artist who's trying to get a following on social media it can be very discouraging to put work out there when there is little to no interaction / feedback in return so there's always things you can do obviously everyone knows that you can put hashtags on your photos so people can find your work you can't communicate with other emerging artists but I think the best thing to do would be to restructure what you're what you want or what you're looking for from your work so if your objective is to gain a following on social media and to get attention for your work it's probably not the best priority to have because it could take years to get there and that means you need to sit through being disappointed all the time for example I was probably had table for a couple of years before I had the following that I had there then even still on Instagram I've been on dis track for like five years and that's how long it's taken me to get and that's posting quite a look does take a long time friends who have gone viral and who are just like exploded overnight but it didn't happen like that for me and I think that's a more sustainable way so what I would do is work on creating great work working on your tone of voice expressing who you actually are in the captions and communicate with people whose work you love let people know you love their work it helps one thing I would say though when I see people tagging a bunch of people in photos including myself it kind of is very annoying and if people comment on my photos spamming their accounts on my photos if that's also very like a I don't feel inclined to look at your work and I'm sure if you DM people and let them know you love their work they're gonna be like who is this person because I that's stalkery internet person I love lurking and fighting out like who everyone is but yeah I would suggest what making great work too not expecting that you're gonna get a huge following straightaway and talk to your peers finding the platform that works for you so for me it's YouTube Instagram someone thats vlogging may not have a huge following on Instagram because they can't translate their personality through a photo or through a caption whereas on screen they're really really bubbly really bright really fun really engaging so never rule out like a new social platform because it could be the one for you that kind of explodes hi char do you have a certain sketch or motif you go back to whenever you're feeling artist like can't wait to see the vlog well for me it's definitely animals I just think Abe nature is the best source of inspiration B there are so many reference images online and so much to learn like there's always going to be an animal you haven't drawn yet so for me when I'm stuck and I don't know watch a draw but I know that I should be practicing or I feel like I want to draw without any idea of what I want I just Google any animal watch a nature documentary do some quick sketches there it kind of is a really really good warm-up that's about it update wise I will be working on a very another very late PT post I might just have to skip this month because I'm actually super super busy rock and I just joined a gym I don't know what's going on there we'll see if we can keep it up or if it's just a huge waste of money for us going to Cambodia in a week um I'm speaking at Sydney writers festival which is a huge huge honor because it's like filled with super legit authors and like children's book illustrations that I have my including Sean turn oh my god Sunday the six I'm doing a reading at the storytime
