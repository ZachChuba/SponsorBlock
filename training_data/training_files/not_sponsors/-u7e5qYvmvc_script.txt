split a daily jackpot wow we are really cashing in oh yeah on July 17 1955 Disneyland Park in Anaheim California has operated for over 60 years it might have the richest and most complex history of any theme park in the world along with this comes a variety of attractions shops and experiences that have gone by the wayside today we are going to be talking about 10 in particular these are the top 10 extinct opening day Disneyland attractions [Music] Frontierland it needed a mascot and a big attraction to pull in crowds and give them something entertaining and no one man better suited that legendary position than Davy Crockett himself the dusty barren corner of the park featured a large wooden fort that held a very popular Davy Crockett arcade a shooting gallery full of fun gags an interesting lore the neighboring Davy Crockett museum featured a few showcases including an Alamo exhibit with two life-sized wax figures of fess parker and buddy Epson a historical firearms display sponsored by the NRA and a recreation of a frontier mercantile that served as a themed gift shop the building would also serve for the occasional Davy Crockett character meet-and-greet where guests could get photos and interact with teen legendary hero the museum portion of the attraction wasn't too popular and quickly closed with the wax figures moving out to Tom Sawyer's Island as Frontierland continue to grow and Technology improved new shooting gallery the Frontierland shooting exposition open in the 80s leading to the original arcade to eventually close and reopen as another gift shop experience the original Davy Crockett arcade helped pave the way for many Disney parks to feature some sort of fancy shooting gallery and while not much remains of the original Davy Crockett experience the foundation and spirit of frontier land that he created still lives on today in the 1950s television was dominated by shows depicting the Wild West namely conflicts between cowboys and Native Americans this staple of pop culture found its way into frontier land on opening day in the form of the Indian village located right next to Aunt Jemima pancake house the small village exhibit featured the ceremonial dance circle and a full-blooded native chief in a surprisingly progressive performance system Disney would contract various tribes for six months stints at the park to demonstrate their culture to the guests before rotating them out for a new tribe to share their unique traditions however this Indian village wouldn't last too long as it would be quickly moved to the rivers of America in 1956 where it will be greatly expanded in comparison to the opening day version the Disneyland that you know today is not the Disneyland at the public knew in 1955 while every corner of the park is now packed with an attraction and no space is necessarily wasted 60 years ago the layout of the land was sparse and empty over in Frontierland families could fish picnic and just relax in the wide open prairie pastures a stark contrast to the fast-paced fur ride that now sits in its place and for frontier land's signature attraction wasn't an animatronic musical revue was it a runaway Mine Train no it was mules just mules groups of ten would hop on their own mule and be led through the tall rock formations and desert-like conditions of frontier land this live animal attraction called the mule pack lasted in the park for nearly 20 years occasionally getting a facelift as the frontier land area expanded when the park built the mining village of rainbow ridge the mule ride changed its name to the rainbow Ridge pack mules and then again after nature's Wonderland my train opened the attraction was renamed pack mules through nature's Wonderland some incredibly original and creative naming by the parks team by the end you had passed there a small village sections of rock formations filled with animatronic animals and slowly traced the trails of an old mine train with close to 75 working meals in the parks at any given time the maintenance of live animals was burdensome and unpredictable the Mules would often refuse to move which didn't make for much of a ride and if the cast member forced them to move the situation got even worse also mules would often decide to follow their own heart rather than the pre-approved path when Disneyland announced their new e-ticket roller coaster of Big Thunder Mountain in the 70s most of frontier land including the pack mules were packed up and shipped off into the desert the pack mule attraction was one of a kind for Disneyland with the no other park featuring anything remotely similar [Music] Dizzy's signature circle vision 360 films have been featured in multiple Disney parks throughout the world and the first film debuted in Disneyland's tomorrow and on opening day presented as circa Ramah USA the first film to debut was named a tour of the West sponsored by American Motors the 12-minute film utilized groundbreaking technology designed by Disney Legends the concept apparently came from a conversation between uh Bioworks and Walt Disney in which I works was explaining issues that the crew of the film westward ho the wagons was facing when trying to adapt the newly introduced cinema scope process this is when Disney asked Iwerks if there was a way to make a film that extended the screen even more perhaps 360 degrees around the entire audience what I works and his team were able to produce was more impressive than any previous attempts at cinematic immersion the resulting exhibit in Tomorrowland as with other earlier Disneyland attractions had varying names these included American Motors circa Rama exhibit American Motors exhibit American Motors presents er Kurama and just circa Rama in the sign directly outside the show building the circle Rama logo was presented in black letters except the letter C AR which were colored red just in case you didn't realize that the exhibit was sponsored by American Motors to further drive home the sponsorship I see what you did there Dan it's my turn yes to further emphasize the sponsorship American Motors placed five cars on the floor of the theater the appliance company Kelvinator which had recently been absorbed into the American Motors Corporation also had a variety of kitchen and home appliances placed around the show building the film itself was shot using the eleven cameras placed in a circle on a specially made rig how did that rig get around well was placed on top of none other than the American Motors Rambler both a sports fastback and roomy enough for the family - and you thought our sponsorship was shameless by the way big thanks to swag iq for sponsoring this video the tour of the West film comprised of exterior shots of landmarks such as Monument Valley but Grand Canyon Las Vegas and the streets of Los Angeles the film was projected above the audience by 11 projectors with small black strips in between each screen this was done in order to avoid the blind spots created by the camera rig tour of the West lasted until 1960 where it was replaced by a new circle vision film america the beautiful' [Music] do you enjoy snacking at the Tomorrowland Pizza port or is it now Pizza Planet about regardless of course you don't because the pizza there is awful it's practically made out of cardboard and tastes like it's been rehydrated from some weird NASA approved astronaut freeze-dried packet long before the pizza port was dishing out gross quick serve pizza the space was occupied by the opening day attraction rocket to the moon a centerpiece of the Disneyland spaceport in Tomorrowland the rocket to the moon attraction took guests on a simulated space trip to the moon and back using nothing more than two large screens and circular Stadium ride seating outside the attraction a massive 80-foot tall rocket ship greeted you the tallest structure in the park at the time three feet taller than the castle it was placed outside the attraction to give guests a reference for the ship that they were about to board I'd like to give you some idea about the rocket ship itself and explain some of the more interesting highlights of our operation here so when the flight gets underway you'll be able to see by watching the upper screen what's ahead of you and by watching the lower screen you can see what you've left behind upon entering the futuristic looking Space Station you were directed to one of two Rockets Luna or Dayan changed a few years later to our tourists and Polaris in this short queue area there were special weighing stations that actually told guests what their weight would be once they landed on the moon after being directed to their rocket guests would enter and send to a large round room the room featured a screen above their heads to show where the rocket was going and a central screen on the floor to show a bird's-eye view of where the rocket was taking off from the floor would begin to rumble as the rocket took off thanks to large speakers hidden under the floor then guests could peer down in the central screen showing an ever increasingly distant Anaheim below the ship as the screen up above them showed the moon growing closer and closer eventually the guests would reach the moon slowly passing around its orbit while learning facts from the movies voiceover before flying back down to the surface and landing like one of Alon Musk's new fancy rocket pods this was seriously ahead of its time over the many years and many facelifts of Tomorrowland the ride would get redeemed eventually ending on mission to Mars until of course the major renovation to Tomorrowland in 1998 when the ride was gutted and the fill building was tree formed into a pizza joint a new rocket about 30% smaller was built outside to promote coca-cola products and the only remnant of the ride today is the high peaked front facade painted over after the Douglas Aircraft Company dropped their sponsorship one of the most recognizable features of Disneyland's Tomorrowland is the lagoon that currently hosts Finding Nemo submarine voyage but this was of course not present on opening day it would not be until 1959 that the original submarine voyage would open in Tomorrowland so what was in that spot when the park opened a lagoon a much less impressive Lagoon well we got to go down to the boat landing Ronnie Reagan are you there take it away thank you very much art and here on the lake of Tomorrowland we have boats made out of fiberglass and they're as strong and safe as anything afloat in attraction named the tomorrow and boats allowed guests to drive small boats and laps around the small pond you heard that right guests were given the wheel surprisingly this turned out to be a bad idea the small motors of the boat would overheat when guess attempted to speed up and a tow bow had to come around and pick up the stranded vessels on top of this the smoke released by the motors was dense and problematic Disneyland's management came up with a brilliant solution to enclose the motor within the boat in another shocking twist while this did reduce smoke it only made the overheating problem worse another attempted solution was to add a cast member to each boat which drastically increased the operating cost of the attraction the attraction was eventually renamed to the Phantom boats but the issues proved to be too much for the small Lagoon and it would close in August of 1956 it was the first attraction to close and it is still the shortest lived Disneyland attraction it's almost hard to remember that before omni movers and massive rotating theatres attractions were sometimes nothing more than a large moving floor that passed by windows displaying gorgeously detailed paintings this was the case for Space Station x1 a futuristic experience that took guests high into orbit to a remote Space Station that overlooked a vast distant picturesque views of the earth below upon boarding the large circular yellow Space Station you would begin your journey on the East Coast as a sunrise crested over the horizon and by the end of your journey you would witness a lovely sunset on the west coast the show building was a large circular room with a massive painted portrait of the earth that wrapped around the exterior the mural was textured and 3d giving the illusion of a live topographical view of the earth from orbit the black space above the painting was lying with pinhole lights to simulate distant stars while clouds and storms were under the surface you would travel around the room in front of your small 3 foot by 4 foot window peering out over the painting that showed off small cities rolling mountains and even a deep forest with a fire that billowed smoke eventually the ride was updated and renamed a satellite view of America after the first real US satellite provided aerial views of the world in 1958 but low attendance and disinterest in space led to the attraction closing in early 1960 replaced by the art of animation exhibit [Music] visiting present-day Disneyland could be a fantastic experience the rides shows and various entertainment options provide fun for all ages but there is one thing missing in the happiest place on earth that is of course a science museum while this is absent from Disneyland current attraction line up on opening day such an experience did exist the Monsanto Hall of Chemistry was a free walk through museum focusing on the wonders of chemicals and plastics the outside of the building featured an illustration of an atom with fountains and lights dancing along the wall the inside was an exhibit promoting Monsanto's creation of various products the signature exhibit in the Hall of chemistry was the Kemet Ron eight tubes each containing a different basic natural element that was used by Monsanto to create over 500 chemicals the idea of this aged about as well as an exhibit called the magic of lobotomies would have but it lasted a surprising 11 years eventually closing in September 1966 due to declining interest from the public and a better utilize the large building and Tomorrowland in 1967 the space would be transformed into another Monsanto sponsored attraction adventures through inner space which would eventually be replaced by the building's current tenant star tours the Tomorrowland area of Disneyland was one of the most heavily sponsored parts of the park with tons of companies trying to put a face and brand on the future and while most riots were sponsored by big corporations some took it a step further by actually installing exhibits of their futuristic products in the park which is what brings us to the Kaiser aluminum Hall of Fame the bright shiny lightweight material was the medal of the future in 1955 and the aluminum Hall of Fame was there to dazzle guests when all its splendid wonders the self-guided walk through tour attraction featured dozens of wild creations all out of aluminum first guests were greeted by the Kaiser aluminum pig the mascot for the attraction alongside a massive aluminum telescope structure next guests would see more practical uses of aluminum with appliances building materials and various showcases you eventually ended up in the final large Hall that housed the future of aluminum the two big highlights of the final hall were the times fear a massive highly polished aluminum sphere that displayed medieval knights firemen and stir knots all wearing aluminum in one form or another and the brightest star in the world of metals a large metallic glowing star and now we take you into the future again and the aluminum exhibit and show you the aluminum telescope Bob Cummings take it away this is dr. Heinz Harbor and I'm sure you will remember him from Walt Disney's Tomorrowland mr. Harper has a very interesting experiment to show us here as we stand in front of this giant aluminum telescope which was built especially for the Disneyland show soon after the park opened Kaiser felt that Disney was spreading himself too thin and introducing too many possible competitors to the Kaiser brand they immediately wanted out but Walt convinced them to stick around for a few years longer but eventually the company and their lavish display packed up and left the theme park of the moment their five-year contract expired today the building that once housed the shiny metal now houses a robot made of shiny metal as it was absorbed into the show building needed for Star Tours Disney being such a family-oriented brand rarely tries to appeal to a strictly older audience rarely that said when Disneyland first opened Main Street USA featured a small little shop with the sign intimate apparel brassieres tour Siletz Oh walk inside and it is in fact a lingerie shop presented by Hollywood Maxwell brassiere company of Los Angeles inside you will meet the Wonderful Wizard of bras speaking from a smooth 8-track and turning round and round on a rotating stage the wizard takes you through the history of the land down under see the unmentionables of recent history in 3d illusion boxes and watch those undies appear or you get the Kevin you're having a little too much fun with this we should probably wrap it up fine that's basically it it was a lingerie store right next to Grandma's baby shop which intimate apparel brassiere store so let's actually outlived the Wizard of bras and the store only lasted until January of 1956 before it was absorbed by the neighboring glass in china shop special thanks to disney dan for helping out with this video go check out his youtube channel with the link in the description and forget to download swag IQ with the link below thanks for watching and we'll see you next time on do the folks loved oh man you've got some issues second version telling you I'm ready to go let me know because I never belong the ones that have obeyed or better be known for getting down to the nitty-gritty give you better women let's go who's made whose pain most talk for don't deal with thang we certified observe as I come through and give a true display we champions understand me standing under of the canopy Kennedy better because he Nikki's ready to drive a top speed let's get it I wake up victories my old top school on the run got a go get it right now [Music] [Music] you [Music] you
