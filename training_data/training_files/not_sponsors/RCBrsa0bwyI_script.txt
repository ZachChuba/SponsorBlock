[Music] hmm [Music] I will do one more will do AAA AAA AAA i dev wizard my on I might have picked the hack that is a bit much Wow okay so let me close the poll this is actually very impressive so this is what the hack boots up to like in itself is very impressive it gave me an error Oh - on my [ __ ] project 64 emulator and the readme tells me how to fix error Oh - it just needs a certain plugin and you know let me change these settings real quick that is that in itself never seen anything like that in a hack the [ __ ] debugged itself [Music] that's how it boots up when it's like working correctly that is [ __ ] insane event not insane that a romhack that is just crazy I I can't really wrap my head around that welcome to Mario's house hop into the pipe when you're ready to play the level this place has lots of secrets in it so stick around and see if you can find everything this is my first level hack so don't expect too much from this I did design everything exactly if I wanted to though so any bugs are likely intentional big shoutouts the sky dev for help with porting music for the fact and just got a bug breather for help with making the SEC work perfectly on consoles so it's console compatible as well that's pretty sick apps to the members of the rom hack discussion channel and simpleflips discord server for help with some bug fixes as well as just some very supportive people being very supportive everyone supported participating in this competition something-something ground pound sign I mean at this point it's not even sacred anymore everyone's okay I am speechless this is insane that is way too cool I kind of want my legs better ground pounds assign more okay you think it gets rid of more body parts oh it do oh so I made a last-minute change about an hour before I submitted to this because what I originally programmed and might have taken the joke a bit too far and I really don't want to risk being DQ'd for it you would have been fine [ __ ] body parts overrated what the hell that was sick [ __ ] my ass this is not a game okay I start arms and legs wall kicks are different in this game when you hit a wall you stay on the wall until you press a to jump off okay oh I get it Wow I think I'm a little bit bummed out about my no limbs thing I got going on guaranteed firsties what's up with my angle okay and my angle was fine I just didn't believe my angle wasn't fine whoops I just need to hold perfectly right and this is easy I did it to myself honestly watch out Chucky will eat you off the platform if you're not careful I don't want to be heated I was like I eat free life okay did I miss her edit to start oh joy I'll most likely die anyway what one my going insane you think talking to that toad got rid of my coin hand yes definitely no what what is this gag what the hell gels are lava proof but you can ride them across here safely be careful though you can speed up out of control when writing one brew hella true oh my god this acceleration is steep what what no my Busey at the shell in this game is crazy fast for some reason oh oh I don't I feel I'm gonna puke um a not really sure what my goal is here that'll be honest maybe I was just supposed to be nice rather speak to him dumpy I don't know maybe I meant to die here well I don't think that's an option the camera is so weird it's forcing me into this maybe I should have to exit but I don't want to exit and be wrong I am it's not that big of a though [ __ ] it up stir it up did I see the word the end for a millisecond okay let's just preserve from the beginning what there's some [ __ ] up there I must know mods are asleep quick post mega chicken I almost missed Easter egg oh my god I'm gonna puke again let's see what it was at the end of the night for realsies this time no more honking around dude our honk days are over [ __ ] you noticed you're not VIP what happened well I didn't be unviable my guess is you were never VIP but I respect the play do I respect it enough to make you a VIP oh there is a bum up there I know I don't respect it enough 20 VIP but it was a good play a good plan one time oh my god one time like a bunch of years ago like five six years ago someone had a name similar to siglemic it was like misspelled a little bit and they went into this chat it was like a Mario 64 trip and I like you and modded me or something why'd you and mod me it was not them they did get modded and they did ban people sorry I got a little bit distracted by this die [ __ ] wait are you coming back a few moments later please
