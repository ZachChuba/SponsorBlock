Revis has fallen last week try Glavine forces initiated a massive offensive into multiple systems across New Eden the heaviest fighting took place in the system of Revis where despite intense resistance even calm and allied capsuleers ultimately failed to prevent the try glaive ian's from completely over running the system all Eden calm and Concord forces have either been destroyed or pulled out of rare ah--this bringing its effective security levels down to null at the center of the Tri glaceon activities in this system is an installation called the DA spore vedyam transmuter deployed by a world arc near the Revel star during the invasion this installation is currently the main concern of Eden calm intelligence as its main purpose appears to be some sort of large-scale stellar harvesting almost immediately after being deployed even though not fully constructed and with warfare raging all around it the transmuter activated its effects on the harvested star swiftly became clearly visible throughout the system the nature of the resources it presumably strips from the star is still not known for sure capsuleer theories suggest the rare iSAGEN 10 or iSAGEN 5 as possible materials harvested by the transmitter try Glavine forces have also deployed a number of mining facilities in the asteroid belt scattered around the system these extractives super Nexus mining facilities presumably harvest and process the required minerals to construct ships and other structures in besieged systems this is believed to include materials necessary to complete the second construction phase of the stellar transmuter while deploying massive forces the Tri glaive Ian's are using a living off the land strategy to fully realize their aims Systems invaded have previously been surveyed for suitable resources and their defences probed it is believed that once a viable system is found they invade with enough force to establish a foothold they then attempt to solidify that foothold by constructing warships and equipment using materials they extract from the local resources this choice of strategy may be a deliberate decision to maximize the impact of world ark production capabilities reducing the number of ships and equipment required to invade up front this then allows the Tryg ledian collective to mount major attacks on more systems simultaneously alternatively it might point to resource starvation in the tri gladion controlled abyssal deadspace possibly due to scarcity the impact of drifter attacks or both if so it may have forced the Tri glabius to harvest the crucial resources needed recognizing this Eton home has implemented a defense strategy whose primary aim is to starve the try gladion war machine by denying them access to vital resources this requires immediate efforts to repeal the Tri glaive Ian's from targeted systems and make them fortresses proof against invasion hitting the Tri glaive Ian's fast and hitting them hard right from the start designed to deliver that punch up well and even calm have announced that they are speeding up the production and delivery of a new line of warships the sky breaker stormbringer and thunder child are designed to carry weapons based on the upwell arcing Voort on projector technology a super weapon previously only found towering on keep stars the concept behind it has now been brought to a more compact form and will be fitted on this unique line of ships the details about the performance of these ships has not yet been revealed and upwell has refused to provide the scope with any sort of demonstration showing up their weapon capabilities but they claim it will enter service soon there is no doubt that these ships when they arrive will provide the firepower so desperately needed in this struggle ahead but for the inhabitants of Raveis it is too little too late fortunately rara vas is a low population system its planets mostly barren with limited populations in underground industrial settlements there are sporadic and confused reports of evacuations from the planets other accounts indicate at Roy Glen presence and some settlements have dropped out of contact there are also a few Citadel's in the system adding to the local population and possibly housing refugees as of yet there have been no confirmed tri glaive ian's attacks on any of the Citadel's but now that Eden calm forces have pulled out they might find themselves under attack zone despite numerous attempts the scope was unable to reach any Citadel officials for comments what makes the loss of Ravis truly appalling is the fact that the Tryg leaving assault could most likely have been pushed back had it not been for the traitorous acts committed by an alarming number of backstabbing capsuleers on multiple occasions these rogue capsuleers attacked eden comm forces swinging the outcome of some critical battles in favor of the tri glaive ian's while many capsuleers loyally sided with the defending even come forces in the end they were overwhelmed by the combined strength of the tri glaive ian's and the collaborating capsuleers although eden comb has established ten unbreakable fortress systems it struggles to defend other systems that have come under attack a large-scale counter-attack to liberate rah rah vas has been ruled out the fact that vast numbers of capsuleers have cast their lot with the Tri glaive Ian's makes the ongoing situation very grave the Tryg leaving collective have for the first time established middle stronghold in New Eden and show every sign of remaining in the system large fleets have been reported roaming the system while its resources including its star are meticulously harvested to build more ships and equipment as the people of New Eden confront this first major defeat together we must contemplate the implications of losing the war against this dreadful enemy is it possible that they will harvest each system they conquer until it is completely exhausted of resources before moving on like a swarm of insects what will happen to the inhabitants and infrastructure and heavily populated systems if they are lost will traveling through captured systems become safe again once try glaive ian rule has been established these and so many other questions remain to be answered as the war continues to rage on this is Lina Ambre reporting for the scope
