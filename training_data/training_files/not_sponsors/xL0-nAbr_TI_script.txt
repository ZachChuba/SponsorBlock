hey little stinkers and welcome back to youtube.com a website that has now been officially banned in all 53 states if you're one of the many new people who just discover my channel welcome and I'm sorry that I called you a little stinker that's just it's not an insult that's just like what I call my fans for some reason I don't actually remember why if someone could please update my Wikipedia page actually and provide like an explanation for that that would be very helpful for me and everyone but nonetheless welcome I'm very happy to have you here by all measures my last video was a monumental success for my channel in terms of how many people saw the video in such a short amount of time how many people subscribed because of it and really it couldn't be going any better but I guess if there is one downside fame sometimes comes at a cost and in this case the cost is that a bunch of kids are commenting mean stuff about me and while I will admit that it certainly hurts my feelings to have a bunch of eight-year-olds call me stupid it's pretty funny and makes for good content so today I will take you guys on a journey through some of the most beautiful and poetic comments I've received this week from Jake Pollard's yo-you dumps the first part was the entering they aid that in all the show you never go to show right I don't know what is so entertaining about judging people life when your own life isn't perfect he is rich though he have a creative mind not like you [ __ ] second guy again be creativity bro [ __ ] you [ __ ] Bumba see your videos [ __ ] because of Jake you are getting views you you you [ __ ] I regret watching this video I had no need for this information why did I watch it I don't even know you am I the only one that knows that the girl Jake is holding is his girlfriend oh that's why they were kissing I thought that was his sister that's why it was so weird to me I'm not trying to be mean but he never did the challenges oh nice one very funny then right above it poop you are you guy why does Jake say words of advice when he is really the bully himself he really disses on people who don't deserve to dis think of it the YouTuber distracts the teachers the people who have get through this this comes to my final conclusion that team ten is run by ads so that means that the new generation is ants in fact everything is made out of annex I hope earth blow up I like the way this guy thinks yeah I'll go to the show only if I'm paid three times the amount I paid for and if the challenges has money I think you should make a video on small channels and start with mine please good idea I'll definitely make a video about your channel have you seen Jake Paul on TMZ news [ __ ] he'll probably knock your skinny ass out ha ha ha it'll be funny if you guys run into each other and you'll be speechless your tail will be touched between your legs I'm sure it'll happen hey how'd you find out about my tail stop you are so stupid I can't believe you have even one subscriber you are just a hater like if you agree alright I liked it you are videos are too long I know this isn't related to the video but is it just a thing for every grandparent / great grandparent to have an extra fridge in their garage I have been visiting a lot of relatives and I noticed that they all have a fridge in their garage just for ice cream and soda I would have lost way more brain cells if it weren't for Drew's talk throughout the show thank you I was gonna post a video without any narration just clips from it and not set up any context but then last minute I decided you know what I'm gonna talk about it and then I did and I included that in the video so that was a good decision cringe narration I tried my best damn I love Amanda me too white a fukushi still with you one of the most common comments youtubers get is just someone not saying anything about the video but being like oh you look like this other person right I get that constantly and it's always different people so I'm gonna do a few comparisons and you tell me if any of these are true you look like shroud the [ __ ] you look like elliot rodger edward is that you oh yeah okay I see it I see it [ __ ] it I don't like Jack Poe but you're literally only making minor E of him scribed Thanks we all know you did this video for the views and money yeah of course I did of course I made a video to earn revenue this is my job it's like your boss telling you like we all know you only came into work today to earn your paycheck damn it who told you this person's entire comment was I use mobile YouTube okay one for mobile I'll help with my research thank you what's the name of the jazz he's playing in the video oh yeah jazz music what product do you use um for my hair or for like editing or our you know I know you mean an enemy wait up did he create YouTube guys it's simple okay 13 years ago I invented YouTube and then I sold it to Google and used the money I got to play NBA basketball where I was a power forward for like a hundred teams then when I retired I came back to YouTube to make commentary videos it's a very normal career path please stop asking about it didn't Dru say he wasn't going to do videos on the Paul brothers anymore and to hold him to that did I say that but I wholeheartedly believe this will be the last video I ever make about Jake Paul and I implore you guys to hold me to that no I never said that you guys know what that sound means it's time to make sure that my last video is still monetized oh wait I could just do a brand deal has slash drew to get 10% off any purchase guys thank you so much for watching I know this video wasn't as in-depth as what you may have come to expect from this channel but I just wanted to get something out quickly before I left my home for a week I'm going to VidCon in California I'm gonna be there for like eight days so if you're going to VidCon hopefully we can run into each other and high-five or make out I don't know no I'm not gonna make out with you but we can high-five remember guys if you liked this video remember to comment I like this video so cuz then I'll know that's the only way I'll know if you'd like it but yeah I know this wasn't as long or as good as most of my other videos but not to worry because I will be back very soon with my regular content thank you
