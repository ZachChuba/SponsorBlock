have you ever been sat in math class and the teachers explaining quadratic equations or something full of equations and you understand everything it's the worst right well if that's you this video is here to help here is how to suck at maths with five easy tips tip 1 if you don't understand something do not ask for help put yourself back in the classroom put yourself in the position we've all been in you've just been taught something new some new concept and the teachers given the class a bunch of questions to test how what you understand it you don't understand this new concept at all you're looking down the problems and you're clueless the pro move here is to look around and see what other people are doing some people are getting on with the questions they understand some people are looking just as confused as you now what do you do you stay silent there is a professional teacher in this room someone who has studied maths for 10 years someone who has a degree in the subject who is in this job to help you understand the subject matter better if you ask them a question there was a very real risk that you will come away with a better understanding of maths if you ask a teacher for help you are like 99% guaranteed to improve your ability don't take that chance tip 2 if you find something difficult give up next a really easy one this is super simple to implement whenever you're given a question look at it decide whether or not you think you can do it and if you think it's too difficult give up this one's really important guys one of the most common mistakes people make in trying to suck at maths is pushing through difficulties rather than giving up like someone might be given a problem that they thinks too difficult so they might make it simpler and simpler and simpler until they find the version of the problem that they can answer and if they were to give up their I give them partial marks but the thing you absolutely have to avoid doing the big mistake is to then increase the complexity of the problem like adding bits to it and improving your understanding until you can eventually get back to the original version of the problem and actually answer it I can't stress this enough guys if you want to suck at maths you've got to accept the level you're at now and never want to improve stay in your lane here's a 5 second rule of which might help if you can't answer a question in five seconds then move on you can't do it five seconds should be enough time to determine whether or not you could ever answer a particular question or not tip 3 if you find something in maths interesting stay away here I'm gonna use a quote from Marcus DeSoto writing in The Guardian one of the books my teacher recommended was gh Hardy's and mathematicians apology at the time I was very interested in music I was learning the trumpet hanging out with the RT crowd doing plays and singing in choirs but I also had a desire for things that made logical sense for solving puzzles for a rational perspective on the world a mathematicians apology suddenly opened up a bridge between these two competing desires these two cultures it's rookie error there is nothing more dangerous to a lack of understanding than interest in the subject so as soon as you find even the tiniest bit of maths interesting under no circumstances pursue that thing discipline guys don't google it definitely don't ask your teacher questions about it and don't try and find out anything more about it in any way you have been taught everything in your lessons for a reason don't add any extra knowledge to that because you might come away with a better understanding of what you're taught in class tip 4 only do the questions you're set as homework I've got two words for you guys bare minimum homework is literally only set to improve your understanding in class a lot of people will tell you that homeworks actually set to give teachers something to do they don't have very much to do but I'm telling you homework is carefully designed to make you better at maths so you can't not do it you'll get in trouble for disrespecting the system or something so you have to do the homework but you don't have to try while doing the homework so spend the minimum time on it possible bare minimum well you have to do the homework absolutely avoid up all costs doing any extra problems whether that's in textbooks or in websites or in popular science books if you do extra problems off of your own motivation you will get better at maths so don't do it tip five remember maths isn't for you you're not good at maths you'll never be good at maths it's just not the way your brain works we all know that you have to have a brain that works in a particular way to be good at maths and if you're good at maths you can't be good at anything else the same way that someone who speaks French can only speak French this is probably the most difficult tip to put into action because it's about a mindset rather than a specific thing you should be doing personally I find it easiest to implement using a mental mantra every time someone mentions maths or math class I make sure to say to myself maths I'm not good at maths I'll never be good at maths in fact you can say this out loud to your friends if you have a friend that is good at maths make sure you say that every time they bring up the subject the important thing is to cultivate a negative mental state if you preclude the possibility that you'll ever be good at maths you're guaranteeing that you will never be good at maths so those are my five tips but exactly what to blacklist okay remember if you want to suck at Matt's here are five tips to help if you don't understand something do not ask for help if you find something difficult give up if you find something a maths interesting stay away only do the questions you're set as homework and remember maths isn't for you this is a serious issue and I hope this blog has been instructive and helping you suck at maths if you'd like some case studies of sheer mathematical incompetence then I highly recommend you check out my vlogs from my PhD just remember maths is lame no one will like you if you're good at it and if you become good at it there's a very real risk they'll end up with an interesting high paying job wait [Music] you
