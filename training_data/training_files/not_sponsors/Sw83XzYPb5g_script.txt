with firebird chicken
that's right usually when i steal a dish from someone i steal both the recipe and
the name but this time that is not the case all
right the original firebird chicken is actually a stir fry
and quite a bit different than what you're seeing here but i absolutely love
the name and thought it would fit perfectly for
this very simple extremely spicy and incredibly delicious dish and
hopefully one day this becomes so popular
that people think that other recipe got its name for me
so with that let's go ahead and get started by adding one very large sliced
garlic clove to this mortar along with two seeded roughly chopped
habanero peppers which also in the store sometimes go by
the name of scotch bonnet and then we'll also toss in a spoon of
salt at which point we will proceed to smash this into a fine paste
which by the way can be extremely dangerous as while you're pounding some
of the juice from that pepper could splash up into your
eye so i do suggest you use some kind of protective eyewear
alright some safety glasses or reading glasses
or even sunglasses which not only will protect you
but as everybody knows there's no cooler look than wearing sunglasses indoors
but anyway the point is smash this down to a paste without burning your eyeballs
and once that's been accomplished we will add the last two ingredients
so to our fruity ferociously fiery fresh peppers
we will add the non-fresh fermented funkiness of a bottled hot sauce
which for me is going to be sriracha but please use whatever you want
and then last but not least believe it or not we're going to add one large egg
and we'll grab a whisk and give this a thorough mixing
and not only is this going to act as a marinade but it's also going to form the
base of our coating for the chicken oh and by the way since we're going to
apply this to the chicken once it's prepped
we can finally answer that age-old question of which came first the chicken
or the egg it's the egg but anyway once that's
mixed we'll go ahead and set it aside and move on to prep a couple boneless
skinless chicken breasts and by prep i mean cut into three pieces
the first of which being that tenderloin or finger as it's referred to so we'll
go ahead and peel slash trim that off and then what we'll do is sort of find
that seam where the tenderloin was and we'll place our knife in right about
there cutting from the smaller side to the larger side at about a 45 degree
angle and as i finish this cut i have no idea
why i angled the knife that way creating one of the worst and most
irregular cuts i've ever produced all right i think i was looking in the
viewfinder instead of paying attention which is of course my standard excuse so
please let me show you that one more time all right so first we'll remove
that tenderloin which pretty much peels away on its own
and then we will find that seam and slice from the smaller side towards
the larger side at about a 45 degree angle
and then this time finish to cut straight through okay that was a little
better and then what we'll do once that's been
cut up is generously dust both sides with some kind of starch
okay i'm using rice flour here but you could use regular all-purpose flour
or even cornstarch if you want okay they're all going to serve about the
same purpose but personally i think the rice flour
does the best job plus i have a whole bag of it and what
else am i going to use it for but anyway you decide i mean you are
after all the tim curry of what's about to become a slurry and
speaking of horror shows once those pieces are well coated with
our flour we can go ahead and pour over our pepper and egg mixture
at which point we will take our tongs and toss these pieces until they are
completely coated and i said completely make sure you get
every nook and cranny and know it might not look like the most
appetizing thing ever at this stage but you'll see once we're done pan
frying this it is going to look absolutely gorgeous
even that horribly cut misshapen piece but before we can pan fry this
we need to wrap it up and let it marinate in the fridge from anywhere
between 2 and 12 hours and in case you're keeping score at home
i did mine for about three at which point we can go ahead and fry
that up in a non-stick pan set over medium-high heat
into which i put a generous splash of olive oil but any other kind of
vegetable oil would work or any melted fat for that matter right
clarified butter would work as with some good old-fashioned chicken
fat but anyway we will place that in and cook that for about three minutes
per side or until beautifully browned and just cooked through and if you see
any small spots that don't have any of that slurry
you can go ahead and transfer on a little more with your tongs from the
plate and as you might expect those smaller
pieces will cook faster so generally those will be the first
ones we turn and of course also the first one's removed from the pan
and you know what i have to say that oddly shaped piece is starting to grow
on me it actually turned out to be kind of
cute but anyway like i said we'll go ahead and cook these for about three
minutes per side and if they feel mushy when you poke
them with your finger let them cook but when they spring back they're
probably done and that's it we'll go ahead and remove those from the pan
from the smallest to the largest and we'll go ahead and serve that up on some
rice which in my case was some brown rice
that i cooked with some tumeric and peas while you certainly could serve a sauce
with these like a sweet chili sauce to cut the heat
i'm not going to i'm just going to finish up with some fresh chives
because i just wanted pure fire which is exactly what i got
and for what is probably the thinnest coating you will ever see on a chicken
the amount of flavor and spice it delivered was unbelievable
just incredibly flavorful and yes extremely spicy
which is why i came up with the name firebird allegedly
and above and beyond the taste that coating really does produce an
incredible texture and i find really does help keep our
chicken juicy i mean come on look at that glistening
meat so i really do love this technique for what it does both to the texture and
the taste and while this is definitely very spicy
it is also very addictive so even though that he keeps building
you just can't help but take another bite and i know these things are very
subjective but for me this never went over the top
and became painfully unpleasant it just straddled that line perfectly
but anyway that's it what i'm calling firebird
chicken and a special shout out to the blue koi
in kansas city where i first came across the name i appropriated for this dish
maybe one day i'll be traveling through and i can try their version
but until then i'm just gonna have to settle for this which i really did think
came out amazingly well and that's why i'm gonna finish up by
saying i really do hope you give this a try soon
