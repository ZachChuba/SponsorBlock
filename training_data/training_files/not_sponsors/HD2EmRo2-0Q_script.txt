for sponsoring content for LA by night now last episode our coterie were guests at a very unusual dinner party so let's take a look at that through a rodent size with pages from Ramona's sketchbook Hollywood Forever Cemetery not our favorite place is it guys not exactly a lot of good eatin there for you or for me and X says it's super haunted what a shock right but screw the spooks we had a job to do our coder he wasn't here for a midnight stroll they had a dinner date no Frankie not that kind of date now that you mention it Belle did say something about doing it on a grave haha okay focus focus Jasper brought them here to meet some of his creepy cousins along the way they made a discovery the grave of Griffith J Griffith yep that Griffith Nelly's ancestor the dude who started Griffith Park four points Edith go to the head of the pack but that's gonna come in handy later huh and hey look which you can see from the obelisk the observatory this [ __ ] just keeps getting weirder so the hosts were these creepos some of Jasper's clan Amalia Mitnick and Gary nice enough is not far to go but don't get on their bad side these guys know everything that goes down in the city and they will sell it for the right price Annabelle spread the message of resistance and the Knauss kinda bought it but like everybody else they want something in return access to whatever magic [ __ ] is going down in Griffith Park figures right dinner was I know I know [ __ ] I'll bet they knew we were watching Dom I'm sorry I'm so so sorry that you had to see that there will be payback I promise our Belle did great held a ground politic like a pro with some help from her undead change it's coming we called it didn't we guys yeah the spark is lit and our Belle is holding the match but she's made so many hard decisions so fast she's got to make more and every choice takes a toll she's learning that every victory comes with a price but some prices might be painfully high [Music] Thank You Megan Jessup for those wonderful sketches and look back at last week even the most humane of vampires discovers that conflict among the undead is often inevitable but not all vampires fight with fangs and claws tonight we'll look at two different sides of vampire conflict two different points of view so let's do that let's tell a vampire story [Music] [Music] it is late in the city of Los Angeles it is two nights since the dinner party in the cemetery this evening finds several of the coterie in an SUV driving west into Camarillo territory Victor who's the wheel Bailey he's been he's proven himself to be solid and you are on your way to the Getty where the camera law holds elysium important question are any of you armed no I do not bring the Rothfuss guns they're in the safe are there weapons in the automobile yes but not that I feel it'd be particularly effective but you know standard standard mortal weapons okay wait wait you two get in here get in here get in here for the selfie get past me oh I got it I got it already I text Annabel named this look so great this this I love this this is what happened to this I am making a statement I feel like you of all people should know that fashion is an expression and I want them to know that while I'm showing respect I am NOT like that that's why no suits today unbound realness do you have something to say over here no because you look awfully nice okay this I love this I love this I figured it wouldn't lend some truth to our performances if I looked like I had wanted to join them which is up speaking of like I thought we were gonna be diplomacy bros and then you were gonna be doing your both of you guys would have been killed instantly there's a reason why we're not sending you on a suicide mission we aren't I mean you weren't sending us on a suicide mission because it feels like a suicide mission yeah well speaking of that mission we should figure out what the hell we're going to do well Firenze got us an audience we're out we're going to Elysium we're going to the Getty Center which is actually my favorite place in LA you remember we went we went through yeah right I really loved it there actually it's not a bad spot for an Elysium I have to say but we're gonna go we're gonna try and negotiate I'm sure they're gonna want to know what you plan to do about the sheriff thing right what do you plan to do about the sheriff thing that's a good question what do I plan to do about the sheriff thing our plan was to stall this doesn't seem like something I install anymore it is probably approaching finality one way or another yes hmm well I think there's some Intel it needs to be high over found so perhaps stalling is still our best option mm-hmm well I'm gonna back your play either way you know I think you'll know what to do when the time is right I I just have to get to the table with Vannevar I really believe I can make him listen to reason if I can just talk to him with your negotiation skills he has gotten us this far so remember no use of any of our vampiric powers right yeah yeah I didn't I didn't bring I didn't bring the hunter weapons I didn't bring the Rothfuss pistols I didn't want to offend anyone or quite frankly just have them taken from me let me be more specific just don't get caught well this is probably better we just don't do it they'll be doing it yeah well it's their Elysium no it's our Elysium it's everybody's Elysium savate camerea an hour we're all safe there don't come to Elysium what's the wait you're the camera real a specialist you know I I just have a reading knowledge really like how does this place up it's simple it's a safe ground mm-hmm everybody's there mm-hmm to make connections I suppose or to talk gossip that's all the Roses ever talked about right what's the newest thing in the domain so keep your options open eh you did have to make an arrangement for Rex with Amalia is that something we need to put in motion tonight's probably do you think chess is gonna be here tonight probably oh yeah is the Harold yeah it's gonna be great I mean but we're not intending to hit him tonight right no no okay I don't know believe it or not I know you guys think this is crazy but I really am trying to do this diplomatically like I'm gonna show respect I'm gonna follow the rules maybe we'll all keep our heads on our shoulders maybe something good can come from this insanity maybe hopefully oh one other thing we probably need like a code word like if something goes wrong right what kind of code are you thinking well the safe word is pineapple everybody knows that but what I thought I was chicken fingers to each other I don't know which note to make pineapple chicken fingers that's a lot of words to say if you're in trouble yeah it is let's uh hmm let's say baby be baby be baby so any of us say the words baby B we head for the exits and if we get separated by meet up at the club Oh works too right could do that or we find one another if it's too long well there's always a chance that they're going to try and separate us so they can kind of play us against each other because quite frankly that's what I do yeah okay so worst case we get split up we meet at the club yeah baby B means Red Alert we get out of there all right anything else we need to discuss I mean it probably the thousand things but anything with the time we got left for we get there nothing I can think of my brain is pretty much screaming right now so you know you look beautiful you look beautiful I always look beautiful this is going to be fine it's kind of like you're on vacation I'm supposed to represent our lay so thank you for that yeah it's fine ah also if they nail us down about the whole prints thing and the whole sheriff thing hmm feel free to disavow any knowledge of it if you have to fair enough I won't take it personal care enough thank God yes I know what I'm going to say though Anabelle text back the text includes photograph of her own it's a motorcycle big vintage Harley and it says gonna ride this I just look at it and say I show it to you guys and Link brew higher so frickin cliche I mean what's gonna happen she's gonna live with me ballet is way safer than what we're about to do ya know I'd trust me yeah she could stand on it and ride it like a skateboard and be better huh then we're gonna be you know do you even know those people that she's gonna go talk to did she tell us the name no I mean she's going with nines I believe so I assume she's safe wherever she's going hey golden said Valkyries or something right yeah hmm either way she's got her job to do and we got ours and you're probably right that they're almost certainly safer than we had yeah yeah as the vehicle progresses westward the ground Rises foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains or where you find the Getty Center and some of the most prestigious neighborhoods in Los Angeles built so that they look literally down on the rest of the city from steep slopes and high hilltops most of the homes in this part of the city are expansive tudor-style manor houses although there are a few examples of more modern buildings but every home is a sprawling estate with elegant architecture perfectly manicured lawns and state-of-the-art security systems in case kindred are getting any ideas the Getty Museum commonly referred to as the Getty is an enormous postmodern architectural wonder in gleaming white in glass perched high atop one of the hills overlooking the prestigious neighborhoods of bel-air and Brentwood just above the 405 freeway this is one of the most incredible collections of art in the Western Hemisphere if there is a famous artist that you can think of chances are that they have at least one piece in the Getty the our collection contains pieces that date all the way back to the Middle Ages and from last week as you approach the Getty in the car you notice that there are armed security guards patrolling the grounds the radios crackling and many vehicles a lot of limousines a lot of very late-model very expensive luxury cars most of them with a driver waiting inside you're waved in by one of the security guards who indicates where Bayley should park he does so and you notice as you drive into the parking lot and look around from up here you can see the entire city this might be the best view in Los Angeles better than the rooftop of the Grove parking garage or even the observatory it's as though the entire city is laid out before you like sparkling diamonds subtle it's I gotta say I love his sense of style it's a beautiful sure you do Bailey parks the vehicle and asks if you have any special instructions sir I don't think there's any Pokemon up here either you know probably skip the Pokemon tonight stay in the car because there's a real chance if we've got to go we're gonna have to go fast and under no circumstances let anyone block you in here understood I'll take care of it oh yeah good luck sir thank you uh and if she comes back without me go yes sir yeah you know there's an odd symmetry to this there's there's worse places to dive and in this isn't gorgeous repository of that's not no oh okay all right that's it's gonna you're correct there are worse places doing the work place is there yeah uh okay all right okay let's do it hmm hand in hand absolutely approach office day now and follow along based on where the guards are directing us probably towards the tram I assume mm-hmm which takes you to the interior I am keeping an eye out for any kindred I know so far you haven't seen anybody but mortal guards so perhaps the Kindred are inside eventually you are directed to a particular door to one of the larger buildings in the complex and inside everything is gleaming white marble polished mahogany and shining crystal massive chandeliers illuminate everything with dazzling light artfully placed and manicured plants liven up the interiors but on the inside there are no mortal staff anywhere all you see are monsters like yourself the undead perhaps two dozen kindred pale and all eyes turn to you now you recognize several faces you see Rex impossibly handsome with his big toothy grin Paulina shooting daggers at you with her eyes an Edison aloof mysterious hmm circumspect Jasper you see no Nosferatu but this is hardly surprise victory you don't see anyone that you know many of these creatures are dressed in very unusual fashions things that would attract attention in public but here among other vampires seem appropriate it's as though they feel they can be themselves and the effect is disturbing none of the other Kindred make any move toward you although Rex shoots a smile at you Nellie Paulina turns away Edinson nods you don't see your friend Chazz anywhere at this time in this amazing illuminated place surrounded by great works of art there are says on derevenko all the Kindred seemed to be maneuvering slowly around the central point and there are two individuals at the center of all their activity one must be the prince Vannevar Thomas have I ever laid eyes on Vannevar before never inure on life and the other is a kindred you don't recognize well it must be Vannevar but do you know her never seen her what's protocol if it was me I just walk up and shake his hand but I something tells me that's not how this game is played wait your turn then we act natural absolutely I'm not gonna do that what's the alternative you want me to act natural here it's lazy no no Eddie told no don't be yourself very right true not you at all yes a very singular looking kindred detaches himself from the throng surrounding the Prince and moves toward you if you didn't know better you would say that he and Jasper had consulted the same tailor he too is bald he - where's round red lens spectacles but his attire is crimson or Jasper's is black right down to his leather gloves he stops a few paces away welcome young ones hello I am Maximillion Strauss I keep this Elysium it's a pleasure to meet you Maximilian Strauss Victor temple nearly Griffith Jasper Forrest yes miss Griffith thank you for having us mr. price has told me a great deal about you Oh has he yes I see I hope all good things His Majesty will call for you soon please make yourselves available thank you mr. Strauss pleasure to make your acquaintance sir should you require refreshment go to the back room thank you I think I might thank you very much he backs away turns and walks under Lee toward the prince and his guests are your majesty the anarch's are here go ahead shall I let them wait as your Majesty wishes the other kindred alter their pace and movement they cease to rotate in polite circumlocution around the prince and begin to drift around you it's not unlike being at the center of a tank of sharks all smooth beautiful and deadly sleek in the next minute blood everywhere I do want to make my way towards the refreshment not to eat I just want to see in what state the humans are in how are they being kept like how is the blood being offered that's what I'm looking to observe what you discover in the back room and by back room they mean a very posh and plush lounge all leather and velvet reminds you a little bit of the chaton wire the mortals are comfortable and they are quite willing to participate in the kindred appetites to never partake when I'm working but no thank you I'm actually gonna go find the rose garden I'll be back since it's a maze out there thanks for that that means yeah maybe that'll be the last joke I ever get to tell us nope we're good we're good that was the one you chose it's yeah really I will die as I've lived thank you yes we're gonna wait here for the prince so sounds good I'm gonna head over to Rex and Paulina and Edison the trio of roses greets you each in their own way Rex clearly happy to see you with his big Midwestern grand fresh fare good looks Paulina shooting daggers with her eyeballs and Edison as enigmatic as ever hmm darlings it's been some time since we've seen each other yeah how are ya Oh Rex I'm so good how are you awesome everything is great isn't this fantastic it's beautiful it's absolutely gorgeous Vannevar knows how to throw a bash apparently so but apparently so hello your majesty the pleasure is all ours no doubt yes well I should say my lovely Susanne hello Suzanne there's a new lodger your name Nellie Griffith and and what what is your lineage oh Claire toreador of course I'm always afros your sire there sire things have changed it's mr. Pryce I have never seen you around Suzanne are you new amongst the camerea no I am NOT new amongst the Camarena all the time yes you know you do remind me a little bit of an old friend of mine is that so yes who she was quite beautiful she lived in a little glass bubble glass bubble Marie Antoinette oh you heard of her I have heard of her she's a very fascinating historical figure as are you Wow thank you that's very kind of you to say you were friends with her oh yes my goodness very close friends dear tell I would love to hear all about her another time fair enough Your Majesty thank you so much for inviting myself and my friends it was quite interesting that you would have us anarch's here on Elysium we appreciate your company I see it was there anything that you wish to discuss with my comrades and I with yourself perhaps someone of refined taste mm good company well what could I assist you with it seems that things have changed enough over time and with someone of your how do you say flavor [Music] we might improve this already quite spectacular Gord I'm certain you are more intelligent than you appear oh well that remains to be unseen how about that Paulina and Edison look on they know better than to say anything Rex looks a little frightened Paulina looks pleased and Edison is unreadable hmm Rex darling um huh I would love to show you to the Hollywood cemetery and actually if you guys had some time it would be lovely to show you the Hollywood Cemetery as well it is a beautiful place at night ah yes you wanna know more go to the cemetery yes I have actually just recently came from there there's some beautiful artwork there surprisingly we appreciate the invitation but we are of course detained by matters of this state but of course I figured you could not help the Baron with his attire he chose that on his own volition I apologize that it may not be to human liking titi yes hmm fascinating if it was up to me I would have had him in one of my suits now Victor when you emerge from the back room and look around you do see Nelly in conversation with the prince and his guests Jasper where are you I'm with the Baron the game is starting no wait she's leaving her web Makana for you your friends in the shadows do they always follow you around like children not like children like family we stick by each other often you know there is a fourth baby be really should show herself sometime soon but it seems that she may have other plans tonight baby B yes did we possibly hear that I don't think you're close enough to hear so unless you're using a heightened senses power or aspects I think the murmur of conversation and the like motif music would not let you overhear their conversation all right it is worth noting but we have made our way to such a station by extending our hand to allies and we are not decided yet as to the fine company you keep I see and what is it was your decision based on whether or not they come forth to speak with me like men I see are you sure no I'm not sure at all but historically me just walking into things and starting to talk has been frowned upon so all right I'm gonna walk over a spur is going to cross the room and join the conversation I do follow him what he does and Victor as well so within moments Nellie is flanked by her associates no that's where you went oh yes I was trying to look at the roses and your majesty mr. Thomas and Suzanne she's in a whole shin oh sure oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] I'm not French I'm so sorry Prince Fenimore Thomas it's very nice to meet you and you know Scott - pleasure mmm did you no doubt know Jasper Victor temple thank you very much for having us for this wonderful gathering here in such a lovely place huge fan of the Getty Center it's always good to remember culture and that finer more beautiful things in this world yeah I couldn't agree more it's gorgeous every undead I in this room is trained on this conversation we are appreciative that you extended an invitation to us this evening it is very kind of you both we are known for our kindness yes we are here to interact openly and pleasantly yes I so really get to enjoy the cultured company of my own fellow been true it is refreshing to say the least you are not what I would call a venture from your attire from your mannerisms from your demeanor but I am from my results such a long resume you have in your short time that's it's true my nights do not begin to even remotely match what I've heard of you or perhaps many of you or and I don't I've not been able to make your acquaintance before tonight but I assume yours but it is true I'd like to think I've made the most of the time that has been allotted to me as have we all mm-hmm very good on this matter we would like to speak with you further it would be easier let us say for you to do away with any doubt you might have in the camera line any misunderstanding that you might have with our true purpose and come to a greater understanding of the world as it is but as you imagine it might be well I may speak for myself here but I don't believe we would be here if we didn't already have leanings in that direction as you know Nosferatu I am recently without a Sheriff I had heard yes and the position itself has become open to someone of a certain degree of talent and tactic I had also heard that as well from what I heard that position is being considered does it entice you it could surely you must have some wants you must have some needs beyond your most basic beast there must be something in exchange that your prince could offer you I do have needs and I do have one Prince but it's just a matter of if those wants and needs align with what the camerea does well we are here among friends speak freely well let's see if I were to accept the offer that has been placed before me I think the first thing I would like to know what exactly not having come from the cavalry or myself what exactly does that job entail well like all kindred in my domain you are of course at my beck and call of course but with your special attributes your persuasion and gifts it would be for us together to preside over those in this city who cannot understand the way things truly are all right now my second question considering the events that I heard that took place what's to stop the same thing happening and the position being refilled isn't that such a thing you might be surprised to know how many sheriffs have come and gone but as you know this unlife is about the moment and doing with our time what we are given mmm-hmm do you prefer the shadows do you prefer your disconnected ambling existence or would you prefer some purpose we all do tend to suffer from the sins of our fathers but I don't necessarily do things the way that most of my clan do hmm I do have those common talents but sometimes I'm a little more direct now my third question and also the thing that I generally desire if I were to do the thing do I get time alone to pursue my own goals and ambitions the three of you know you are never truly alone the ivory tower sees everything and this is of course the reason for my invitation to you dear baron hmm the answer is no of course you would never be alone but should you find yourself some special purpose or desire some pet project you might bring it before me to discuss now you Victor Victor I want to like you I really really do you have wealth as many of us do you have taste as some of us do and above all you have an ambition for power which is a great strength in one's allies and a horrible trait of one's enemies but you behave like a child a petulant child hmm at the princes words the red garb keeper of Elysium Maximilian Strauss drifts just a little closer as though ready to act if it becomes necessary are there any other seats around them like besides what they're sitting on I think that is for the His Majesty decide are there are there seats available for your guests or should they remain standing there is a stool if you'd like to sit upon it child would you mind I would I would rather not Louise I would rather not loom over you I'm aware that I can cast quite a shadow and I do sit but when I pans out you don't think you think I'm clearly not doing anything aggressive not a terribly comfortable perch I mean you are very tall we're way past comfortable I do do things differently than some of our kind I do do things differently than many of the other Unbound but quite frankly that's why I've been successful I can't follow a 17th century playbook and accomplish 21st century goals of course of course of course but the reason we do things the way we do them is because it works and has worked it is a fact that each thing you have typed into that device each message you have sent each call you have placed is absolutely in the hands of those who would destroy more than just your kind or ours you make us weak with each stroke of your finger I'm glad that you said this because you've now come to the real thing that I would like to discuss that yes we do in fact have a common foe we do in fact have a common foe that will not differentiate between us for a tutorial or ventric amarilla a narc they will just see us all as monsters and want to destroy us all which is quite true so yes I preserve the masquerade in an unusual way but you've spoken to the fact that you and I need not be adversaries none of us need be adversaries because our real enemy walks in the daylight that is what I would personally like to discuss with you Prince Tomas I have a question for you did just a moment there because then do you recall a the appointment of the sheriff or at least the offering of the appointment of the sheriff indeed I am but a minor student of the camera behind the way things are done but my understanding was there could be no sheriff until praxis was completed so as such Markos was never sheriff now you you you also might have a call when Chaz came and spoke with us I had some commentary on the state of your praxis did this happen to have reached your ears sir would you care to enlighten our company all the a kindred in the room are now at least six paces closer than they were in every undead eyeball trapped the motion of the prince's extension of his ring and his arm being withdrawn if they breathed there would be a loud intake of breath I won't insult your gathering with recounting what may or may not have been said but would it be accurate to say that you did not take it seriously when you heard Maximilian Strauss steps forward Your Majesty I believe he refers to his own claim of princedom in the city specifically dressed as such I wasn't aware there was a bathing suit component of the competition what this child suspects that he himself Baron if I am correct please Prince has his own claim my station so here's the point I'm making now you see just now when you hear that how that ideas last that you're like no it's not possible correct understand that for the Kindred of Los Angeles when you arrive on the scene and present your ring to the kindred that have walked these Knights of this city for decades decades perhaps centuries perhaps it is equally unacceptable to them it is equally unacceptable that when you extend the ring that everyone fall to their knees and kiss it let us ask everyone oh these people here sure I mean the Kindred of Westwood of Hollywood of the valley of the unbound but there may be a way there may be a way what do you propose Baron Jasper yes what is your current emotional mood what do you feel what emotion is uppermost in your heart at this moment probably fear Nellie the same question for you loathsome hey almost hate borderline hatred but loathsome now I make a wits and investigation wall please include 100 guy three successes that would be five six five six five sorry go critical yeah that's right you see him is in a very very far edge of the room so wearing a beautifully cut suit Armani you think maybe Cerruti you're not sure and he is staring okay please proceed m'lady I used my second sight to read the moods over the three he does not appear to be changing her attitude or aspect different dye actually could I use my telepathy instead yes who is your target Nellie Nellie what are your surface thoughts at this time what are you thinking as you see him across the room Oh utter hatred mm-hmm are you thinking about what you'd like to do no actually it's probably more flashbacks of what he's done to me the images conjured in your mind's eye are of Chad's price beautifully handsome but cruel with Nellie intimidating her manipulating her lying to her and Nellie believing all along that he loves her Nellie am i darling would you like to take a tour of the gardens with me I would love that excellent so Nellie and Suzanne leave the gathering and the Kindred Park for you like hmm the undead see allowing you exit out into the night that would leave Jasper and Victor and his majesty in conversation to your point no I don't wish for your station I have not earned your station I haven't earned the position of Prince but you have to understand to the unbound neither have you just like you don't think I have any claim whatsoever to any say in the running of the city to the kindred that dwell here they feel that way about you but there may be a solution there may be a way we can resolve this - at least not to our own greater benefit at least not to our detriment because quite frankly I know in this place I have to assume I'm an open book and completely transparent so let me say outright what I'm thinking for anyone who may be wondering peace between us is of the utmost value that can't come in the form of us just bowing down in letting collars get put on our necks or we would have already been in the camarillo but it's equally pointless in disadvantageous to be warring with each other in the streets I propose diplomacy a new convention of thorns right here in Lausanne ha yes we can show everyone we can show the entire world that there is a new way forward you know yourself the world has changed the world is fundamentally the same the Beast is fundamentally the same if I were to describe to you gravity any differently it would still pull you to the center of this earth but it was the fires of the first Inquisition that drove us all to the table to talk in the fires of the second Inquisition are lit I have seen it myself if not now when there's a murmur of laughter from the encircling kindred I turn and I look at them and I say I wonder how many of your sires laughed before they met the fires before they met the dawn Maximilian Strauss looks at his majesty as if asking for permission to speak I was there you know nothing of what you speak his majesty is quite correct flaunting our safety with your insistence on using those devices can no longer be permitted the cellphone is negotiable the cellphone is mine I hold it up and I snap it in half you break your own cellphone yeah I break my phone smash it in show but then I tuck the pieces back in my own pocket say if that we kindred in the room I'll step a pace closer Maximilian Strauss separates himself and moves to stand behind you that's ready mm-hmm sir may I remind you that you stand in Elysium while no violence is permitted here you are a guest this is twice that you have refused a request from his majesty refusal of a third may require you to depart I reach in and I take out the two pieces of the phone the cell phone yeah and I'm all like apologies that I mean to offend I'm new to these sorts of things very no yes and I do hand in hand him the pieces of the phone the broken items to the phone yeah I use dominate and offer you my ring a final time Baron now I want to make clear that what you feel isn't accompanied by the normal telltale signs of the use of the power normally when a kindred uses dominate at least as you have experienced it it requires eye contact and a visible force of will whatever is happening here isn't like that at all you feel simply that of course why shouldn't you be a gracious guest and do as your hosts requests if you want to fight the compulsion they'll require a role of willpower you would need a considerable number of successes to succeed I'll kiss it so you lean forward miss the cold circle of metal on the princes hand mm-hmm you feel as though you've done the right thing it feels perfectly justified almost rational it's a path the least resistance there is a murmur of approval from the room tension slides out of shoulders kindred nod after I do it to do a understanding that I feel fine that I did it but I still have my own thoughts afterwards correct you are memories and your emotions are not affected mm-hmm it doesn't seem to you however that you've done anything unusual or wrong I completely am rationalizing my choice to kiss the ring yeah exactly so I've seen it before yeah but with respect sir my point stands with full respect to you with full respect to this fine gathering the point stands and who would rally such an endeavor you baron you said yourself my ambition is a terrible trait in an enemy I would rather we not be enemies as I once said in a very different meeting I would sooner see all the beautiful art in this building burned to the ground before I saw anything happened to you as far as I'm concerned you are there sooner see mark and Isaiah burn to ash than anything happened to me as well surely you understand that I am not to be disagreed with and it is my professional opinion as your elder and your superior that this childish notion this this clutching for a history you do not understand from time I'm keeping an eye on Strauss he's standing directly behind Victor within easy arm's reach I'm just watching he sees you watching you you bring up an interesting point a prince you yourself are powerful by extension you're tremendously powerful the full weight of the ivory tower you could crush us at any time but you haven't yet why when you have seen as much night as we boredom will seep into your time and as you strut and fret your hour upon the stage it does little more than entertain us I'm pleased to be tale told by an idiot is that what cost you San Francisco boredom I do not think that San Francisco is lost I believe that Los Angeles is how shall we put it a better location Los Angeles is absolutely better than San Francisco meanwhile outside the building there is a beautiful maze-like garden under the night sky at this time of year the air is chill and crisp but the flowers are no less beautiful for it to Roses join the night okay I slipped my arm into yours I I sense something very special in you oh I see so much pain a broken heart I know that I recognize it I felt it what'd you do about it hmm I want to help you oh I think you and I would make a wonderful team I see and how do you perhaps can I give something to you sure opals and diamonds oh are you beautiful Suzanne how old is this piece would you say 235 years old that is well over my age wow this is beautiful is this it was given to me as a gift by someone who broke my heart Prince Mithras no I you know that name the Prince of London before London fell you have a very rich taste I know mm-hmm I see that in you too yes rich taste absolutely suffer I try to build my my own Empire why are you here with mr. with your majesty Thomas why am I here mm-hmm where else would I be I could be anywhere no I want to be in the center and I want to be where the dreams are made here in a Hollywood they taste the best you know those dreams get broken easily here but if you have it right before that's the best hmm the moments before the dreams get broken I see that you're a preferred taste I want you would you be would you be mine in what way darling my lady-in-waiting my secondhand I want you to be a hero fight for our rights our power as women hmm I think we could make a very powerful team see I like the word team I don't like the lady-in-waiting Oh with its wound yes old it is yes it is so a partnership working in parallel yes what's in it for you okay what are you wearing what is this diamond does it reveal my secret we're partners for a while tell you the story but what is it that I am wearing I've designed this myself fabulous thank you for a designer I am I am I have a clothing line called thorn and a perfume line called arachnophobia like your ring yep tell me darling do you like this time period it seems that you are still caught up in old ways I feel very out of sorts how so maybe that will be for the future but first tell me about ISA sweet ISA that is a very impressionable young lady who has the pleasure of attending my school for the first time in her first year yes she's a very fascinating creature that I keep a close tab on yes so human mm-hmm so fragile it's very fragile yes I kind of took a liking to her she reminds me of someone from my past who family a sister perhaps or a brother I use my emotional control and cast instant love and almost impossible to detect so Nellie you experienced what can only be described as an overwhelming wave of passionate love for Suzanne it washes over you calm and inviting if you wish to resist you need to roll your unmarked willpower i'ma try I will care of Suzanne's roll um blood dye included guys John Mark Karr yeah nope nope totally going for that that was one save or once unsurprisingly the power of the attraction is irresistible there is a flicker a moment and then you feel the compulsion pervert stood under the stars and just staring at them and just watch them fade away yes that's exactly how exhilarating love feels it's absolutely just adoring I grabbed her face and start like nuzzling my nose up against her skin you should stay here in Los Angeles darling I could show you everything around here oh my will will you be mine of course I will excellent oh this is so exciting I haven't felt like this in years [Laughter] you're exhilarating I grab her and kiss her you kiss her time ceases to be there is only the kiss hmm meanwhile inside the Elysium the kindred seemed to feel by their relaxed movements that something has been achieved they step backward a few paces and they even begin to murmur and talk among themselves well you know everybody's been much nicer than I assumed their feet we have many years of practice I am surprised that so few kinds of representative thought there would have been more but Seneca I don't really know any this is the camerea you have much to learn and I would be willing to teach you I do make a habit of learning things I very slowly lean closer so that it can in no way be interpreted aggressively is it I don't want any waiting Leah I'm trying to make a move on him or anything I just want to be able to make it harder for people outside of the three of us to hear me extracting hear the talking of the Kindred around you ceases but they don't move they merely watch I understand the unique constraints of your position as I'm sure you know doubt understand the unique constraints of mine of ours would it be possible after I deliver your terms back to my colleagues we could speak again in a more private environment I feel like it's very difficult for either of us to be completely transparent at a time like this anything you can say to me you could say before my subjects these are friends here if you have something else to say you may say it but I do not like to repeat myself please don't worry about me you can say whatever you want mm-hmm I assume all the Nosferatu here are listening attentively Strauss speaks I assure you young one there are no Nosferatu present in the Elysium how one hmm there is the one apart from those invited I appreciate the respect you've shown us I appreciate the hospitality that you have shown us and I will advocate for your position when I go back and then talk to my colleagues I expected as much I don't want to fight you Prince Tomas of course you do not I don't want anything to happen to anyone here I hope 500 years from now we can meet again on this exact spot and whatever stands here and reflect over the tumultuous times of the 21st century but you have to know sir you have to know and I still attempt to like lower my voice quietly but trying not to be overheard right trying I realize everyone's trying to hear I'm trying not to be overheard you must know it won't be so simple it's just declaring praxis in Los Angeles is yours we will see Jasper yes wits and awareness three successes your eyes are drawn upward perhaps in contemplation you notice the grand chandelier all shining crystal the center of the room you notice the gilded chain that attaches it to the high ceiling at the very top of the chain many dozens of feet overhead almost too small to be seen clinging to the chain with sharp little claws is wrapped you know you asked Jasper what he wants hmm what do you want Prince I wanted I've got it all I could ask for in that our interests are aligned it's my wish for all of us more time I like you more than I expected baron I must say the feeling is mutual sir don't feel bad about him he doesn't like anyone and to speak for me speak for yourself then have you made some decision or will you make me wait I've heard things that truly are worth something are worth waiting for indeed but you will have your answer soon it is a very large test to consider and an important one and I wouldn't want to do it lightly with respect Nosferatu have you chosen your primitive council yet or is that come after the rest of the Praxis I don't know what the process is I looked into it but there were no websites that detailed it in my library books aren't old enough in time when I have made my home here when we have finished hanging all the tapestries and I have thought the matter through I will decide who will stay and who will go but for now these things are kept close to the best and is it here the Getty Center where you are making your personal Haven it is quite a spectacular place isn't it this is for tonight well should you ever make it over the hill to the valley I can show you many wonderful places in my domain in the night garden' passion of two toreador is a singular thing it doesn't come often nor is it easily described Wow me what you feel Oh accelerated excitement wonder it's oh it's so magical will you live with me what live with you yes I have a very complicated woman I'd really don't know you'd want that oh you don't know me huh where would we live I have a spot where would that be not going to tell you but why not I'm just me your partner your lover I should be told these things I cast ah so you wish to persuade her say yes yes so compounded with the artificial but irresistible love it's very difficult to resist Nellie but you do have a chance hmm you want to try to hold it off no no I'm just gonna go with it gonna go with it yeah okay she's fascinating she is the world just as the kiss was the only thing that existed for as long as it was on your lips she is the only thing that your eyes can see couldn't dream of saying no to her I'd like to kiss her again this time I'm gonna use lingering kiss normally works only on those or under a certain condition mm-hmm what are you hoping to achieve um as hard as I'm falling for her I want her to basically fall for me you want to try to make her feel some of what you were feeling go ahead and make the roll Suzanne surprisingly she's going to try to lure you into romance from her attraction your choices are to go ahead and allow it and be swept up in the moment smooth or to maintain the effervescence maintain the upper hand paint and the upper hand we're sorry we're assembling the pool yeah kiss yes isn't my persuasion in prison sir just thank you mm-hmm why why can't I find prisons right now there we go thank you five um I'd like to use a willpower take willpower damage to re-roll up to three dice that was better thank you six six total mm-hmm this is a good willpower expenditure they're very very close she's good hmm she could be expert given time tutelage so against your will and perhaps better judgment you do feel a spark of something in return your mind says it's not real and that it won't last but it's undeniable no one has dared to do that to you in centuries Wow Wow indeed so you've joined us excuse me joined us joined us renounced the anarchist movement why would I do find your true calling this is your true calling anarchists disgusting heathens children but so baby peons are so much bigger than that you're so much bigger than that don't joke I'm not you were to get an ivory tower oh but it's so beautiful inside the Elysium while outside the lovers are having a little spat Maximilian Strauss leaves his station from behind Victor crosses the floor and comes to stand next to his majesty he leans in and he whispers Your Majesty will recall the other appointment of this evening time grows short what is your well with your guests I bid you adieu and a good night if you would like to stay and enjoy the view you may but I must be away on business no I believe will collect Nelly and see ourselves out but I would like to say what whatever is coming whatever happens next I would like you to know you've won my respect sir is it proper protocol to shake your hand no maybe next time and I do stand slowly the kindred seem satisfied and approving of their prints tolerant of you and Jasper and perhaps expectant you have an answer soon and as I turn I look at Strauss I am a great admirer of your designer and tailor as well sir good evening he touches his own round red glasses and I do make my way towards the Rose Garden yeah she's did she wear Nelly and Susanne exited the building so they aren't difficult to find they appear to be quite enamored of each other oh here's the question which one of them do you think did that to the other that's not a hard question she's much older hopefully it's temporary Suzanne you do hear their approach hello hello it would appear our business is concluded ma'am oh well thank you so much for coming this evening it was wonderful to meet the both of you thank you for the invitation no no she won't be staying with me is that so I wish you a pleasant evening well we have our meeting with the baby be later tonight we have to discuss the project I can't leave my love oh I mean she's so beautiful I mean clearly that's uh that's interesting I always find when I have to motivate people to feel things it's not real when I do it perhaps you just have a greater mastery of the arts you wish to release her no no I use my emotional control of awe on the both of them you'll have to choose between the two of them and it won't compel all them to do anything it will make you seem friendly but they won't Oh Beth well I'll try which one do you choose Victor Victor hmm you're quite lovely I understand what you see in her as you are preparing to extend your unnatural attraction to them you hear footsteps behind you in the garden it's Strauss with the red coat and the glasses it makes a sound in the back of his throat as though this is what he expected he clears his throat unnecessarily and says madam apologize for interrupting His Majesty has expressed a wish that his guests depart I'm very sorry we will meet again soon I'm sure I hope so and with these beautiful stars and moon and I kiss around both cheeks hmm never turn the gesture kisses in farewell Strauss looks at the three of you and with his eyes he indicates go while you can mr. Strauss to you don't take my eyes off her I do sort of corral you make your way back to the vehicle where Bailey is waiting mm-hmm yes you have a long ride back to talk this seems like an excellent place to pause reflect and when we return we'll take a look at the other side of kindred conflict hello and welcome back to our vampire the masquerade Chronicle la by night season 2 episode 8 innocent monsters it is the same night but in a different part of Los Angeles a very different part of Los Angeles far to the south beyond LAX beyond Englewood there's a different world from the Getty and bel-air trans Rumble by dislodging dust and paint and rust everything here seems to exist in the shadow of bridges and overpasses and other elevated structures that aren't built in other parts of the city at least half of the houses here are derelict or at least overtaken by terrible blight decay even many of the legitimately inhabited structures have broken windows are boarded over doors the entire neighbourhood seems to be a product of deliberate years long camp pains of economic oppression and this is where nines and Annabel find themselves tonight Annabel you received a text earlier that had a picture of Jasper Nellie and Victor on their way to Elysium with caption this look okay so I just Victor looks like a dad from the 80s and clearly Jasper is pulling off a goth dr. horrible look and no he looks good very good hmm like today that's good it's fine no no no it's fine it's fine everything's fine everything's totally fine everything's fine everything's fine okay stay on task yeah yeah yeah r why are they called the Valkyries are they actually are they like honest to god Odin sheep are there Norse guides is there a real God oh you're asking the wrong person I'm the man that always asks that question every single night we'll find out I know about as much about as I know about as much about them as you do oh just that they are in South LA mm-hmm and they are called the Valkyries and that we really really need their help we do okay I think we have a really good shot here hey how do you feel I mean I just you know I think it I think it went okay with the Nosferatu good I think they'll let us here yeah so yeah I mean how bad could it be right right what do you think you're up against right now no I I don't know hey could I don't know if they're sympathetic to the cause you don't know if you don't I don't know anything like it's it's hard to collect information I mean I mean why is everybody scattered why doesn't anybody communicate with each other hmm what are the anarch's why must they be like this why must we be like this you know there's something really interesting that happens when you become in kindred I think that's for better or worse we tend to find some corner and stick to it and rarely do we go beyond those boundaries and take that kind of leap of faith in risk contact beyond whatever is necessary right here where we are right now is out of my turf absolutely I have no idea what we might face you should be ready for anything I've had to be but I mean humans do that too but I don't know I just working together is the only way we're gonna get [ __ ] done so yes hold on to that right now you seem a little bit mmm jolted ground yourself tap into that thing that ownership that you have you know why you're here stay true to that don't let it get shaken 19 Annabel how are you getting down into South LA we're on my hiding we're on like on nine spike yeah classic that every built hobby I just you know hated by my microphone was always really worried about it well just hold on tight then okay so you rock it into South LA headed for the destination that the nos rots who gave to you it's hard to talk on a bike so you have to let the night wash over you different year riding on a grossly overpowered two-wheeled vehicle with a perilously low center of gravity but you're immortal it's thrilling doesn't take as long as it might in a car more maneuverable nines navigates as though he's been in the south end before trail leads you to a dense neighborhood tangled streets broken street lamps overgrown Lots damaged homes the blight is very evident and very real and Abell you haven't come here a lot when you were alive it's a far cry from Griffith College Hollywood don't seem to be a lot of people out on the streets in this part of the city I'm not even a lot of lights on in the homes eventually you're roar into the parking lot the address you were given it's one of the only lit buildings in the block loki's cycle repair a lot of motorcycles parked out here some of them in various stages of disrepair being taken apart some of them pristine and gleaming all of them chained up there are lights on inside the shop Loki's this is it okay you ready you know what I am good me too as if in answer to the roar of your cycle the door of the shop opens two figures emerge both kindred both beautiful but in very very different ways one dark serious clad in leather and the other like something out of a pagan nightmare one of them's got to be a bruja right we're Klan leather jacket possibly so you emerge from your shop here having heard them from half a mile away got a problem with your bike huh uh seems to be working pretty good me but you're welcome to take a look at it why other reason would you be here we're here on business of sorts what kind of business well Gary sent us Gary golden nos brought to you nice guy he says that you are might be interested in what we have to say I don't think anybody speaks for us we didn't think so either which is why we've come to speak to you ourselves that I appreciate so what what is this that we would be interested in right now Vannevar has waltzed into town and declared praxis he's the Prince of Los Angeles now princess come and go right well did he send his Herald to you to try and get you to bend the knee nobody gets us to do [ __ ] do I look like we just bend the knee no mmm but things are on the move the second is inquisition has arrived in Los Angeles federal agents breathing down our necks and now Vannevar has said kiss the ring or be crushed under the jack-booted heels of the camera now the answer oh yes please I'm sorry uh I'm Annabelle right this is 9 Rodriguez uh ladies it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance may we please have your names okay yeah sure uh I'm sicker ex Casey so why do you care about any of this why it doesn't bother us any the presence of the camera really doesn't bother you at all here the presence bothers me but we mind our own business they're making their camera love demands fealty a blood tax anarch's have been so separate from each other there's a bunch of rabble for so long but we need to unite if we're gonna push them out need that's such a demanding word do you need to do anything I mean I need to do what my own free will inspires me to do but beyond that I don't need to do anything really see this is exactly what we're up against right now this kind of game playing is what's going to become the downfall of the Kindred in the city who's playing games this this bantering back and forth look let's just have real talk okay kindred say kindred you know You Know Who I am I know of the Valkyries we're not coming here for any of that [ __ ] we have something real to talk about the camera is here that thread is real this free will that you're talking about it's lovely for as long as that you can hold on to it the camera Ella don't believe in self guv and they are United and with their power they will crush us if we don't unite in the same way exactly they're united because they all see us in the same way squabbling over Berenice right just beneath them well then come inside and we can talk about it but everything has a price of course it does all right yeah come in invite them into the repair shop what's it like in there well besides the bike parts everywhere you see pagan runes along the walls and little trinkets tossed about hmm Annabelle may come intelligence and an occult roll one huh one success one success vaguely familiar you think that the runes are authentic you know you've seen pictures of them somewhere before but a lot of the other symbols and signs and objects you don't know what their exact purpose is but you're pretty sure that some kind of magic are you a witch that's rude I'm sorry I'm sorry I think I can go about asking people here election octagon I think there are more important things at hand yeah sorry it's just really interesting to me I have I have some friends that are witches and nofilter it's part of the charm maybe we can talk about that yeah you're really cool um but seriously though eh what are you doing out here well you don't have a coterie you don't have a baron you make a lot of assumptions I I mean I didn't want to know we keep these streets clean clean of what we don't tolerate liars no no salaries disrespect no liars or cheats here you're surrounded by Liars in cheek of course it seems to be the way of the Beast any political faction is so why by aligning yourself with scum like that do you think it makes you any better what do you mean what political faction any political faction your set their sect any sect we're not talking about that we're talking about freedom real freedom is it really true freedom to live under a baron who sent you here we come out of our own free will and as you said everything has a price freedom oh my god I can't believe I'm gonna say this but freedom isn't free it really isn't it can be really so how do you defend your territory from when the camera Ella come marching in we watch each other's backs just the two of you know how many of you are there honestly a couple dozen at most that's information we'll give you if we agree to help but as of right now we mind our business we keep our area clean don't have issues you came in here you didn't see any of that trash here for now but the camera lad just got here and in the couple of months that they've been in town they sent out practices there's a Harold there they're laying their claim well they won't lay their claim here what makes you so certain that you can stand your ground against them just your group I'm not so concerned with them personally I'm more concerned about the pedophile down the street we look to our own we clean up our own and I don't need to get involved with anybody else's mind games there's no mind games there mind games so you clean up your streets one petty thug at a time what if you could make the streets cleaner all over Los Angeles make your can your Kendrick could walk through the streets not just in your area but in Beverly Hills or in downtown in the valley do you think somebody like me wants to go prancing around Beverly Hills it's not realistic anyway it's an idealistic pipe dream revolutions have to start somewhere how clean do you think you're keeping your part of town anyway on our way here we saw buildings in disrepair you can smell the struggle in the air I applaud you for your efforts I applaud you for for what's driving you and in the cause of desire to do good in that sense you're holding your own well boat you could have so much more character is built in struggle nobody gets to live a life headed to them on a silver platter just because things are broken doesn't mean that they're lost you're right we're not here to judge that or criticize that and I apologize if it's coming off that way we're really not here we're here more than anything to have real talk and to see if there's a way to come together an alliance or maybe even beyond that we need your help you mean the movement the whole strength of the Anarch movement but we need you for that well you need us we do and we need a favor and we want to know if you're willing to do bad things to be a great person here's a deal we're obviously more concerned with the danger we can see with the immediate threat to innocence in our area you're talking about coming together making an alliance right how do we know that you care about what's important to us I agree with six I think if you can show us that we can share a common threat and a common enemy and a common objective maybe then we'll be willing to take on some of your objective what proof do you need well as I said I need to know that you're willing to do anything it takes what are we up against tell us more about the threats that you face on a daily basis well for example there's a guy that we've been watching to deal with he he goes by rags he takes in orphans and he uses them to smuggle drugs around the city until he dumped them then he just disposes of them in a whole variety of colorful wings and that is not tolerated and we've been watching him to make sure that we are making the right decision because the only solution to this is death innocence shall not be harmed we made perfectly short rags is far from innocent so are you willing to kill in the name of the greater good do don't don't we have courts or your justice systems are family let me just tell you as someone formerly in this justice system you put so much trust in there's political strife all over that [ __ ] - there's corruption everywhere you can't trust that interest you you trust what's inside you trust in your blood your heart your instincts what you know to be right that's the thing is that yeah I've always protested against the corruption in the system and the system is rotten but we can make a new one we can make a better one again more pipe dreams I don't need some pie-in-the-sky dream from you that you can sell me on I want a solution now to solve the problems immediately at hand of course there's always a future for better opportunities but right now just like the camerea is what you need to deal with right now and you need our help to solve that this is the trade so in return for building a better tomorrow you want me to kill we want to build a better tomorrow for South LA I respect that who are these orphans so many kids from all over there's a few specific orphanages rags hangs around at and slowly plucks them off what about them makes you want to protect them got the [ __ ] kids they're innocent in this game that we play regardless of my humanity her humanity your humanity they're in a snow regardless hmm is he kindred or or human he's kindred it seems to me you feel like you've been I don't know almost neglected from the rest of us we don't feel neglected we live just fine you do you're doing fine it looks like it you're both strong I can see it and but this yeah needs help it does what do you could use money it could use influence money doesn't solve all the issues in the world you know a lot of times it just makes it worse influence as you can see with camerea sometimes makes things a lot worse we respect each other just person-to-person being to being yeah but we can't have these fractured little systems we can't have like roving gangs taking out the taking out the bad guys like one block at a time I'm trying to build something where all of us can get together and where there will be a system that will take care of this guy in a just manner and is death not just how long is it gonna take to build this system how many more orphans have to die for you to get your dream and have it be effective orphans don't need to die I know they do every night and they deserve to be protected and it's commendable that that's what put a stop to it but will you yes yes we will you have my word and this is not just a game if you really do this that would go a long way to show that maybe we do have some common interests in this I know you need our help and you clearly want this and maybe at the end we don't want the same thing but right now we do I don't want anybody to tell me how I should deal with this person I don't want anybody to tell me what I need to do anything I want true freedom and freedom doesn't always being death doesn't always mean you have to kill but sometimes like I said you have to do terrible things to be a great person because the that is what's right Anabelle your phone text message it's Ramona got a second sorry hang on kind of busy what's up eyes can't catch up where are you South LA Mokey's cool eyes in a few can you give us a second please you can step outside I'm going to leave the garage and go back out into the parking lot under the streetlights what's going on Nine's it's not that I'm opposed to getting rid of what is clearly a terrible person who doesn't deserve to walk the streets anymore it's that if we have this idea and we continue to be fractured and the idea of complete freedom like how how can we do this how can we get them to understand that if they're out here on their own we won't survive they won't survive they don't seem to see that right now huh I'm not opposed to taking this guy off the streets it's just that I want to prove to them that what we have in mind is bigger than that is bigger than pulling one thought off the streets I ask you something yeah so far the conversation that we've had with them do you see them resisting and putting up walls no it just it feels like they're just trying to test us how do we pass that test and what's the purpose if we pass that test what changes in them I I don't know I don't know if they'll understand that cohesion is the best plan I think they'll just think that what do you need from them to get what you want I need them to understand that it's better for them it's better for all of us if we stick together and that it is possible to build a better system and what does that require showing them that we do care about what they think go in there and show them that you care about what they care about cuz that's what you're all about I do I want their streets to be safer I want orphans getting used to fraud smugglers Lee I just want to I just wanna make it better so that that kind of thing doesn't doesn't get this far you know you told me one of the first conversations that we had and stuck with me what does everybody need the home isn't just a place it's who you're with a shadow crosses over at the streetlamp soundlessly an enormous owl rise to the top of the street lamp and perches up there looking down at you and nines in the parking lot now tilts its head in a winks one of its enormous eyes at you it's huge nines this is the biggest I'll use things like the size of an eagle oh it looks completely out of place here should I be afraid front bars actually I text text Ramona oh really question mark no why maybe owls don't have cell phone okay after you I thank you that I go back inside the owl flaps its wings twice collides in the open door you are surprised to see your friends joined by nocturnal bird of prey perches on one of the bike seats in the shop you know as a gangrel you're very familiar with animaux animals this thing is larger than any natural owl as you see so you brought a friend more friends to make more friends with at least they got good taste that to Ducati that's her Ducati the Owls hidden laws sink in know the Owls claws retract some the build and Victor temple all right so did you have a good conversation yeah you're concerned about this that concerns me we'll take care of your problem give us all the information on rags where we can find them any weaknesses that you might know of I'll take care of it when do you want it taken care of now see me yeah yeah I mean the sooner the better would be great the sooner you do it the sooner you'll have an answer tonight none you'll be watching and if it all goes to hell we'll help boil tea goes a long way when somebody helps us and they mean it we have their backs Valkyrie don't turn their back on their friends ever I no matter what now it takes a while to become said friendship level but uh you know Sharon some mutual interests will go a long way into making that a reality and hey we're always looking for good strong friends baby steps you know Holly seems intensely interested in this conversation you know it can understand you me but I recognize who it is well you haven't seen these particular markings before well in the sake of honesty I'm assuming your friend would like to join us it's their cool it's cool the owl nods nothing hide so how do you plan to guide them there you want to take them or do you want to give them an address we're gonna take them a few blocks down hop on your bike no no no bike still no we're coming alright we'll do it the slow way it's not always in our interest to be loud and I'm not yeah yeah yeah kind of like it sometimes maybe later I mean look like my face I like it all the time alright let's get moving so we're gonna take them around the corner about three blocks down and you can knock on the door and say you're interested in somewheres what come on I'm steady sell cocaine heroin you know okay even heavy legals - opioids mark anything anything he can really get his hands on all right Sekar accent Casey where will you be doing this we're gonna go around to the back like the alley in between the two buildings yeah we're gonna stay in the vicinity in case reinforcements are needed but you'll hear if we call for you what are you gonna call for Asgard I like your style hey all right let's do this thing huh okay and don't [ __ ] it up I don't want to clean this up I will do my utmost best ma'am lady if you owe money 80 okay a wood with Annabelle as we approach the where Powel flaps its wings lands Jim do you wanna Oh it hops up onto your shoulder talons digging into your coat it's really heavy I mean it's huge yeah ah you okay um no no no no this is like all right it's like you know I mean you know anything it's just it's this anesthetic it synthetic that is mine now mm-hmm great um yeah I have a desire sort of an itch to step away and let you handle this on your own because you need to be in the spotlight okay they have to see this come from you and I cannot be the one to snip it no no thank you um I'll be close yeah I can handle this you still have a choice you don't have to do anything that you don't want to do stay true to you and let that lead you I'm afraid that if I'm in the presence of somebody like that I might snap his neck all right I'll be near Thanks I step away do you want to go around to the back to where the Valkyries are waiting or do you want to be someplace else I'm going to be kind of around the corner I want to watch her approach and as soon as she gets in I'll go back around and join them okay duly noted this place reminds you a lot of the building where you confronted the thin Bloods with their weird

span just a few minutes oh I see you've been busy well mm-hmm have you eliminate the threat it's been taken care of yessiree sir way cleaner than before how did you do it mind games but he's done right worthy he's not gonna be troubling you anymore that wasn't the question listen everyone has their secrets right but I took care of it I think she allied herself with rice I'm asking the question I obviously asked it loud enough so you could hear me no I did not allied myself with somebody who runs drugs with children then where's his body we don't take kindly to Liars around here what did you want me to do tonight did you want me to kill somebody or did you want me to take care of your problem I thought maybe I explicitly said kill him eliminate the threat make sure the threat doesn't come back in the future that's what I heard you haven't been specific with us about what happened how do we know rags won't be back doing the same thing tomorrow but I could be wrong maybe I didn't say that but I thought it was very clear it's at this point that Bragg's emerges from the back out into the alley where you're talking very loudly rags piece of [ __ ] himself yeah yeah Ramona is Rona your body you can see the owl perched on top of the house uh Ramona can you ask rags to roll over for me the owl isn't there anymore now it's a young kindred a young woman she wears sweats a black t-shirt with cutoff sleeves she's got glasses long permanent fangs yo love the rides Hey rags II roll over he drops to his knees and does a couple of spins on the tarmac Ramona asked rags if he's ever gonna do what he done ever again rags e-baby you done with this [ __ ] I'm done I she made me drink you buy this she got the bond on me I buy it but I still don't trust it bond works Ramona yo looking to fight for freedom hey I'm already signed up I'd like you to join us because I want to keep a closer eye on rags why do you mean hang out on a bike I mean I could show you how to ride we think be nines you can have was kind of one ride a bike hmm seems like a win-win to me yeah in that way if he does decide to act up again I can finish the deal God you sure about this I can't help feeling like the scumbag one well everything comes with a price if he does it again he's attached to somebody yeah we're it this way you get muscle helping you clean up the streets isn't that right rags just point me where you want me in the shop cleaning up the trash all right don't touch any of the bikes either all right I guess sometimes you take in the target and they help the cause isn't it what you keep your enemies close what does it keep your friends close and your enemies people are enemies deader yeah so what's that mean I mean you're gonna join up it means that you're gonna stick with us y'all hang out for a bit we got to keep rags here under control and make sure he does what he promised Annabelle he would do if he doesn't off he doesn't I'm gonna eat him well I still don't trust you that was not the deal I kind of do I kind of do Annabelle thank you for showing that our concerns can also be your concerns that takes conviction we appreciate that now not following through on that conviction right that makes me question things yeah so what you keep talking about having us join you what does that mean I mean if you're doing something that would be fine by us anyway maybe we'll get your back but I'm not taking orders from nobody nobody's gonna give you orders but I think you may you know I fight for free will as well I believe I believe that everybody deserves a home I I want it for the Nosferatu I want it for the thin Bloods yeah the thin Bloods there around end of days all of that but they deserve homes just like the rest of us the camera won't want to take that away we are going to crush them we're gonna push them out of Los Angeles and not only we're gonna are we going to get rid of them but we're going to change the system as it is I'm glad that you think you're gonna change the system I know I'm gonna change the system well believe it when I see it hey me too but I want to see it this is gonna be awesome it could be awesome look we're just asking for a chance we can give you a chance all we ask is that if the time comes you can ride some backup the time is going to come well if the time comes we'll see we'll maybe see you there depending on this situation I don't want to take orders from nobody who's saying this is best for our cause so you have to do it I don't want to hear so you have to do it if the time comes and the cause seems worthy we do what needs to be done and as we said seems fair hey hey rags you roll over again that was great I like oh look at him go I love this this is so cool hey one thing I get my own bike we'll work on

local clinic that serves the under-privileged is tonight you want to throw any cash Olli you got Anya now in with it I'll be sure to take it over sounds good yeah so as we've seen conflict between kindred can be fought and resolved in many different ways sometimes with great difficulty and sometimes advantageous Lee but regardless of the nature of the conflict secrets always have a way of getting out Fiona you're back already I came to check on you see how you're doing on that research project I gave you and I brought you takeout I'm not hungry I haven't been I feel strong that's the blood it does that sometimes but you have to eat we talked about this my blood gives you a little bit of my power that's why you're healthy again and you're basically immortal as long as I keep giving it to you it's a pretty good deal but you didn't exactly do this for me did you you're so clever I did it for many reasons for me for you for politics you won't understand for a while but unbalanced it was for your own good I know and better to be this than be killed for looking into what I was looking into I won't keep you in the dark like Jasper did but I will keep you safe and this way you can keep investigating plus you already know the biggest secret that we exist I know and I'm grateful to you for all of this alright I feel like I am or is that just the blood - you really are something the blood helps you see things my way but I wouldn't control you like that I don't want to dull that mind of yours especially now that it works for me and if I wanted to see Jasper not yet this is about him isn't it this is bigger than Jasper Chloe you have to start thinking of things in the long term we can live forever not all plans and how they start and sometimes you acquire pieces before you know what you want to do with them on the board I know it's just that I want to see him because you miss him or because you have questions both but I can wait it can wait long term long term you
