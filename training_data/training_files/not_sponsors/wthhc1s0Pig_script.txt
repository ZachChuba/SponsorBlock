let's start with an explanation of dynamic range since it's pretty likely that it'll be easier to understand what a lot of it is if you know what it is in the first place dynamic range is much like a contrast ratio a measurement of the difference between the brightest part of an image and the darkest unlike contrast ratios which use linear numbers to represent the luminance of the brightest whites and darkest blacks in an easy way that anyone can understand dynamic range is measured in f-stops each of which represents this difference in powers of two okay so let's do an example a pocket camera rated at six at stops of dynamic range can correctly capture an image that has bright spots that are 64 times brighter than the darkest shadows this according to Wikipedia anyway is about what our eyes could perceive if they operated like a still camera and just took snapshots as we went about our business but they don't instead when we look around our eyes are adjusting constantly to achieve an estimated maximum dynamic range of as much as 20 stops to put that in perspective the best cinema grade digital cameras top out in the neighborhood of fourteen to sixteen stops of dynamic range today and while that allows their operators to capture beautiful images that have a mixture of bright light and deep shadows without clipping or losing so much detail that all the camera captures in a given region is complete lactose or blue note pure white it would appear that to achieve what the I can more is basically better and we've still got a lot of work to do right enter HDR or high dynamic range imaging this technique attempts to make the image on your phone or camera look more true to life by revealing more details in the shadowy areas of an image and in blown out bright areas by exposing the image multiple times to compensate for the limited dynamic range of your capture equipment it's not a new technique by any means and basically all HDR implementations work in pretty much the same way the camera records an image multiple times in rapid succession at varying exposure or brightness levels then software techniques are either automatically or manually applied to blend them together into one image borrowing the details in the shadows from the brightest image and the details on the bright light from the darkest one and put in the all together in an attempt to recreate what the eye would see if you were just looking around normally at the scene that you're trying to capture in theory it's great and there are certainly situations where an experienced DSLR user with a tripod and a very still subject can tastefully use HDR to produce very pleasing images but there are some challenges number one is motion a moving subject will not look good with HDR because whether you're capturing three images the way most smartphones do or whether you're capturing 20-plus the way a manual DSLR user might someone moving through the shot or even something as subtle as leaves blowing in the wind will usually completely ruin the image number two is scenes with vivid colors or interesting looking contrast while HDR post-processing neighboring more color into a dull image it can have the opposite effect in an image where you've already got vibrant color and of course if you're looking for like artful high or low contrast by its very nature it will reduce that effect in fact the situations where HDR might be legitimately useful are pretty few and far between a backlit skier in the shadow of a tree with a beautiful mountaintop lightly lit landscape behind her might be better captured with HDR but this is mostly only true if the objective of taking the image is to get a more practical image where you can see the details in the skiers face as well as the landscape because often HDR counter-intuitively ends up looking surreal rather than more natural but I think there's a place for that while many purists may disagree with the use of HDR entirely this is the kind of argument that I often have with my production crew where they might want a super sexy shallow depth-of-field shot on a product and I might just want to close the aperture boost the gain to high hell and produce an image so it allows the viewer to look at any part of it and get a clearer idea of what the heck they're looking at as opposed to creating something that is better art or more
