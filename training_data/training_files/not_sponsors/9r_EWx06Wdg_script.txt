hello this is chef john from food wishes
como with hawaii and garlic shrimp scampi that's right i've received a
bunch of requests to make this and after tasting it i understand why and if
you're a garlic lover you're gonna want to grab a pen and pull out your bucket
list and add this recipe to it and yes by the way scampi does mean shrimp so
this recipe is actually called hawaiian a garlic shrimp shrimp bob redundant
names aside I absolutely love this and I really think will too and what we'll
do to get started is peel an entire head of garlic and to do that I'm going to
show an old trick for doing it all at once by using a couple bowls and all
we need to do is separate the cloves into One Bowl and then once that's done
we'll put the other Bowl over the top and we will give it the OL shake of
shaken for about thirty seconds or so or until all those peels are knocked off
the cloves oh and let me give a little warning if you're freakishly
strong like I am I think I might have shaken this a little too hard
or a little too long because it appears that one or two of my cloves broke apart
but forget that the point is all those peels came off really easily and we
didn't have to peel those one by one oh and I was too lazy to walk over to the
sink but if pour a little bit of cold water into this bowl that's close a
real easy to grab out and then what we'll do once we have about eight or ten
nicely peeled cloves of garlic is take a knife and chop them up but not super
fine okay we don't want mince garlic here because what we're gonna do next is
toasted golden brown and some butter and if it's too small there's a chance it
could go too far and burn and when I first start out with this I'm not just
mindlessly chopping down I'm actually aiming for some of those bigger pieces
and going a little bit slowly and deliberately until it looks like I have
a lot of consistently sized pieces and then we can speed up and chop this as
small as we want which like I said is not gonna be super small okay I think
the perfect chop size for Hawaiian garlic shrimp is right about here and
that's it that is now ready to go into our butter so what we'll do next is melt
four tablespoons of butter over medium heat and we will all take a couple
seconds here to watch that butter slide across the pan which I find very
relaxing and maybe a little too relaxing since I never focused the camera for the
shot of the garlic going in the melted butter
but anyway once that butter melts and starts to foam up we'll go ahead and
stir in our chopped garlic and our plan here is to cook this during over medium
until it turns a beautiful golden brown and while don't have to stir
constantly don't go anywhere all right golden brown is good the
golden black is not gonna work so we're really gonna need to pay attention here
and catch it right at that perfect level of toastiness which for me was right
about here and don't forget after turn the heat off this is gonna toast
even a little bit more so you're not gonna want to go any farther than this
and then once that set we'll pull it off the heat transfer it into a bowl and
we'll reserve that so we can add it back into the pan once our shrimp are cooked
speaking of which what we're gonna need here is one pound of fully thawed
deveined but shell on shrimp which is usually
sold with some kind of name like easy peel and while can make this with
the shell off that's not how they do in Hawaii and by leaving that shell on you
get so much extra flavor or at least that's what they officially tell people
okay I'm gonna be testing that theory later as I'm gonna try second batch
without the shells oh and the reason for the paper towels is want to make
sure these are as dry as possible so make sure drain these very well and
then Pat them nice and dry and then once those are set the only other component
we need is our star cheese spicy coating which is gonna be made with a couple
tablespoons of rice flour or if want regular flour but rice flour does work
better and it's not that hard to find all right just head for the gluten-free
aisle and then to that we will add a tablespoon of regular paprika plus a
teaspoon of the finest Cayenne can find and then we'll finish up with some
salts at which point we'll simply give that a mix and once combined it's ready
to toss with our shrimp so we'll go ahead and remove those paper towels and
then go ahead and sprinkle over that kody mixture and the reason we're being
so generous with that as well as with our garlic butter mixture is because if
we are using the authentic method and we're peeling off the shells
a lot of that goodness is not going to be attached to the meat so we want to
make sure we have plenty to go around but anyway we'll sprinkle that over at
which point we'll take a big spoon or spatula or spoon eula and mix these
until they are very evenly coated making sure of course every nook and cranny is
covered and that's it once those are thoroughly completely covered in our
coating we will head to the stove to cook these up
which will do over medium-high heat in a nonstick pan in a few tablespoons of
olive oil and a pound of shrimps gonna make two portions and I'm just cooking
one here because we do not want to crowd these all right we definitely want to
use what I call the Beyonce method which is just a single layer just a single
layer just a single layer just a single layer all right so if want to do the
whole batch got to use a bigger pan and since we're not gonna crowd these
they're only gonna take a couple minutes per side so we'll give that first side
about two minutes and then we'll flip them over and then give the other side
about the same and of course when I say two minutes per side that's just a guess
are you're the one that actually has to decide based on how big your shrimp are
I mean are after all the con Aloha of how long to go brah but a couple
minutes per side is a pretty good guess oh and in case you're wondering the best
size shrimp to get for this dish I think are the 21 to 25 per pound size all
right when buy shrimp there's usually two numbers on the bag like 16
20 21 25 and those numbers simply refer to how many shrimp per pound and then
what we'll do once these have been beautifully cooked on both sides is well
go ahead and toss in our toasted garlic and butter and we will stir all that
together and cook that for about 30 seconds or so
at which point is going to be ready to serve and if enjoy the smell of
cooking garlic which I really really do it does not get any better than this it
is just absolutely intoxicating but anyway let me pull together and pull
these off the stove so I can serve them up on some white rice alongside the
traditional fresh lemon and please do not be shy about spooning that toasted
garlic and butter over the top and that my friends is nothing short of garlic
shrimp heaven or in this case garlic shrimp shrimp heaven so let me go ahead
and squeeze over some lemon and dig in and with the shells on these you
basically have two approaches to eating we can go ahead and pop the whole thing
in our mouth and then spit out the shell once separated and that method will
deliver the maximum amount of flavor which by the way was tremendous but the
downside is the feeling of shrimp shells in my mouth is not one of my favorite
sensations so the other much more popular approach is to pull the shell
off before eating which is of course very messy and does take a good amount
of effort but in fairness and isn't quite as hard as I'm making it look here
since I was trying to do this with and which is not recommended alright
what want to be doing is not filming this at the same time and eating this
outside on a picnic table going at it with all ten fingers and also adding to
the challenge here every once in a while get a batch of shrimp where the
shells are really really super thin and paper like and this batch was like that
and don't worry I will go back and eat that meat I left in the tail sections
when I should mention just that toasted garlic butter on the rice is pretty much
worth making this recipe for all by itself so good and yes at a certain
point I did give up on the one hand method which did make things a little
bit easier but anyway to summarize Hawaiian garlic shrimp scampi with the
shell on is insanely delicious and absolutely one of the best garlic shrimp
recipes you'll ever enjoy ok searing these in the shell really does add some
flavor and does help keep the shrimp from drying outs but if we're being
honest definitely a little bit of a hassle to eat so in the name of science
I did a second batch and other than peeling off the shells I did everything
exactly the same all right same garlic butter same coating same searing in the
pan same rice and same fresh lemon although I did change the placemat and
in my opinion I found these to be just as flavorful are just an explosion of
garlic shrimpy goodness and of course way way easier to eat however there is
one major difference right with the authentic method we're not necessarily
supposed to be eating all the coding which is why we use so much whereas here
it's seared right onto the shrimp so that aspect is definitely more
pronounced and we do get somewhat less of a pure garlic and shrimp flavor
profile but when weigh that against how much easier these are to eat I think
I do prefer these over the authentic shell on version and I keep using the
word authentic although I'm not really exactly sure how authentic these are
since I've never been to Hawaii all right to be honest I've always been a
little bit afraid to go ever since I saw that Brady Bunch episode when I was a
kid but from what I've seen what we did was pretty close so ultimately if you
decide to make these you're gonna have to decide whether to go with the shells
or not but the good news is no matter which version make they are both
incredibly delicious and a must make for any garlic and or shrimp level
which is why I really do hope give these a try soon so please follow the
