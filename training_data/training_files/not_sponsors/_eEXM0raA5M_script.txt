sponsored by The Great Courses Plus. A little over three months ago, I released a video about what if everybody on earth lives inside the same city. Today we're going to talk about something perhaps even more terrifying - What if everybody on earth lives inside the same building How large with this building have to be to house all 7.4 billion of us survive right now? It's not a strange of a question as it may seem at first. This picture right here is the town of Whittier, Alaska. And by that I mean the entire town is located inside of this one building The entire city's population of two hundred fourteen people for the most part lives inside this single building. And they really don't have to ever leave it. This is because almost all of the functions that you would normally find inside of a city are all located inside of the building. Inside, you can find the city's police department, The post office, The mayor's office, A general store, A grocery store, A hospital, A laundromat, A hotel, A church in the basement, And even an indoor playground complete with a swimming pool. The building is the city and the residents of the city can stay indoors almost indefinitely whenever the weather begins to get bad, Because all of the city services as well as their homes are all located inside of it. But even still just 214 people live here which is nowhere near the entire human race. So let's get bigger and think about buildings with the largest seating capacity. The AT&T stadium in Arlington, Texas is the home of the Dallas Cowboys and is truly enormous, Larger than the US Capitol building and capable of sitting 80,000 people. Which means that you can comfortably seat the entire population of Andorra inside of it But it still isn't as big as the largest indoor stadium in the world which is located here in Pyongyong North Korea and it's called Rungrado 1st of May Stadium.. It has the capacity to seat 114,000 people all indoors 34,000 more people than the AT&T stadium or about the same population as the Island of Kiribati or about twenty percent of the population of Wyoming but even that isn't as big as the largest ever planned Indoor Stadium which would have been constructed in Berlin by Nazi Germany had they won the Second World War the building would have been called the Volkshalle and would have been capable of sitting 180,000 people inside about five percent of the population of modern-day Berlin the building would have been so enormous that German architects calculated that the moisture collected by all of these people breathing inside of it could have actually created artificial rain and side causing the building to have its own weather if we move to outdoor stadiums however which would still be one building in a sense and we can fit much more people the largest outdoor stadium currently is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway capable of seating 235,000 people a little less than the entire population of reno nevada but once again the Nazis had plans for an even larger stadium in the event of a victory in World War Two their plans were to construct the Deutsche Stadion on in Nuremberg which would have been capable of feeding a massive 405,000 people more than the population of New Orleans and over five times the seating capacity of the AT&T Stadium Hitler plans that after Germany won World War Two every single Olympic Games for the rest of history would take place here at this stadium but because the war was lost the stadium was never finished however the largest building anywhere in the world in terms of how many people are meant to fit inside of it would be the Great Mosque in Mecca Saudi Arabia during the Hajj period the mosque has the capacity to fit four million people inside of it which is greater than the entire population of Panama there are buildings that could in theory fit more people to miss though they're not designed to fit people but we're going to see what could happen if we did so anyway before we get started with this part though let's figure out how many people we could safely bit inside of one square meter after a lot of research it seems that anything over five people first where meter to be potentially dangerous and lead to people trampling each other so that the highest limit let's go with about five people on average being able to possibly fit into one square meter the largest building in the world in terms of its physical footprint on the earth's surface is going to be the Tesla gigafactory once it's finished being built in Nevada its gargantuan when compared to the AT&T stadium and the US Capitol building and it would take up a physical state of 530,000 square meters or a little larger than vatican city which means that you could fit the world's smallest country completely inside of the boundaries of the world's largest building at five people per square meter that means you can fit 2,650,000 people inside the building all indoors more people to live in all of namibia so we're at the scale of entire countries worth of people sitting inside one building out but we can still get much larger the largest building ever designed in terms of the floor space that would occupy with the Crystal Island building which would have been built in Moscow where it not halted have been completed it would possess two and a half million square meters were the floor space which combined could have fit a staggering 12 million five hundred thousand people were more than the entire population of Belgium but we can still go even bigger if we begin to take a three-dimensional view rather than the two-dimensional view that we've had so far with this in mind the average height for a modern human is roughly 1.63 meters therefore if we construct a cube with a one square meter base and height of 1.63  meters and we can fit five average human inside of it this gives us 0.326 cubic metres per person for 3.07 people per cubic meter with this mouth in mind the largest building in the world in terms of sheer volume is the Boeing Everett factory located in Washington the building possesses 13.3 million cubic meters located entirely indoors which is so large that the building has its own microclimate somewhat similar to what the proposed Volkshalle in Berlin would have been like adding floors into the building with an average height of just 1.63 meters each capable of fitting the average human inside and we could theoretically fit 40,831,000 people inside of here which would be enough to fit the entire populations of Denmark Norway Sweden Finland Iceland Greenland Estonia Latvia and Lithuania all combined and still have room left over for all of Serbia just for good measure that's the largest building in the world though and that's still not even one percent of the entire human population that could possibly fit inside of it to get to that point we need to construct a new building and if we did so what is the smallest possible size that it could be to fit all of us well at the time of making this video the world population is actually 7.4 78 billion people if we crammed people into the same density as we did inside the boeing factory and we will require a volume of 2.436 billion cubic meters or 2.436 cubic kilometers the building would be a cube with sides of 1.3 for six kilometers in length and height of 1346 meters this seems big but place in downtown New York City that would actually look like this inside of which you can actually fit every single human being alive today the tallest building in the world is the Burj Khalifa at nearly 800 30 meters high but the tallest building under construction that will be done in 2020 is the jetta tower which will be much higher when finished at 1080p ters only 330 meters short of our mega cube the base of the cube would only be about five times larger than the Tesla gigafactory as well so building the cube is certainly within the realm of possibility and if it was built the entire human race alive today all 7,478,000,000 of us could also fill inside of a building that would only take around half an hour to jog around so thank you very much for watching this video I must now take the the video that you just watched and I hope you'll subscribe to my channel by clicking here you
