proper people entry does not get any easier than this the doors are just wide open it's just wide all right now we drove by yesterday and that door was not open no so either somebody came in here last night or somebody's in here right now guess we'll find out yeah wow there's the whole water park should we try to get into there first that's not a light on is it that's a window i think it's a window into an alleyway yeah there's no power in here please no water park towels will be on this door wow it still smells chloriney in here it does it's eerie that it's so silent in here usually when you're in these places all you hear is a massive echo of kids screaming water splashing i had a whole lazy european feels pretty apocalyptic to just have this place to yourself yeah this place is like set up like they just straight drained the pools one day and didn't come back there's even all the life vests still on the rack over there looks like they had four slides in here one of those bowl slides another tube slide and two body slides it looks like every single life vest is still still here yeah [Applause] got the lifeguard floaties the paint is peeling on the supports so this place has probably been abandoned for at least a few years 2019 2018 19 19. oh wow there's a bunch of smash light bulbs all over the floor here some kids probably came in here and found a box of light bulbs and brought them up to the top and just started chucking them down i have a bull slide we had one slide that was just completely outdoors but then it came back in to let out over here i wonder if it was like freezing cold outside if you would feel the cold through the slide i mean obviously the water would be heated in the winter but that one is just completely outside for quite a while let's go up to the slides it's pretty tall for an indoor thing oh there's a cool view down here let me go this way i'm going up okay still got a floaty up here it's still inflated you can hear the road through the slide so i'm sure you feel the temperature change damn old light bulbs hey brian what's up hey hey gets pretty steep coming up here i think actually maybe not i'm not going to climb through the tube it's too small of a tube all right i can feel this thing swaying a little bit yeah this is definitely one that you're meant to lay down in brian uh say something down the slide what's up yo all right i'm heading back down it's just a mess of tubes in here you ready to go down the ball slide it's gonna need a little sliding more than just walking probably you're gonna walk down this one it's so steep i mean you could do a little slide it doesn't seem that look how steep that is all right go ahead if you want to do it go ahead should i film it from the top i don't know i might slip down too if i don't go from the top i don't know a little scare yeah i mean worst case scenario you just slide there could be an obstruction in the tunnel i don't see an obstruction it's not that bad are you actually doing it it's not that bad no like i'm not falling right here like it's not bad this is like as deep as it gets i guarantee you are not the first ones doing this and these shoes have no tread on them and they're still fine well we're not out yet no still have to go through that all right i'm going in the pink hole there's a tube in the way what's going on in you there see his shadow you went through there fast i saw your shadow here and i was going to film it and you were already coming out there i had a moment kept going of course there's a chair just chilling a whole stack of floaties tubes whatever you call them yeah those things are really good at holding here i mean some of them yeah some of them are better than others this is like the most notable piece of graffiti i've seen in here though yeah got a good angle to shoot too so it kind of i mean this place wouldn't even feel abandoned if it wasn't for the uh occasional graffiti let's see all the lazy river jets to make the current i'm taking the lazy river to the other side so all these windows look like they were hotel rooms that had the waterpark view there's a person in here yeah like an adult like older dude i mean right at the front door he was closing it up look there's still sheets on the beds we're kind of trapped aren't we you can't get out of this area without going by where he is gonna take the lazy river true let's take the lazy river i really want to go down back here oh he's right there i saw him again this truck is right there [Applause] we have to get to that door over there i saw his truck well we snuck by him yeah there's a truck out here too oh he's right there now did he see you i don't think so oh he drove off what the [ __ ] i think he's carrying the blaze he has to be that door's still open yeah it is well let's just keep filming did we see if the truck in the fireplace are there two trucks that's the same truck i saw out front so there's probably two trucks i mean one truck these must be the water damaged rooms it's like half of it's cutted in half if it's not so some kind of construction of some sort with these ends these rooms are still intact you want to check one out yeah sure all right i guess might as well this one yeah try to squeeze past the chair the door is open to connect the rooms and this one is just gutted it's kind of weird i still have sheets on and everything this might as well be an active hotel yeah this is like really clean no mold or anything in here yeah there was some kind of water damage here that's why they abandoned it ironic an indoor water park resort getting shut down due to water damage this area is still very well intact yeah it's kind of interesting how they're just a dividing line i heard a smoke detector another room there's tissues there's even towels and toilet paper this hotel even has the tap to enter it's really up to date i'll just come back across so we're in like a secondary hotel to the main hotel it's only connected to the other one by one hallway yeah this is like the lobby for this wing i don't know if this is a lobby there's not really a check encounter it might not have been a check encounter but this is definitely like some kind of it says play and there's a pool table right probably it's kind of strange it looks like they were two separate hotels and connected or like this was an original hotel and then added onto an extension yeah this building looks like an older like generic hotel added on with the other stuff added on lifeguard stuff associates they walled off this desk here this could have been the check-in desk right here but it's walled off but yeah now that i know what's behind it it's pretty obvious that this is just walled off there is some water damage down here mold it's more of the same down here rooms and then the dividing line of mint and gutted there's more mold down here yeah because the water came down here and sat yeah they were really gutting these rumps not even a wall these rooms over here are literally just framing there's nothing left in here so the only way to get to the main part of the hotel i think is to cut through the lobby where the guy was hopefully he's gone now gone all right the door's closed now yeah he must have come just to close it yeah a all right let's go back to the lobby the freshly sealed lobby okay so i got all the brochures for the tourist traps wow they do does anyone actually ever take these cabana village tiki fun center under renovation should we go upstairs here or go into the cabana village let's go check out this because we know upstairs are just going to be hotel rooms yeah but it's a different kind of hotel room so we'll go check the hotels i want to see the resort stuff there's rooms that way giant game room located in the cabana the giant game room not just a normal game oh look it's blueprints for the water slides the [ __ ] was that what was that i don't know the whole building just shook yeah oh there's power on the power just turned on no way are we sure it wasn't on before oh yeah wasn't i like is there lights on in there yeah yeah this was on before still doesn't answer why the whole building just shook that's where all the light bulbs are coming oh guess what i found christmas decorations you bet of course well i don't know what just shook the whole yeah that was really [ __ ] really like that it felt like shifted yeah the only other time i've experienced vibrations like that is in a hurricane when like the power lines are first starting to arc it kind of makes a loud sound like that so i think maybe a big main breaker got flipped somewhere in the building that's still my guess things interesting look at this room it was windowless but your window would look out into the hallway that's kind of shitty what the hell that's weird that's a really depressing hotel room yeah there's pump beds in here yeah four bunk beds i don't know what exactly it just looks out into the hallways just got weird vibes all around and then the bathroom oh no no we'll keep exploring until we get kicked out so these are all rooms that just looked into the hallway yeah this place is pretty big it goes down something big and open in there and then it goes down this way you want to check what's down that way first yeah this looks like more rooms i think this says the game room oh let's get that out let's do some games area closed yeah wow this is huge yeah this really is a big game room sounds like the fire alarms are going off maybe some kind of alarm is that's an alarm system look these are all hotel rooms along the side here yeah the hotel room's right here too these were all rooms this hotel is designed so weird yeah i just saw somebody walk by outside you did yeah you sure it wasn't a reflection i'm sure it was a person right outside that door you see that there's that sliver in the door yeah 100 it was a person walked right by in front of that sliver interesting there's all the stuff ripped out here like this is ripped out let's make a brick interesting check out the mold in here that's advanced mold holy crap this place was moldy when it was open it had to have been i don't think mold can get this advanced right here you want to investigate the beat it's just the smoke detectors that room it's a smoke detector yeah they really gutter all this [ __ ] look at the mold wow then he got enough apparently no so there was some really significant water damage going on in here around the basement was not maintaining the roof at all anywhere you can tell this arcade carpet yeah on a table there's more tables back here oh this is the game room that they were talking about nothing left no games notice all the construction is on the floor though carpets ripped up and the bottom of the walls for sure so like the place flooded how did it flood though we're not in a flood plain yeah of all things i expected this place to be i expect to be tacky touristy whatever i did not expect it to be this creepy like claustrophobic it's not even creepy in like a traditionally creepy way it's just like i heard that so weird that it's creepy oh [ __ ] what is it are they in the car i don't think so they know we're here multiple we're [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] we should just try to leave at this point maybe go out the way we came in i only saw two cars but that's like the only one joey looked out of the building could be surrounded for a look can we just go out here no i mean i don't think we did anything yes but they could try to block in a while they could try to pin something yeah it would be [ __ ] if they do yeah i mean that good turn your light off there's a lights on in here oh they turned lights on yeah that's what that sound was try to be quiet oh look we can they might just be waiting for us to go out there though we shouldn't yeah no we shouldn't they straight turn back they turn the power on might be watching the back door too though i don't know what to tell you oh there's somebody there hello oh hi what's going on i got a couple people down here you're just taking some photos oh i got a mask in my jacket if i get that out yeah what door did you come in the front door that was wide open just now uh like a couple hours ago how long does a little bit go like a couple hours probably an hour yeah something like that i didn't know they were doing anything i figured it was going to sit here and rot until they demolish it you guys been breaking the window did you no front door that was open i appreciate your understanding gentlemen yeah no problem i mean didn't realize it was this cared for but we saw the door wide open and we thought you know all right so the front doors were probably open because a worker was inside and they ended up calling for police it turns out the owners of the property are tired of vandals and squatters breaking in while the property still sits abandoned they clearly watch over it and the owner explicitly asked us to let others know not to visit or you will encounter police there are plans to demolish the older original part of the hotel and renovate the rest but with the current state of the property and the current state of the world it's unknown if and when that will happen thanks to nordpass for sponsoring this portion of today's video we all have hundreds if not thousands of online accounts each needing passwords to log in and it's extremely cumbersome to manage all of them you're either using the same password across multiple accounts or using a built-in browser password manager now it's definitely not a good idea to use the same password because if one service has a data breach and that account info gets leaked all of your other accounts are now vulnerable to be accessed unless you go through each and every one changing the passwords manually and if you're using the built-in browser password manager like the one in chrome well it's not their top priority to keep that data secure they just want to make their browser easy to use and convenient well that's where nordpass comes in nordpass takes security first and encrypts all of your passwords in a private vault you install it on all of your devices and using the password generator it creates a password that's basically impossible to memorize or guess but don't worry you only have
