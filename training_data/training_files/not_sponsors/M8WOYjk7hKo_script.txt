Engineering samples or reviews samples, they're cherry-picked so that the media outlets like Linus tech tips will see inflated performance and Overclocking numbers so that you yes, you Jerry will get suckered into buying a new CPU every year right? well That's what people keep telling us and this common knowledge has been around for years now so today in our inaugural installment of sh*t viewers say we are going to either prove that there is something to this or debunk this myth once and for all Intro So here's how we decided to run our test we grabbed our sample core i5 8400 and not to play favorites our sample Ryzen 5 1600 X then we went to the local, NCIX Sorry memory express to buy retail chips of the same to compare them against For your peace of mind we will upload the entire Uncut clip of us buying the chips and running our tests on them we're gonna have that link below anyway let's talk about why it might make sense or might not for a company to seed reviewers a Superior sample now the obvious answer we hear all the time is that they would get articles Boasting of better performance numbers or a better overall user experience In that initial oh so important wave of launch videos and articles Enticing consumers to open up their wallets All while not actually having to provide that level of performance or polish at retail But conspiracy theories aside would this actually make business sense Imagine this you've got a lemonade stand where you sell the freshest Tastiest lemonade on the Block on day one, and then you swap it out with lemon pledge Now a lot of people are gonna show up to buy on the second day, but as soon as your reputation for selling. What is Literally furniture polish spreads the kids across the street who were selling cheap powdered lemonade the whole time are gonna Take the bulk of the market share Now we're not saying this has never happened Think back to watch dogs and no man's sky and III both Ubisoft and Sony respectively showed off beautifully complex worlds with tons of graphical detail and then both of them ended up being significantly simplified upon release now while in some industries it is possible to get away with this kind of BS in General the negative. PR has the potential to completely stall future sales So it is not a risk to be taken lightly and in electronics the up to Multi-billion dollar investment that goes into designing and fabricating a processor design makes this kind Switcheroo and economic impossibility like it's not a different paint job So then let's look at one of the other theories Maybe they're just taking golden samples off of what is otherwise the regular production line Now that one is much more likely But it doesn't really hold up to closer scrutiny either From my experience and others earlier CPUs are produced at the tail end of the manufacturing Learning process when viable yields are lower and compared to the more mature units that come later Can actually require more voltage to maintain a specific clock speed not to mention that they might have poorer memory? Compatibility or might output more heat at the same performance levels Even the couple of weeks between early samples shipping out and retail availability can result in Improvements now there have been and there always will be exceptions to this But it is far more likely That we are dealing with the same silicon lottery as any other CPU because you got to remember even on the same wafer No, two processors will have identical characteristics So if it doesn't make any sense why do people still think it's happening most of the time as far as we can tell it just seems to be a fanboy argument justifying why someone disagrees with the results being published by the dishonest media and Frankly we're just so tired of hearing it that we not once But twice the first time we bummed up the footage so we had to start over including buying two more CPUs Anthony Not once, but twice went out and bought these CPUs so we could show you this TLDR for gaming we found basically no variance in frame rates even in direct x12 mode while synthetics actually favored our retail chips as For productivity tests on the intel side our chips traded blows back and forth but not a clear-cut victory for either side and we put this down to normal chip or even run two run variants due to the Dynamic and reactive nature of turbo boost and then as for team red It was pretty much even across the board so for better or for worse AMD appears to be shipping Exactly the same product today that they were in April of last year and then to back that up we even tried overclocking both of our AMD chips our Intel ones were locked but both of our AMD chips had identical clocks at identical voltages and identical temperatures, but even crashed at identical settings So in summary then this conspiracy theory is busted for the two major cpu players and While nothing that we've said today is going to prevent people from making these arguments in the future What I hope is that it has at least armed the rest of you with the ammunition that you need to shut them down Once and for all it doesn't make business sense. It doesn't make engineering sense. It just doesn't make sense But you know what does make sense switching to ting ting is the mobile carrier that's focused on customer service and customer satisfaction When you call ting if you have an issue for whatever Reason you do not speak to a robot you get put through directly to a person And you don't pay extra For the privilege in fact the average ting bill is only 23 bucks a month per device because of the way they billed you pay Only for what you use now if you're stuck in a contract and you switch to ting they'll cover 25% of your cancellation fee up to 75 bucks and if you use our link Linus ENCOM to try out their savings calculator and see if you'll save money you can actually get another 25 bucks in service credit or Towards a new device so go try it out So thanks for watching guys if this video sucked. You know what to do break that one Yeah
But if it was awesome get subscribed hit that like button or check out the link to where to buy the stuff we featured in the video description Maybe literally these ones maybe we'll put them on eBay. I don't know also link town There's our merch storage has cool shirts like this one and our community forum, which you should totally join We have so many processors and how?
