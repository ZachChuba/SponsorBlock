I've been doing this YouTube thing coming up on about a year now and while I've referenced it numerous times I've yet to do a video about Ely dangerous one of my favorite games of all time there are a few reasons I haven't done a video Elite is a massive sprawling space simulation whose complexity makes discussing its quality as a game in a single video exceedingly difficult Elite has also since releasing in 2014 evolved and changed drastically the elite I played five years ago is nowhere near the elite I played today mostly of course elite scope while impressive isn't necessarily unheard of cloud Imperium games of star citizen is comparable and another work in progress but I don't want to compare and contrast elite with what might be its main competitor at least not in this video instead I'd like to compare contrast elite with itself its imperfections with its awe-inspiring achievements it's beautiful mechanical intricacies with its labor intensive idiosyncrasies I want to talk about reasons I'd love elite and I want to talk about reasons I hate elite and because of its complexity evaluating a lead - also requires explaining how it works so to begin lay out what exactly elite is developed and published by frontier developments elite dangerous is a massively multiplayer space game that takes place across a recreated Milky Way galaxy containing 400 billion star systems each explorable and some based on real-life data in elite you're not a hero you're not the chosen one instead you're just one of many player controlled commanders and there's not much special about you you're a pilot for hire in a galaxy full of war mystery and money to be made the majority of your time will most likely be spent in the bubble a region of space inhabited by humanity and gradually expanding as warring factions jostle over territory there is no singleplayer story at least in the traditional sense you exist and take part in a galaxy that evolved this activities like repairing space stations or fighting off aliens have an effect on the galaxy and some plot lines happen outside the scope of gameplay political intrigue our scientific discoveries when you boot the game up for the first time you appear in a space station with a miniscule amount of credit the weakest vessel in the game and the universe of possibilities there are a few introductory tutorials but once you're in the galaxy there's no objective marker destination or reassuring voice instructing you what to do next it's an unceremonious introduction that throws you against the learning curve you'll be scaling for hours what you do in and outside the bubble is up to you perhaps you desire the life of an honest trader hauling goods from one space ports in the next maybe laser burns and shell casings are your thing and maybe you catch yourself aimlessly adrift in the enormous galaxy map marking points of interest wondering what Barnard's loop looks like close up and considering just how long it would take you to get there of course for the most part elite doesn't just allow you to do these things you're starting ship a sidewinder will get you from point A to point B but to really flourish in the Year 30305 you'll need better gear and eventually a better ship and getting better ships with better gear not only means climbing that learning curve but enduring a painfully slow grind it's important to remember elite status as a simulator that it's built on a foundation of being a somewhat reasonable grounded sci-fi universe and this simulation makes certain elements of elites grind grind the earth anywhere you go anywhere you travel is going to take time in fact traveling is most of what you'll do in elite just flying through space elite has three speeds by which you'll do this traveling normal space super cruise and hyperspace normal space is what you'll fly around space stations and dogfighting that's measured in meters per second and varies greatly from ship to ship hyperspace is what you'll use to fly between star systems which lie light-years apart a Lightyear being the distance light travels in a year from a gameplay perspective it's essentially a loading screen if not at least a really cool loading screen the area you see around you is known as which space a mysterious higher dimension of reality vessels used to cross massive sections of space and yes hyperspace is technically a place another speed but just don't worry about that lastly super cruise is elite standard faster than light propulsion you'll use to travel inside and around individual star systems all ships travel at the same speeds and super cruise measured anywhere from kilometers per second and all the way up to hundred even thousands of times the speed of light rather than light-years star systems are often measured in light seconds the distance light travels in a second elite treats supercruise in normal space like two different places players and super crews can't smash into players in normal space star systems are realistically scaled and simulated celestial bodies hundreds and sometimes thousands of light seconds apart all orbiting and spending like they would in real life even if you're simply transporting cargo from one space station to another expect a good amount of downtime massive objects like planets and stars make accelerating and super crews slow and as plotting as that can feel the fact that star systems are realistically scaled makes it necessary you may come across a star system with all its planets and space stations relatively close to each other and in those instances you may not need to get two speeds hundreds of times the speed of light to travel around but space wasn't made for the convenience of humanity and some star systems span across hundreds of thousands of light seconds meaning you'll need to reach higher speeds in order to cross them if you were able to accelerate to max beads at any given time and supercruise you'd uncontrollably jet across star systems without being able to slow down for your destination I'll admit there were times I've even felt exasperated staring into elites massive expanses waiting for time to pass and it's definitely annoying missing your target because you were going too fast or stopped paying attention but elite scale in slow pacing isn't a downside it's a requirement in an appreciated one at that elite is a fascinating case study and the differences between taste and objective quality it may not be a game for you when that's obviously fine but to achieve what elite sets out to achieve this scale is intrinsic even if inconvenient as much as I hate elite stretches of boredom I love its tangible sense of size which the scale provides now there are ways I think frontier could streamline elite scale for example every time you warp into a star system you appear just outside the system's biggest star most of the time that star acts as the system center space stations and the like orbit planets around that star however the biggest star isn't always the mains star there may be a smaller star thousands of light seconds away that for whatever reason happens to be where all the space stations and stuff are out and traveling there takes a few minutes if you ran elite through a cost-benefit analysis you'd find a constant problem is that costs often outweigh benefits economics is surprisingly a massive element to elite as a game and many of elites problems start with those economics breaking down space stations being minutes in some extreme cases more than an hour away from the system's main star is evidence if you're say hauling cargo between space stations sometimes the time it takes to travel larger distances isn't always offset by the benefit gained in the end why take a job that'll take forever when you could accept missions that may not pay as well but end much faster meaning you can more quickly move on to more missions and more money I do believe elite scale is necessary long flights are a part of the game that need to stay but I've never thought these extreme cases of Space Station's taking 15 or 20 minutes to reach are necessary space stations have mission boards that list all kinds of different jobs like hunting pirates are hauling cargo but our cost benefit analysis rears its ugly head here too sure you could accept this mission for just under two million credits but you'll have to search for and kill ten pirates there are other more cost-effective ways you can profit from combat more quickly this missions an inefficient use of time to be fair jobs come with other optional rewards like valuable resources optional rewards make missions more useful specifically once you've put a few hours into elite and I appreciate the concept but I feel there has to be a more creative fun way to utilize these missions as well as how these valuable resources are handed out one great aspect of elites economy is that it remains untainted by microtransactions or any real money mechanics elite has microtransactions but they're cosmetically everything you purchase in elite is purchased with in-game credits that you can only collect in-game everyone starts in the same place and where you get to is up to you keeping the integrity of elites economy and gameplay firm and authentic you earn everything so once you decide what it is you want to do in the galaxy you have to learn how to do it and even with guides and tutorials the best form of education is experience the opening moments of your career as a commander are daunting if you don't have a friend that can show you the ropes you'll be spending a good chunk of time poring over our online guides reddit threads and forum posts there will be trial and error plenty of bumps and bruises marking your interstellar journey but that process of learning how to make your own Wayne elite is among the most enjoyable and challenging learning curves I've ever experienced you not only gain a better understanding of how he leave works as a game but you'll feel yourself organically becoming a better pilot over time a criticism might often see the LOB that elite is at-at lacks direction that lacks defined goals or that quite simply it lacks stuff to do there's definitely some truth to this elite once players to create their own goals strive for whatever they consider necessary what they consider fun but there are times this feels futile you can organize much of what elite offers in three pillars combat trading and exploration you can profit off of each to some extent and they all have different paces and styles of gameplay combat is active exploration my personal favorite is far more relaxed and trading is sort of in between each pillar requires different ships and different equipment for traders you'll need ships with more cargo space and longer jump ranges and those looking for a fight will want stronger ships with stingy shields and hefty weapons whether you dive into elites world of trade or suit up for combat the gameplay loop is pretty much the same you do stuff to get credits and spend those credits on better equipment and ships in order to do bigger stuff and get more credits and spend those credits on even bigger and better ships and equipment I do wish there was something to break away from this mold I don't want to say the sentence I wish there were more to do because I think that would lead you to misinterpret what I'm trying to convey instead I think a better sentence is I wish there were more to experience content that doesn't rely on hours of circular repetitive gameplay through the years frontiers added quasi endgame bosses and challenges of sorts that serve as long-term goals Beegle point a star system more than 65,000 light years away from Earth is considered an achievement any Explorer able to reach it then there's the thyroids and the alien species that made a surprise appearance a few years back and for whom humanity has been fighting a war against ever since thyroids are notoriously difficult to kill you'll most likely need a high end of vessel outfitted with the best equipment credits can buy and a few fellow commanders crazy enough to try of course in order to attempt these activities with any chance of success we get back to elites harsh grind and cyclical gameplay elite has dozens of ships all of which fly and feel differently I've always found just how in-depth lilit ships are to be oddly underrated and again it's something frontier has designed within the framework of simulation of being plausible learning what all your ship stats mean both individually and collectively is at first totally overwhelming getting the basics down though isn't too tough than knowing the basics is all you need to get started no matter what you're flying you'll have core internal compartments optional internal compartments and hardpoints core internal compartments are things like thrusters armor and your frame shift Drive which allows for jumps between star systems these are elements every ship has optional internal compartments are things like cargo bays shield generators even fighter hangers with deployable fighters your friends can fly because these are optional not all ships have access to the same optional compartments all ships have a starting point baseline vanilla stats you want to build on top of as you're piecing your trusty vessel together you'll find some ships are versatile and others more focused rigid and purpose with hard points which are your ships weapons poor internal compartments and optional internal compartments you can really tweak and customize your ships subclass the aspects floor for instance is popular among explorers for its long jump range starting at a 13-point 12 Lightyear per jump maximum you can improve that range up to and beyond distances of 45 light-years which is what I have my ask to explore at right now but the ASP Explorer also has plenty of optional internal compartments so I could plausibly load up on cargo bays and turn my ass but reverently named Faraday more into a hauler than a jumper equipping cargo bays would decrease my jump range but my ship would fit into another role and if I ever wanted to switch back I just need to unequip the cargo bays and go on my way the vulture by comparison is heavily combat oriented it doesn't have a lot of optional internal compartments using a vulture to explore or trade is possible but impractical your ship will need to reflect the business you've entered your commander into it's good to think about ships as investments investments that provide returns over time all ships are pretty expensive specifically early on as you gain enough capital lower tier ships can produce relatively high returns it all depends on how you're using them perhaps you occasionally find your life as a trader slow when you desire a little more action after you've accumulated an adequate amount of credits you could purchase a mid to low tier ship outfitted for combat and go bounty hunting if and when your ship gets destroyed you pay an insurance fee to rebuild your ship this means dangerous activities like bounty hunting come with the risk of paying to get your ship back which can then cut into your profits as a bounty hunter but with enough assets backing you up the hit you take from dying is lessened because you died and relatively cheap mid to low to your ship depending on how expensive the ship you purchased is you can hunt for bounties and a low-cost ship and reap the same profit you would had you purchased an outfit at a higher tier ship for combat evoking Jay Z your commander is not a businessman you're a business man elites economy is imperfect but it can also be beautifully complex star systems go through real time herbs and flows their economies rise and fall you can fly through the galaxy map and view systems by different criteria like what kind of star it is are what goods it produces one filter is state which shows the health of a system systems can be at war going through famine or experienced large economic growth called a boom state systems and a boom state are great opportunities for traders and once you got your ship outfitted to haul goods learning how to read this economy is incredibly satisfying there's a term used throughout elites community homes star and no it's not a reference to an early 2000s internet cartoon because travel takes so much time jobs that require less traveling like mining or bounty hunting can mostly be done within one system your home star is a star system that facilitates the amenities necessary for your commander to build wealth for example my home star was once a system called iota per CI a star system about 34.4 light-years from Earth iota / CI houses a few ringed planets and in these rings are resource extraction sites where AI mining vessels scour the ring for minerals and with these miners comes pirates looking for a quick shakedown Walker City a Space Station relatively close to iota / CRS resource extraction sites is equipped to rearm and repair ships after combat so after patrolling the resource extraction sites and finding and eliminating any pirates with bounties on their heads all it takes is a quick trip back to Walker City to flip the bounties you've collected for credits and rearm and repair your ship for another round of bounty hunting what's more is that if a pirate does get the better of you you respawn at the closest space station to where you died in making Walker city extremely convenient a good home star is a formula in iota per see eyes case a combination of resource extraction sites and a well equipped space station within close proximity of those sites all giving way to high profits over a relatively short amount of time not all space stations are well-equipped mind you some don't even have standard services like refueling and repairing finding your home star all depends on the business you've invested your commander into when looking through the galaxy map for signs of the kind of economy you need this process is amazing a simulated sci-fi business venture searching for lucrative markets across the bubble which evolves and changes and who knows maybe you go on frontieres' forms or elites Reddit and read what other commanders have found you ask around with other commanders about systems they've found and try them out for yourself word of mouth is a real legitimate tool as you accumulate assets your need for a centralized base of operations could subside if you reach this point elites power play mode could be a viable alternative to searching for fertile business ground power play itself is about as complex as the rest of the game it really is a game within a game the bubbles different colors represents the galaxies different human factions showing what territory they've conquered and who they're competing with for more territory you can pick a faction and join the effort partaking in various missions in order to widen your factions territory in the galaxy all it takes to join a faction is to scroll through a menu and pick one there aren't any matchmaking systems or waiting lobbies I'm going to be transparent here well I've put my fair share of hours into elite I haven't spent a single hour involved with power play and since introducing power play in 2015 frontier has continuously changed the way the mode works this has made power play sort of infamous and elites community its complexity already makes it tough to talk about without playing it for an extended period of time I just don't have enough experience playing to delve into and evaluate its nuances and any meaningful way what I can discuss is frontiers recent announcement that the team was looking into making power play open only here's what that means in elite before you jump into the galaxy you have three different options for play open solo and private solo means you have the whole galaxy to yourself there won't be any other player control chips anywhere private is a galaxy that you can invite friends to but random players don't exist open is the galaxy in all it's random player glory it's essentially a public server you can invite friends to play with you and you may encounter random players out in space player versus player can happen anywhere at any time no matter how strong anyone's ship is now power play is heavily a player versus player mode as frontier themselves said recently power play is fundamentally about consensual player versus player conflict we think that pretty much all of the systems and rules would benefit from being played out in open only as it would dramatically increase the chance of meeting other pledged players and being able to directly affect the outcomes of power struggles I don't have a dog in the fight here if frontier design power play to be primarily a PvP mode then that's fine but the rest of elite doesn't require PvP to work let alone for it to be a good game solo and private servers are fantastic features elite has and continues to benefit from and they should always stay another late-game addition frontier added not too long ago was the engineers enigmatic characters who can boost certain parts of your ship past what you're able to do with standard upgrades the concept here is amazing you do jobs for the engineers and in return they further modify your ship pushing the limits of what's technologically and scientifically possible there are other games with similar late-game mechanics but Elite gives players reasons to overpower their ships whether it's upgrading weapons in order to hunt down the aforementioned are guides or boosting jump distance in order to reach stars that lie far outside what's possible for standard frame shift drives actually working with the engineers is complicated and ultimately kind of boring to upgrade parts of your ship engineers need resources you go out find the resources and craft the upgrades to reach higher tiers of engineering allowing for even more powerful upgrades you'll need to deliver the required number of resources multiple times as I mentioned earlier Faraday has a max jump range of about 45 light years to increase that I need a typical disrupted weight geckos and chemical processors neither resource is something I can outright purchase and while each resource is relatively common all that's required to find them is just to fly around and well find them working with the engineers at least the ones I've worked with is inactive unchallenging there's no real strategy or trick it boils down to a simple really long fetch quest it doesn't feel like I'm assisting a brilliant engineer create technology that exists on the edge of known science at the peak of humanity's ability there are whole guides player made Maps even on farming resources for engineers I am fully aware elite isn't the only game to have this issue but I don't see commonality as an excuse I enjoy and appreciate having a way to overpower my ships and make them feel truly unique if engineer quest lines were more active and dynamic experiences less about fetching things and something more challenging I'd much more look forward to doing them if there's an area where your leads dynamics really shine it's dogfighting it's firefights are difficult chaotic detailed and deadly on the right side of your ship you have three columns which designate how you've distributed your ship's power between systems engines and weapons while exploring or trading you won't likely need to adjust this much at all throw power into engines and you're good to go in combat these three columns each matter and how you distribute your power depends on your fighting style as well as the ship you fly putting power into engines raises the top speed your ship can reach and more quickly recharges boosts boosts aren't just temporary speed increases but when used correctly they can get you out of an enemy ships weapon radius before they're able to fire at you putting power into systems means your shields recharge faster and putting power into weapons that allows you to shoot for longer periods of time before your weapons require a recharge dogfighting is a struggle for positioning your ships scanner the circle in the middle of your cockpit gives you a reading of the objects around you as well as their position relative to you the two lines pointing outward from the middle are your sight line combat is all about getting enemies in that sight line through whatever maneuvers you can muster and locking on with your weapons to fire whether it's flipping your ship around moving vertically up and down or flying in concentric circles while keeping your weapons pointed inward combat is going to keep you moving and it's not going to be a whole lot of straight lines the blue bars on your speedometer represent where your ships highest turn radius is relative to your current top speed you'll want to set your speed in that area in order to get maximum maneuverability and if you're ever out maneuvered increase speed to get out of your enemy's sight lines turning a flight assist off could help you evade attacks - with five assists off your ship stops counter balancing your movements as pointed out - uh Nolita wiki Sir Isaac Newton's first law of gravity is that an object in motion will stay in motion until acted upon by an external force that's why when you throw a paper airplane it slows down because of the air and gravity and stuff but if you throw a paper airplane in space it's going to fly forever if not at least until it meets something that stops it likewise with flight assist off your ship will twist and spin and refrain from counterbalance your input along with boosting this makes your ship far more maneuverable than it is normally you can cut sharper corners fly in one direction while facing another and by turning flight assist onigen switch directions faster learning to better control your ship without flight assists opens new freeform combat maneuvers that more than anything require player skill in order to be effective all ships have different combat capabilities from base hull strength to different amounts and placements of hard points the more you fight the more you learn which ships are tougher to fight and what their strengths and weaknesses are and perhaps most importantly where their blind spots are the vulture for instance has two front-facing hard points combining into a solid punch for anything that stands in its way of course this means the vulture has to face enemies to shoot them which isn't true for every ship top-of-the-line vessels like the Anaconda not only have more hard points but some of its hard points sit on top of the ship meaning weapons can hit targets above the ship as well as in front of it weapons themselves come in a multitude of forms from continuous lasers to pulse lasers and even tried-and-true bullet tossing Gatling guns weapons come in different sizes in different orientations to gimballed weapons will automatically follow your target as long as they're in your sight line while static weapons only fire forward how you fly in combat matters as much as what your enemy is flying you'll want to engage in stay in a ship's blind spot as well as become acquainted with them a new virility of elites various ships and where their blind spots are remember the vultures limited sight lines while the vulture is also known for being relatively maneuverable in the hands of a capable pilot the vultures front facing hard points are harder to evade than you might think the dynamics in play with elites combat are astounding between ship type weapon type equipment and player skill it's a system that emphasizes experience requiring a combination of technical skill and knowledge to master for the most part you'll be finding other ships in asteroid fields in open space which is fine combat works there but I'd love fights facilitated around space stations or just above the surface of planets elites combat is amazing it's incredible but it lacks a substantial variety of setting when you think about grand sci-fi space battles there's all kinds of stuff going on obstacles debris and other ships if I ever had to fly and fight inside something a la Star Wars I don't know if I'd ever play another video game for the rest of my life elites combat and flight mechanics are I think tuned to the point that those things are possible I just wish they were facilitated I do notice specifically while flying through asteroid fields that elite does stutter and has trouble keeping everything that's moving on screen moves smoothly I'll be honest I don't know if it has to do with my VR set up my PC or some kind of optimization issue so maybe it's something frontier has tried and just doesn't have fine-tuned enough yet for inclusion into the game elites combat may have been the element that first hooked me to the game but what eventually became by far my favorite aspect of elite is also the least active exploration sometimes when I explain amongst friends why elites exploration is so appealing to me I feel as if I'm defending it as a game mode because there's not much to do once you leave the bubble you jump between star systems and the sewage you find the vast majority probably filled with lifeless planets and moons once you're a good distance outside the bubble there aren't Space Station's battles or territories it's just space the untamed cosmic wild you'll need a fuel scoop to refuel your ship and make sure the jump routes you plot in the galaxy include star types that you can scoop all scooping involves is flying close to a star and supercruise it can be dangerous when done incorrectly since you're right next to a gigantic super heat a ball plasma but keep your distance fly slowly and you'll be unharmed most stars in the galaxies are scoopable so it's not too difficult to find fuel when you need it what I find so enjoyable about exploration isn't the gameplay there's not a whole lot to do to begin with know what appeals to me is an elite scale there's such a vast separation from the rest of elite and its players when you're thousands of light-years removed from the bubble when you're driving in SRV around a random planet in the middle of some secluded nebula with a fellow commander no worry no care in the world you feel as though you have the whole galaxy to yourself you may be the first player to step foot on an entire planet and you could very well be the in yet at the same time elites isolation also comes with a strange connectivity exploring is time-consuming it takes hours to jump long distances even with high in frameshift drives but the places you go our places other players can go to every planet and star and nebula exists in everyone's gain yes planets in elite are mostly just rock though you'll find plant life another natural phenomena here and there through the years elite has filled some parts of the galaxy with stuff to find the mysterious ruins and odd alien plant life and there's rumors that more is hiding out there somewhere and really I wouldn't want frontier to fill a galaxy with tons of stuff in the first place again space isn't domain made for humanity elite should reflect this the challenge of exploration should be enduring hours of jumps and stars seeing what you can find and maybe stumbling across a massive mountain that overlooks a planet's surface you land to put your feet up and know that you got there you conquered a distance someone ever dream of taking on and there is risk and exploration remember when you die you respawn that the closest space station and there aren't very many space stations hundreds of light-years away from the bubble let alone thousands of light-years die once and you're back where you started there's a tinge of danger of peril if and when you run across high gravity planets do you chance landing on them or steer away getting to know the Milky Way and it's architecture is such a joy if you want to travel somewhere that's either above or below the galaxy's plane you'll need to be ready for start entity to drop the farther from the Galactic plane you get the fewer stars there are and fewer stars means fewer places to refuel and fewer destinations to jump to making plotting your course a bit trickier elites Milky Way is magnificent mapped to some extent after the real Milky Way you'll find actual stars nebulae and other objects humanity knows exist you can find and travel to famous stars such as voi Canis Majoris Serb metal Jews metal Jews being a star you can see in the night sky with the naked eye soon after astronomers discover the Trappist one star system an actual real-life star system was 7 earth sized planets about 40 light years away from Earth frontier put the system in and you can go check it out if you want your skybox changes relative to where you are in the galaxy each star you see around you is a star on the galaxy map there aren't any fillers fly toward a nebula and it'll eventually dominate a portion of space giving a glow to the emptiness around you there is more work to be done on the galaxy there's no denying that a quick flight through the galaxy map and you'll quickly begin to spot the same four or five nebula models some nebulas like Barnard's loop or the Pleiades are modeled after what they look like in real life replacing the placeholder models is high on my list of things I'd like frontier to change about the galaxy though they've certainly been making strides over the past few years my list for elite of course extends beyond exploration there are numerous tweaks frontier can make that would go a long way in improving elite I could carry on forever with miscellaneous structural and gameplay changes I'd want to see like why can't I see a Space Station's inventory before landing there inventories from station to station are different which is fine and realistic but if I'm searching for a specific part why can't I look it up in a digital space Amazon compare prices and distances and choose also right now I can go online customize a car compare prices and make it purchase it would be a huge help to have something similar in elite where I can look up a ship out fit it with various gadgets and equipment and decide if I want to purchase it after seeing the full price elites come a long way and it has yet a long way to go being able to walk around on your ship and fly through planets that have atmospheres are big additions players have wanted since the game launched frontier recently said elites next big update wouldn't be ready into the latter part of 2020 saying that update whatever it is would be a defining moment in the history of the game and the biggest update yet I love elite dangerous even if there are things I also hate about it it's a game unlike any other and while problems persists some extremely annoying I've loved the time I put into it and I tend to have an optimistic outlook for its future moving forward in any case I've got 27 units of tech that needs Hollen over to Tanner City in v8 eight-six and tari so I can't talk much more I'll see you around perhaps somewhere out in the galactic vastness of our own Milky Way [Music] you
