[Music] oh hello you know Magic the Gathering is a game with over a quarter of a century of history over 20,000 cards to choose from and with a collection that big when you are going through the back catalogue of cards it really is like boring through a library of ancient arcane spells and tomes you can find cards that you've never ever heard of that your friends have never ever seen played and yet and yet are still powerful and effective so presented here are the professor's top 5 most under played cards in commander I got the list I got the 5 cards no Emma first of all I don't know how you got in my office and second of all I'm making the list of the most under played magic cards for commander why would I have you make the list because I know what I'm talking about I know what I'm talking about I'm the professor yeah of card sleeves all right hotshot how about an under played off my five under played commander cards versus yours and we'll see which ones are truly the most under played okay fine you're on but just so you know if you haven't seen my glasses I know a lot of stuff you've probably never heard of before ha you're on they could fill a magic online database with cards you don't know and they do and they call it the magic online database Oh what all right I'm totally gonna win this underplayed off with number five seed guide ash fuel did Lotus on a creature is a big deal the fact that it's such a difficult thing to interact with is even better with something like a traditional manner rock destroying the card is going to be good enough but seed guy - is specifically creating lands and lands are more difficult to interact with at most commander tables the increase in sacrifice decks over the last couple of years even gives the fact that it's a dies trigger some upside being able to jump from five to nine mana on the turn is no joke and that doesn't even get into the fact that seed guide ash can grab non basic forests like murmuring Bosque stomping ground and a guest tropical island though I'd rather spend that money on a foil Russian stomping ground just to send a message so for my number five card I have the caudal warp ride which at first is a little bit scary because it does cost six which is a pretty high mana cost but it is something that's incredible it's serving is a half removal half token generator in a single card the tokens obviously go away quickly so it'll be difficult to do anything in the vein of abusing crater hoof behemoths with the tokens but using the tokens with ash nods altar or price that's not too hard to really abuse some cards like birthing pot and prime speaker vanaf are the fact that the tokens still have that converted mana cost of six is also incredibly relevant my number four is steely resolve how are more people not running this steely resolve is the kind of card that masquerades is a tribal card that's actually quite powerful whenever a deck has a bunch of creatures with activated abilities having the option of giving a chunk of them shroud is powerful enough to warrant a two mana investment in the early game something like captain sis a is rarely going to go all-in on a single creature type but it isn't difficult to imagine a world in which humans soldiers or even elves having shroud is something that will give any of the removal heavy colors an absolute fit that's not even touching on the fact that the card can get political whenever trying to create allies within a game the card being symmetrical gives it additional layers of play that aren't exclusively downside so might number four is torpor orb tour forum is one of the easiest ways to shut down a green deck a good chunk of cards that are going to be answering artifacts and enchantments in green happen to be creatures with enters the battlefield effects these are your reclamation sages touristed on Harmonix liver and so on you have to build your deck around it a little but so many creatures and commander are affected by the card that once you've compensated for torpor orb you come out very far ahead well my number three is burning earth people sure do love their dual lands burning earth is the kind of symmetrical card that reads like it's going to affect everybody the same amount that flips on its head when only one player is actually building around it it's easy to create situations in which some people at the table are completely locked out of the game because they've leaned too hard into perfect mana over simply playing good old-fashioned basic lands the downside of the card and likely a big chunk of why it doesn't see much play is that it's going to make the table very upset in any sort of aggro deck however it's easy to punish any player that tries to attack you for playing the card so number three instill energy the number of times the players had to read this card at my table is staggering instill energy takes green commanders with tap abilities from good on their own - absolutely bust it in half for one green banner the fact that it allows for multiple activations of prime speaker vanaf are you son wanderer bard even just bloom tinder gives an idea of just how much up side this card can provide in it costing one mana I don't understand how it isn't slotted and basically every green deck with creatures that have activated abilities my number to pick is controversial it's a hot take and that hot take is gonna win me this match and that is basic lands yeah forest swamp Mountain you know what I mean basic lands people are worried about having infinite duel lands too frequently and it leads to playing from a turn behind a bunch of the time tap lands have a real cost and when you're later in the turn order that can compound pretty heavily it feels like you're actually going 6th or 7th when your first two lands enter the battlefield apt and you don't have any acceleration the mulligan rules being so lacks in commander and mana rocks being so plentiful it's pretty easy to just have half of your lands be basics without getting punished you are it also has the benefit of allowing you to play powerful cards like back-to-basics and dodging copies of the mu√±ez stuff from opponents for my number two card I have imps mischief the most difficult things for people to anticipate are the things that shouldn't be able to happen black having a redirect effect is exactly that if shift can redirect a game-ending spell or simply act as a counter spell on a counter fight by redirecting what counter spells are targeting that doesn't even get into its subtle uses as a redirect effect turning around even just say a card draw spell or something to that effect in commuter you have so much life to play with that the downside of him mischief is pretty close to non-existent in the fact that black kids access to that effect has so much upside the court slept on far too often relative to how effective it is in practice all right I'm about to read my number one and I've already won with debt of loyalty come on cards that break the color pie are always going to command some sort of premium in terms of power level but dead of loyalty doesn't even seem to be that pricey for what it does whenever a player actually uses removal or a board wipe it's generally going to be because there's a single card on the table that is threatening to end the game or at the very least to take it over having the ability to make someone else do the dirty work of making an enemy and then also coming out ahead on the table is an unbelievable effect for just three mana my final number one most under played card and commander is inspiring statuary there are so many cards that produce incidental artifact tokens and so many artifacts that have static effects that inspiring statuary is frequently closer to warn power stone with upside than it is just another version of dark steel you got when you pair statuary with anything that makes treasure like smothering tithe clues or food it just gets out of control you can also use it with cards that turn off while tapped like winter orb to add extra play to already powerful tools and for those reasons I'm going to have inspiring statuary as way number one most underplayed card in commander so what why don't you let us know in the comments below tell us whose list you think wins for most underplayed commander cards and speaking of underplayed Emma where can people find well you can find me on Twitter at Eaton underscore te e GE and I'm sure that for wedding this you'll be kind enough to plug some of my other content in the description and this program was made possible thanks to a sponsorship from card Kingdom as well as the patreon support of viewers such as you so thank you [Music]
