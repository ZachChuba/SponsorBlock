(Let’s have fun) Let’s have fun.
(Sure, have fun) Have fun! What’s wrong?
(Come to your senses) One, two, three! “One in a Million!”
Hello, we’re TWICE. “Time to...”
(That thing on your mind!) “TWICE!”
(Without preparation?) - Again!
- How? More fun? Brighter! Heh. Karaoke-style.
(Bright! Fun!) One, two, three! “One in a Million!”
Hello, we’re TWICE. - “TIME TO...”
- “TWICE!” You changed your hairstyles
now that it’s spring. We did.
(TWICE turned colorful) We wanted a change
since it’s spring. Did you watch it?
(Last T.T.T episode?) Yes!
(Full season clear) I watched the fancam. - We have fancams?
- I didn’t know! On TikTok...
(On TWICE’s TikTok channel!) - There are individual clips.
- Fancams. Right. I saw them.
(Everyone, go check them out!) So, girls! Today... Where are we? A karaoke! Speak up! It’s a karaoke. - Why are you so quiet?
- Try again. Where are we? A karaoke! That’s right, this is...
(TWICE in a Karaoke) The first time
we’re in a karaoke - together.
- Is it? Really? To be honest,
our members aren’t that into karaokes.
(Not karaoke fans) I loved them
before debut. Really? But now,
they feel like... Practice booths.
(Strongly agreed) NAYEON and I
went to karaokes a lot. Don’t obsess about
singing well. I used to enjoy
adding echo effects, but now, I can’t
focus on the song, DAHYUN’s good.
(Another karaoke member!) She goes alone.
(“Karaoke Alone” DAHYUN) - Right.
- She sends us her videos. I was a guest on
“Happy Together,” so I went alone...
(TOFU practiced alone) What’s more,
she films them herself! I shared them
on our group chat. (Let’s have fun today!)
Where’s the mic? I always drank Pocari Sweat. Guys,
what’s your go-to song? No. 18?
(Means “favorite song”) - None.
- Oh! That song! ("Happy to be a Rabbit”
Rabbit Eating Peaches) (Warming up before they start)
“Daring Woman.” Oh! Sing it.
It’s been a while. (I like “Daring Woman”) I like “Itaewon Class.”
(MOMO’s PICK: “Itaewon Class” OST) “Itaewon Class?”

(TWICE in karaoke) Last week,
DAHYUN and... Who? DAHYUN, NAYEON
and SANA were the captains.
(And this week’s captains?) This time, I,
JEONGYEON and CHAEYOUNG will be captains. We drew lots last week.
For today, everyone will play the ladder game. Woo-hoo!
(We love ladders) Far right.
(Choosing orders) I’ll go beside MINA. Second from left. Number one. I choose number three. (MOMO: No. 4)
(Finished choosing orders) (Choosing partner)
This is a hit or miss. (The unavoidable hit-or-miss)
Looking good, CHAEYOUNG. CHAEYOUNG, great.
(Eye-catching Pink CHAENG) Start!
(NAYEON’s ladder first) Please! Please!
(With NAYEON’s desperate prayer) (Ambitionz reunite) Darn it!
(Not those two...) (Ambitious NAYEON is happy) Is this a blessing in disguise?
(An unrelatable remark) ♪ Doo-doo-doo ♪
(SANA’s ladder next) Yay!
(SANA on Team JEONGYEON) (NAYEON’s Rival No. 1, JEONGYEON) DAHYUN, please. (As for the SMC President?) (DAHYUN’s ladder next) (Please)
(Nerve-racking) (Send the President to me!) (CHAEYOUNG’s prayers were answered) (DAHYUN on Team CHAEYOUNG) Cute, CHAEYOUNG. ♪ Doo-doo-doo ♪
(MOMO’s ladder next) (MOMO on Team CHAEYOUNG) Oh! MOMORING!
(Welcome to MOMORING) Won’t it be fun?
(Sounds fun) ♪ Doo-doo-doo ♪
(TZUYU’s ladder next) ♪ Doo-doo-doo ♪
(Our TZU) ♪ Doo-doo-doo ♪
(What’s the result?) (Welcome to Ambitionland) MINA’s automatically in
Team JEONGYEON. (Teams have been formed) - Only TZUYU needs to...
- Come over. (Switching seats) (Choosing team names) (Group of primary colors) (Glance) (The primary colors’ team name is?) We’re ready. (They use the same gestures) (We can’t lose) MOMO! (MOMO... Got it?) Yes, we’ve chosen.
(Team names chosen) You guys first.
(Confident) Why so eager, Son CHAEYOUNG?
(NAYEON feels betrayed) You were quiet last time. No.
(They’re still scary) (DAHYUN’s last minute check) At first...
One, two, three! Ha-ha!
(Like it) Let’s go. One, two, three! Diction! Eh?
(What’s the matter?) Songs need good diction. We’ll wait and see.
(Lukewarm) Diction it is.
(Not giving in) Okay.
(Next) (Girls, got it?) We’ll stand up first.
(We’ll show you standing) Cool
(Ambitionland waiting) (Ready)
Ask us. What is it? Our team is...
One, two, three! One More Time! If you hear our songs, you would want to see us once more, so we chose this name. So you’ll sing once
and give us an encore? Of course, if we do well.
(Encore possible) We are...
Madonna! Hee-hee-hee! Whoa.
(Lukewarm towards each other) - Why?
- Why Madonna? We were going to choose Madonna,
Michael Jackson, and Bobby Brown.
(JYP training room names) - Let’s switch!
- TZUYU chose Michael Jackson. I heard her! “They’re Michael Jackson.
Should we pick Madonna?” We’ll change!
Michael Jackson. - Go with Bobby Brown.
- Sure, we’re Bobby Brown. (That was easy!) (Extremely COOOOL) CHAEYOUNG, it suits you. (Perfect theme) - They’re our training room names.
- Yes. Great. There we go. We’re Madonna. (TOFU’s version of Bobby Brown)
We do this. We are... Michael Jackson! (NAYEON laughs at TZUYU’s detail) - One, two, three!
- Bobby Brown! (You’re our comedians today) Bobby Brown! That’s not Bobby Brown.
(Where’s Bobby Brown?) (We know) - We know.
- It was my idea. Bobby Brown! (What a curious child) - Where’s the Brown?
- The Brown’s here. Huh? My hair...
(Turns out to be Bobby Blue) Brown? Me!
(True brown under the pink) So, we’ve teamed up, guys. Do you remember
the school camps? Right!
(Reply: Student Camp) Wow! Anyway,
here are the teams. Ready to have some fun? Yeah! Can’t hear you! Ready? Yeah! Great! Shall we say,
“TIME TO TWICE?” Yes! - “TIME TO...”
- “TWICE!” (ROUND 1 MC JEONGYEON)
Listen! (Listen, everyone) The first game is... Random Remake. Please explain. Choose a title song
by TWICE and sing it. Meanwhile, the other teams change the beat,
chord, melody, etc. using the buttons here
to throw you off. (Got it) Try to keep singing
and finish the song. The team with
the highest points wins. The winners receive Korean beef and fruit. Runner-ups get fruits. The third team gets snacks.
(How’s that?) Thank you.
(Good) *Before the Shooting*
Wow, you’re giving us this fruit later? - Insane!
- This is it! We should win! - This is Team DAHYUN’s!
- Beef! Sing loudly to get more points.
(Giving karaoke tips) It’s not only about the score.
(NAYEON’s already competitive) Round one!
Let’s start. Choose your... - Title songs.
- We did! (High-security relay)
Really? Go first. - Michael Jackson.
- No. Oh, right.
The captain’s team goes first. - Right!
- Why? Because last time,
the captains went first. Fine, then. (End of debate) (List of TWICE’s songs
added in the karaoke) - Why so many?
- That’s a lot! (First up, Team Michael Jackson) - Distract her?
- I chose... “TT", The song I made a lot of mistakes on. - We have to do...
- Right. ("TT") Can you raise the volume? Can you ?
