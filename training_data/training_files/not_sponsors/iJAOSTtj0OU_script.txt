we love messing around with some cutting-edge artificial intelligence here at corridor in fact we've been working with gpt-3 which is currently in a closed access state so sam thankfully was able to get permission to use it and today we're going to have that ai right this entire video we're going to get the script from sam's screen on our phones and then as we do the action sam's going to enter that back into ai so it's going to be a back and forth loop as the ai tells us what we do and then we feed back to the ai what we did and it continues our story we might be crossing state lines in a couple hours i don't know if i know what's gonna happen so buckle up oh boy so guys our setting is complete it's the four of you on the famous green couch in our studio we need the first prompt as to what happens we need to make an interesting video that gets 10 million views what should we do [Music] peter replies well how about we play a game matt agrees that sounds like fun wren however is skeptical i don't know if we have time for a game we need to make a video we can film in less than an hour nico suggests we can do both we can film a game and then make a video about why people should play it matt jumps up excitedly that's a great idea we should play a game that's based on a tv show what tv show what about the walking dead that would be cool we can play the game and then talk about it we just need to figure out the game what do we need to do we need to roll some dice matt jumps up and down excitedly i love rolling dice i don't know if this is a good idea i don't really feel like playing a game where we all die we wouldn't really die we would just need to restart now we get to do an action what are we going to do well do we get some dice yeah you guys do whatever you want so i'm typing niko gets up and grabs an assortment of dice from his dungeons and dragons collection the first player was matt matt says i'm going to roll for my survivor's name he rolls his die and gets a seven he looks at his character sheet and decides on bill my name's billy [Music] i rolled and i got a six i'm going to be called sophia oh i rolled and i got a three i'm going to be called carl i roll for my survivor name she gets a an 11. i'm going to be called laurie brennan turned into a girl all of a sudden [Music] now it's time for the starting equipment and their mysterious persona nico gets a baseball bat my mysterious persona is t-dog hey i get a wolf whistle guys matt gets a wolf whistle [Music] my mysterious persona is lorry rem gets a pickaxe and my mysterious persona is andrea peter gets a handcuff peter gets a handgun next it was time for the players to make their first move they could do anything in the game that they wanted as long as they rolled the corresponding number apparently now we're playing a dice based walking dead game i'm gonna roll the dice we'll see what i get we're gonna feed it to the ai it's gonna tell me my next move this is pretty cohesive now everything we're doing like makes total sense nego rolled a 10 which means that you can look for supplies if you find them you can take an item to use in the [Music] game [Music] nico decided to look for supplies and found a can of beans oh yeah t-doc's not going hungry tonight matt's turn okay all right i hope i get a good one matt also rolled a 10 which means that you can look for supplies matt decides to look for supplies as well and find some batteries [Music] wren's turn i'm rolling 12. i rolled a 12. you can move in any direction as long as you roll the number rolled on your dice rin decides to move north but rolls a 5. go north yeah go north red there you go a little more north there you are that's north all right here we go i got a 13. peter rolls a 13 a very lucky number which means that peter decides to move forward two spaces and now he's in the bathroom see you later so i guess two spaces this feels like a lot more than two spaces [Music] right now the ai's been dictating this game and of its own accord it now said it was now a time for the players to encounter an obstacle peter's turn you find yourself in a bathroom there's a zombie in there oh oh he's in trouble go find peter go find peter right now peter decides to fight the zombie but he misses completely wren runs after peter and attacks the zombie with his axe but he misses completely nico's turn nico attacks the zombie with his baseball bat he misses too [Music] you guys suck you're so bad at this matt's turn hold on guys i got this one you decide to go in the bathroom and kill the zombie zombie bursts into flames and turns into a pile of ashes everybody cheers the blood of my eggs these cokes make guys continuing here ren's turn you decide to look for supplies i pick up a pile of ashes and add it to my supplies it still thinks i'm a female these are the zombie ashes that i have now cupped into my hand netflix it was now time for the final encounter before them the big boss appeared it was massive it was scary it was a huge walker in a police uniform the authorities [Music] the group was scared they needed to roll a 20 on two dice only then would they win the 5-0 it's massive it's a huge pile of crush wow said peter unsure if they would be able to do it why don't we put the dice on the number 20 then reverse the footage to make it look like we didn't cheat that's a great idea that would be awesome we could make it look like we really rolled the 20. they put the dice on the ground with the number 20 facing up right they blow on the dice to make them move then they rewind the footage [Music] that looks pretty good we made it like we rolled a d20 i don't say anything even though they cheated they rolled 20s which meant that they decide to fight the walker congratulations you have won the game the end everyone laughs and high fives that was fun i agree it was really fun good job everyone i think it's time to make the video now wait it's not done [Music] do it do it baby we're just getting started yeah let's start filming we can film it now everyone else agrees as they sit back on the green couch welcome to the corridor crew today we are going to tell you about a video game we played it's called the walking dead and it's awesome yeah we all played it and we all loved it i was in second place and i beat everyone else and i had the most wins and i had the least amount of wins it was fun and we all had fun playing it that's why we're going to recommend you play it [Laughter] wow that was insane that's really trippy it gave us like an intro and an outro basically yeah that's incredible we came back into the review of the game like we said we were at the beginning of this project wow it knew that when this game was over that means the video was done and i i didn't i did not touch that at all sam can you give me an ai uh version of like requests for like likes and subs you ready you ready to act this out just tweet it out okay red and
