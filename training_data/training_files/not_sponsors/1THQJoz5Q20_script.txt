I about lost night oh my god this is so many likes I'm so proud of Michael bad up so proud the Vinci Surgical System is the most advances you can find surgical experience for minimally invasive surgery [Music] hey how's everyone's global health crisis going my house is why does it quiet oh it's quiet it's on full goddamn quarantine and I'll probably be dead in a week anyway not from the virus like like a electrocution accident or something it's actually giving me a lot of free time and what better way to spend free time right now than to help the medical industry and I can't do any chemistry or biology or like body stuff yeah but I tend little BOTS X and let me tell you those da Vinci Surgery robotic rat bastards okay that doesn't look like a anime mousepad chemistry or biology I've always kind of wanted one of those that are usually like tell you those da Vinci Surgery robotics you know um I think they usually animate boobies you know the ones that pop out I like this frog man oh were Canadians and it like like the circus stop the world doesn't need to know my - rat bastards are ripping hospitals off look at this two million dollars for one shitty robot they can spend that on a couple hundred bandages are like one ambulance ride in the u.s. we can build a better surgery robot for a buck IRA my friend got a cut and she went to like get it checked out and get it I think they put like a bandage on it and I don't know it was approximately three million dollars lot less come on the biggest role that I'm not gonna make my bed flan da Vinci's design is that it relies on these corn heats and low robotic arms for movement say you're operating on a patient's life you start screaming out in pain you got to get up to a space smacking our luck with these robotic arms that slowly [ __ ] and they don't have any travel Vista instead looking about the surgical tools to a rail system that can move anywhere of an operating table hey look it's past Michael you know took them five whole days to 3d model and build one rail carriage what a [ __ ] Mickey you little [ __ ] I'm the narrator I'm like God gonna kill me here's what the part of the carriage looks like you see it uses wheel bearing star trouble up and down the slothy five days to make just a part of it and to make it move no you're stupid and I hate you for power we're using it run ha oh he sounds just like he does servomotor do I know what that means absolutely [ __ ] not I've never done this before what I do know is someone told my boys what I do know is someone told me this would be fast and very accurate and all you have to do to put it in its Michael Reese time hey I got the motor very professionally hooked up to the driver board which is hooked up to my computer so we can see what this thing can do okay so this is the like calibration sequence I need to do this before it actually runs [ __ ] sick it should be a little faster though okay I love how he's like so edgy 24/7 let's say twenty thirty seven and then that one hour the day is done he's just like so [ __ ] excited that something works like I'm so glad he included that could we see what calibration oh my god I love seeing that so much I'm so like have random stuff to like look at this is so cool it does this thing I remember him showing me bit the hand simulator thing that's later on in this video it is so [ __ ] weird it's a gap I just got like pretty cheap off like Amazon is so mason robot do cool stuff exactly or great oh that's good this that's fast give me one second okay you just stand right there looks like this I did a quirky little snap teleportation thing right oh damn buddy you [ __ ] tired but I built this test platform aluminum and wood that I stole from my girlfriend's bed frame it's not like I can go to Home Depot on Florentine this is a prototype so I can write and test the software before I build the actual thing but even the prototype is pretty cool it's the same idea with the motor carriage on the x-axis but now we have two additional motors on the YF allergies give me like a spiny determination admit a firearm but if you write some software that can talk to all the motors you can make it do pretty much anything you want this is the homing sequence it figure out the balance of the machine by measuring them you can make a bond to the things stable as you want it to be buddy yeah it's just a prototype so I'm controlling with my mouse right now it looks jerky and awful but it's actually got a really good amount of precision to it it's kind of going in a circle from the top down his editing games on [ __ ] polling view like I said this is not the final surgery robot it's gonna be much more refined much more medical looking you know much more safe for the user and all that movement was controlled by the code I wrote don't worry I'm not gonna show it I know everyone thinks it's boring so we dynamically picturing these limits which you can put it here the bounds of your machine via [ __ ] maybe instead write some code that steps the motor forward until it starts using a lot of power then you know you the edge of the rail then you know exactly where you are in relation to the balance of the machine it's [ __ ] sick look how cool the cold part is guys I'm gonna keep going this part applies the scaling factors that are calculated as a function of the input but Michael I hear you asks so you can move the carriage over any part of the operating table you want great but how are you gonna move the medical tool take me still has that bleached piece of hair that's where the carriage utility mechanism comes into play that's the thing that's gonna move scalpel or the clamp or whatever often down which is great there's just a small time always hassle I built it which is a good thing my original plan was you know just to have a thin piece of plastic with a motor attached to it that moves a play easy but then I [ __ ] I saw that thing okay there's no way that's gonna survive so I'm gonna make it a little strong you know I may as well make a goal of fast yeah look tear it away no it looks like a time bomb and it weighs ten [ __ ] fell dude that's precisely move the mounting plate up and down wherever you wanted to go the thing is I just don't know if those motors can handle ten pounds so we're gonna have to do a little test Michael why don't you just use the period utility mechanism to test it out well it took me a long time to build and it's [ __ ] beautiful so cry more it looks like a ton of small movements pretty well I access ax okay that's not that bad it's silly slide we can probably just go ahead and make the final version and it looks like goodness I did the stupid hand thing again it's been three more weeks I have severe depression but Michael wears a surgery robot wait for it wait for it Oh big reveal this is the surgery robot you da Vinci should do this is actually insane it's got the super [ __ ] hard-to-reach driver boards like don't know why put them under here I thought it would look cool but Michael they even work does it work it doesn't work I don't know if it works I haven't turned it on yet I've been too afraid since it took me so long to build so I turned the camera on so you can at least see my tears when it tears itself apart I'm worried about it this is why he belongs in our house he knows everything is content when it works and the disappointment if it doesn't work its content either way because when I built it I liked the bull the caveman brain metals strong metal not strong maybe more like McDonald's playplace trampoline but you got to take chances when you're innovating on the next great thing so I'm gonna add in creativity but Michael where's the controller [ __ ] you you are the controller I got this VR hand tracking camera off of Amazon that works super goddamn well so you just take the hand coordinates from this pipe him in the she's had this for a man anything boom oh [ __ ] University robotics you can move life with just floating your hand around robot go here robot be true the music there hope do surgery there yeah which is exactly what happened here now this one's you over there and now the surgery you DaVinci shitty robot can't do that you need to squeeze those little metal robot teats do yours before I sell my design to surgeons across the nation we have to attach some surgical tools to the come because otherwise it's just a big-ass robot so let's buy a scalpel on Amazon wow that is just unacceptable scalpels are gonna take a whole three days well that's pretty reasonable but no that's messed up dang global health crisis that's far too long if only I had an alternative you really think about it scalpels are just shitty smaller knives so why don't we just use bigger better knives like Hello we already have those wake up you know I think this is like our only good knife by the way we have like no I know that's very off-topic I'm just saying we could use some knives we have a p.o box people are usually has started cooking filters have one night are you looking for the cutting edge and power precision and usability look no further the future of surgical robotics is here unlike some others is this not love gamut of tests for right innings power unless have a pineapple for mincing the operation operate on it surgically over here now patient small incision a small incision I can't get it image out of my head it's really nice the power isn't the only thing we strive for is an essential tenet of surgery and we make no except I can talk Frodo really [Music] [Music] yeah wait wait wait don't you guys think this kind of looks like Timmy wait do you see it it can't look like Tammy and then an ear huh do you see it like the little eyes to nose don't think little mouth it's like Lily always subconsciously draws Tammy I know you see it I'm not gonna pressure you but this is supposed to show how accurate my machine is let's see try to do that you might be wondering the system FDA approved but don't just take our word for it real medical professional has to say about this innovative new technology we're gonna go for like a laparoscopic appendectomy so if we just make a small incision above the chest here we can a little bit more difficult for some procedures but not I just wish I knew where the heck he found this guy and Roldan a lot of surgical system so like I was saying moving the patient is a lot easier with the system like normally it up to manually with a newbie would you add this to your okay my favorite clip on the Internet you're wrong last but not least we've made our machines so intuitive that anyone can do surgery with no prior training so you've never seen this finishing before in your life it's perfect because this study is to see if we can bring someone from zero skill level all the way up to the ability of what you try stable I might go from not too close it's kind of dangers oh just put your hand up could you just put your hand out above the things I wrote before tonight okay can I just say when I came in so there's a blood bag thingy here right I came in and almost like is that Coke no that looks like blood no that's not blood that's coke right he goes oh it's blood okay so I was so fixated on this big bag of blood though had tubes coming out of it and stuff I did not see the knife behind the monitor so white and fun I'm not the basis of my genuine reaction I about last night because like you know what there's these parameter is nice but if there wasn't dead I'm just dead my wrists unarmed gone gaming no more career already kind of non-existent but now further non-existent probably the scariest moment of my life what I'm glad that it was for conscious gonna make a small incision right above the ear [Music] decision to stop plug the hole with the knife yep got perfect knife yeah you owe this it's okay no it's fine is it winning if the learning experience triangle attracts a knife from the head let's just try and get it out of ya okay good incision nice thank you I felt so bad cuz he was like doing this and he had been doing it for a while also I think it's fine said watch this on his video he had been doing this for a while and then I felt bad cuz I was like I want to help him with the blood because it was going everywhere and then I tried and the thing has so much range the little hand thing has so much range and when I tried to help him with the blood I just heated that knife the other way but thank God that's the doll side and it wouldn't done anything regardless I don't even know a guy yes thank you for watching that concludes recent video elements for my surgical system if you're a hospital looking to try it out follow me on twitter subscribe to me on youtube and maybe just maybe I'll let you borrow it for a bit woman that did not get banned for their outstanding smoked crack [ __ ] you da Vinci robots and then unbend [Music]
