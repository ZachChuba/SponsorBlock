if you followed my PhD journey starting in 2013 and finishing in December 2018 then you'll have seen what I have been studying you've seen how I have studied it but I want to in this video definitively set out what I found and what ended up going in my thesis and thanks to dashlane for sponsoring this video it's going to go into some detail so to stop people from feeling lost I've broken it down into sections let's start with some background so my PhD was about the Earth's atmosphere like ogres like onions the atmosphere is divided into layers from the bottom up you have the troposphere the stratosphere the meter sphere and the thermosphere these layers are most commonly defined by their temperature profile how temperature changes as you go higher up in the troposphere the temperature gets colder the higher you go if you've ever been up a mountain you'll have felt this effect however once you go past about 10 kilometers above the surface the temperature stays the same and then actually increases with altitude this happens until you hit about 50 kilometers up at which point the temperature starts to decrease with altitude again this region is called the stratosphere and it behaves very differently to our layer the atmosphere the troposphere the largest feature of the stratosphere is the polar vortex a circulation of fast-moving air over a thousand kilometers across with wind speeds of over 200 kilometres per hour that forms every year in the winter over the Arctic my PhD was about how these two layers interact with one another in particular during big violent events called sudden stratospheric warming a sudden stratospheric warming occurs when the polar vortex breaks apart either because it splits in two or because it moved too far south these events are called warming's because when the vortex breaks apart air from further south piles into the stratospheric Arctic and squishes it down this squashing or more properly adiabatic descent results in increases in temperatures of up to 70 or even 80 degrees Celsius in the stratosphere over just a couple of days and we've known since about the year 2000 that when sudden stratospheric warming happen the weather in the troposphere is affected thorpe up to 2 storms going across the Atlantic track further south than normal and there's an increased chance of extreme cold in the mid-latitudes this happens because the primary mode of variability in the stratosphere is the strength of the polar vortex or the primary mode of variability in the troposphere is the location of the jet stream the fast-moving river of air that divides cold arctic air from warmer mid-latitude air and these two modes of variability are couples together which we can describe mathematically by an Arctic Oscillation index which is just a number which can be defined at any height above the surface if the AO index is positive the polar vortex is strong and the jet stream is relatively straight and far north if the AO index is negative then the vortex is weak and the jet stream is wavy and further south in the aftermath of sudden stratospheric warming we see descending negative AO index anomalies the influence of the sudden warming creeping towards the surface and staying there so a vortex breaking apart results in a very wavy jet stream which sits further south we know that this happens but we don't know how this happens my PhD was about proposing a quantitative mechanism for this descending influence and in order to explain exactly how I did that I first need to give you two more pieces of specific background information the Arctic Oscillation index is a result of a complex statistical process called principal component analysis or PCA you don't need to understand how this works but the end result is important when applied to surface pressures over the northern hemisphere over a couple of years of data pca defines a pattern over the earth this pattern explains whether majority of variability in surface pressure takes place for example it shows that if pressure over the Arctic is relatively high the pressure over the North Atlantic is relatively low a bit like a seesaw this is the Arctic Oscillation pattern and the a/o index is the number that tells you if the seesaw has one end up or the other in terms of the pattern whether the Arctic pressure is high and so atlantic pressure is low or if the Arctic pressure is low and the Atlantic pressure hi the first step of my PhD was simplifying how we represent these variations in surface pressure for reasons that will become clear in a second I was specifically interested in the pressure over the Arctic so I defined a new pressure index designed to be equivalent to the AO index it was designed to be simple to bank you just averaged the pressure over the area north of the 65 north latitude line and then subtracts the long running average to produce a pressure anomaly over the Arctic but is this equivalent to the AO index well if you compare the Arctic Oscillation pattern to where my index is calculated you see that my index is defined over the same area as the primary blob of the AO pattern and because the AO is a seesaw pattern if you know whether one side of the seesaw is up or down you know if the other side is down or up so my index contains the same information as the AO index but in a simpler way and this is something which I demonstrated statistically so I defined a new index to represent the principal mode of variability of air pressure but why was that important to do well I defined the index in such a way that I could easily derive equations that govern how it varied in response to changes in the rest of the atmosphere so remember what I was trying to do I was trying to show how the strength of the polar vortex varying could change the position of the jet stream in the troposphere if I could derive a set of equations which showed how the pressure index in the troposphere varied in response to changes in the stratosphere then I will have achieved that you can think of my index as like an imaginary cylinder of air surrounding and above the Arctic the pressure anomaly in a particular slice of this cylinder has the same information in it as the complex pca created AO index but while that index has lots of things that influence how it changes in time my pressure index has just two things the mass of air that goes through the cylinders walls above the slice and the mass of air that moves vertically through the slice if air moves horizontally into the cylinder above then there will be more mass on top of the slice of cylinder which will increase the pressure on it likewise if air moves vertically up through the cylinder then the pressure on the slice will also increase what I needed to do then was derive two equations one that describes the air mass that moves horizontally into the cylinder and one that describes the mass that moves vertically in the cylinder these are those two equations and they were the next important thing I did in my PhD if you want details of how they're derived then read my thesis link in the description for this video I need to explain the most important variable in these equations sign the stream function a stream function is a way that we can mathematically describe a fluid flow the atmosphere behaves like a fluid on a rotating sphere and so we can define a stream function for the atmosphere a stream function is a scalar field meaning that it has a single value at every point in the atmosphere the speed that the atmosphere flows in the east to west and north to south directions otherwise known as wind is calculated by looking at how much the stream function varies in the north to south and east to west directions respectively you can also calculate the temperature of the atmosphere at a point by looking at how much the stream function changes as you get higher in the atmosphere so by calculating the gradient of one field the stream function you get information about multiple fields wind and temperature I used a stream function to calculate the air mass moving in to and within the imaginary cylinder of air around the Arctic via these two equations but I've only told you what the stream function is not how you calculate it and that's really a video all on its own but basically you use a variable called potential vorticity or PV for short which might sound familiar to long-term viewers Peevy is another scalar variable that's rich in information about the state of the atmosphere it's not a physical thing that you can see or feel but constructed from hell air rotates and how temperature changes with height via a process called inversion you can take a PV distribution and get a stream function from it the PV can be just one part of the atmosphere and yet the stream function you get by inverting it is defined everywhere so the stream function associated with a PV distribution in just one area encodes information about how that area influences the rest of the atmosphere this has been a few conceptual leaps one after the other so just to recap PV is a variable in the atmosphere which you invert to get a stream function which describes how the atmosphere behaves the stream function can be used to calculate how air mass gets moved around in the Arctic and those mass fluxes used to calculate changes in my pressure index PV calculates a stream function which calculates mass fluxes which calculates changes in the pressure index which tells us whether the surface atmospheric seesaw is up or down if I could show that changes in the PV distribution in the stratosphere caused changes in the pressure index at the surface then I will have achieved my goal but I found something a bit different and not what I expected you can add together the stream functions calculated from inverting different PV distributions in different places in isolation to get a total stream function if you've studied electrostatics this will sound familiar it's just like the superposition of charges and remember that PV encodes information about the area of the atmosphere it's defined in transmitted by the stream function to the whole atmosphere so if you invert the PV in the stratosphere on its own you will get a stream function which tells you how the stratosphere influences the rest of the atmosphere I could define a stream function sy s which only has stratospheric information in it it's calculated by inverting stratospheric PV only and then use this stream function in my horizontal and vertical mass flux equations to see how the stratosphere influences the pressure index in the troposphere and I could equally define a stream function sy T which is calculated by inverting P V from the troposphere on its own and then use that in my mass flux equations combining the two stream functions together produces the total stream function and so the total horizontal and vertical mass flux however by considering the stream functions separately you can isolate how much horizontal and how much vertical mass flux is forced by changes in the stratosphere and how much is forced by changes in the troposphere my theory was that in the aftermath of sudden stratospheric warming the vortex splitting apart but the stratosphere had a strong influence on the troposphere communicated via mass fluxes induced by changes in the stratospheric PV distribution man it literally took this entire video up until that point to be able to say that sentence and have you understand what it means I could test my theory by calculating the total mass fluxes moving in to and within the imaginary Arctic cylinder of air via my equations and then comparing that to the mass flux is seen in observations if the total mass flux predicted by my equations matched those seen in observations then that would verify that my equations were correct and if that was the case the relative sizes of the two contributions from the stratosphere and from the troposphere will tell me if the stratosphere has a significant influence on the troposphere so was I right this is an example time series of my pressure index as seen in observations the horizontal axis is time and the vertical axis is height above the ground you see the sending positive and negative pressure anomalies over the Arctic now compare this to what I calculated using my equations at first glance they don't appear very similar but you start to see similarities between the two this large negative feature followed by an ascending positive anomaly this large positive anomaly encompassing a negative anomaly all of which are approximately the right magnitude if you do the stats the two time series from observations and calculated by equations are reasonably close to one another for the past 40 years of data they correlate moderately I'll spare you the exact details of why this doesn't work perfectly but the basic reason is that you're trying to sum up lots of things which are positive and negative to try and make something which is very nearly zero and that's open to a lot of errors especially when using course resolution data if you're willing to accept that these two are close enough to one another then you can examine the contributions from the stratosphere on its own and from the troposphere on its own clearly the influence of the stratosphere doesn't really get past the tropopause the barrier between the troposphere and the stratosphere but this is cool eagle-eyed viewers will have noticed that something is missing take another look at these two equations for the horizontal and vertical mass flux the vertical mass flux equation is a linear function of the stream function used meaning that the stream function never gets multiplied by itself a bunch of stuff happens to it but it only appears once the horizontal mass flux equation however isn't linear it has a sy times si here it's a nonlinear equation in sy that means that while you can add together the vertical mass flux contribution from the stratosphere and the vertical mass flux contribution from the troposphere to get a total you can't do that for the horizontal mass flux to get the total contribution you add up the contributions from the stratosphere and the troposphere and then add an interference term which has both stratospheric and tropospheric information in it so just to reiterate because this equation is nonlinear when combining contributions from two different stream functions you have to add an interference term to the Sun representing the interaction of those two stream functions if you add that interference term to the stratospheric influence represented using sy s star then you see the influence of the stratosphere penetrating into the Trop fear or in other words the nonlinear interaction of stratospheric and tropospheric information allows for changes in the stratosphere to affect the surface and while this is just one example time series the overall statistics for the 40 years of data back up this conclusion so speaking mathematically I demonstrated that the nonlinear interaction of stratospheric and tropospheric information substantially forced arctic pressure tendencies in the troposphere which is equivalent to saying that they substantially forced the AO index in the troposphere or surface weather and that's not something which we known before and it was something which is only possible to learn because of the entire framework that I'd constructed in my thesis from the pressure index to the mass flux equations I realized that this video is a relatively deep dive with lots of new concepts and not very much time so in case you got lost along the way let me rephrase what I learned my PhD without referencing any of the maths I learned that the stratosphere that's the next layer up of the atmosphere can influence the troposphere our layer the atmosphere including weather at the surface but not directly instead the stratosphere influences surface weather by the way that it communicates with the troposphere or if you like but the stratosphere can influence the surface weather but if and only if the troposphere is in the right configuration to receive that influence this is a relationship which is most noticeable in the aftermath of big events like southern stratospheric warming but it holds generally and that nonlinear relationship the conversation that goes on between the stratosphere in the troposphere is something that we didn't quantitatively know until my PhD this video as long as it is is still only a brief overview of what I did in my PhD and it doesn't even include all the results from my thesis so if you'd like to learn more about what I did and read it yourself then I don't recommend giving the background chapter a read then you can do so on my website I have a website by the way my website is use the promo code Simon Clarke will get 10% off thank you for watching the video I hope that you learned a few things and I didn't make this either too simple or too complicated there knowing me I probably managed to do both if you'd like to see the tropospheric effect on a sudden stratospheric warming then go and check out the video I made on the recent cold snap across North America and if you haven't seen my PhD vlogs then go watch them thank you very much for watching the video and I'll see you in the next one you
