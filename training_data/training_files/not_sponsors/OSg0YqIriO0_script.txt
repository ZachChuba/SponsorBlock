today's video is brought to you by expressvpn de brother ben as we all know the location of any given Wizarding school is a highly guarded secret almost I guess you're inviting some foreign schools and their students to visit for a year for a big competition I guess there are some exceptions for that or I guess if you're one of the generations of students who attended the school and needs to show up in a moment's notice in the dark with the giant army of dark wizards and Giants but other than that super secret which reminds me have you guys seen this map of where all the wizarding schools are because it is beautiful oh hey look there they all are or at least here are seven of the schools that are bad at keeping the secret according to JK Rowling there are actually 11 big wizarding schools worldwide but I guess the other four are just much better at keeping a lid on it although let's face it they're all definitely in Russia India China and Australia I mean sorry guys you're totally falling victim to population density and geography it's really not that hard to narrow down in any case they're the most famous of any of these schools is of course Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and even though we know it's in Scotland and something about the general geography surrounding the school that's probably about as specific as most people can get sorry where is the school next to a Scottish Loch right okay well uh yeah I'll just I'll be there in a jiffy see how that could still probably be an issue for most people doesn't really narrow it down very much but not to worry guys because today I think we have figured out the exact location of Hogwarts school [Music] guys you know how muggles can't see down below hope you check it out ok let's just start with the basics we know at the very least that Hogwarts castle is located next to a Scottish lock in a mountainous area surrounded by woods aka the Forbidden Forest and to muggle eyes looks like ruins we know 100% that it is a Scottish lock because that has been confirmed on poverty in Scotland but there are many many lakes so that doesn't really narrow it down a bit our first goal was to just shrink the playing field you might think that where they filmed the Harry Potter films would be a good starting point for which Lake Hogwarts is actually located at well that ends up not being very reliable because what you see in the movies is actually shots from lakes all over the place depending on what they needed for that particular scene instead to narrow things down a bit we decided to start with the Hogwarts Express we know for certain that every year on September 1st the Hogwarts Express leaves platform 9 and 3/4 at 11 a.m. sharp and delivers the students to the school after sunset and according to time in date.com sunset in Scotland on September 1st happens at 8:11 p.m. they are on the train for at least nine hours which by the way no wonder they are always just starving by the time they get to the feast it's no wonder all Dumbledore says is blubber augment and tweak if you said anything else people would ride because they're just starving but it's like full video about that by clicking the card either way when you're leaving from London you can only head north by train otherwise you'd end up in the ocean and into land you somewhere in this vicinity and Scotland that said it is a fictional railroad they're taking so it's hard to give an exact route and believe you me looking up train speeds online not as easy as you might think the next hint we get is actually in the movies and while I understand that's not as high of a cannon level as the books hear me out in Prisoner of Azkaban it is mentioned that Sirius Black has been sighted near Duff town which Hermione exclaims isn't far from here yes it is a movie only reference but consider this when that movie came out JK Rowling had already finished writing order of the Phoenix and it's not like she wasn't super duper involved in the production of the film's and she would have had to allow this reference to exist and they didn't have to include it they didn't have to say Duff town I could have said hogs need or any other fictional Wizarding town but they chose to leave it is where we're at is we're looking for a secluded location nine hours north of London by a train near Duff town surrounded by mountains lake and woods and from there we just opened a terrain map over Duff town and zoom out to see if there were any particularly mountainous regions nearby and great news there is one super obvious candidate welcome to can garbs National Park which nearly positive I'm saying wrong this park is home to not just five different Scottish locks but also the second highest peak in Scotland the ben macdui which I'm nearly positive from pronouncing wrong plus it has the benefit of being a national park meaning there's no chance the land will accidentally get developed by muggles you you know how like sometimes you're just like walking and all of a sudden whoops I accidentally developed some land here know what I mean is there not going to a plan construction and inadvertently stumble upon Hogwarts so yes the park does have a lot going for it but it's still also quite big so we still need to narrow it down a little bit more and doing this isn't actually as hard as it sounds we just have to find a spot that matches our list of conditions which again it needs to be on a lake surrounded by woods relatively inaccessible to muggles and would appear as ruins to muggles and if you can believe it there actually is a location that perfectly fits this honestly at first I thought this was gonna be kind of tricky the park is home to at nine different castles and varying amounts of upkeep and like I said earlier five different Lakes alas eight of these castle builders apparently didn't want waterfront property because they're totally bonkers I guess but that leaves us with just one other option and guess what it's totally in ruins allow me to introduce you to the Loch and Eileen and its Island Castle Island but yes I know Hogwarts isn't on an island don't worry I will get to it trust me this castle is perfect not only is it the only castle in the park that's on a lake but the fact that it is on an island does make it less accessible to muggles in fact there aren't even like ferries or other boat services at the lake that will even just take you out to the island also I mentioned earlier that the other castles in the park are in varying degrees of upkeep but that's only kind of true six of the other eight are immaculate and beautiful and I very badly want to go visit them mostly I was just trying to be nice to this one Drummond castle I mean just look at it pour think have some self-respect drumming and the eighth one is Glen boo shot Castle which I've nearly 100 percent positive from pronouncing wrong but which like I'm sorry castle feels kind of generous maybe at one point you were a nice stone house but like look at this I'm sorry is that a chain-link fence and is the chain-link fence somehow higher than your actual stone wall yeah no Castle I don't think so sorry not the point the point is that the castles in this park are very nice and kept up with V well so really the fact that the island castle is in ruins makes it stand out as kind of unusual almost like something's just a little off in fact and this is where it gets kind of freaky I went on Google Earth to try and get like a ground-level view of the castle but just take a look at how it loaded I've got a full perfectly clear 360 view of the shore looking out at the castle except for one single square that wouldn't load the money shot the castle itself was hidden from view like that's kind of weird right like a little bit like technology doesn't function at Hogwarts something either way though we are looking for ruins that's what Hogwarts would look like to us muggle so it's to our advantage and it actually gets even better do you know what's a really common theme amongst castles history castles have histories it takes a lot of people to build and then maintain a castle their castles for a reason do you know what this little Island Castle does not have history there is just not a documented history about it historians can only guess when it was built Hogwarts was built in the 10th century we know that when was this castle built nobody knows maybe then and get this there are actually legends about the specific castle having zigzagging underwater secret passageways to get people in and out of the castle but they've never been found but like are you kidding me with this ancient lakefront ruins Castle that wrecks technology with legendary underground secret chambers and it's in the known relative area of Hogwarts yeah but Jay it's still on an island what about that yes about that there are actually two explanations for that one real-world and one in universe in the real world there actually was a path leading from shore to the castle at one point but in 1700 they built a dam on the lake and raised the water level which then wiped out said path in a universe however the fact that the hassle appears as ruins on an island could simply be part of the illusion which could also account for the size because I'm sure you might have been thinking that Island looks kind of tiny for Hogwarts don't you think yes I do think but I think that's what they want you to think but just like the fact that it appears to be in ruins the size is also part of the illusion so guys there you go that is our best guess as to the exact location of Hogwarts in the real world let me know do you agree in the Tao section down below also before we go I want to give a big shout out to the viewer who sent in and submitted this idea for us by the name of Robin clerks Robin put together a whole report a really great research and totally sold us on this idea we added some of our own little things in there as well but I hope you really enjoyed it Robin great job guys thanks so much for watching today's video please remember to leave a like on it if you haven't
