unfortunately being met with what seems like a pretty aggressive haunting grab a snack because tonight were diving into the foreign realm of tick-tock to experience and dissect the odd mystery of security 1275 you it was the night of July 3rd I was just sitting around scrolling through Twitter notifications because I was bored and I noticed that hey what's this a fan of mine by the name of airplane mp3 had tagged me in a Twitter thread by a girl named Angela Chavez this as you might expect shows us a few out of context videos by a tick-tock user named security 1275 here we can join in on a short clip of a guy that seems totally startled by someone or some thing that's in this building with them so you can get a feel of what this guy's hearing let's have a look real fast so I'm actually hearing something banging on the door I'm hoping I'm gonna catch it bear with me guys okay I'm back door was open again hello security so this accounts run by a guy named Josh he's a security guard that patrols a local cemetery in Georgia and during his work efforts he's been accompanied by some eerie guests the majority of the content on his profile essentially falls into the category of him living on his daily life experiencing something bizarre giving us follow-ups to it and giving us general life updates also he periodically makes references to his YouTube channel Ori archives his major tik-tok videos and livestreams now security 1275 has over 75 videos at the time of writing that is that's a lot that might be a record for something I've covered on this channel no yeah it's definitely a record so we aren't dragging this on I'm going to bring you with me through the major chronology and highlights of everything that's happened on the channels as far I absolutely encourage you to head over and follow him on God dare I said I encourage you to make a tick-tock account and go follow him because this story is definitely an interesting one that's gained quite a considerable amount of steam with that out of the way let's head back and check out his content you now this guy initially made videos on a different profile so it's hard to gauge when he initially began if I had a guess I'd assume that he started in the ballpark range of mid to late June anyway and one of his initial uploads we encounter one that centers on Josh going out to visit the cemetery that he patrols at he explains that he's out that night doing a routine checkup before he encounters his first sliver of strange activity [Music] what the hell hey kid kid [ __ ] that I don't know where he where this kid [ __ ] running from me kid holy God where the hell he went this kid definitely seems off absolutely refusing to turn around and being non-compliant with Josh a chase ensues that ends in the kid vanishing entirely Josh eventually seems to let it go and resume is about his normal patrol albeit a little weirded out where does that kid go though why wouldn't he talk and why do you run let's press on this is supposed to be the most haunted cemetery incident and I am chasing a kid right now I will not be going down that way we just took this job like two days ago through the city this is ridiculous somebody has definitely been walking behind me I'm not sure I just saw some tourist from Ohio told him that the place closes at 10:00 I'm about to head back over there but I don't know we've got some it's gonna be buried here tomorrow so I'll be doing a escort right now I'm just wait a minute did you see that escort interesting the kids still poking around in the dark and somehow Josh didn't noticed that he was right there in plain view curious about this I'd open to the comments of this one and found that he actually didn't notice it until people started bringing it up apparently he was looking in another direction when the light panned over the kid and as a result it was missed anyway this could simply be chalked up to a prankster or trespasser that didn't want their face to be seen due to potential ramifications so we can let this one odd instance slide the next few videos are simple lifestyle and music uploads without much substance for us fast-forwarding through this though we jump to another night where he's on patrol in this one he's equipped with the flashlight and dayz air inside the pitch-black chapel building but here something a bit more bizarre begins to take place ok I've got my taser out now y'all just to be aware Jesus Christ in the video following this he gives a bit of context he explains that he was actually called out there due to reports of a woman screaming and apparently after his previous recording ended he heard it again and got the hell out of there a few videos later we jump warden time to some original videos on his new account Josh explains that his old one was deleted due to him showing his gun I was on his hip by accident during a livestream thus resulting in someone reporting him with this in mind from here on out all remaining videos were shot as over the past couple months or so to the present so up next a few videos will be uploaded with his dog accompanying him he gives us some backstory on way it works which is the colonial Cemetery in Georgia and then proceeds to tell us that he's about to head back out there to ghost ons it turns out though the true reason he went out there was to check on his coworker whom he claims as a younger guy that's one of his assistant officers I was gonna come by and check on him and I can't get him answer the phone so this is a good time if you see anything this would be a good little video because I had no intentions of coming out here I went up and checked on the other side I just don't know whether Lee's at he's not answering his phone so I hope whatever the hell was messing with me and my older videos did not get him for some reason while out there he isn't able to find him but this is later explained away when Josh gets a text from em claiming that he was off getting lunch but with it was a strange bit of information I am I was actually just gonna come by and check on him make sure he was ten-four but a funny story is he said that he had PD here earlier because he saw what looked to be a little girl was in the hallway when he drove by when he went back he didn't find anybody a little girl huh the few videos that follow this are general updates and one he shows off his security lights and in the others he explains once again the situation with his deleted accounts in this set of videos that he presumably shot a couple days later though we can see him going back to the cemetery on his day off in responds to a few claims of vandalism by the groundskeeper he explains that people were messing around the night before and he was heading out there to secure the building so nobody else could enter within cut two of videos that he shot inside of the building he was in the process of taking care of business but unbeknownst to him he wouldn't be alone what is going on I'm basically just securing all this stuff right now [Music] just making sure there's nobody in here anybody in here hello yeah but listen you got to get out of here you're gonna have to come talk to me okay were you out I can't see you you're correct so you need to come out okay you guys hear this this is broad daylight I don't know where this kid is where are you could this potentially be that girl that his coworker mentioned earlier directly following this we see him at a police station getting some paperwork regarding this apparently a police officer had gone and checked the place out as well and caught much of the same phenomena on his body cam while he hasn't released any of it for us it definitely is something interesting to note so with the strange kid at the beginning to the creepy voices at night and in the chapel and the stuff that went down when he went to check on it during the daytime all of it ended up leading to his coworker quitting done he's out and I wonder why so what is up you guys so my security officer that I'm supposed to have here tonight he came in and turned everything in today he quit so I'm actually hearing something banging on the door I'm hoping I'm gonna catch you bear with me guys okay I'm back door was open again hello security okay oh how the hell they keep opening these hello yeah hey you need to come out I'm not playing anymore I don't know where the hell he's people are aware jesus [ __ ] christ alright call alright guys there was somebody standing in the corner I just saw that when my video uploaded and [ __ ] the lights are flickering on and off hang on a second guys so don't know what the hell is going on here but I'm about to check this out okay guys I'm really not sure what's going on here yeah I'm [ __ ] done this is some spooky [ __ ] [ __ ] going on here nope this is why my security officer [ __ ] quit just so y'all can be witness here I'm checking out this [ __ ] I'm getting the hell out of here that's my day off I hear leaves crackling and [ __ ] no there was a kid standing somebody was standing right over here when I walked right past them to the left so what is going on you guys I hightailed it out of there don't know what the hell that was there was absolutely no switches in that place to turn lights on don't know why they were flickering so right now I'm at the Jim Williams house this is something I was talking about on my old account there aren't any switches in there huh are you sure whatever or whoever it was that's haunting this place is undoubtedly getting more intense and you can bet your ass that I'd be out of there much like he if that ever happened to me but the switch thing that bothers me anyway about ten or so videos follow this with typical lifestyle YouTube an update shenanigans not much seems to happen during the span other than him showing us some day in the life stuff behind the scenes and one of his most recent videos though he gives an update about a security car and mentions a quick patrol that he needs to do elsewhere before heading back to the cemetery then we get a video with the caption please tell me you'll heard that and I'm sure you know what's coming take a look so what is going on you guys there is a red truck out here and the chapel lights just came on hello Hey look if you just saw here [ __ ] with me you fix it end up in jail you understand so where are you I'm get the [ __ ] [ __ ] done with this [ __ ] man nope nope nope hey off to the [ __ ] no no no no no no sometimes I hear [ __ ] with me are this scary [ __ ] [ __ ] I ain't doing this garbage no more and that's in the most recent content on his accounts at least as of the time of writing deals with him going back out there with fans and also a recording of his TV since apparently he made it on a show called right this minute definitely an awesome feed for something done primarily on tick tock you alright guys so here we need to run with two basic propositions as this stuff real or is it fake so let's assume like we always initially do that this is real Josh from start to finish claims that he believes that this is the work of the paranormal he mentions it numerous times throughout his videos and even on the right this minute interview that he did claimed that he thinks it's the work of ghosts to be honest I don't think that's the case here at all yes colonial cemetery is an extremely haunted one and has seen its fair share of paranormal activity but man Josh has seemed to gather a colossal amount of ghost footage from this haunting if this were truly the work of the paranormal then damn he's out done literally every single person in the world when it comes to content but I'll get more into that in a minute anyway I don't think it's ghosts I think it's people playing a prank on him right as the beginning of the series we meet a mysterious kid that refuses to show his face shortly after this we see him for a split second in another one of his videos and later on we hear voices footsteps and wall banging all typical methods for people that play pranks at nights hell when I was younger I loved pranking my friends these kids just might be a bit braver going out to this haunted cemetery at night to pick on the security guard and that's it they likely come back at night for fun and considering that it was summertime the dates would line up they're out of school they're bored and they're having some fun with it by picking on the cemetery security guard now if we go off the idea that this is fake then we can really pick some self apart first off like I said if this is paranormal activity going on here then josh has a metric fuckton of footage that dwarfs the ghost footage library of nearly anyone else in the world sure he could be pranked but what if I entertained the tiny little possibility that Josh knows the kids he seems like a pretty stand-up guy and potentially could be trying to make a series of his own in a format that not many have tapped into yet being tick-tock also the switch thing there is absolutely no way that the chapel doesn't have any light switches and I can absolutely guarantee you that somewhere in that building exists a switch to control the lights in that room whether or not he knows who's controlling it is debatable but that one tiny little detail really stuck out to me and I have a heavy suspicion that someone's behind it anyway there's no doubt that he is a real security guard though he's shown his weapons his car his light setup and even him going out to patrol various events in his videos what I think is happening is that he's having a bit of fun with heads through a day-in-the-life haunting series on tick-tock and Dan it's honestly pretty fun to watch weather security 1275 is showcasing a prank the paranormal or fictional webseries the authenticity and purity of the content is strikingly prevalent internet oddities on unorthodox social platforms are so so much fun to watch and dig into and I seriously commend Josh for making something that's creepy intriguing and surprisingly captivating real or fake I'll leave that up for you to decide but one thing's for certain I highly recommend that you keep tabs on the continuation of this series because who knows or other strange activity he might catch he seems to be extremely active on all his social accounts and regularly interacts with his fans so if you have any direct questions he'll most likely answer them all in all the series is still ongoing pretty quickly - by the time you see this there will likely be new developments into the story so for now that's where I'll leave you go check it out experience it and most importantly just have fun with it thanks so much for watching I'll see you in the next one I love you all and good night [Music]
