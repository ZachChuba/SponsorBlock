So are you happy now Finally happy now are you Well, i’m just the same I feel like i lost everything Everything comes and goes as they wish, even without a goodbye If this is how things are, I don’t want to love anyone again. I’m just going to take a trip down my old memory lane. Under the orange sun We dance together
Where there’re no shadows There is no promised breakup there See you in my memory that is beautiful Forever young Woo woo woo Woo woo woo woo Woo woo woo Woo woo woo woo Forever we young Woo woo woo Woo woo woo woo It is a nightmare, I don’t want to wake up forever Island yes this is an island a small island made by you and me Yeah um forever young forever is like a sandcastle Goodbye is like an emergency alert Wake up in the morning, longing for you I’ll pass through the infinite eternity To see you on the island again As someone once said to comfort me It’s not easy to forget even a handful of memories A long time has passed, but the island still holds on to me Under the orange sun We dance together 
Where there’re no shadows There is no promised goodbye there See you in my memory that is beautiful We pillow our heads on each other And talk about things that are not sad There is no gloomy ending there I’ll see you in the memory forever Forever young Woo woo woo Woo woo woo woo Woo woo woo Woo woo woo woo Forever we young Woo woo woo Woo woo woo woo It is a nightmare, I don’t want to wake up forever
