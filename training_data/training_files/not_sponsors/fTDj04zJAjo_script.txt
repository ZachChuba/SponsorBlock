to a warehouse Luke ambushes the wrecker and Danny and Jessica steal the crowbar from the wrecker but it is revealed that not only can the wrecker summon the crowbar with his mind like Thor does with his hammer the wrecker has also assembled a group of three super-powered criminals they are calling themselves the wrecking crew the first member of the group is someone who we will not name yet but eventually will be called Thunderball he is the strongest member of the crew he picks things up and throws them at Jessica the second member of the group is someone named piledriver he's the fastest member of the wrecking crew and he fights Luke Cage the third member of the wrecking crew is named bulldozer he is the least vulnerable member of the group he wears a helmet he's kind of like the junk or not bulldozer and the wrecker fight Danny and Wright as a group is almost lost Matt as daredevil shows up after a pep talk from stick turns off the lights in the warehouse saves the group and they retreat the team meets for the first time and talk there is friction between the members of the group Matt comes up with a plan Matt it's tear temple and Jessica go investigate the construction site Danny as iron fist and Luke hang out and Danny trains Luke in harnessing his Chi at the end of the episode Matt and Jessica make a discovery using that super hearing that there is a cave hidden under the instruction site where they find a bunch of ancient markings and a pair of safety glasses Jessica realizes that a prospective client is probably the Wreckers girlfriend and explains to the group who she believes the wrecker is he's a construction worker named Dirk Garthwaite Dirk went to prison but got out early and turned his life around Dirk got a job at a construction company which was bought by Alexandra bot and after seeing the harm she was doing to the community Dirk adopted the identity of the wrecker and vandalized bond construction sites he stumbled upon the magic crowbar was imbued with its powers and assembled the team with which he shared that power Jessica does not know the identity of the other members of the team after they learn about a wrecking crew attack that resulted in a casualty the team comes up with a plan to catch the wrecking crew Danny reveals his identity to the group and explains that he can get bought told a press conference that will attract the wrecking crew then the team can take them by surprise but a monkey wrenches throw into the plan when the morning of the press conference Jessica is arrested for trespassing let's do this it is the defenders rewrite episode 7 down with the king we are now in the third act the heroes have a plan everyone wakes up ready to go but Malcolm can't find Jessica misty calls the group and tells them Jessica's in jail and the team doesn't know what to do but they determined that they need her so Matt volunteers to go get Jessica out of jail everyone asks how Matt says I can do it can you get back before 10:00 I guess I don't have a choice then Luke Danny Colleen Claire and misty go to the site of the meeting and Matt as Matt Murdock goes and meets foggy at the police station where Jessica's being held they meet the cop that rested Jessica this probably can't be one of the main character cop some well-meaning but unknown character the cop is talking to Jessica Matt Murdock bursts into the room looks at Jessica and says Jessica Jones shut up I really wanted to keep that scene it's really fun in the comics the wording is a little different but I wanted this to be a nod to that conversation they had before Jessica hears his voice gives him a confused look and Matt knowingly nods at Jessica he says I'm her public and Jessica cuts in defender so she knows what's going on the cop leaves Matt and foggy go through the files Jessica looks at foggy questionably matt nods Jessica says so you yes but you're blind and yes I am Miss Jones foggy says and we need to know what they told you what evidence they have Jessica says hold on a second you are actually blind that's right now have they shown you any like can't see blind foggy says is there any other kind Matt okay I was in an accident as a child I have chemicals sprayed in my eyes and here we are Jessica says so are you like a ninja turtle or something what's Matt futs in Miss Jones we don't have much time I have somewhere to be and I think you do too cut to the rest of the team everyone's getting worried and Alexandra shows up she meets with Danny and Ward and Alexandra wants to give her talk now an hour earlier than they were planning Danny says I wasn't planning on doing this until 10:00 Alexandra says why the press is here now what are you waiting for back to the station mats reviewed the files and he has the arresting officer back in the room with Jessica and foggy so all you have is a woman who looks like Miss Jones at the scene well I mean Miss Jones is a public figure who wears apparently one outfit Hey she's a style icon foggy and sales of scarves and jackets have risen dramatically Miss Jones is a hero one who deserves support from police Matt last time I checked it wasn't illegal to wear a leather jacket and a scarf the police officer looks stunned Matt smiles cut - Alexandra is about to start the press conference Danny and Luke are worried Claire gets a call from Jessica they are on their way in the subway is the fastest way to get there Alexandra starts the press conference with Danny nothing happens no one's sure if this is a good or a bad thing they're not ready but also this was their best shot but then as expected the wrecking crew attacks Alexandra's guards get her to a safe place in the building the police tried to intervene but Thunderball keeps them in a distance Colleen breaks a way to keep Thunderball distracted the other three members of the wrecking crew follow Alexandra into the building now Luke gets into the building Danny slips into a closet in the building and comes out dressed as the iron fist so now the wrecker pile driver and bulldozer are going to fight Luke Cage and the iron fists inside this building which means this is your hallway fight but Luke and Danny are now working well together they have chemistry so maybe they can't beat these guys but they aren't getting beaten either they're holding their own which is the name of the game run down the clock until Matt and Jessica get there and they can get support Colleen and Misty work together to keep Thunderball busy outside your first big daughters of the Dragon team-up Matt and Jessica are trying to get over as quickly as possible they see a news report about the attack on those subway car TV screens that definitely don't play live news whatever we gotta build tension the wrecker leaves piledriver and bulldoze there to fight Luke and Iron Fist so that the wrecker can go straight for Alexandra now Danny and Luke need to stop those two but also they need to stop the wrecker so Danny volunteers to keep bulldozer and piledriver busy while Luke goes after the wrecker so here's Luke v wrecker round two and this is a little different to Danny's Chi training has taught Luke how to focus he's dodging the Wreckers attacks doing a way better job than the first time they met and danny is also doing okay against his - until he takes a big hit from bulldozer and loses his Chi Luke yells - Danny you all right I don't think I can do this for much longer and then Danny has an idea they're gonna get him Luke says him yeah we failed they're gonna kidnap him and use him as ransom kidnap who Danny Rand then Luke catches on Oh No where is he he's by the front door in the closet Luke and Danny raced to this closet and then the Wrecking Crew takes the bait and follows them Danny makes it to the closet finds his clothes Luke tries to hold all three members of the wrecking crew off by himself he's thrown through a wall wrecker gets to the closet opens it and finds Danny Rand Danny says it don't hurt me I'll get you what you want wrecker says oh yeah you will and then the record knocks Danny unconscious piledriver asks what about bond wrecker says we gotta get out of here before the other ones show up we got what we need live to fight another day and the Wrecking Crew escapes into the sewer or something I don't know somewhere where they can't be found Danny and Jessica finally get to the site they rush to Luke are you all right yeah I'm fine where's the kid they took him they captured the iron fist and Luke smiles no they captured Danny Rand end of episode seven so in episode seven our team has suffered a failure but they have grown together Jessica now trusts Matt Luke and Danny work together well and now with Danny secretly the iron
