[Hong Kong GGG Waiting Room.] Oh! She's dancing well! [The stylists leave while laughing lol] Hey, you should come and do this together with me! How come you're dancing over there? What should we do next? S S Start! I forgot. What's the next? How do you remember? Me? Because I'm the one who made the choreography and taught you. Do you like me? No way~ What's this song? No Way song? [YUJU's excellent lyrics writing skills haha] - This 'No Way' song..
- Do you like me? No way~ Do you love me? No way~ Do you like me? No way~ Do you love me? No way~ [Even doing the choreography lol] Don't you guys know the song, 'No Way'? How do I look? Just leave. For what you've done to me clearly.. - Clearly?
- You're gonna get what you deserve. I reckon it's not clearly but equally! You don't know the word, clearly? Clearly means like later, obviously and certainly. Don't you know the feeling of "I will keep an eye on you clearly?" When you use some words, they seem all wrong. Do you know why? Because you've always used wrong words. [YERIN haha] Hey! - You, come over here! Come here!
- Oh, I! I saw that. What did you see? Ah, I remembered something. Some weird things YERIN used to say What? What? What? The correct one to say is 'age meat richly' or something like that, you see? Do you know what YERIN said? She said 'age meat seriously'.. Seriously~ That's correct to say though. [YERIN who's always serious about meat.]
Ah, I guess they do that seriously~ It's just that compared to anyone else - I use more abundant expressions!
- Right, that doesn't mean you're wrong. It's just that she's a little special. You know the words that come to my mind are just... Unique unlike others. I really.. always say right things Everyone understands that, right? No? Nod, please! You all understand, don't you!? Then we're all good, right? She's taking a selfie in this kind of moment. I don't think there're any good pictures. They all came out really great!
