now if you're playing the movie on a telephone you will never in a trillion years experience the film you'll think you have experienced it but you'll be cheated it's a such a sadness that you think you've seen a film under California a frequent question I get asked when I take portraits of strangers is what's your Instagram not how can I see the photo or are you going to print this but a direct request or my Instagram handle I find this interesting because the question carries an implication that not only do I have an Instagram account and that the photo will be posted there but because Instagram has become a default for how we view photos so my relationship with Instagram is complicated on the one hand I think it's a great tool to have at our disposal it's fantastic to be able to reach hundreds thousands even millions of people to instantly showcase our latest work but on the other hand I do feel that Instagram has had some negative effects on the way at least I approach my photographic work my preferred way to see my work has always been large and imprint and maybe it's because my background is in print design or because I learn photography before digital as a thing if I didn't make prints on the enlarger in the darkroom my photo didn't exist at all I think the way that photographers choose how to present their work is an important part of the artwork it's part of the story in the concept a photograph is an artwork and its form is just as important as that of a sculpture or a painting and that's not to say they're existing small and in digital format on Instagram is wrong but there it should do so because that is how the artist intended it to be seen one of my favorite photographers Wolfgang tilman exhibits his work in a very distinctive way every exhibition he has is meticulously designed by him he creates a scale model of the space beforehand and carefully plans where each image should go he tapes large scale prints next to six by fours and pinned up torn out Maggie Dean spreads the features work the result of this is a removal of hierarchy everything is equal large commercial shoots are given the same value as small personal shots you can argue the presentation of his work has an egalitarian approach the unique way he arranges his images has become an experience in itself for the viewer as the viewer spends time looking a beautiful order starts to emerge from what first may seem like a chaotic disarray of photographs and prints you start to notice how multiple images line up and the viewer can follow their own path around the space forming their own narrative from the visual elements arranged before them you leave with your own visual essay a story you create from the path you choose much like one of those old multiple-choice adventure gamebooks one of the most highly regarded and seminal photographic publications of the 20th century is Robert Frank's the Americans a book containing a curated selection of 83 photographs that showcase a cross-section of culture from post-war America now while all these photos are great images they're not meant to be viewed in isolation the book is a collective a narrative piece and not necessarily a conventional linear narrative but a message that is told through a photographic essay the book is a journey of visual counterpoint commentary in juxtaposition sometimes photographs gain significance and meaning only when they're part of a wider story photography doesn't always stop a single image photographer Edward Burtynsky produces stunning photos of sweeping views of landscapes that have been altered by industry his work is shot on large format film and more recently a high-resolution digital medium format but to properly appreciate Burtynsky's work you need to see at large when exhibited his work is often printed up to 2 meters wide seeing the vast expanse of intense detail is an important part of understanding his work Tillman's journey of images frank's photographic essay and Burtynsky's detailed vistas cannot be experienced through instagram so what is my point here this is not meant as a of Instagram it's not really about Instagram at all it's about trying to encourage you to think about the many ways your photography could be experienced by an audience if you've never printed your work large I highly encourage you to try it if for no other reason than seeing all those details in print will help you understand your work much better Instagram is a fantastic tool at your disposal it empowers you to connect with potentially millions of people and instantly share your work with others but remember it is just a tool like the lenses you shoot with or the software you process your shots with in the same way you don't only shoe 2f 1.4 just because your lens can do that or you don't add lens flares into each of your shots simply because Photoshop has that function you shouldn't let Instagram be your last port of call in your image making process just because it's there tools are there to help us realize our creative vision not to define it maybe Instagram is the perfect vehicle for your work but maybe your work works better as a large print or as a collection of images making up a visual essay it's worth exploring your options for that final part of your photographic process try to think about how your audience could experience your work rather than just to see it so massive thank you to everyone who supports me on patreon you help keep this channel going if you want to sign up for that as a link below also
