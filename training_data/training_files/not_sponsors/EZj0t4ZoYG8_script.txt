maybe you've heard of Belle Delphine she's a lude cosplayer slash entrepreneurs slash Wang commander I know I know I'm hopping on trends but daddy's got to pay bills speaking of which of Belle Delphine says she's into baby daddy domination which I am too because sometimes I need to feel the helpless since safe listen up for a second I want to talk to you face-to-face right now things are getting out of hands more out of hand than your schlong during refractory cyber space used to be a place where you could post Pokemon rule 34 and talk about video games it still is that but times are a-changin with the explosion of social media over the last decade Internet addiction is becoming more and more prevalent the constant dopamine injections from shiny Instagram pics the constant information load shoved down your brain pipe and now there's even girls acting saucy on the internet I can't believe it America's Puritan ancestors did not build Elfi so what's the dealio yeah what is the dealio this IRL elf chick who likes octopuses and also men ages 40 to 50 but won't date them cuz they'll die too soon is quite something don't worry this is the story of an English lady converting the Internet's loneliness and Dilys frustration into cold throbbing cash of thought to recommit in so shamelessly that the neckbeards and girls you wish you knew in real life have really truly felt wrong it's a tragic thing a strange thing it's it's the story of how Bell Delphine conquered the Internet and may or may not have conquered your mind it's the story I'm gonna tell you today this story you never hey you're thirsty gamers I'm grants I'm selling the gamer got bathwater steeped in me life is hard but this will make it even harder let's get started [Music] there's a great deal of contention towards those who the internet perceives as thoughty2 hottie some people see them as exploiting your vices down there some just think they're doing what they love as a business others see them as empowering women by showing their bodies others still immerse themselves in these elude cosplayers to an obsessive degree thanks to dash lane for sponsoring this video now back to on June 16th 2019 bell delphine posted to her Instagram that she would be making an account on the hub of prawn and uploading hot videos there she promised the videos within 48 hours for two days teenagers and insoles everywhere stopped tenderizing their respective no-nose they wish to save their climax for an event which promised the release of a lifetime however on June 18th something terrible happened she did not post videos of herself getting it on like Donkey Kong a video titled Belle Delphine gets huge in [ __ ] was literally her squirting whipped cream into a tin and plopping it onto her face a video titled PewDiePie goes all the way inside Belle Delphine was simply her eating a printout of Beauty pine she didn't bang PewDiePie the chronically diddle is part of the Internet what's furious now naughty comments on that naughty web sites are usually gold but these ones were Gold's tainted by creepiness sends blueballed anger q Belle I forgot eight different pocket puppies ready for this and kill myself now it's all your fault you baby stand up I made this couch just to say screw you my disappointment is immeasurable and my days ruined you have five minutes to rectify the mistakes you've made before I'm a joke love you why is this so important to you you realize that just videos maybe this is a little obsessive a little unhealthy indeed there is a direct correlation between those who are really into lewd cosplayers and those who have no hole in which to bury their respective bones for the men and women you wish you knew whose balls are now blue this trolling hit them hard the people creating lewd content on social media are often referred to as thoughts thought is an acronym for that hoe over there I don't use that word but for context I'm simply referring to those who the Internet perceives as thoughts is being a thoughts really so easy is being a thoughts manipulative scroll through Instagram patreon or any platform that promises the potential to become self-employed doing what you love and you'll find an endless stream of people trying to make it big by being hot men and women and in-betweens it's the way of the worlds it always has been occasionally you'll have breakout successes that stand out above the rest but being a thoughts is weird thing like any form of business marketing is important and marketing is inherently deceptive with all the click bait I've used in my day I am absolutely guilty of being deceptive coke Cola does the same thing and so does Belle Delphine she originally got big and making a cow faces that's a facial expression from anime where someone is at the height of physical excitement for MU normies out there indeed miss Delphine will dress up as either an anime character in elf or something nerdy that would reach deep into your imagination and then explode a Holy Hand Grenade of big nuts energy that's the marketing trick of every linguine lingerie knee cosplayer who's ever succeeded Mike Pisano's they hit you deep with the characters of your dreams and tie a string around your nether so you'll give the money is it manipulative absolutely is it immoral what are morals we covered five nights at freddy's for years I hate preaching a while ago I made the conscious personal decision to unfollow every lewd model and sexy cosplayer on social media I realized that by choosing to allow these people to inundated agrammatism I'm not sharing this story as some small-minded attempt to destroy the followings of these people but rather to share my perspective on how consuming too much sexy content affected me and maybe affecting you there I would be going about my business feeling normal and just not thinking about where to stash my nuts but all of a sudden BAM some chick in a pokeball bra and red thong that I followed would appear before me caught two at precisely calculated ankles with the facial expression that would imply she gave a fudge about me or something this is the lure by which hot artsy girls try to get my money through my little buddy although I never paid money to any of these women I did give them my attention and that makes all the difference but there are people who do give them money lots and lots of money for an attempt to fill a hole of some sorts pun intended selling bathwater may be a funny meme but it's also filthy I mean literally it's fell Delphine's human filth we all share one type of water a day it just makes this to use the same water humans are gross the words I drink her bathwater may or may not have slipped my lips once or twice or five times right before I blacked out a bar but honestly if presented with said bathwater I probably wouldn't do it therefore we can surmise that the audience that would buy that bathwater and they did it's God now is a little further down the rabbit hole than your average Twitter peeper no shame though Ubu every time you see someone physically attractive sending you attention part of your brain lights up and maybe some other stuff happens too it affects your state of mind it affects who you are in that moment everything a Ludi model does at least the successful ones is about presenting themselves as an unattainable attractive person who's also maybe into you it's different than if you just saw some hot girl or guy in a bikini at the beach minding their own business pretty eyes staring into a camera with a flick of the eyebrows in the booty sway are all things women I've actually sucked the life out of in real life relationships have done to me except instead of a camera lens it was directed towards my eyeballs subtle movements and expressions that successful Noddy cosplayers nailed perfectly all tap into subconscious signaling that tells your brain a you but remember they don't care about you okay that that's a way too harsh I mean they don't care about you nearly as much as that look would mean in a real actual social situation no doubt most of these cosplayers would want you to live your best life what I mean is they don't know you about a year ago I got out of a two-year relationship it ended amicably but it did end during that time it was a real-life human relationship where two people loved each other there were those moments that nobody planned where one person would look at the other and give that hey you look I'm not very good at the look okay the difference between this and a hot model looking into your eyes is there's actually meaning behind the look when someone you care about looks at you like that it makes you feel good in a way that makes your soul feel good and maybe probably you're ridiculous too when a saucy cosplayer does it it makes your downstairs feel something if you think it makes your soul feel something too then that I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you probably feel it very lonely I don't say this to be me but rather that you can make your life what you want to you got this homie don't get honeypotted it's not real models barely clothed cosplayers Ryan are all literally eye candy at least how they present themselves on the Internet they're people however mouth candy is something made to keep you addicted to the mouth pleasure it gives you a Snickers bar has been carefully crafted by a large corporation to make you always want more they aren't feeling like actual food is feeling even though their marketing implies otherwise they aren't good for you either yet if I spent one year salary on a lifetime supply of them Snickers would appreciate me for being their best customers see what I mean Snickers aren't inherently bad but they aren't the foundation of a good diet likewise dental workers aren't bad but if they're a substantial part of your mental and erotic diet your life will probably suffer all of this brings us back to Belle Delphine in many ways she cast decided to everything I said about tantalizing cosplayers cheap doesn't try to craft her entire online persona as something believable that's why she posted to her Instagram that the top comment will get a video of her eating their profile pic that's why she did a prawn Hub prank that's why she has a four-minute video of her befriended a dead octopus it's why she literally sells bathwater she's steeped herself in she does things for the meme and doesn't try to pass herself off as genuinely into these things clearly it's in act yet in many ways she does exactly what every naughty cosplayer does that's why she'll post a video to Instagram doing a dirty tease wearing cat ears saying which one of you gamer boy wants to play with me heart implying she would ever spend a second with your neckbeard but unless you saw her at a panel or something but that's different that's why she wore cat ears a different time bit her lip ran her hand over her bearded clam with the caption what would you do if I came back home and you got me me Abed I'm not gonna British accents implying that she would ever present herself specifically for you she will never do that in a million trillion years she knows this most people who follow her logically know this but the reason it works is because some way deep in the minds of her hardcore followers is a voice that takes this fantasy a little too seriously who do you think is paying her 20 plus dollars a month on Instagram what demographic is filling her bank account I'll give you a hint it's bipedal Homo sapiens who need a few too many Snickers bars in their life ones that would drink bathwater with human skin in it to feel a little more connected to another person the more lonely you are the more likely you are to misinterpret any cosplayers body appeal as something more than arts you can pay for if you want all social connotations aside Bell is a lady doing her thing and it's working take away societal norms indoctrinated morality selfish views on your lonely bone and what you're left with is a woman doing exactly what your mom does going to work and bringing home the bread she's just getting more of it a lot more perhaps one day she should open a bakery and sell her buns Delphine doesn't deserve any hate for that she's not the problem the problem is having problems that might make you think she's a problem and I like less than half of the office well as you deserve a revelation I know but there's even more a deeper L pool to plunge our minds into look at this video that I did such a fantastic job of recreating earlier at first glance it's just a hot girl doing the thing but look Delphine dolphin dolphin dolphin Delphine dolphin dolphin could it be that Belle Delphine is actually a dolphin at first glance I thought this was ridiculous but upon watching the h3h3 podcast Papa Ethan asked miss Delphine to fart into a jar and to send it to him she responded with this and then by the way she said Belle dolphin this is big news people if you've watched our recent videos you know that I have been on a spiritual journey to spread the word of the dolphin tribe Ryan only recently saw the light and many of you in the comments and on Twitter understand the peace of mind and feeling of empowerment that comes from swimming with our aquatic brethren through hyperspace perhaps you think this is ridiculous but I'm here to tell you it's not two moons ago I picked up a book from a controversial bookstore that changed my mind forever it was written in the early 90s by a lesbian who could truly channel the tribal I don't know if it's derogatory to point out she's lesbian but I thought it was funny she wanted us to know if straight white guy wrote a book on stay up collecting he'd be hilarious too in Chapter five tuning into dolphins and whales the author makes perfectly clear some people believe that certain dolphins have shape-shifted changed form through the ages and visited humans as famous illumined personages such as Jesus and Buddha supposedly dolphins have been guiding our evolution here on Terra Terra being earth of course indeed dolphins have come to humanity in the form of messiahs for millennium is it possible there's a new dolphin Messiah among us one that commands attention with fitori and drags the insults of the internet by their loins don't be in insult be a dolphin a dolphine get that money pour bath water down your booty for bus get that money pee pee in a jar get that money poopie in a bag get that funny sell it for a thousand bucks you're worth it you know it you're a beautiful individual your body and waist deserve to be celebrated there's no shame in making those dollars slap on that lingerie and those snapchat stickers this is the message of a dolphin's Messiah make that money really though Mel Delphine is all about business when she looks into the camera or just looks hot in general and pretend she wants her gamer fuel it's just business it's just getting that money if you can barely afford to pay rent don't squander your paycheck on an act if you've got the money support who you want to support just remember these sexy cosplayers are like Snickers bars eat too many and you might end up fat and lonely with tooth decay and Edie be aware of what's in undated your feed may do to you be aware of what it does to your mind namely making you think more with your dick than your heart or better yet make your own Snickers bar to satisfy that hunger because you know what they say never get high on your own supply become your own act let this Dolphin Messiah guide you to your personal fortune make that money don't hurt yourself don't hurt others instead follow the Galactic tribe to your own treasure be the thought you are on the inside and get paid just look at Ryan he gets paid don't wouldn't you rather be compensated than be compensating are we all not
