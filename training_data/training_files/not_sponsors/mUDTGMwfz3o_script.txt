online store make your next move with Squarespace if you want to become a full-time portrait photographer one of the jobs that you can pick up in the quiet months is corporate headshot photography that's not the most glamorous sort of photography I mean normally when I do a headshot or portrait session I have at least an hour with one person where they can get comfortable I've got time to coach them towards a good look and feeling more comfortable and I can do different things with lights they can change outfits and hairstyles and the rest of it and we can be guaranteed we're gonna get something great by the end of it but in corporate headshot photography sometimes I've had to get through 70 people in two hours that just isn't the time for that so I've come up with a bit of a system that works for me where I can bring people in shoot with them and get them out the room and get good shots consistently throughout a shoot all in 90 seconds to two minutes per person it's not the only way to do things I'm sure you have different techniques that you use but hopefully looking at the way I do stuff there might be some tips in what I do that you can add to your own way of doing things and it can lift your game as well the whole thing with corporate headshot photography is the balance between being very very efficient but also keeping the consistency of your shots up so let me show you the setup [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so let me talk you through the setup we'll start with this background light here which is facing onto the white paper the reason I'm gonna show you white paper is because in my experience it's just the most common background that most corporates want they do clean white websites it just works with most this stuff they do but it's a great idea to ask the company before you agree to do headshots what kind of background they want I've had some companies want gray and some want black and some one big color of the company so just work with them and find out what they want but this is the most popular solution I found plus it's the most tricky because you've got a balanced exposure on that background light as well so this light here is going to sit behind the subjects if I'm the subject here you can see it's over my shoulder and it's facing up onto that paper and that's going to provide that pop of white in the background I'm using a white paper roll just because I hired a studio space to show you this stuff today but other options are if they have a pure white clean wall in the office that's big enough you might be able to get away with using the wall in a pinch otherwise I've got a backdrop which is like a 1.5 by 2 meter which you can flip out and hang on a stand I've used that before I've often got companies to buy their own paper rolls if I shoot with them regularly they keep them in the storeroom and I just pull it out every time I get there and it's saved me having to try and find a way to get there in a taxi because it's it's quite big and the other option is you could actually put up a big soft box behind the subject and have them stand in front of a big okto or a big square softbox or something and that gives you your solid white background but we'll get the exposure in a minute my key light which is here is off 45 degrees 45 above to the left and we'll tweak that a little bit later I'll show you how this light is just a Bowens I think it's a 400 is what I'm using they've gone out of business there's loads of similar lights let's just look it up online and I'm using a soft lighter so 1 meter soft lighter because it's a really versatile useful modifier it's so easy to pack away it's very light in this super cheap if anything goes wrong with them as well and it gives a nice softbox style light so if I move around here you can see what it is is it's just an umbrella that the light shoots into and then comes back out through this diffusion material and if I light myself here you can see that's giving me quite a nice side light on the face I've then got a reflector sitting off to my right here which is going to be used because when this pop of light is coming here the shadows on this side of the face might be too dark all I need to do is bring this reflector in closer or further away to fill a little bit on the site and then the last light is this little light up in the corner which is another Byrnes 400 which I've got going through a Pixar prose strip box okay strip box because it's going to give me a nice even distribution all along the back of my head down my shoulders on my back not that I'm shooting that far down and the grid because it's going to keep the light channel this way and not flare into the lens and I've got a sheet of diffusion in this that's softening it up as well so that's my basic setup with just my key light here with a soft lighter my reflector which I can bring in closer to fill shadows on this side my strip box are back for a little bit of a rim light and one light behind me which is going to pop on that white background and blow it to white so in terms of camera I'm on my 5d mark ii Canon which is a full-frame DSLR with the 85mm F 1.4 Prime on it 85 is a great focal length the portraits on full frame because it compresses a background gives you less to deal with and also make sure there's no distortion in the face and I already know exactly what my settings need to be and I'll give you those in a second this on the top here is a little trigger you get loads of different sorts of these this is a little one by county Met it's a fairly generic one and for those of you are terrified by flash it's very very simple this trigger talks to the trigger there which is attached to that backlight which is lighting up the background because it's gonna be the brightest light in the room so this tells that to fire when I hit the button and then because the other two lights are set so that when they see a flash in the room they also fire when this triggers that these two fire at the same time because they see that flash now I already know what my settings need to be I am on ISO 100 no choice so on the image as clean as possible so keep my ISO as low as possible that's already set I know I want to be at f/4 at 85 mil because the whole face will focus but by the back of the head it's going to start to go soft which I quite like the look of I know the loads of people who won't like that you'll want to shoot deep and have everything sharp that's absolutely fine if a client asked me for that that's how I viewed it but if it's left to me I kind of like the the slightly shallower depth of field as no it's not very shallow it's just a little bit and I'm on one over 125th of a second into as much shutter speed and I don't have an option for that because if I'm hand-holding I want to make sure that the shutter speed is fast enough that I don't get any shake and the basic rule is that you should always be shooting one over whatever your focal length is or faster so with an 85 minutes should be one over 185th of a second or faster than that I've got a lot of latitude here I've actually got image stabilization on this lens plus with strobe it's very very forgiving but just to make sure the image is sharp that's what I want to sit but I can't go faster than one 125th of a second either because I know this camera and over one sixtieth of a second the camera starts to lose flash sync and if you want to Google that you can have a look it's it's a very technical thing about how front and rear curtains work when the shutter opens and whether that's seen with how fast the light is being delivered by the flash but just to give you an example if I take a photograph of this light here at the back and at the settings that I've just mentioned to you it's going to be overexposed at this point but just to just to show you what's happening you can see light through the whole image but if I take my shutter speed up to four hundredths of a second and take the same photo again you can see on the image it's starting to fill up with black from the bottom and going up if I go to one eight hundredths of a second the whole screen is almost full up with black now so that is flash sync I need to for this camera stay at one 125th of a second to be safe 1 6 1 over 160 I've found on this camera it just starts to get slightly dark at the bottom a little bit of fringing I know that 1 over 125 is gonna be safe so if I have my settings in the camera the way that I need them and I know I can't change them I'm going to set my light so that it complements and exposes correctly for those settings but I also need another way to be able to dial the exposure down if I need to someone will might come in with a very bright top and the next person might come with a very dark top and I need to balance the exposure to make sure that this consistency throughout so I need a fourth way to play with exposure and I use a variable ND filter and this will screw on the front of the lens and basically I can use it to start to cut some of the light out you can see if you twist it can you see that it cuts the lighter it doesn't change the color or mess with anything it's not like sunglasses it's proper ND filter glass which means that it's just stopping down the light and by twisting it I can pull the light back or push it forward again depending on where it needs to be without messing with the settings that I know I need to keep [Music] so all the lights are in place settings are in the camera I know I'm not changing them it's going to be this little ND filter tweaks just to get the light where I need it to be now I need to set the light so that they're balanced with each other and and with the settings I've got so I've got Andrei normally if I'm doing a big shoot I have someone along to help me out it just helps so much having somebody here so you can use them to set the lights instead of making the poor first person who comes in be the person has to stand through all this stuff while you're sort of dialing everything in Andres a great photographer as well I'll stick you the link below and you can check out his stuff so he's gonna stand there and make faces and I'm just gonna get these lights going so what I probably want to do first is actually turn everything off except this background light so the front two lights are off and I'm just going to take a shot with that background light and I want to see basically a clean silhouette as far as possible so taking a test shot and I have got a clean silhouette on that but it's too dark I need these blinking black highlights and I've got them set up on my camera to fill all the way around so I need to turn this background light up to let me guess around I'm going to take it I'm gonna take it quite high there to just offer full power and I'm gonna test again and okay that's good there is a clean silhouette all the way around I'm a little worried what happens is if you push the light too hard you don't get as clean an edge because the light actually starts to come and wrap back around and you lose your clean edge so I'm going to back this up just a touch and just to get that clean line on the silhouette so probably a better half okay and one more okay and that looks good to me so I've got a nice clean silhouette nice hard line all the way around so I'm going to set my key light next so turn my key light on and let's just take a shot I don't even know what the setting is let's just see where it's at and I can dial it in from there not a light meter guy as you can tell so that is looking okay it's just too hot on the side of its face so I need to back this light down a little bit I'm going to take it down to well this is you know between 1 & 6 is sort of what burns gives you as a as a scale so that's back down from 5 to 4 and that now is looking good I like that that's exposure is good on the left-hand side of the face it's starting to look a little bit shadowy so I can bring in my reflector now and basically what I need is is the light to be bouncing off this and just filling a little bit on that side of the face can you kind of see there's a good angle from where you are that light kind of bouncing off turn a little bit yeah there we go okay good so that should give me now just a little bit of fill on that opposite side okay that's great I like that it's not too much I still want shape I don't want to fill the whole face I still want the shape but it is just filling in a bit of those shadows and I could bring it even closer if I wanted to fill them a bit more last light I can put on is this backlight and turn this on it's at the moment it's about three let's just guess and see how we do with three see where it is and all this is going to do is just give a little separation on the opposite sides of the key light so that's the key light 180 degrees right the way across is that RIM light just on that back side for the hair there on the chin and the jawline so that will give me just a nice little highlight on the opposite side and I like it quite subtle so we've got a nice kind of Rembrandt feel which works really well especially for guys and you got a nice little kick of light on the back what I'm gonna get Aundre to do now is just tape by your feet they're just tape a line across just so people can stand behind that tape okay so this is gonna mark the point exactly where they need to be standing it's easy when people walk into the room I'd have to take time just go stand behind that tape is very very easy to do so exactly just shuffle a little bit this way for me not too much come back a bit back a bit back a bit back a bit back of it that's perfect right there's good okay now this is a little trick I used to get different sorts of lighting for different people without having to move lights around so just tape just by your left foot there just on the inside of your left foot there just put a little bit of tape facing sort of towards the backdrop there yeah yep that's great okay good so I've got him to put a little line on the floor and that's what I'm gonna position people if I want this Rembrandt look but sometimes that kind of shy we look on the one side doesn't suit some people I know women especially don't really like it they like are more flattering to the overhead light so I'm gonna get you shuffle this way a little bit just a little bit that's great and now the pole is gonna come into play here just a little bit back that's good right there but obviously it's very very easy to take out and post okay that's good and just a mark just almost right by the end of that piece of tape there and because I've got these two marks I know that when people come in I can shuffle guys a little bit more this way if I want to give a bit more mood to the face or I can take people a little bit more this way if I want us to have a nice more flattering overhead light and some people suit different sorts of lights but in the middle of the shoot I can't go rearranging lights for different sorts of people and this is a way just with a little move can change the lighting quite dramatically a good little test to do before you start shooting just to make sure that none of this ambient light is actually getting in on the shot is if you just take the trigger off the camera so now you're not triggering the lights anymore and just take a normal shot the screen should be entirely black because without these lights that means that none of these lights are actually affecting the shot that these settings they're not bright enough to to affect the exposure at all so we are only dealing with a strobe so it's a good thing to know that you're not mixing ambient and strobe and you're not because the lights can change with ambient with stuff coming through windows it's a great thing to check the only other thing to do before we start shooting is just to get a gray card shot I'll do an editing video as well so showing you how a process through these images but having this great card shot really helps the camera is already set on the correct white balance so it's not that much of a problem but just to be super safe and to fine tune that last little bit I'm just going to Andrei to hold that great card in front of his face take a shot so I've got that there so now I've got that gray card shot and now I can get the correct white balance at the end the only other things to say is I'm not shooting portraits I'm shooting landscape and the reason for that is that I want to use all the real estate top-to-bottom to fill the sensor but I also want all the shoulders in the shot at all times and the reason for that is I want three clean edges on my shot because when I blown everything to white designers love that means they can extend these images any way they want they could make banners out of them anything else as long as they've got three clean edges and I'm not cutting off shoulders at any point so that time choosing to compose and for focusing I'm sent to focus in recomposing and that means I've turned all the focus sensors off on the camera and just got the center one working and basically what I'll do is I'll focus on the nearest eye to camera and half press and then I recompose the shot where I want it to be and take the shot so that's taking that center point putting it on that nearest eye half pressing to to get it to focus recomposing the shots and then taking the shot the rest of the way when someone walks in the room I want to get them positioned as quickly as possible get them to loosen up and just relax cup it so you're just gonna hop in find the blue line there and you're gonna face this way face towards me you're gonna direct people's body position a lot in two minutes and I found the easiest way to do this is to get them to mirror your movements good all right so it's probably easiest if you're gonna mirror me so just gonna take a little shuffle backwards that's great toes behind the line that's cool and follow me is gonna shuffle a little touch this way that's great perfect where you are in terms of body position I want to make sure they have a straight spine their shoulders are level and flat that their right foot is slightly forward so their body is pivoted just towards the light a little bit and the front shoulder is just dipped down a touch so sound it like whole body straight let knee straight everything sits straighten that okay now you gonna take a little turn this way towards the light okay and you're gonna use this leg to lean on okay so you're gonna kind of lean a little bit forward on on that like it's you like that leg better yeah okay okay and you're just gonna lean into the shot a little bit so it's just about like lengthening your neck a little bit so don't don't everyone tell us - how'd you tell them to do that so all you're gonna do is just drop this front shoulder and just pull pull the head forward so as if there's like a string on the point so not too much pack it up I'm scared that's good that's great good exactly we are okay in terms of head position I'm watching the chin and making sure it's not pointed towards the floor pointed up at the ceiling that the eye level is straight to camera and that their head is level and straight shut up just attacks like you did it that's great stay there and down a little here all right good you will get some people who blink a lot either naturally or because they're anticipating the shot when they hear the focus beep what I do is get them to set the position close their eyes and count down from 3 to 1 and as they open their eyes I wait for their eyes to go from wide when they first open them to just settled and I snap that moment okay so I'm getting a lot with you blinking so what we're gonna do stay with stay we're stay we were good I'm gonna close it you could get you to close your eyes I'm gonna count three two one and you're gonna open them and look straight into the lens okay so keep that expression your mind if you want something slightly how the expression really goes open your eyes look straight in the lens okay close your eyes and three two one that's great and again close your eyes three two one that's great unless the company is specified I encourage people to give me a selection of serious looks and lights a happier looks I think it's important that head shots should still have some personality in them okay relaxed so basically I'm going to take a few shots and you are going to give me a few different expressions you can do some serious ones you can have some lighter ones because I'm going to give you the camera and you're going to choose which one you like the best so you're just giving yourself choice basically at the end of the day that's what you're doing okay are you ready great get in quick it's good okay so try it try a few that's lovely it's good I let people choose their head shots I don't choose for them I used to I used to kind of get home and take pride in picking the best shot and editing it up and sending it through but I had them sent back too many times because people weren't happy with it or they want to see all the rest to see if there was a better one because they don't trust it or don't like the way they look and all the insecurities start coming up and then you end up doing multiple edits on people these aren't shots you're gonna want in your portfolio they're just head shots and giving people the power to choose which shots they can take home actually makes them feel a lot more comfortable as well so I'd encourage you give them the choice and there's a few ways you can do that one way might be to tether if the shoot is slower paced and I've got the space I can bring a computer and set it up with Lightroom tether straight into the computer and then I can get them to sift through the shots afterwards on a nice big screen and we can zoom in and make the Select right there and I know exactly what I'm editing otherwise sometimes I'll have my camera over on a shoot if it's a smaller space and I need to move faster and I get them to dial through I'll take them to the first shot and then I'll get them to dial through their shots to have a look and I just encourage them don't overthink this just go with your gut which is the shot you want to take home and when they make this select that's the one I'm going to edit and then they take a piece of paper they'll write their full name on the piece of paper plus the number of the shot and then they're gonna hold it up sort of mug shot style and the last I'll take is I'm holding with their full name and the number of the shopmen edit so in lightroom is really easy to see that's the one that i need to look for and plus I can then label the files as well when I send them back with the person's full name as well which is nice the other way you could do it is to actually create contact sheets in Photoshop of all the shots you took and then send them to the company for them to send around and people can make their selects but unfortunately turnaround the time on that is often huge especially if you've shot 70 to 100 people in a day to send something round so everyone can make a choice you might be waiting for weeks so I suggest finding the best way for you to do that but I've encouraged you let people choose the shot they want you to edit so hopefully that's helped this definitely isn't the only way to do it but hopefully by me sharing some of the ways that I do things you might have picked up some tips you can add to the way you do stuff and hopefully it speeds things up remember just keeping that balance between being really really efficient on the day but also being aware of quality being able to just make little moves and adjustments that make a big difference and it keeps the quality high
