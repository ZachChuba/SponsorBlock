this video is sponsored by brilliant pavel Matuszak is a scientist at the Rutherford Appleton lab in the UK his research has led to something that can be called Superman vision and in the next few years might change the way that you fly well not not like that if you've flown on a plane in the past few years then you know that you're not allowed to bring any liquid container greater than 100 millilitres in volume in your hand luggage the reason that we're not allowed to do so is of course to prevent liquid bombs and similar threats to the safety of the plane so for the hundred milliliter restriction to be lifted airport security would need to be able to rapidly accurately screen liquids without opening the containers therein and this is actually now possible thanks to a new technology developed by Pavel and his colleagues it's already being used in airports around the world to screen large containers like baby milk and medicine and it works using something called spatially offset Raman spectroscopy the Raman spectroscopy is a technique which enables you to identify the chemical composition of an object by simply shining laser light onto it and looking at the illuminated part or its vicinity and looking at photons which change colour so by shining a laser of a known wavelength of light on a subject you will get some light reflected back with different wavelengths most of the light will be elastically scattered or Rayleigh scattered back meaning that it will have the same wavelength as it did when it left the laser but some of the reflective light will have different wavelengths this is known as inelastic scattering coincidentally also what a group of cats do when you surprise them the idea of Raman spectroscopy is that these changes in wavelength between the incoming and reflected light are caused by the molecules in the target substance shifting energy levels in response to laser light by energy level I mean the rate at which the individual molecules vibrate and rotate which is dependent on what they're made of molecules are raised from their initial ro vibronic state incidentally an amazing word to a virtual excited RO vibronic state when they absorb a photon of laser light when a molecule emits a photon which we detect as the reflected light they descend to another different state the difference in energy between the initial and final ro vibronic states is the same as the difference in energy between the incident from the laser and the photon emitted by the molecule because the energy of each row vibronic state depends on the structure of the molecule what it's made of the changes in wavelength of laser light reflected off a material are specific to that material the changes in wavelength are like a fingerprint uniquely identifying a particular substance if you perform Raman spectroscopy on some unknown sample you could identify what it was made of by comparing its fingerprints to a known database of other substances this is how Raman spectroscopy works normally if you were to identify a powder or a friend that you haven't seen in years something without a container but in order for scanning technology to be usable in airports it's got to be able to see through containers and that is Superman vision ability to probe deep inside these objects was advanced at this facility in my research with my colleagues where we learned that simply by illuminating an object at one point and collecting signals several millimeters let's say one centimeter away you can see better deeper lying components or objects taking that second measurement is key because the photons of laser light don't just reflect off the surface of the container they migrate deeper into its contents spreading downwards and away from the laser the photon still interact with the molecules of the containers contents raising their row vibronic States and making them emit photons with different wavelengths when they jump back down these emitted photons are also detected at the surface but the signal from the containers contents is very weak compared to all the photons being emitted by the container if you look at the point illuminated by the laser and that one would be blinded by the surface signal and typically be blind to the chemical signatures hidden in it from subsurface layers or from the content however if you take a second measurement say a centimeter away then you pick up a much weaker signal from the container and so a relatively much stronger signal from the contents of the container but you still have two signals two fingerprints overlapping one another one from the container and one its contents so you use the first measurements to define a fingerprint for the container and subtract that from the second measurements to isolate the fingerprint of the contents the larger the spacial offset the separation between illumination and collection point the higher the likelihood with photons penetrating deeper so by varying this separation you can control from which depth statistically photons originate therefore what's the signature they convey whether this this is a surface of a container or content so with this technique you're able to see into a container and within reason determine what the contents are at an arbitrary depth beneath the surface I've compared it to Superman vision in this video because I'm a massive nerd but Pavel has another amazing and equally geeky comparison the critically that also tricorder but not you know with the same capability but getting close to it because we can also diagnose disease we are using exactly the same technique to diagnose the presence or absence of breast cancer all presence of bone disease non-invasively so if you've ever wondered why big expensive research facilities exist or how they benefit your life just remember you may soon be able to fly with more than hobbit-sized supplies of toiletries and if you get sick while traveling Star Trek level technology held in the palm of your hand yes this is an actual product developed by Pavel spin-off company may help to diagnose you and this is all possible because of laser
