hello everyone we are now in February and if you are already feeling behind on your organization system for 2019 I'm here for you I believe and this is the motor of my year that if you want to achieve things in life you need to start simple and you need to go back to basics to achieve the perfect balance of what you need to be productive and organized this is why we are going to start with a free full organization system that will absolutely help you get your life together and have everything seamlessly organized into one eco system so today we are going to talk of course about the Google Apps for productivity and organization basically this means that the Google ecosystem includes the calendar file managing email managing with productivity tools text editors and a note-taking app regarding the pros and cons of the Google ecosystem I will start by saying that it's free so as long as you have a compatible device and internet connection and Google products aren't blocked in your country you are able to access Google Apps also there's synchronization between all the devices you use to access the same account and you have the ability to sign-in into your organization system in any computer or device there's also constant backing up of your information so you'll never be afraid of losing anything so there are simple tools that make your organization system that much easier to use and to manage for cons we can also take simplicity because it can be a burden for some users who prefer complex tools to organize their lives and also the digital environment may not be very convenient or the best start for some people I myself use a hybrid of an analogue and a digital system and there are some tasks that I prefer to do on papers if that's your case I need prefer to do all of your organization in paper that's just fine also you mostly need an internet connection so if you live in an area where that's hard to come by you might have a lot of trouble making the most out of this ecosystem to build a family of our organization system we are going to start with Google key and I believe that Google key is one of the most underrated organization apps out there yes we'll keep is a very simple app but it's really powerful because its simplicity is transported to other types of cool apps like calendar and Gmail but we will talk about that later so for now what you need to know is that Google keep acts as a dashboard where you can place post-it notes with all kinds of to use of notes and reminders so in your main dashboard you can see these little notes that you can call code and then click and drag according to your own priorities your Araki and even if you want you can simply establish blocks of color so you can see how many tasks you have according to the topic you chose for each color the best way to organize your notes with Google keep is basically establishing a color for each kind of topic you are choosing for each node so for instance here I have yellow for every YouTube related task and I have blue for every school related task White's tasks are personal tasks including things like personal to do's appointments financial stuff and so on the second thing you can do to really organize your notes is using labels these act as tags so you can simply create a notes assign it a color and then choose a label according to the topic of the notes so you can select the label on the left side of your screen to access all notes labeled with that name also as I said before you can click and drag every single note so you can have the order of notes that you prefer to get yourself organized also since it's a Google product you can also download Google keep to your phone so it synchronizes with everything you do on your computer when you migrate all of your to use all of your notes all of your project notes into Google key you can definitely go to Google Calendar and start managing your time your appointments and your tasks my basic tip for Google Calendar to work is creating a calendar for each categorized sort of information you are trying to place your calendar so for instance in my particular case I use for instance write for family sharing tasks and appointments I use purple for my history classes I use orange for any YouTube related stuff this is a really good way for you to understand which parts of your week are allotted to certain parts of your life and so on the second tip I can give for Google Calendar users is using the upper part of your calendar to schedule daily tasks instead of hourly events so even if you're using a calendar blocking technique to manage your time in your digital calendar sometimes your events do not occur hourly but instead they occur on a daily basis this happens mostly with holidays birthdays and things like that so what I do in these cases is creating that event then assign it to one of those specific color-coded calendars and then drag the event up to the top of my calendar where it will be considered a daily event that I do not need to assign an hour for the event to be completed or finished also will calendar has a function of syncing with all of your devices and also inviting it also allows you to invite people to share your calendar this is really good for things like house work your business team work or even scheduling meeting hours with book clubs work groups and so on the power of your Google ecosystem really shows up here when you access the tools in the right tab in the right side you have these little applets that you can access to open up different google apps that can synchronize and can be used with your Google Calendar so for instance we have already set up all of our tasks in Google keep and by clicking the respective button on your Google app you can access all those tasks so you can better understand by looking at those tasks those color-coded knows how you need to schedule your time better what type of to use you need to integrate into your calendar what kind of goals you need to project in your schedule and so on also if you set reminders both in your Google Calendar and in your Google keep apps you can also get on track with your tasks and with your advance by being smart with how you establish those alarms to go off in your phone after that I think it's time for you to manage all of your files with Google Drive if you'll basically be the only file manager you need in case you have a permanent internet connection so Google Drive is free until 15 gigs which may definitely not be enough for you to keep all of your files but 100 gigs goes for less than $2 per month and if you're a student that's what you'll need in case you deal with PDF and text documents mostly just like any file manager on your computer Google drives allows you to create folders and organize them according to name and color so you can basically create a full-fledged file managing system online that's why you never fear losing your files since Google Drive backs up your documents to the cloud so they're always there even if your computer crashes there's nothing really special about Google Drive in itself it's a very simple and powerful tool for you to organize all of your files and being sure that that can be accessed anywhere if you cannot rely on a specific device to do all of your work you also have sharing capabilities with other users and the good thing is you do not need to share your whole files with your friends and family because you can select the specific folders or files you want to share also the good thing is that when you are storing documents in Google Drive if they are text-based documents you can quickly open them up in Google Docs and edit them on the go and Google Docs is actually pretty powerful text editor although it's not as powerful as Microsoft Word but it definitely has the tools you need including a commenting interface as well as sharing capabilities that make it a solid text editor in case you need something a little bit more structured than Google keep it also has constant clock backup so you'll never worry about losing your files and although the tools are nothing too elaborate they will make the job just fine finally I want to talk about Gmail and I'm not going to talk about Gmail in itself as a mailing service in comparison to other mailing services but I want to talk about the organization tools inside Gmail that make it the perfect tool for you to organize your mail if you are into the Google ecosystem so the first thing I love about Gmail is the ability to color code and label my emails effectively just like I do with my calendars I have very specific labels in my Gmail things like answered not answered sponsorship inquiry blog posts any school related emails and so on and every time I get an email I will automatically label it according to one of those things and I will just label off those unanswered or an opened emails with that label so I know I need to get back to them as soon as I can the second thing I enjoy about Gmail is that integration with other Google Apps like calendar you'll keep and tasks so basically you can open that type on the right side of your screen and Gmail lets you pick into those apps and use them side-by-side to interconnect all information from that same account this really comes in handy if for some instance you are using your Gmail to schedule a meeting and you need to access your calendar instead of having to access the calendar in another tab or even in another device if you prefer it that way you can simply open the calendar tab inside your Gmail accounts and see if you have a free slot of time to schedule that meeting and just type your mail right on the go the third thing I really enjoy about Gmail is the ability to have different inboxes so for instance I a ton of social emails arriving every single day to my inbox people who are messaging me on social media emails that are getting to my YouTube account things related to my Instagram people replying to blog posts on my website and so on and usually those emails are not a priority for me to answer so they're all filtered into the social inbox so I can get to them when I can get to them instead of having to constantly see my main inbox being floated with promotional emails with forum responses with social reminders and so on
