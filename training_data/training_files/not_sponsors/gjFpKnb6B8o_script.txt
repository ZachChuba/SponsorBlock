coming up on this next intersection this car is in front of me maybe the light will turn green it is green now so now I'm let's see what happens the cars in front of me it has turned green the limit line is green as well well the proceed it is proceeding all right there we go that's awesome proceeding without having me to confirm with the stock or the pedal once a car is in front of me and before the actual intersection very nice alright guys we're back latest update is 20-20-20 4.6.1 this is a pretty substantial update pretty big update in terms of the amount of features based on vehicle configuration and based on location okay I'm gonna go through the ones that we have and got in our car based on our location and configuration but then I'll also talk about the other ones for other types of cars model threes model wise in different countries such as China and see what they got as well alright so let's jump right into it starting first and foremost they have a new update to traffic light and stop sign control or traffic light awareness as I like to call it this new feature just basically allows a little bit more permission a little bit more permission to be able to have the car go through an intersection with a green light without confirmation as long as a car is in front of your car okay the actual release notes read the traffic light stop sign control feature no longer requires explicit driver confirmation of pulling the autopilot stock to continue straight through an intersection for green traffic lights when there is a lead vehicle ahead of you an autopilot is confident that you are not in a turn only lane the stop line in the driving visualization will now turn green to indicate that the car will continue through an intersection coming up on another intersection no car in front of me again it was just my luck using the stop to confirm I want to go through the limit line should also show green as you see it coming up here showing green which means it's going to proceed through with the green light and that works as expected pedestrians are coming through slowing down for pedestrians my distance my follow distance is set to 1 on autopilot / adaptive cruise control but the autopilot stopping for pedestrians happens a lot sooner than 1 so that's a good thing stops wait for in advance now a car is proceeding I'm not doing anything here and now it's gonna proceed because the cars in front of me the limit line is green next one I'm gonna acknowledge see what happens here it's gonna be a red light so doesn't matter making the turn nice and easy like we like it very good so a car has to be in front of you they're taking baby steps with this one but it's still good nonetheless step in the right direction to be able to go through if a car is in front of you they can go to the green light and it will show the green limit line to further reinforce that it sees the green line and it's gonna proceed through the intersection again green line here goes through no additional confirmation needed so that's very good if they can adjust the speed limit just by 5 or 10 miles an hour that would make this much more usable in normal conditions because as you see them going the speed limit but the car in front of me is going much faster the cars behind me are going much faster and they're right on me but it should prompt me right about here there we go into stopping for the traffic control stopping for a red light against look celebrating a little too fast for my comfort my taste but it is slowing down nonetheless to a complete stop limit line is red now from a standstill now it's green turning green now and now it's proceeding I don't have to do anything it's proceeding because the car was in front of me even though the car turned the next light that's coming up it's asking me to do something that I couldn't write quite see it asking me to confirm so a little conflicting with the signals here because it's asking me to confirm but it's also saying it's stopping so kind of difficult to see it kind of wants to override the programming of waiting for someone to confirm versus just proceeding to stop or proceeding to go through the light without the software based parameters that it's bound by okay so no car in front of me right now lights gonna turn green limit line will turn green as well and then I can proceed bicycles pedestrians all in here I'm gonna use the stock to confirm I want to go through because I'm too far from the nearest car and now I'm going right through coming up to this next intersection animations are still there nothing's different there but coming up on this next intersection this car is in front of me maybe the light will turn green it is green now so now I'm let's see what happens the car is in front of me it has turned green the limit line is green as well will it proceed it is proceeding all right there we go that's awesome proceeding without having me to confirm with the stock or the pedal once a car is in front of me and before the actual intersection very nice the other improvement here is the backup camera improvements and the back up camera improvements here just now leverage the side repeaters to help with visibility with the backup camera okay you can now view video streams coming from your side repeaters and cameras for added visibility around the vehicle when your vehicle is in Reverse swipe to display the repeater cameras video feed or simply tap the application launcher all right we got the back of camera it's in Reverse I've darkened the the visuals a little bit just so it's not blown out because at the time of day it is but I'm going to show you what this looks like you can swipe down a press and now these two side repeater feeds come up for you the video may come off as a little pinkish or reddish that's not what it actually looks like it's a lot more natural not as as blowing out in terms of pinks and saturation it's just the camera doing this thing but it shows you the two feeds here you can't enlarge it you can't swap them like you could in a dashcam view or sentry mode viewer it's just allowing you to be able to see in this little screen here now this only works for the backup camera view so the model s and X they have backup camera view that's split with the proximity sensors as well and in this view that's where they're showing you the repeaters if you're trying to just use the backup camera by itself you won't be able to do that you have to enable it to this view and then be able to toggle it on if you want to use it based on the app otherwise the car will need to be in Reverse I'm gonna shift down a reverse and go at the park this is great it'll be able to show you exactly what the repeaters see and it provides an extra layer of visibility the problem is these are kind of small for this particular screen it's kind of small makes it a little bit difficult to see everything that's going on right here does give you a good sense of it so I'm not too mad about that I'm thinking the use case here if you have things obstructing your rear-view mirror you would use these if you have things you know potentially obstructing or people that are obstructing you your ability to see the side mirrors then you would use this view to help you back out so on and so forth what we would ideally want to have is you want to have some sensors some alerts some cross traffic alerts when you back out to be able to show you exactly what's going on behind you and give you an alert and notify you if an oncoming car is coming that's ideally what we want here but this is a good step in the right direction so definitely good to see them using this these new functionality using the cameras for multiple purposes other than just recording videos but also to aid the driver one thing to note again as you drive if you want to have this up while you drive you have to be in this mode so you can't split it with media or anything else and you always have to have these sensors up so if you use the app you'll do what I said before use the app here camera you put it in this mode that's if you want to drive with this view up so you can see what's happening to the left and right of you on the highway potentially if you want to be able to see what's in the left lane and be able to make a safer lane change so this is a really good feature however it does require you to have this bottom space occupied okay otherwise good job Tesla on this we also have dashcam improvements specifically for sentry mode to make sentry mode videos easier to review we've added a red dot along the video scrubber to indicate the moment when a sentry mode event was triggered okay so this is great because it allows you to stop having to scrub through the entire video looking for what triggered the sentry mode event all right so we got the sentry mode player up or the the dashcam viewer up in sentry mode view in terms of viewing the Sentry mode only clips we see our red dot here the instance where a sentry mode event occurred and if we click on it we'll be able to see exactly what triggered it build a look at the cameras obviously there's one to the left someone walking their dog were they close to the car not sure why we'll jump back to the front see what's going on here and there he is again taking a look at the car all right there we go Wow boom so this makes it a lot easier to find exactly where the instance that the central event occurred as opposed to having to scrub through the entire clip so good job on that one Tesla tune in improvements they've made an update to the tune in app in general I'll just give that disclaimer upfront but they say with this update we've improved the usability and discoverability of tuning stations in podcasts so that's easier to browse content we've also added the ability to adjust playback speed of podcast up to 2x alright guys we got the tuning up here checking out the tuning features again a whole new application really they've changed the icon here it's a different icon different logo to represent a new app and new features ok everything else is pretty much the same with the only difference here is now you have that playback speed that 2x playback speed that you can toggle between 1 1 and a quarter at 1.5 and 2x for playback speed as well and it looks like they've also changed up you know the way the podcasts are displayed making a little bit easier to find things as well as if you want to search for things as well so that's tuned in pretty straightforward update all right last feature on our list we're not gonna do the language obviously because we don't speak Portuguese here but we'll take a look at the vehicle and we'll look at the the walk away door locks to be able to see what that looks like and that's showing us that hey walk away door locks has the ability to exclude home which allows you to be able to again not have your car lock at home and therefore won't necessarily have to keep unlocking every time you walk by with the key fob so again good if you're in a garage I can close space or close property we have to worry about anyone being close to your car so keep that in mind all right so one other undocumented feature here that we've noticed is that now with this latest update when you're a check for a software update it tells the date of when this checks for the latest update so sometimes the car might check and it might not be really checking this is verifying that it's checking right now at this particular date and time to let you know that I should check for the latest updates that's pretty cool okay guys so these are the updates that we received however they're a bunch of other updates that you would have gotten depending on your configuration and depending on your location so one of the updates is range display it says your car will now display slightly higher range that more accurately reflects capacity of the battery this presumably is going to be new Model S's annexes as well as the model threes and model wise driving visualization improvements for China specifically is the additional objects that are gonna be displayed in the driving visualization which includes stop signs stop lights and select road markings so this is now China just being able to catch up after whatever regulatory approvals were necessary for Tesla to be able to clear it in China so these things that we had in the u.s. already China is now getting them so congrats to China next there's the super charger improvements for Model S and X select versions of them based on the battery and since your car is now able to charge at v3 superchargers at up to 225 kilowatt peak rates as usual when using navigation super charge your car will precondition the battery to make it easier for you to truck to charge as fast as possible at the supercharger so select battery and select Model S and X cars presumably the newer ones with the newer newest battery tech and the newest motors are the ones that are going to be the ones that are going to have this level of capability alright in Korea they have paper used super charging is now active okay the release supports paper used super charging and the charging rates are indicative of whatever charging rates there are there again this is something that's been the same for the US but now just adding it for other countries alright and then also now for select vehicles probably newer vehicles probably specifically model threes and model wise and even maybe the essence in X's the new ones the Ravens if you will your vehicle will now precondition the battery when navigating to a third party fast charging station in addition to super charger so typically what happens is when you put in a destination as a super charger in the car the car will automatically pre-canned the battery this is now saying that's gonna do that for any other designated or mapped fast charger that's going to now cause the car to precondition the battery for that one as well again giving you the best possibility to get the highest rate of charge possible and get out there as quick as possible and most importantly for the Model 3 and model wise specifically and that is the enabling of the internal camera the internal camera that sits just above the rear view mirror is now going to be activated and will activate itself and turn on and record a clip and some stills in the event of an accident okay so you can't access it any other way through the cars interface not do the cameras not do sentry mode or dash cam or anything like that but just in the event of accident that's being detected in the car the car will automatically turn it on or record I should say what's happening obviously this is gonna have this is gonna tap into the data and privacy policy of Tesla for you to turn this on or to activate this which means that Tesla can always have this camera on seeing what you're doing in the car so be mindful of that and use it at your discretion but by doing so you may have an opportunity to get some insight and some information as to what the driver was doing or what someone else was doing in the car at the time of an accident so it might be valuable for insurance purposes or just for safety purposes to make sure that you you have a good claim on what happened inside your car in the event of an accident okay so those are the other updates that we received again across the globe just depending on your vehicle configuration and depending on your region alright so that wraps it up for this update huge update let me know in the comments what you think about this update what features you've got which features you thought you should have gotten but you didn't but again this is for all cars depending on your car configuration and depending on your location that's going to determine which features you've got okay until the next time enjoy your day enjoy your test
