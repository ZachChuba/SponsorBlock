intel's tenth generation core i9 processors are launching right now so we need to update y'all on the changes to their high-end desktop product line up their massive price cuts and their performance improvements but by setting the NDA lift to midnight the day before AMD's intel has forced us to also tackle another subject in today's video just how low their cowardly pathetic weasely behavior has sunk man i hate reading sponsor spots when I'm like mad glasswire I don't mean to take this out on you with glasswire you can detect malware and block the idly behaving apps on your PC or Android device use off for code blindness and get 25% off glassware at the link below okay back to Intel now what could you have possibly been thinking that we wouldn't catch on that tech reviewers have never seen this bull before that the enthusiast and gaming communities are just stupid gee and tell i wonder why your embargo lift is mere hours before everyone knows because they announced it publicly that AMD will be unveiling their new third-generation red ripper processors make sure you our video about that could it be maybe because you're just so excited to get your hot new hardware in the hands of your valued customers or could it be because you know that even after slashing your prices as much as 50% on your rehashed hardware you've still got nothing and you'll grasp at any desperate strategy to avoid any direct comparisons against your competitors product I mean the worst part of all of this is that everyone that I have ever met on the enthusiast and the gaming teams that Intel is a good person one with more than enough common sense to know that this was going to backfire King immediately and what that means to me is that the only possible explanation for this is that some bonehead exec with no actual clue about the real world and how it works who ignored those good people's excellent advice then laid down the law and went ahead with this plan to launch first by a matter of hours why so that the launch day reviews which tend to get referenced by buyers over the entire product lifecycle couldn't contain direct comparisons to something you were afraid was going to be better you are a weasel and you are a chicken you seek to misrepresent the strength of your products to consumers weasel and you seek to duck away from a fight rather than take the criticism that you know you deserve chicken I hope you get fired because there are people with more integrity serving lunch in your cafeteria and maybe they could use a raise they certainly wouldn't have handled this any worse than you did LTT Starcom by the way if you also need a drink let's talk about the product now that is core Intel's new cascade Lake X is in fact a skylake X refresh same basic core design same cache layout same process node same number of course but there are a number of tweaks under the hood the memory controller has gotten a nice bump in both max capacity and default speed and we also get an extra four PCI Express Lanes I'll be it still running at Gen 3 speeds unlike AMD's latest CPUs which are running at gen for the turbo frequency on this SKU Intel opted to provide only one chip from their entire new lineup it's a nice bump to 4.6 gigahertz and turbo boost max actually boosts it even higher on up to 4 cores now the base clock is the same as last gen though so it's clear that they aren't expecting people to run these with an all core overclock without incredible cooling what's truly new this generation is what Intel is calling deep learning boost which is to say that avx-512 has been expanded with the new vector neural network instruction extension the extremely high level explanation for what this does is it accelerates repeated multiplication of numbers that happens to be quite common in convolutional neural network processing anyone who's using these types of workloads should therefore get a pretty decent performance boost but unfortunately that is currently a little bit out of our wheelhouse to verify alright and there's also some mystery meat mitigations for Intel's latest round of security vulnerabilities the price drops those look pretty good at least the gangsta Intel's own lineup we are now getting 18 cores for what used to be the price of just 10 but AMD's recently launched risin 939 50 X 16 core for 750 dollars not to mention the design a cheaper motherboard makes that feel more like a defensive reaction than an earnest effort to just bring more value to the consumer out of the goodness of Intel's heart which brings us to performance testing then we've gone with high-speed ddr4 3,600 memory for all the benches that support it and we've got the highest end consumer chips being tested along with our h EDT ones and here we go Oh whoo oh dear it's a really good thing Intel decided to drop their pricing because it looks to us at least like their 10th tenth it's may actually have worse performance compared to last gen in some scenarios in spite of their higher boost clocks we reached out to Intel about this and they said yes the 1098 exe numbers that you have are in fact accurate but your 99 80 XE numbers are higher than expected we're not really sure what that means but we retested a bunch of times and consistently got these results on what is quite literally the same motherboard with the same bios settings and operating system so our best guess is that the new hardware vulnerability fixes are taking a toll here until wouldn't confirm that but come on Linus it's half the price the last 10 right oh yeah it is but like even compared to AMD's 250 dollar cheaper raisa 939 50x the kora 9 10 9 8 exe isn't doing so hot in most of these tests and that is in spite of its 2 core advantage now some of the shorter or more lightly threaded workloads where Intel can really flex their clocks be an advantage those look all right but once that boost window expires the advantage moves clearly to team red the mozilla firefox' compile test is a great example of this where we actually saved over a minute and 30 seconds on Rison versus the new core I nine in fact Intel pulls off a convincing win in exactly one scenario spec workstations energy test summary then a good job I guess at least in terms of productivity now for gaming no h EDT processor is truly ideal but the 10 9 8 exe refreshingly manages to pull off better performance than its predecessor here and AMD's gaming king but 3950 X also couldn't stand up to it only the core I 999 hundred KS pulls off a substantial lead from the rest of the pack so I mean that's not that terrible but it's also not what most people would buy the cpu for so thermals and power are an interesting thing to measure on the 10 9 8 exe at face value you might think it's as simple as having a base clock of 3 gigahertz and a boost of 4.6 but in reality there's actually far more going on here so just have a look at this mess of ATX offsets and perk or boost clocks in fact what Intel doesn't tell you on the box is that the all core boost frequencies are actually the same between the 10 9 8 exe and its predecessor you tested this for ourselves while we were trying to wrap our heads around the results from earlier and yep higher lightly threaded boost in the setup phase of this blender render then identical all core boosts through the rest of the test notice by the way how the 99a DXE manages to catch up somewhat by the end of the test despite its slower start this seems to support our Hardware mitigation handicap hypothesis as for power consumption we got this very bizarre reading and moderate core temperatures with our corsair h 115 ia IO water cooler which suggests that the CPU would actually very much like to possess a higher base clock but to hit their TDP targets Intel didn't give it one I mean at least you might find a little bit of overclocking Headroom on this thing as long as you've got strong custom water cooling to be clear though I've been really harsh today but a lot of that was being mad about the chicken way that Intel handled this lunch I mean this is not a bad product it doesn't make your cat sick or randomly shout insults at birley men who pass you on the sidewalk and or whatever it's just clearly the result of far too much beating of far too many dead horses this is the end of the line for X 299 I mean Zen - based mainstream chips are challenging Intel's best of the best and Intel didn't even have the stones to go up against the thread Ripper chips that are also launching today so that should give you some idea how that's gonna go and so with that in mind the conclusion is this tension isn't awful but what it is is still very expensive and a dead-end platform with nowhere to go for upgrades so it is clear that Intel needs to have a much more compelling response to Zen 3 when that launches which will be in the first half of 2020 if AMD is to be believed now then what do you guys waiting for
