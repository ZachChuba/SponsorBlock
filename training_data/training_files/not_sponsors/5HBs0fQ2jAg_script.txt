phones ringing it's on to your answer I think it's for you don't you agree though that the RPG should be done speak to this man see what he says hello I'd like you to think about nerve from the RPG slightly more than you have cuz you'll be doing to be honest I don't think is listening i wide your neck in hi everyone hope you're doing well today we're taking a look at the Odin in Call of Duty warzone I've had so many people asking me to start using this and make a video on it so I've leveled it up recently and I have to say that it is a bit of a monster that we call can be hard to control but if you get a nice firing position and keep a low profile you can chunk enemies with this thing and this is how I've got mine set up of basically maxed range and accuracy so I've got that ridiculous Colossus suppressor on there 8 10 millimeter barrel 5 MW laser VLK 3 tons optics so I can shoot people at range and the Ranger foregrip keep in mind that you only get 20 shots with this build but the damage and accuracy is so high that you can drop multiple opponents in that many bullets just try and throw a couple of headshots in there too also mobility is very low so you will run slow but it's good to pair with an MP 7 or an mp5 if you need to push or someone gets up close to you and so I've got a couple of awesome matches for you now using this setup which we'll get into next playing with Tommy and part take a deeper look at that later on enjoy was a very hot drop the dead are the nose breaker you love to see it okay at the top of the ladder run oh is it she liked to lay the distraction with the drain I'll distract it well Adam you guys know this sneaky way up there oh dude push to make comment my mother liquor how dare you that was so rude it's all apples in the

quite like it the damage at range is just ridiculous I would like to try and get a solo win with it though so watch out for that in the future but it does work really nice in squads for it's picking people off at range and I hope that you enjoyed those games I don't think it would replace the m4 of the ground for me at the moment though good stuff so I three months for free with that said I hope you liked this one guys have you tried out the Odin doesn't anyone run it as their main gun and just dominate people let me know below if you enjoyed you in the next one
