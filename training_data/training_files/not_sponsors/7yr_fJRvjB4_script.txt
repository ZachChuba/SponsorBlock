what is it oh dude come on stop playing around you got to come take a look at this oh that's not good welcome to day 2 of the VR for build and this is actually the build part the hard part yes yes so in the last episode we drove the car at the Wardrobe fine it's a little bouncy oh but it's not gonna be good enough to drive 2,000 miles one of the most grueling realities in the world and these cars weren't exactly known for their reliability so we got a bunch of parts and it's gonna be interesting they're trying to install them actually before we do any of that it is extremely hot I'm just going to turn this on this doesn't look sketchy at all okay that should move some air that sounds pretty bad we have everything so the first thing we have is a set of side mount aftermarket inner coolers and they're bigger than what we have stock actually don't know what we have stock I believe it's like plastic and some really really small course now what they do is these cool the air the air charge because when they go through the turbos the air is quite hot it gets compressed and then it has to go into the engine and engines don't like really hot air so these are very very thick boys but they're supposed to fit in the stock mounting locations and they're supposed to fit with all the stock pipes but coming around here is the main focus of what I want to do today and that is cooling so I suppose about interviewers and the important job to do but maybe a more important job is keeping the engine cool and we have a bigger aluminum radiator and we have grab what I need for the car that I need don't have to mix it right here we have some really good brake upgrades we have Karbala tech XP eight pads and if you can see right here it says pre bed basically whenever you get rotors and pads you have to bed them in it's like a marrying process and you have to go up to a certain speed brake down to a certain speed and then do that over and over that process is not exactly the best especially because we're in the middle of a city so these came free bed and I have to do anything and we also have these stop tech rotors we're going to be doing a lot of braking so I figured we might as well get everything brand new now coming down here we also have some new radiator hoses and then we have a complete exhaust this was just an aftermarket exhaust I got off eBay it should make the car sound a little better and perform a little better because turbo cars perform well a lot better with a bigger exhaust I believe this is three inch or four inch this is the maybe pile because I actually know what the history of this car is and it's only had 5,000 miles since I've sold it last so I got an oil pump I got a timing belt kit I got a bunch of OAM Mitsubishi parts I have any time I go from here gasps it's the timing belt adjuster and I have a full gasket set and I got Puccini we might not be installing this stuff if we look at the car and determine that the car is perfectly fine as it is oh that I think tires we can't forget the tires forget the tires so these are my favorite tires the world these are Michelin Pilot Sport flores's and these aren't in the same size that I have a car to 6535 18 and these are going to be what an upgrade from the all season mismatched dry rotted disgusting tires that I bought used five years ago most importantly they're forward the same yes yes they're for the same times a number have permission match tires we gotta get the car in gear and see what's underneath because I actually have never had the car on the lift and I'm a little scared of what's gonna be under there but it's only our week-long vacation and trip on the line that can't be bad [Music] Oh Oh what is it oh dude come on stop playing around you got to come take a look at this oh that's not good we're flaking a little bit mm-hmm unfortunately that's not the worst part now we've got a small transmission leak which is not terrible but she is leaking some that is a universal boot that they put on top of the factory boot when it split and it's leaking grease and actually rubbing a little bit what's that golden nugget doing someone at some point decided this would make a good lift point quick tech tip you don't want to lift your car by an oil pan what do you think it's pushed it up a little bit there's heavy rust in it and they then tried to fix the small hole with some type of solder ideally we would go ahead and pull weld and repair but unfortunately all of our bolts that secure the old pan have substantial rust and the block is substantially rusted we run into the situation that attempting to remove this old pan will very likely result in a lot of broken bolts yes and put us in a situation that it is impossible to get the car ready for the rally and yeah we need to tap and we just don't have the tools or anything to do that what we're gonna end up doing is kind of a temporary patch repair where we'll straighten the pan as much as we can with it on the car scrape all the rust off and actually use some epoxy to build a little bit better patch the oil pan I'm probably gonna get a bigger oil pan maybe an aluminum one because these you can't get any more and the used ones are gonna have the same issues as this but other than that mechanically she actually is is sound the ball joints the rest of the suspension is got rust it's not perfect but it's serviceable the exhaust looks yeah the the exhaust is special we kind of choked down here a little bit to this nice flex section and we step back up here to this T it is separated and leaking at the top there the o2 sensor was just kind of cross threaded sideways and it's perfect okay absolutely perfect you have to figure out how to do the wrong thing the right way which you shouldn't always do but it's something that if you're ever stuck and decided taking a car on a rally with four days time to prepare yeah the how to best fix the worst situation why don't we just take our time and just do it good right that's all the time I can usually get off yes to come down and help you guys don't want you her to go right hashtag don't go [Music] [Music] so it's almost time to start putting new stuff on the car it's exciting it is so we got our old exhaust here and it's looking really old and our new exhaust right next to it this is not quite a hundred percent stock 3000gt exhaust it's been patched together with different segments the whole front segment is kind of wrong this was where both your turbo down pipes it goes under the engine to the turbos through the catalytic converter through our Vice broken section what's interesting is that there's only one muffler in the star so it comes in to the muffler does some magic some of it goes out and then the rest of it is asked to go to the other side yeah another small muffler this is trickery this is not actually a dual exhaust it's not very good for flow it's not very good for sound now we have this I bought this on eBay it was the cheapest one I could get but it has a one into two and this is more of it's not true duals obviously right but it's more I think it's more flow friendly [Music] [Applause] [Music] so let's talk about cooling this rally that this car is going on is gonna be from Santa Fe New Mexico to San Francisco California and it's likely going to be through the hottest parts of the country in the middle of summer and I can't risk this car overheating so we're gonna do is we're gonna overhaul the entire cooling system now the water pump in that car is likely okay it's not due for a service I did do it 5,000 miles ago and they're good for around 60,000 miles but the rest of the cooling system that does need to be changed especially the coolant and as I so go check it out [Music] are you crossing things out I am yeah they got something done we we got a lot done and that's because it's the next day it is our last day before we turn into pumpkins and we have to go do the rally but here's what we did and we marked off a bunch of stuff on the list and let's just go over what we did first thing first take a look at that exhaust dude I took the silencers out we don't want a silent car he also did the brakes so we have the stop tech rotors we have the carbo tech pads and those are the front you can see the brand new pads right there and I had a heck of a time fitting these new inner coolers and they look great I really like the fitment of the inner core's themselves the piping however was a different story the piping was a well it was a nightmare because these cars especially the 99s they had a different emission system than the 91 so even the 98 the charcoal canister down here it was in a different place in the earlier cars and that meant that it had different intercooler piping and the CX racing intercoolers that we have they were built for the earlier cars obviously they're not gonna build a part just for a car that they only build 200 and something of so we had to be creative I had to make my own piping we took one of their pipes and we just cut it down and we relocated the oil cooler a little bit further back we just put it on one bolt back there and we made a few modifications cut off some brackets and whatnot but everything is on there hopefully it should not boost leak and take a look at the difference so this is that stock and then that is the big boy right here so this should make sure that we don't heat soak at least not as fast also this radiator was a little bit of a pain to deal with because since it's bigger than the stock radiator didn't fit 100% we actually had to knock this back a little bit and the radiator is actually sitting on this radiator support I wanted to make sure that it didn't chafe on anything so we just took a little piece of vacuum hose cut it in half and that is the buffer between this metal and that metal in addition we had to you definitely can't see it here we have to grind some nubs down there were some pro true ting bolts you definitely have to grind those down or else your brand-new radiator is gonna have some brand new holes in it we haven't put coolant in it yet and we haven't put the intake pipe in yet because we ran into our problem with the wave yes okay the fake KS blow-off valve yeah and yeah let's take a look at that we got a snout off the valve seat kept falling off yeah and the problem with this car since it's a mass air car every time that's unseated its sucking in unmetered air and then when you come on to boost its not seating so you have a giant boost leak so you're sucking in air when you're not supposed to and you're leaking there yeah when you don't want to so for those of you who don't know what this thing is this is a blow-off valve basically when the car makes a boost boost goes in here and then it goes into the engine however when you close the throttle it shuts all that boost into this pipe and then that goes basically back into the turbos unless you have one of these and this is a blow-off valve and that opens up under vacuum like that it lets all that boost pressure out and it makes a cool little - noise however this one yeah that that insert is what makes the whistle yeah the whistle however this is not a real HKS as far as I know this looks like Chinese pop metal and you can tell that the casting is just garbage so this basically came apart and we bought a new one and it's on its way from Amazon hopefully it'll get here in time and if not then we'll have to kind of deal with that Chinese one I really don't want to though I also don't want pieces from that falling into the engine potentially so it's a Mitsubishi can eat all the plastic that that is that is very true that's the opposite of true so in addition to that we did the trans fluid we did the diff fluid the transfer case fluid and we bled the brakes we also did a little bit of weight reduction right here is well this is a it's an interesting piece because the clutch pedal this car actually has a booster like you'd see on a brake so it has a power clutch which I've never seen in any car but the the clutch I've noticed is very very hard to press I guess I'll just deal with that but this is a reservoir so this makes sure that the booster still has pressure after you turn off the car however if you look over here you can see that there is a quite a big crack in this plastic reservoir so this thing is junk this thing is not doing anything and all we did was we removed it that's a little bit of weight that's going in the garbage it also blocked your intercooler it also blocked my intercooler and it probably gave me a vacuum or post leak so yeah found a lot of those well you missed all the other fun here that we did - good night all the vacuum lines and by fun I mean absolute misery ok previous owner had had it plumbs one of the previous owners probably the fifth owner ago right is that that would be you let me does that mean we found the boost control solenoid was connected to the exhaust gas recirculation valves and exhaust gas recirculation valves are on the boost bow before you get to technologically advanced for us here here is the vacuum routing I don't know if you guys can decipher that that is seriously complicated especially for a car in the 90s they should a color coded this or made like a B C that would have been nice but everything is just black and it just kind of goes everywhere so that's what we had to deal with and kind of reengineer because some of this stuff just wasn't even working right yeah nothing was there so it's now plumbed right we got the radiator hoses the thermostat yeah you also do the thermostat thermostat is actually underneath here it's right there it's actually not that hard to get to did the fuel filter as well fuel filter down there we have the K&N filter that was actually spotless so that saved us 10 minutes but yeah and it's when you're trying to do all of this is substantial yes and we also got a new battery over there because the old battery it turned on the car just fine but it was leaking at the top and at the side it was ballooning out a little bit and once that starts to out gas that means that battery is no good you don't want to put any charge into there because that thing might explode now I think we should probably check if our timing belt is okay so the way you can check there's uh there's a cam cover right here and you can just inspect the timing belt it shouldn't I I mean I put this in around four years ago right and it's only done 5,000 miles so I don't I don't think it should be like in horrible shape we should be 100% in its service life but this is the chance that things could be horribly wrong uh there's actually no wear marks or anything you can actually look it's not a lot of times you see small separation they're gonna be looking for a cracks or something like that right yeah you'll see small cracks if you ever see cracks on the backside of your belt change it immediately this I mean it's supple it turns actually that there's there's some pretty okay attention here a lot of these cars they have they get very loose because it's a weird setup with the tensioner the tensioner actually needs oil pressure and then when you don't have the car on for a while it basically loses all that tension yeah the belt on this side is just a little loose and that is normal on this car so that's one important thing with this this motor and similar motors for Mitsubishi is if it's been sitting a long time do not push starting because you'll probably run the risk of jumping a tooth if you're towing it don't have it in gear because the car is going to jaw so back and forth and again loose oil pressure it can jump timing and you know that very well don't you yeah fun fact I had this car shipped from my house and then they had it on a regular shipping trailer and then when it got to his destination it wouldn't start because it skipped timing and I believe that it's because they had the car in gear and then when the truck was moving around it might have just shifted something and skipped its scripted - thankfully nothing in the engine was harmed and it ran perfectly fine and it runs perfectly fine now but we're good with the maintenance it will definitely make it another 2,000 miles I don't think it should be a problem at all right now we need to get everything back together in the car that that feels good right now we're just putting everything back getting the wheels on tires on and then it's gonna be first start [Music] [Music] all right moment of truth this is the first startup after our sort of 24-hour restoration it's been like only a day it's the first day of just getting the bar over here through yesterday a little bit today and this is the real first yeah this is the actual first start this isn't this isn't like Discovery Channel's first started yeah are you nervous on a scale of 1 to 10 how nervous are you Oh she runs she lives does she leak I don't think so I hear some more of the exhaust we'll rub that up after gets up the temperature but what we're going to do now is we are going to burp the coolant actually can you put the AC yeah it's on yeah yeah the heat all the way up so we can burp the coolant system then all we have to do is recharge the AC then she should be good to go this is sounding pretty good all right [Music] yeah sounds so much better it's gonna come on excited I'm excited yeah you got all-wheel-drive [Music] we're on the road and it feels pretty good it feels it feels really good it feels way more sorted the idol is better the power is better long I mean we just drove it down the street but it's coming from a stop the suspension definitely needs work we actually don't know what the wiring is so that hasn't been done yet these roads in Dallas yeah they're not good they're not good the Dallas roads are okay just tells bushland it still over boosting a little bit so we have to figure that out because it picks up speed pretty good but I just don't want it to explode the engine but that's all we do is shakedown run all right so we push this cutback do good job and I think we have our official response vehicle team and we got a got a drone okay so here is where the car used to be and there is where the car is now and I have my friends here and they're gonna be helping along friends you have names don't you Palin and Stephen from yes I know 0-2 awesome and now they are 0-2 awesome detailing is that is that just your chopper today we'll see these guys are actually very responsible for me getting my Murcielago they were the originators of my trailer that I ended up weaving okay well it's it's it's in California I'm sure it's still there it's probably gonna be in the next Fast and Furious movie we just took this thing on its first run and we learned a lot of things number one it still beeps for the overboost but we're not actually going past 14 psi it's actually fine I'm it might just be that the system thinks we're going more than we need to and that's okay we can be faster in this car another thing is I overfilled the coolant over here this is the expansion tank and that just well it just peed all over the front which is not a big deal we're just gonna have to take out some of the coolant the reason why I overfilled it is just because there is no real marking as to where full is but everything else seems very very fine other than that suspension and the reason why I haven't connected the suspension yet is because these wires are different colors but we're gonna figure that out in a second but I love how this car is handling and looking and actually speaking of looking this car looks really really dirty and that's the reason why those guys are here because for the last part of this video we're gonna completely overhaul the look of this car this is gonna look amazing [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh my gosh you guys this is this is my car this is the car I fell in love with all those years ago and this is the car I wanted to build all those years ago it's it's not a hundred percent it's not perfect but I like it like that I love that this car has been lived in has been driven it looks fantastic and I can't thank the guys that's there too awesome enough they did an awesome job Jared you have been busting your butt just working on this thing we got this done in a little over 24 hours this was a day just just one day of wrenching I'm really glad zero awesome came by because I don't enjoy that side and they did yeah they did mean they came in this is one of the best looking cars I have ever seen and I'm glad I'm proud to own it and I'm proud that my friend helped me along with this this is a ton of fun but actually we got a little bit more done off camera because when we took the test-drive we've heard that we are over boosting or what we thought was over boosting told me was the overboost whistle or warning but we did a little bit more research and turns out that's not the case so the wastegates actually do work everything works as far as the turbo system or sit yeah yeah but it still made that noise these have the clutch booster assist and we had hold that big vacuum diaphragm and that's there so when the car is off you have assist on that first so the pedal so the pedal isn't as firm right it's not as heavy because just because of the designing system there's a hose that would connect from here that goes into this system that goes off into a couple other valves and then comes back down to here so we've capped it off and eliminated that system to get rid of that whistle so it's going to be a hard clutch on this car it doesn't really matter it that's just a I'm living with it thing like in deal we've driven custom cars yeah better yeah this is this is not this is not that bad eventually I do want to kind of rebuild that system but it's not a big deal what's totally drivable and it actually makes it a little more fun you kind of manhandle it a little bit the man pedal right the man pedal that's that's right so another thing we did was we've wired back up the suspension and it took a little bit of sleuthing on the internet but we found out the color-coded wires and let's see if it works by the way they also did the interior and it just looks fantastic it looks brand-new and we get to live in it for the next week and it's not gonna look that good no it's definitely not there's probably gonna be some wrappers of some pepperoni sticks yeah so key in the ignition and Oh already already it's on look at that it's a front zero zero rear zero zero and we can and it just moves those little motors that's amazing and now we have all our settings and we can basically do it whatever we want so as it stands right now this car is completely sorted [Music] well we are at the side of the road we might be a little late to the drivers meeting [Music] [Music]
