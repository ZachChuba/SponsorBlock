oh.he dokey folks welcome to something maybe on my end you've seen it cuz I've done it on the the main channel local recorded but first time trying it here in a multiplayer server that happens to the description of either twitch or YouTube and we've got a good food source okay so I just the random crafted sorry random not crafting looting random loot drops data pack that we've got in the world I just generated this like an hour ago zine popped it into the save file and it's easy peasy we're off to the races so what do you want to do you want to do since this is your first time doing this right I'm assuming just like at this point we just dig and break everything trying to figure out what we can make sense right but like what do you want the goal to be let's try to beat the ender dragon this is my first time doing it sure I mean that's always a good nice vanilla goal is to pray first what was that skeleton skull I think we can't yeah okay it's some blue concrete powder I ourselves to the string okay wait we can run our string and get wool yeah what is dirt do nothing dang we need a silk touch for that mmm chest our hands boys that's what I'm talking about that's what you talking about you want some prismarine I got prismarine yeah but I have a chest I have a village change we are all we are balling on food but we need we're just we're just naturally just getting it all okay so here's the way that this always works is that I have a notepad and I always like use the notepad and I do okay so poppy goes to village chest tall grass I guess tall grass isn't a big deal any I just mark off the ones because it's so easy to like lose track you know and you want to try to keep track of what does what if you can okay yeah okay there's we have a dungeon right here what really hey off the oh my god and it's open dude I got an axe I give you an axe like are you thinkin X because I told you the freaking poppies are a village chest here you go I don't I assumed a village chest was you know a chest that you get I don't know what a village test is these chests generate nothing so that's good yeah you probably want to dip probably want to dip so here's the thing you get excited about oh it's a dungeon that's really cool except that the dungeon chests have another loot table so you don't actually do anything in this case it looks like okay so we get a flowerpot so interesting thing to note is that a when you ain't got a cauldron umm and we can't break that yet until we have a pickaxe Oh would you get that from cow oh okay the cow is an emerald that's pretty dope oh yeah playing the string I forgot about that one pigs are polished diorite so that's wonderful we get a kelp well once we get a pickaxe will open up a whole world of possibilities Oh Oh what you get it's good we got iron boys we got iron okay so wool breaking wool is an is an even better village chess so I just got iron and now I am going to shear sheep I just kill the Sheep there's cheap up here though yeah dude I mean you're gonna get the wool for now but I'm trying to get wouldn't you kill from sorry what do you get from demonetized in the Sheep carpet okay I feel like I'm doing what are a few table yeah yeah that's pretty cool though that's pretty cool a little axe action okay alright so the slabs a lot of slabs going on I guess the problem we still face is we still need wood to build a crafting table oh oh dang what do we got here iron oh this is pretty what are you it's an iron golem but plus wool and yeah I get green wool wait I'm getting all sorts of random stuff out of here I have 50 53 iron ingots what are you talking about this is an iron golem drop but there's like I don't know that's weird why is the green wool there that's the thing I'm confused about so that's oak leaves to iron basically that turns into observers server blocks but yeah we need what I got I don't have any I know we need wood though so I guess the whole white wool situation doesn't really matter much that's what I don't get is that you get these ones that are weird mixed like why is it an iron golem that's also got a wool color associated with it I don't know how that works okay oh yeah so that's that oh sure grass I am being told oh yeah yeah wait we can we can use help to burn things though uh you get a furnace no but you were like we need wood so I was like eh we've got kelp bush things I don't know no no we need wood for a crafting table bro oh yeah yeah that kind of an important thing you know listen it'sit's the simple things okay stonecutter cutters kind of nifty boys okay um I can't put it down and break it those the thing hey would you like a ooh actually this could be really good this could be this could be super duper or we could find a village and there's crafting tables there that's the you know there you go it's not nighttime yeah I think they're just coming out of the cave is this wait wait that's an enchanted fishing rod yeah I gave that to you oh thank you you're welcome I've always wanted one I'll actually give you a look at the situ here so here's the thing is we fishing actually has three different possible loot tables associated with it so we can it has treasure junk and fish and all those can be changed for something else so might as well see what yet okay why ma'am there's a lot of zombies going on I don't know why I use a dungeon there could be a dungeon another zombie done I got a button boys I got a stone button okay so that's that a button is it they placed it and it disappeared so that was neat yeah we need a pickaxe I think all right they'd like it bro it disappeared when I placed it not when I broke it I have luck at the c3 on this right now so it should give me the ability at the village chest huh okay so that's still fish oh you know what let me let me share the other sheep over here oh we need to try every different kind of flower as well yeah that's not me I've been hitting different flowers oh you have okay yeah that doesn't do anything there's also acacia and acacia hair is stripped dark oak wood do you think canet yeah you can oh thank goodness dude thank goodness you can turn that into a cracker planks yeah we're good now I have a crafting table alright what was that from red wool yeah red wool would you get red wool from somewhere oh okay cuz we need six - it's another important thing I don't know where yeah where the red ball came from okay see that's why we have the notepad yeah yeah yeah no that makes total sense yeah oh did you know that acacia leaves drop acacia wood that's nice piece okay actually no there's okay there okay wait wait hold on is that a slab oh no it's a full plate that's that's convenient that's very convenient Thank You acacia you're so kind a case you were wondering this is what you get I'm gonna make two beds thank you Oh acacia turns into what appears to be redstone torches yeah I saw that okay so leaves to conveniens red wool is from crafting Oh red dye and white yeah did you not hear what I was saying about the population I have not understood [Laughter] he's lost it guys let me check it throw me your helmet how are your helmet okay can you how about we sleep though uh oh I already had one oh yeah strip the log that's a good call everybody it's a good call do you want us sleep sure it might not work for you if you've done your homework but hey I own a gold helmet for you yes oh that's sad because I owe you the beeping I still don't think I'm taking it off cos you look thick so I don't know like I've never done a villager chest so you were like hey I've got a chest and I kept thinking like like a chance like cool we can store stuff so I was I was confused I was confused about that too when I first did randomized death and the person I was playing with was telling me like oh I just got this kind of chest I'm like what do you mean you just got a chest and like so I just mean I just mean it's the loot that you would get from that particular chest is all alright I'll make you a a set of iron armor as well if you want uh I mean I've got a lot plenty of iron to so okay well here's chest plate for you there you go at least made yeah thank you and now I got a lot of treasure maps - Wow yes see the thing is treasure maps not really all that exciting because the treasure chest yeah yeah okay iron so that's exciting yeah and sticks right so we're basically we God yeah I mean this is we're off to a very start he usually doesn't go good boy squiggly yeah let's see can I may oh yeah yeah we can make a bow real quick - dude I already made one just get some string from ADIZ boys get some string yeah iron block I know there's a lot of things we can craft right now iron block coal block eh just a bunch of bunch of stuff did we break gravely it is true gravel is lapiz lazuli so oh we can then champ if ever we want to a blue veins that sounds good Epis in lousy line okay so that cozened eh yeah III broke okay so that goes into red shoot what did that come from and that goes to a saddle alright so these were particularly exciting that I do one string ever since I discovered that you can do the axe backwards I've been doing that and oh you just now trading people like well yeah I mean that was kind of hey you know just fresh and a little you know haha joking but now it's beak it like it's like saying something ironically at some point it starts becoming ironic you're just saying it you know like it's now just it's just what it's coming out and I I don't know how to feel about it but I'm an axe to the right sort of guy gotcha dude gotcha you're a he then did you okay so things that we got before cauldron let's break the stonecutter god I don't worry about okay so don't sticks don't really care what yellow stone brick wall go to nether wart okay that's cool that's not true I was talking about some no stone brick wall turns into wooden stairs okay we can also craft things with this wood that we've got and see ready get out of that right a thing nada okay so we're um fish oh yeah yeah we got the concrete powder from this what about cheers on this the heck is that oh and stone brick wall they have n stone brick walls I mean yeah yes it does exist it is the thing that yes so I'm gonna see like I'm gonna see a bunch of stuff that I had no idea even existed let me I'll make you a bow too cuz I am nice a nice guy oh we can get dirt dirt comes from n stone brick walls nothing there what was it that gave the oh that was fishing okay let me fish again and I'm gonna get the button and then I'm gonna turn it into concrete this time the button into concrete did you try breaking our beds negative dark prismarine okay which turns into a pot and a flower good good and so where did I find that red wool I feel like it was from when I was doing something breaking the nares okay so here here's the thing when you get a flower pot and a flower you can actually put the flower in it and it will give you a different drop oh so we gotta try okay so all the different flowers and then we try a flower pot with a potted poppy goes to redstone dust oh I guess it doesn't really matter because I had a redstone block that I found but anyway umm what else okay white tulip a white tulip in a pot gives you an orange tulip with a pot oh how convenient is that yeah dude it's great that gives you nothing so that's exciting Oh in the world did I get that red let's see what else I can make more um have you done a lot with making various acacia related wood things no I just found the clay which turns into yellow concrete okay or a clay I turn it I crafted that into a block and then that turned of the yellow concrete then turned into a jungle trap door yeah I actually had that happened myself too and a pumpkin all right this is the one that goes to red stone no that's saddle chute to saddles though so we got that oh that's why things look wacky it's the texture pack for the B yeah it's not just the golden helmet bro it's like lots of stuff yeah I mean it just it looks so good did it off to ask ends wait for just a resource pack that just has the head or you could do it yourself self-sufficiency hey look everything looks normal again don't mind me I just figured the data the the the randomizer was like doing kind of random things like okay bring up a good point with redstone forgot about not being an idiot okay here we go let's see what this does brilliant okay so we have that I hear that we hear that we've got all the Terra Cotta we could ever need and the what else again oh we make that is decent amount all right you ready for us to lay out some some stuff here dude you ready for right no no we got that let's see if any of them go to anything all right so this is a shelter box isn't it yeah the pse there's an issue that we're out there how did you get there we win we want to repeat it we did it we did boys that's it that's the first time I've ever gotten that - it's the first time okay stop stop we need to get more wood and I don't know which one was because we were both like picking stuff up there but I it was something that I crafted on you it was the one that you broke I think it was the stair wasn't it yeah okay it was something you crafted I would you know one of the things I had I just I can't recall which which of the ones it was but I'm about I get I'm about again at all it was the door open the door okay it was the door and then it actually you know we could shortcut this process by just going and mining out a bunch of the granite because it was granite slabs that did that well that's assuming that granite would give us granite right oh that's true yeah I forgot about that I had that's a good point I always I always leave mess that up when I'm playing I'm like oh yeah all I have to do is just go - let me just go read my write that doesn't work that way does it oh I forgot to give you the bow that I crafted for you I'm so sorry that's fine we're okay okay so in an unsatisfactory sneeze more wood for everybody who is recommending different blocks right now give me a moment I have an lute forget okay obviously we do have more that we have to check into the it's good it's a good time to be here - it's a good time to be alive hoo boy I'm glad you're alive same dude oh unbreaking 3 efficiency 5 pickax oh that's so good men 1 I'm breaking three iron leggings oh my god bro oh my god here he goes yeah here he goes I don't wanna make some more dude but it's a two-step process right right I was like oh come on I'm just getting granite you're over here getting unbreakable yeah yeah yeah oh here by the way I mean yeah up with that dude hit you up with that in case you find a horse and you know yeah yeah there's a cow over here so okay brah things are about to go why wait you found a carrot yeah why I mean carrots I don't know is there a way to maybe I was thinking for a second you make a carrot on a stick by with a little fishing pole on a stick but then I don't think that's actually true all right here we go just got a lot of granite I guess there we go oh oh oh oh my just a few things oh my we can't you know here's the problem so in all of my randomization series that I've done like I've actually managed to get pretty decent luck with finding on unbreaking 3 efficiency for I've managed to get pretty decent luck with finding like the wither skulls or the blaze rods things like that we have just hit such hard luck right here that there is no way it's gonna go smoothly for finding the stuff that we need to like get to the end well poopy on that but this is going well so far on this I don't know oh no I can't take my pants off oh and I found oh man here yeah I might need you to de monetize me oh you put a cursive binding yeah listen and and they we're not playing hard core bruh and then I picked up oh my God look at all of that look how are we supposed to sort through all this no telling how are we supposed to Lord yeah we need to make some chess for sure I'm bringing three protection three put those on efficiency for five another efficiency 503 we haven't found any city and monstrous I know we've not okay alright so there's we used two chests and there's still so many doors it's like just throw all the things in no one breathing three protection for yeah those are my pants your pants just as soon as I as soon as I get demonetised gosh from the pants are stuck to me oh my god I don't fire Prato fire prop for and breaking three that's not bad either dude that's not bad either alright um you know Karsavina actually protection for unbreaking 3 I could cursive bind that it's like hooray yeah where's it where's this where's diamond sword dude I need a diamond sword over here I mean we have diamonds so at the very least we can make it no but it has enchanted sign about the Box fire prot for God sharpness 3 unbreaking 3 okay hold on I'm just gonna Bane 5 mending ludecke looting 3 that's pretty nifty there's a silk touch item actually that's good that's really good it's just a shovel that actually will work on a lot of things though you know and a fortune so yeah yeah yeah I mean I think ok I'm just don't put everything that I have yeah like everything that I don't care about that's all this extra I'm just over here yeah but it's like you don't want to lose some of the stuff that you could put to use potentially for making other stuff that then could lead to the things that you need that's all so anyway there's so much stuff though so much random stuff alright alright still no diamond hoes black whoa what a dick that creeper just creeped up on dude he just he just got rid of so many good things which I could have definitely put to use at some point I can never get it rode oh I got a silk touch shovel as well here's a fire aspect what an idiot wasn't it what a loser face dude yeah I have to now I have to break more granted it's a lot man this is a lot of effort tough right here the way that we're having to break stuff and things anyway I've had a diamond sword fire aspect what if you want it and then I need I threw out my food and now I don't have food what was it the game of food oh no what was it that we had easy food at what dropped the pork chops it was one of the first things we found that was just grass it's just grass I'm getting skulls from the grass tall grass I was tall grass okay gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme I mean this is like your efficiency five mending or unbreaking mmm it's a good question whoa mending prot three thorns - curse of vanishing unbreaking 3 I don't even care dude I'll put that one on that sounds good bending on breaking three unbreaking 3 wow this is insanity and it's crazy - yup efficiency for fortune - efficiency for fortune 3 fortune - and breakage 3 unbreaking 3 not going to smite this is this is my rescue of our lives yeah it is yeah the smite is definitely better than bein for sure there's a good these are good leggings if you want on fire prop for and breaking 3 I don't know if you I I need to be killed before I can take out my legging so right got it did you just get heated up into the air by that explosion then you monetized on the downfall yeah that was that was exactly what happened that's fun I mean it was by design yeah but it's it's like it worked out really well yeah you hit me - two - two hearts and then I was like we might get axes out of a an end Lieut I guess it doesn't seem to be you know but you acts a good question mm-hmm maybe we can accidentally find the answer okay so do I have a regular a regular protection three fire protection before I feel like I you just used regular protection on something all right so you want those leggings another guy coming in here coming in hot leggings I have prop for mending I'm breaking three zom for men day oh uh yeah I just had fire protection I didn't know if you wanted okay bit of a riot no no no I'm just going through your leftovers but that's fine because your leftovers are still pretty good ding ding curse of vanishing boo vanishing is the big deal that means Oh protection for mending I'm breaking three uh yeah I'll do that that's bueno this is this is never gonna stop yeah we'll be here forever and ever and ever until it we're no longer here ooh fire protection for mending unbreaking 3 but it has curse vanishing but I'll do that yeah that seems good that seems real good dude right relax I have fire I have protect I have regular and then I have more fire this is wild bro this is wild oh yeah we need to make an anvil it's a good point it's good point that's gone there every Evangel I just want to see if I Oh sharpness for unbreaking 3 looting 3 that's what I was looking for though unbreaking 3 sharpness 4 as well you were sharpness for sword we can combine any surface 5 yes that's what I was like what the anvil we can combine stuff right yeah with our powers we find a feather falling I can combine with that that's gonna be big plays 2 3 isn't it and like that dude we can combine so many things holy crap and I guess I'll make another want to see what we have breaks into yeah was using I mean we are gonna need some levels somehow is the only thing but otherwise who any diamonds that we can just yeah yeah diamond blocks okay down blocks would be good anything else in here oh good that's an iron anvil turns into an alien which doesn't turn into anything did we chopped just straight blinks I believe so okay gold block diamond block terracotta I'm block goes to nothing died right slab and we can plant birches yeah nothing yeah um right Oh grindstone for XP can we make a grindstone right now oh gosh I don't think we can make a grindstone yet what is it that we need regular stone I think so yeah or hardened stone or whatever that is okay I've got too many shovels I want to combine everything oh that's expensive to combine that's quite expensive but yeah that is a desi real good point though that is a very very complainin worked in three efficiency for unbreaking well goodbye and goodbye ooh get sorry but that could no boy are you getting are you getting cursed know exactly but okay efficiency three silk touch for efficiency three unbreaking I'll just stick to that so what does curse of vanishing do I just makes it go away when you de monetize ah yeah I mean with these but these enchantments seems unlikely to D monetize anytime soon yeah I I would agree with you that's why I'm not particularly worried about it yeah I'm not / - hey what is doesn't Deb straighter make you swim faster does ya I killed a cod it didn't believe in anything it said but I have aqua arrest respiration and aqua fit any respiration and depth Strider so give me an ocean I will room that's a good point um huh I wonder there's anything else oh I got rid of my ax that wasn't smart oh my Peas out of gravel that's easy I think can do that died right turns into purple wool the magenta wool which turns into strips spruce so more wood why I wonder why it doesn't give you axes unlike all the different things that you can get out of it weird I mean just make an axe oh I should make a diamond axe how am I doing with this suit what am I doing with this crap iron dude ender pearl rolls out of fish okay wait that's that's a step that's a step dude nice white its I'm trying to it's the I don't know how to know what kind of fish these are boring fish they're not they're not a car they're not a salmon but they are like it's not fishing it's just kind of brown ones just hanging out right it's like it's ones in the ocean that you're yes you want to you know dude dolphins thing with the with the other thing that's a lot of things right there hey come back here stop swinging wait when did they become okay there's ender pearls I don't really want to find out what a dolphin D monetizes - yeah but you know you got to do what you got to do I wanna do what you gonna do dude a lot of flowers alright well I think I've pretty much tell these tropical fish drop this they have the same loot table yeah they definitely do okay you know kind of gotten to the bottom of everything here for the most part Oh Merle block might be nice we can give that a try so I'm gathering up ender pearls mmm cool cool little bit of air so you did find a an ocean you could swim through yeah yeah we're right by an ocean okay cool Oh still stop mmm wonder if I should get the respiration helmet if I want to join you in the ocean oh there was one here yeah prop 30 respiration - aqua affinity okay oh yeah did you ever fish whatever type of fish this is no it's very common so ender pearls are easy it just gave another form of an iron golem which is really weird okay so did we ever do that one spruce in a pot apparently it's Cod oh your cobblestone hey cobble how did you get to cobble it was through I think it was the acacia stairs potentially I found iron ore I don't know where enchantment tables you got chairmen tables huh I got it literally an enchantment table which is out of way you know not out of sugar cane Wow but that that oh I mean I guess we doesn't really do much for us and fortunately I was like excited and I was like wait but with the end stuff now fine I was excited for a second then you took away from me I know I'm sorry man yeah okay I just my brain just went how do I break lava blocks iron trapdoor I know there's like a bunch of stuff we can definitely craft now and I'm trying to think what that might be I'm gonna go through the oh if you get a couple something we can then we can create the furnace mmm very true we do the case you pressure plate I don't know are you Golden Apple those are just helpful for our health as a whole very healthful they're healthful iron bars that's definitely a thing your mind cards break that oh the minecart might drop itself buckets are good to have in general so I'm just gonna make out of those iron door right of course all things that can be done a pressure plate here light pressure plate right here dude buncha stuff alright so how did you get to a cobble again it was I think acacia stairs it was whatever gave us that White's design fancy Terracotta acacia stairs is right here whoa why are that give me do you have all the diamonds on you uh I just got a dungeon jets hello Zack do you say diamonds yes you have all the diamonds on you yeah yeah there you go also I just got golden apples Oh Scott go nice so nice yeah out of it out of a dungeon right nope grass path yeah grass path leads to a dungeon yes so that's the thing okay that's a thing and then yeah tilled dirt it's a good point I gave you all the diamonds and I should have made a diamond hoe so that was a mistake there's half my diamonds and I was gonna make sure to craft a diamond to hoe it's useful this gives cyan wool okay then it was problem maybe acacia slab which give us a button okay give us a banner then no it was it was something else it was one of the things they'd done right dirt easy alright I can't place town minecart until I've made tracks for it no but I can make a rail all right I was breaking the acacia wood for the acacia wood mm-hmm that's not how you get it you break the leaves I was like why am I getting redstone Tori this is very confusing is disorienting carts drop themselves Vic stairs Smith it'd be good if we could find acacia saplings because we're gonna go through it all of our occasion I don't think it'll be too difficult considering we have an entire biome but you know what I'm wrong I'm just I'm just saying you know I liked it I like renewable I like renewables and okay okay so the acacia slab gives the white choker box watermelons um okay one of those that one of those things gave the I swear I mean you ended up with one right what I just get I got a freaking gasp tear from that oh okay oh okay so iron bars are gassed not that that really makes a difference for us because we're not gonna be respawning the oh dude bro but you know I guess that lets this craft TNT we find Sam in the different levels of anvils give different things Oh iron door gives more iron golem loot but also lime wool and everything is iron guy I don't know what that I don't know what the deal is with that so how many skeleton heads and nothing alright that dead ended real quick there who yeah we just need a blaze rod that really is all we need at this point so that's all we're looking for blaze rods and we need to be able to make arrows right it'd be helpful it's not required there's that gaggle o sheep out there hmm okay so you don't care about this stuff we don't care about you I guess I'll just break a bunch of grass paths real quickly might as well do that get lots of golden apples yeah I was just looking at that as well that's a lot of golden apples that was piercing then again I don't know where I got the iron ordered from either I guess a iron ore breaks into wait yes for those mentioning there is a world in which it's impossible for us to get to the end we just hope that that's not the world we're in right now I got bone blocks like in bone meal okay it sounds cool we just need a grindstone really that would heck is this brain would it's another kind of village just it sounds like okay okay I am going to try to write some mobs over here okay and see what sort of stuff we can yet oh good I guess it's been raining for a while um you want to make another bed sweet and just make the rain go away cause I still think bad so skeletons drop bricks okay this freakin witch though Wow this freakin witch right here [Music] get them brick from the skeleton I mean I could get I could get some levels this way all right so let me know when you are ready to do some sleeping I'm trying to remember how to get wool I guess I can go there's a lot of wool on the chested oh okay cool yeah I can do that not orange concrete on the chest only the bestest of wools all right I'm aiming a bed I mean if a dude I mostly name it name it name into bed oh I keep forgetting the silk touch things I guess changes it all hello everybody oh good thank you for the lime wool Enderman you're welcome and which then turned into a yellow man good oh yeah biggest the biggest bummer is that there's a chance that blaze rods could be out of something that requires silk touching and then that's a it's a whole ordeal this is complex and yet simple and but weird but I never I know is it it's very I don't know what to feel right now I don't know what to do with my hands like a ship button to come we've done acacia and then I guess planks I'll let me try vines over here dead coral get in the house coral which goes pumpkin which dead ends and then jungle wood is nothing nothing for your jungle woods never tried vine yeah okay so I will try to get some cobble after I check out these vines it really is like an overwhelming amount of stuff to track okay so we hit leaves we get jungle leaves from vines yeah I have kind of this like oh I'll just remember things no no you need to write it down yeah hey I I've decided I there was an error in my ways and I'm now writing things vigorously Oh starting to but um petrified it what's it what's doing an oak slab and a petrified Oak's lab I don't actually know where you find petrified wood honestly but it is a thing that exists in like some kind of weird dead village or if you monetize village or something what's up librarian drop what is this got a I got a bunch of books enchanted books and paper oh it could be it could be a stronghold library chests it was it was neat okay that's probably a stronghold library chest I would I would guess block of quartz and look you can 18 years later another kind of chess not really a big deal though this paper bit those sticks yes oh yes what else might we'll have here yes oak leaves were that okay so acacia button was that this area where was alright I see you over there hello over there got enchantment tables straight out of sugar cane that's wild Braille it's wild okay so enchanted book infinity well it's open enchanted book power for that's also very helpful yeah yeah like I wasn't mad that was there I remember how I got there might have to end up reviewing footage there we go rewriting paths and stuff like that I mean I I have most of the like valuable ones marked off what what's the one that you're looking to have I don't well whatever led to this chest that I just did man I like like I said I was thinking oh you don't know which led to the yeah I I'm gonna I'm gonna have to like go and take notes in reviewing the footage because I've just been doing stuff like what's this big what's this make what's this make and then not being methodical we broken a crafting table okay crafting table makes nothing good I could try to silk touch it with the shovel actually I'll try that yeah let's see Oh actually yeah let's see what Oh everything's gonna change everything changes when with this air nation attacks yes oh it's a coal block to a carrot so there you go I didn't actually do anything but they get cracked stone bricks oak fence fish who petrified at Oakes lab is what the chest was I don't know how to get that but [Music] I throw out my shares I'm gonna throw my shares what's mine what are you up see you throwing out your shears dude hey surely it can't be certain out maybe shears and how do you do strip blogs I'm gonna Oh Oh got it got it hey strip the Katia's nothing eventually goes the string right make a lap ease block okay I did that already doesn't go to anything nice but I do have a furnace now gives us a fence so we can fence ourselves in and then gives us redstone block so we can redstone ourselves in mm-hmm I guess some cobblestone I need to make wanted to make like smoker and other stuff try placing string I think you tried that yeah that's the kelp okay anyway I have acquired a 12 cobble a stone now and that goes from acacia button cobble okay petrified oak slabs are really old type of slabs existed before normal oak slabs gate if you have a super old world and

are exceeding art oh yes sorry I've been so invested in everything that I did not even another silk touch yup all right I am going to do some final combinations here that is 11 verses 12 of us some around here like I don't need smite anymore but it's whatever so we got silk touch and a big pickaxe there and see what that dropped obsidian drops nothing but wait where did you get obsidian from uh in the world oh okay gotcha I thought you like got a hold of obsidian I was like that's that's that's helpful although I we can always do the easy nether portal where we don't actually need flint and steel or a any obsidian we can just use the bucket method so I guess it's not actually a huge deal I just found another dungeon this I see a skeleton I guess we could see what this Bonners drop whoo yeah wine balls slime balls out of moss stone okay a moss cobble yeah it is gonna be like Episode one everything except for blaze rods that's that's gonna end up being well now we now that we have the
