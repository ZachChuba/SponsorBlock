hey everyone it is mr. crayfish and today I am once again creating your mud ideas in Minecraft now today's episode is going to be a little bit different in today's video we are going to be creating muds based around a certain theme and that theme today is everything to do with mining caving and exploring so I asked you guys on Twitter if you could have a simple mod created for Minecraft what would it be and as always you guys suggested so at many amazing ideas however I've picked four ideas that really stood out now if you would ideas however on that note let's start creating your mod ideas so the first idea comes from a user called moon China and they suggested to add in a gold hopper I can't count the amount of times I've come back from mining or even exploring and having to sort out all my items minecraft is continuously adding more places to explore every update and that means more items and with the nether update around the corner gold is going to be much more plentiful so why not add some more uses having that said let's start coding this mod alrighty so I went into this mud thinking that it was gonna be quite straightforward but it turns out there are some difficulties along the way but the first stage of this mod was to simply add in a new block and within a few minutes I had something working we should have it in the red stain tab here so if we scroll down there it is the gold and hopper without a without a model yet but we should be able to place it down and it looks like everything's working so far obviously looks like a hopper right now but that will change soon and that it did because the next stage to this mod was to create a texture for the golden hopper now it is still my goal this year to get better at texturing and let's just say the first texture I created didn't really look too good what the heck it looks like a sponge all right so I went back to the drawing board and created the texture from ground up and now it looks a lot more like gold now the texturing is out of the way it's time to move on to the main portion of this mod and that is adding in the functionality now I love making mods that fit into your vanilla minecraft and I thought that the perfect functionality for the golden hopper would be to replicate something similar to the redstone item sorter so the golden hopper is only going to be able to filter one item at a time just like the redstone system you may or may not be familiar with this design but one of the disadvantages of this system is you can only a filter items that can stack up to 64 the golden hopper is going to be able to filter any item it is also going to cost considerably less with the gold hopper only costing five golden ingots and a one chest and after many hours of writing code and learning how hoppers work and to be honest I still don't know how they completely work we finally had a working version all right so now when we right-click on the hopper we'll open up this nice window here and as you can see it looks very similar to a normal hopper but we have this extra slot at the front here which is for the item you wish to filter so if I was to place a diamond sword in the filtering slot as you can see I can chuck the diamond sword in however if I chucked a golden sword it's just going to sit on the top now if you take the item out of the filtering slot it is just going to act as a normal hopper so you can actually chuck anything in but it was time to head back into the code because there was still a couple will a bunch of things I still I needed to do first of all I fixed up the title so it would actually say a golden hopper next I added an icon to the filtering slot so it's much easier to identify and something that is not really apparent but making sure that this works correctly with regular hoppers all right so I've set up a little scenario of how I would imagine these golden hoppers would be used so if I was to go ahead and but these items in this first hopper here they are obviously going to go into the corresponding chest and then at the end here we just kind of have a miscellaneous chest for anything else that doesn't get filtered so let's go ahead let's give this a shot I'm hoping this works if not then something went horribly wrong all right let's have a look in the first chest hello oh it worked alright so mod done well not totally we're kind of missing one thing and does this give you guys a hint we need a golden hopper minecart now this didn't actually take too long to add in Minecraft code is actually designed in a way that makes it really easy to add in new types of minecarts but what if I told you I missed one line of code that broke it completely alright let's go ahead and that's summon this thing okay where it's why did things just happen like this I don't know luckily it was only one line of code and was easily fixed oh okay so we should be able to right click on these and it should open up an inventory here as you can see let's give this a shot what I've done is I've put a grass block into the filter slot and let's see what happens we just chucked in a rail here oh look at that it's working so if I give this a filter let's go ahead let's put a diamond sword in here it should only pick up the diamond swords have a look so it doesn't pick that up and if you check it down and saw down here it should pick it up this hopper here will take it out of its inventory and then put it into that chest we can even maybe replace this with a filtered up it as well let's give that a shot first oh so the diamond sword did work let's get one of these now and let's try this with a filtered hopper so we've got a diamond sword and here filtering this one I've also got a diamond sword in the minecart so as you can see it picks it up this should pull it out and then we should have pity in the chest here let's do that one more time we'll put to you this time actually so we should have two in the chest right now there it is perfect this is working amazingly now we were reaching the final stages of the mud all I had to do was add an item in for the golden hopper minecart at a recipe and we were done so thank you again to moonshiner for suggesting this idea I thoroughly enjoyed developing this mod and I hope you enjoyed seeing it be created but now it is time to move on to the next mod idea now I loved it this next idea because it's going to encourage you to explore even more in Minecraft this idea comes from Matt and they said to add in an explorer checkpoint basically this would be a structure that generates in your world and it would contain supplies it would have a campfire so you can cook some food but to actually make this place worth traveling to unlike the woodland mansion I've got an extra idea which is going to take the exploration to the next level so what are we waiting for let's start coding this mod so the first stage was to actually learn how structures generate and to see if I could generate them in a specific biome so for my first test I decided to make tool birch trees grow in a Plains biome but of course spoilers it did not work the first time but however the second time I managed to get it working oh yay okay so this time we spawned in and I mean now we have a bunch of birch trees in the Plains biome but we need to move on to better things and we need to Train generate our own custom structure in this biome now in order to generate a structure we are first going to need a structure so I quickly made up a little small ten by ten camp now this wasn't going to be the final structure in the mud I am going to be having something a lot better added in later on but I needed to have something created so I could actually start working on the code now I don't want to get into all the problems I encountered a lot of this was just experimenting and attempting to get my structure to generate in the planes biome and miraculously I was able to figure it out yay it actually worked I just wanna see if there's any more I've generated around here okay okay calm down here calm down look at this I don't know this was supposed to happen so obviously some changes needed to be made but I changed one line of code and this happened I might have done something wrong now I decided I was gonna do with this problem later and instead work on the next feature what is this feature well as I mentioned at the start of this video I want there to be a good reason to search for one of these camps so what I thought would be a great idea is just like buried treasure if you went to one of these camps you could find a treasure map which leads to a massive or deposit okay so right below me there should be a giant vein of I nor let's dig down here and it should be about level 25 or something like that oh oh oh all right let's clear this out let's clear this out okay okay this this is crazy we have a ginormous vein of iron ore so now this is working we now need to implement a treasure map so we can actually locate one of these are or deposits now adding in the treasure map was actually quite easy minecraft provide provides a way that you can actually just point to any structure in the world and it'll create a map for it and then all we had to do it was create a loot table and then boom the treasure map now generates at the camp now I also made it so these survival camps now spawn in more biomes so as you can see here we are in a swamp biome and one of the camps are spawned if we go ahead and we check inside the chests here hello hello look at this we have already posit treasure map we're not going to open the other one up yet but as you can see oh we are already super close to this I think we need to which way do we need to go okay it looks like we're here alright super super close and that's kind of a good thing about these camps is they're not too far away from the actual reward let's go ahead and dig down here and we should hopefully find one of the ore deposits oh oh okay look I mean here it is but it kind of got consumed a little bit by the cave but that's kind of just how minecraft works this is really cool but now we are nearing the final stages of this mod there are still a couple more things we needed to do one I need to improve the generation and two I wanted to improve the design of the camp so here we have the current design of the camp it is alright but now we have a new and improved design now I'm not taking credit for this this was actually designed by System z if you guys don't know who he is he is amazing at building I definitely suggest you guys go check him out so I've put some links in the description for his twitter and youtube definitely go send him some love having all that said camps we're now generating a lot more nicely in the world and I also added a configuration option so you guys can customize the chance of one spawning but to make things a little bit more interesting I added some biome variants to the camp so depending on where which by and they're spawning they're going to use the same type of wood that is surrounding them and just like that this mod was now done so thank you again to Matt for suggesting this idea I hope you enjoyed watching your mud come to life I definitely felt minecraft needs more things to explore and this is why I loved creating this but for time to move on to the next idea so the next and final mod we are creating will consist of two mod ideas the first one coming from Petula and they suggested to add in a 3x3 mining enchantment this would make it easier to create a tunnel and clear out figure areas the other idea coming from Scott and they suggested to add in an enchantment which can mine all the ores in a vein now these ideas were perfect for an existing model mine could enchant a bull which if you don't know is a mod that simply adds new enchants into the game and with some tweaking today we can definitely make these fit into the vanilla feel of the game so what are we waiting for let's get started alright so we are first going to start off by adding the 3x3 a mining enchantment now it's pretty self-explanatory of how this is going to work basically when you break a block it's going to destroy all the surrounding blocks and this depends on the direction you are facing but to start this off I was just experimenting to make sure that it was possible to create this mod and this first test went pretty good so right now it should kind of dig out a 3x3 area well I'm hoping it will Oh oh my god that is is loud okay we just dug a cave out in like two seconds here this took no time alright I want to dig out this mountain oh I'm gonna die okay as you saw from my experiment it was working successfully but now it was time to change it around so instead of breaking a cube shape it will just be breaking a square instead now this didn't take too long to implement and I got up pretty much working straight away but there were some more things that I had to consider firstly it should only work on blocks that at all is effective for as you can see I'm currently blade breaking leaves and Logs with a pickaxe however it should only work on stone it should also ignore ores because most of the time you want to be able to break them with a for whatching pickaxe this is just simply a quality-of-life feature and I didn't take long that to become a reality but we had more serious issues to fix currently this enchantment is quite overpowered basically you can break 3x3 blocks in the same time that you can break one block so to give a remedy for the issue basically I needed to consider old blocks that the tool was effective against and ignore the blocks that it wasn't from there all I needed to do was add up the time that it takes to break all the effective blocks and boom we now had a balanced enchantment now this enchantment was almost finished the last thing that I wanted to do it was add two different levels level one would be able to mine at 3x3 whereas level 2 can mine 5x5 okay so now we have two different levels we have excavator level 1 and then excavator level 2 yet so let's do it with the level 1 and as you can see boom there we go we have a 3x3 area mind now for the next one this is this is gonna be pretty big and I definitely don't think that we're gonna allow a higher level than this and as you can see it dug out a 5x5 area and the enchantment was now complete and boy this video is getting low but now we need to move on to the last idea and that was adding in an enchantment that would allow you to mine out a vein of ore so imagine you are caving and you come across an ore when you miner instead of it just breaking one block it's going to break multiple blocks and the higher the enchantment level the more blocks it will break now conveniently there was a lot of code from the previous enchantment that I was able to reuse for this one and it made it a lot easier to get the first or working version sort of and let's hope that this works I found some coal here to dig out I'm really not sure if this is gonna work ok well oh whoa whoa hold up we're kind of and know what's going on it's like huh interesting and that ladies and gentlemen is why you test your code and I found the issue fixed it up and we were ready for round two we have three identical veins of Oz here if I go ahead and I break this first one here so we're gonna do either one as you can see it's only broken the blocks that were actually adjacent to the block I was targeting let's go ahead let's do the second one here we're gonna take a little bit longer and okay interesting we'll let that slide for now but as you can see it break a little bit more than the previous one and then finally or eater three destroys the entire vein so far everything was going to plan and the next thing that I needed to do was just update the algorithm that I used to search for the ores because it wasn't actually trying to find the closest ones and that was a problem however after changing that and fixing a few bugs the enchantment was now working as intended and I also limited it to only break the or your targeting and the mod is now done so that is unfortunately going to end off this video today it's been an extremely long video actually the longest one yet so I hope you guys enjoyed all the mud downloads are in the description below and as well if you guys enjoyed this video today I'd appreciate if you could drop a like down below subscribe if you would love to see more of this content and I'll see you guys for a new video real soon bye
