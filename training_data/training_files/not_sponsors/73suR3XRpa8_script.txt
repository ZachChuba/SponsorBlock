[Music] hi guys after my top 5 best switches and top 10 worst switches videos I'm back with another top X video and today we're going to take a look at the top 9 weirdest mechanical keyboard switches ever made weirdest is a bit subjective of course and there are several ways in which a switch can be weird but in this video I'll be concentrating mainly on the weirdness of the operating mechanism of these switches either because it's ridiculously over complicated or redundant or just very different from everything else some are good some are bad but all of them make you think what the kicking off at number 9 we have Fujitsu peerless a somewhat unpopular switch that replaced Fujitsu excellent leaf-spring switches it's a dome with slider design at hearts but they went about it in a really convoluted way in order to get something vaguely resembling a clicky noise out of it and it has a key feel that I've described as stiff and crappy of buckling Springs I explained how they work in my dome with slider mega review video the switches are essentially a slider with a spring in a sock in a barrel plates over domes over a membrane it makes use of a curved assembly including a metal backplate which in this case is held to the barrel plate by a million billion little screws and all this seems like it would kind of counteract the cost-saving measure of going with a rubber dome system anyway and that's not counting that going for rubber domes and what you want to become a clicky switch isn't very intuitive either especially because the clicky noise is very soft seriously guys what's the point couldn't you've just stuck with your amazing leaf-spring switches instead next up at number eight we have Futaba MD switches also known as Futaba complicated linear this switch was patented in 1982 which might sound excessively old but that's basically around the time all the major switch designs we know were brought out such as cherry MX Alps SK CLS KCM buckling Springs and MB high-tech space invaders etc etc this wave of redesigns was done to make switches that were less tall and some manufacturers took the opportunity to also make the switches cheaper and simpler to make for example and going from beam Springs to buckling Springs the height was drastically reduced and the parts count was lowered from 8 to basically just 2 but Futaba MD is an exception to this rule it consists of as much as 16 parts which is an absolutely insane number especially as it's just a linear switch so it doesn't even need a clicker or a tactile part in it we have the top shell shell base two legs coil spring leaf spring contact pan to contact leaves are separate a membrane rubber insulated plastic sealed main slider side slider o ring and a rubber dampener compare that to linear Alpes at 10 parts cherry MX black at 6 linear space invaders at 5 and buckling Springs as well - and you can see that as 16 parts which might have been slightly over the top worse the key fill isn't even very good then at number 7 we have Tesla M s 1 SS 1 Quantum Agnes hall-effect switches these were redesigned knock-off of micro switch SW series which use magnets to create a hole voltage which can be measured to create an excessively reliable switch both designs clip into a metal frame Tesla wind rather over the top by using no fewer than four magnets per switch with these and they mark the polarity of the magnets as well using some white paint curiously the magnets alternate from top to bottom and although I don't have an oscilloscope to measure it I guess you would get quite an interesting output pattern possibly a very sharp one as I mentioned in last week's electronica keyboard review the Soviet Union had a habit of rather over engineering their equipment and this is a great example because Jesus biscuit baking Christ why the hell would you need four magnets for one single switch next on our list at number 6 is Alps integrated dome which actually made the number 10 spot on my worst ever keyboard switches list as well this is one of those cases where I just have no idea what the hell was going through their minds when they were designing it it's actually a discrete soldered in switch which has to to pin contact pads embedded in it which are bridged by rubber dome with a conductive carbon pad at the bottom and on top of that sits the slider now one of the advantages of using discreet switches is that you're not limited to the key field that rubber domes bring but inexplicably they decided to stick a rubber dome in it anyway now you might think that perhaps this design could bring out the best of both but in actuality it's the exact opposite believe it or not the key feeler is worse than a standard rubber dome keyboard as for some reason there is very little tactility in these domes and yet at the same time the key feels rather mushy and hideously short travel as well so you end up with a really roundabout design that manages to be worse than a random crappy rubber dome keyboard at number five we have a switch that's weird not because it's over complicated but rather because it's under complicated and which bear already rather intriguing name of okey tactile gold spring the name is a misnomer the switches are actually clicky and unbelievably the basically single part switches the entire switch is just this really weird-looking spring thing sitting on top of a set of membranes it works by having this enlarged coil slip past a narrowing in the slider well which fires the spring down after building up enough tension causing the tactile feel clicky sound and a perfectly synchronized actuation of the switch it's a very admirable design and it feels pretty good even and the fact that they managed to get the tactility clicking noise return force and act raishin all with just a single part makes this a super elegant design in my opinion even if it's rather wacky next up at number four we have a switch that you hear very little about but which is quite well respected by those that know it markquart butterfly the switches thusly named because of this centerpiece which is an extremely curious looking crumpled up partially disconnected to flop leaf spring that vaguely resembles a butterfly unfortunately for the butterfly in the switch it's actually impaled on a spike in the middle as if it were designed by a fucked-up lepidopterist and the two flaps partially immobilized the leaf in such a way that both parts point up although at different angles resembling a wonky seesaw or something then one of the flaps hooks into the slider and when you press it it kind of does a butterfly wing beat with the slider part going down and then the other end flipping down from under a hollowed-out part in the slider onto a set of contacts which closes the switch when you have the switch open sometimes a seesaw can flip too far in the wrong direction or the leaf won't get back into the slider which can make this thing kind of a bugger to reassemble if you forgot what it looked like originally the key feels actually really quite nice but the question remains who went ahead and said hey guys I've got it let's build a two-finger mount skewered double flapping leaf spring things switch there's even a double action version of it which has another separate clicker that creates a second click and bridges a different contact if you press it down all the way I mean geez next up we have an extremely old switch the mousetrap switch of which I have a cherry version here which is from 1959 the cherry version hasn't been spotted in a keyboard yet but other mousetraps have been documented in one or two keyboards they all look very similar and work according to the same principle the idea is that the handle assembly forms one contact terminal and this little block a post here forms the other with a pivoting leaf spring alternating between open and closed the leaf spring is tensed against the handle post using a coil spring hooked into it and when the handle is pressed down the upwards tension eventually flips the leaf spring onto the blocker post closing the switch both parts are even outfitted with crosspoint contacts just like cherry MX the slider just sits in a top plate and pushes on the handle much like a mechanical finger it's a very cool system and it results in one of the most weakly tactile and addicting to use which is out there particularly because it sits very comfortably in your hand almost as if it was made as a toy for annoying your co-workers with getting close to the end at number 2 we have ITW magnetic valve the video explained a system in took me weeks to make as the electrical workings of the switch is mind-bogglingly complicated the explanation of the video took almost five minutes and several dozen diagram drawings in short it involves a C simulating pulsed current induction through two wire loops inductively coupled via a bead filled with magnetizable filings which can be opened or rather closed via a magnet embedded in the slider which locks the magnetization in the ferrite bead to provide n key rollover protection it uses a patented system of multiplexers which scans each key in turn for presses by grounding it through one multiplexer and disconnecting it through the other leading to an asymmetric charge build-up across the valve output line which the controller detects and stores in its memory until it's no longer found to be pressed this switch came out in a time in which hole affecting capacitive switches which are both also very robust yet significantly less complicated design were already on the market and while I find their incredible convoluted Ness to be highly entertaining I really wonder whose contorted mind came up with this stuff they even remained in production until 2005 - finally at number one we have a switch that's so weird I still don't know completely how it works and of which I don't even understand the whole point either it's the Tokai mm9 switch and its associated clones the switch consists of two two pointed terminals embedded in the shell base on top of which sits an alloy metal ball bearing and on top of that sits a coil spring and then the slider after a very long time I finally managed to work out how it roughly should work but I still don't understand the details the weirdness and what I really didn't understand at first is how pushing the metal ball further down on the contacts is supposed to close the switch as the ball rests on top of both terminals already and yes I tested it and if it just lies on top like this the terminals are connected but I tested them and yes the switches actually work now I managed to find toke eyes original patent on these switches and although it's all in Japanese the drawings seem to suggest that some not readily identifiable path and a slider holds the ball off of one of the contacts until you push it down I suppose that this unidentifiable part is this little lip in the slider and I guess I know what the idea is now but if had difficulties actually replicating this effect using the switch parts as it seems the lifting needs more of a horizontal motion than a vertical motion but whatever anyway what's even worse is that I have two switches from different clone manufacturers with internally almost completely identical parts yet one is linear and the other is tactile now this is where the what the hell alarm truly starts to glow red hot seriously was going on here these little bastards just have me completely stumped I have no idea how in God's green ass crack this thing works I've gone over it time and time again but everything I can think of just doesn't seem to actually be happening even worse the lifetime of these switches is apparently only two million keystrokes which is very low only 125th that of modern Cherry MX switches making them rather useless on top of being incomprehensible what the hell Japan so that's it for this top X video thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed it and feel free to suggest something if you want another top X video anyway see you next time guys
