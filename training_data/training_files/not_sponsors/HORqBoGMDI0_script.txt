If you’ve been watching studying videos
for like 5 minutes, then you’ve already heard of the Cornell Method, mindmaps or the
famous outline technique. These are all proven ways to take effective
notes in class or during revision because they provide a clear structure for ideas,
facts and arguments and have been used by top-scoring students all over the world. But even if they are great, you’re probably
sick and tired of hearing about those three. So today we’re going to cover note taking
methods that usually no one talks about and are also incredible ways to organize information
and ideas without resorting to the traditional note-taking methods. **Split page method** The split page method is a great note-taking
method for factually dense subjects and is used as a more condensed version of flashcards,
promoting active recall after your lectures or in preparation for evaluation. You can adapt it according to your class by
using facts, topics or questions. Dividing the page in half, you can insert
the name of the topic or the question that needs to be answered in the left side of the
page and the corresponding answer or definition on the right column. You can either study these notes normally
or by folding the page to create an added challenge and quizzing yourself on these topics. This type of note-taking method can be easily
recreated in digital format and I will below an awesome video that explains how you can
do it in Google sheets. **Q/E/C method** The Q/E/C method is another study method that
Cal Newport talks a lot about in his Straight-A book. Q/E/C stands for Question/Evidence/Conclusion,
and the main purpose of this system is to structure all of your lecture into question,
evidence and conclusion formats that you can then compile into one big study guide. Besides reducing the amount of unnecessary
information transcribed into your notes, the Q/E/C system creates a clear and obvious interrelation
between topic, conclusion and the stream of facts and arguments that connect the two. Furthermore, this note-taking system is two-in-one,
since, besides helping you organize information while you are reading or attending your lectures,
you’re also creating valuable study materials to use during revision. **Morse Code Method** The Morse code method is a note-taking method
envisioned by Cal Newport and focus mainly on taking advantage of written materials. Whenever you find a sentence that seems to
be laying out a main idea, you should draw a dot next to it in the margin; if you then
come across an example or explanation that supports that big idea you should draw a dash
next to it on the margin. This allows you to record information without
breaking your reading momentum so you can then take notes. The act of taking the dots you’ve written
and transforming them into notes is called the processing stage and it basically requires
you to paraphrase the main idea in your own words in a bullet point. The author then encourages you to take all
of these sentences and review them in the format of a major question: [em fundo branco:]
“What is the main question being asked in the article? What is the conclusion the authors point towards?” **Flow Notes** Flow notes are very similar to mind maps but
they have no rules in terms of structure. Although difficult to review, they allow you
to incorporate a large amount of information during your class, because they are a free
pass for you to simply throw facts, arguments, topics and dates on the page with no specific
order while connecting and linking these ideas as you hear them. Flow notes are great for those who hate transcribing
information and prefer to process what they’re hearing into workable sentences or words;
it’s an holistic method that works wonders for classes with no clear structure, or discussion
with interrelated components that aren’t easily organized via outline or mind map format. In case your class is highly dense on information,
making it impossible to compress all of the facts, you can still use flow notes as a hybrid
system to comment and annotate original materials and textbooks to create summaries or visual
aids for complex chapters or topics. **Sentence Method** The sentence method is similar to the outline
method as it relies on an expansive vision of your notes, but instead of using indenting
and topic formulation, it uses one-liners, one per paragraph, to create a guide for each
topic that is easily readable, workable and memorable. The other major difference is that while the
outline technique uses indentation to hierarchize the importance of different segments of the
topic, by avoiding indenting the sentence method considers every sentence of equal value,
which means that topics with a high-level of detail or information can benefit from
this system as they force you to memorize details as well as key ideas relating to the
topic. I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see
you next week. Bye guys!
