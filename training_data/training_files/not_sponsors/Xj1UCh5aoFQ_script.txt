look at this help I'm homeless and then there's a sleeping bag and a box that is great nobody's ever gonna donate to you eight because they've been oh boy you'd give someone would take it hope you get base mate hopelessness sucks look at these guys as well the lighthouse losers and they're right next to the lighthouse and they've actually got a tool cupboard right here so they pretty much take it over the lighthouse nobody could build that close to it so yeah they owned the lighthouse these guys whoever they are hey guys how's it going overall doing well welcome back to a new video today I am playing on the new rust update if you don't know already they've changed a few things in the game so now you can loot things really quickly they've added in this thing where when you hold hage and hover over items it means you can loot stop ridiculously fast more importantly though and I've been waiting for this for a long time because it's the most annoying thing in rust and they finally fixed it yes they fixed the tree minigame that annoying bug where you would hit the X and it wouldn't actually do anything is finally fixed so hyped about that I'll probably farming a lot of wood much more easy you know drop it into the video I am starting today on fresh wiped Rastafari you may have got a big series for you guys really excited for you to see this this episode right here is gonna be quite a long one so I hope you sit back enjoy the episode it should be over 20 minutes hopefully by the way really quickly all the blueprints have wiped on Ruster bite so I've had to basically get all the blueprints again just ahead talk let's get into it I'm gonna give you guys a little tip right now I love this new looting by the way look how quick fires it's awesome I just found a garage door I'm gonna want to research this right now so just use the research table at the outpost BAM put the garage door in there obviously I don't have enough you probably want to make sure you have enough don't worry I'm not one of those guys that's gonna sit on your head and try and move you away from the recycler so I can loot all see you there guys hurry up man come on I'll just wait you done freaking L thank God for that babe but I need at least ten more straps so I'm hoping these gears gives me it yes 20 nice alright now we can research get in there boom alright easy life garage door that's the first thing we've researched ah now I've got a research everything else Happy Days these guys think I'm afk and they're trying to the track to put me in the fire I just came back direct boys I'm friendly alright just gonna use the RFI number while we're here quickly get some extra low grades okay not quite enough cuz I'm a bit low on would let me buy some wood while I'm here let's buy three thousand four nine hundred stones at least with that I can craft the TC and everything like that outpost guys is the place to be if you want to get sell as quick as you buy as quick as possible okay wallah we now have 51 low-grade crafting a furnace right now oh there's a bunch of naked tier teaming up I don't know what their plan is I think they're gonna kill the guy at the recycler or something's going on this is the low Denis kids what's their plan oh oh oh somebody just got shot he's there he's got a freaky compound bow what I didn't know that was even possible today nobody can get him why the sight is the aim a discussion is a killing man apparently you can get away with killing people if you're in that spot over there where that guy is what that's mad alright yo seriously bad we need to take the outpost back somebody kill him I don't want to divert I'm not doing anything unfortunately I'd like to help these guys kill that dude because I mean he's just sucked over the compound bow killing people at the recycler it probably has a friend that Lutz the recycler every time he kills someone but yeah like that's mad do something outpost okay there's a huge forest next to the outpost this is where I'm gonna live I see yeah I know he's going into the outpost ah one of the problems are living next to the outpost making a quick escape I just walked right into a trap base oh my god what a base man whoever built this perfect I like the design meat oh my god it feels so good now every time I hit one of these crosses it actually hits it okay I've just come back to the outpost to recycle some stuff lads and look at this they patched it they've added a scientist here literally did an update a little bit ago let me add chilling with the Russians guys all right so I've built my base as you saw I'm gonna go show you guys what it's like and but I've almost got enough to actually extend the base now so that's cool and obviously I've just come to the outpost to get some cloth so yeah recycled all my sewing kits a normal rope living next to the outpost though is frickin awesome a little bit home sweet home okay this is my base at the moment it is literally as simple as it gets but I want to extend this base right now I've got a little bit of farming I've got quite a bit of loot there so where yeah I'm gonna go ahead and do that in a sec I just want to get a level one workbench down first we're building a base laughs oh I didn't bring a bow out with me screw it I'm gonna go say hello then it might be a friendly guy maybe you can make an alliance with him hello friendly man you friendly hello I don't even have a boat so I'm not gonna have to kill you how you doing mate speak English okay he wants to try and kill me this dude all right man trying to be friendly with you remember I know where you live it's your choice I'm I have to I'm gonna go in for the kill I think [Music] all right what did I say to you all right I'm gonna look in my chat to see if you're typing he said what you won I saw very friendly I'm sick of you for all you've got babe what do you mean what do i won quite a friend clearly you ain't having all of it all right we'll take it we'll take all this loot I'll play that that's the guy just killed oh hello again oh oh no he's gonna try and get revenge they said feet don't kill I know you're angry I Know You're angry mate come on man we can talk this out we could be best friends I didn't want to kill you but you just didn't want to be my friend so I had to what we're just two guys both starting out you know we don't have to resort to violence all the time man oh my god you might actually kill me I'm running said beat it's so close to me look said B we can talk let's be men up let's be men about this man we could talk this out hey said B all right man I wish you the best a lot with your wife I'm sorry it had to end like this okay just just don't give up keep farming you'll get there all right okay I've got the strap loves to go crap the level 1 workbench now and then I'm gonna upgrade my base a bit more and make it look really cool and also more importantly make it more secure [Music] all right this is my base sauce so you go through here obviously I've got two boxes in there few doors and we got this bit with a little shop front so I can see outside there is a clan that lives over there though it's gotta be wary of that go through here the exit to my base is here and you have to stand on the rock to exit that's pretty cool i'm basically next to a nice little rock here but yeah this is only a temporary base guys but it's gonna do us for a while I'm gonna be able to research stuff with it and we'll we'll stay here we'll stay in this forest for some time I think yeah Scott being a grenade I got killed by an auto turrets that's why I'm a fresh bond right now and my sleeping bag was the timer on it I just randomly respawned decided to do a bit of farming along the road okay made it back garage door is gonna be crafted being tan grenades going safely away to research later what I'm gonna do is because I've already got their bean Tang grenade I'm gonna go try and farm Apple of scrap now so I can get the satchel I'll probably buy the satchel from somebody shot there's a lot of shops selling stuff this wipe so you know like it'll be fine but who knows I might actually get a satchel while I'm out farming hopefully after that we could do a rave so yeah let's just get that done right now I've already got quite a bit of sulfur so yeah just need to get our satchel charge oh this place raid in here hello hello how you doing we are doing reforms what key bro are you guys raiding or what what's going on no we are reforming our house bro because someone griefing help us gonna help I see you guys [Music] and once him again [Music] alright screw up we're getting out his friends on his way now I think he's gone ah it did have full roadsign geared to be fair but I was so close to killing that guy these guys are selling satchels for a hundred and seventy five scrap a bit at price Seaport that's probably we were gonna buy the satchel from if we can't find the satchel from elsewhere research tables being crafted making progress beacon is being researched as the first thing off the checklist now let's pile up enough for the satchel oh hello hello [Music] thanks for the double-barrel mr. Joe mama CeCe's unlocked with blue inside might as well take that free furnace as well at the crafter hammer he had sixty sixty eight scrap as well what a G I'm gonna take the nail gun out with me cuz you know what it's an under underrated weapon I've just been out on my farming trip right now guys I but I've just did a bit of fun but I've just spotted this base here and I reckoned that it could have quite a bit of Lewis so but it's right next to the launch site so it might be a component space it might upload to scrap so I think raiding this will probably a good idea and so what I'm gonna do obviously is continue farming continue on the mission of getting that satchel charge and then once we've got it I think that might be our raid target right there oh my god big mistake he's falling down let me see V obviously I don't think I'd be able to loot him oh I can't loot him obviously but maybe you'll have like an a K that dropped on the ground somewhere sometimes I wish that the outpost would let me loot I want to find this guy's a K hold on a sec [Music] no I can't find sak guys [Music] satchels being bought and the flame fur is being bought what thank you clan don't kill me please [Music] yes made it back okay now I gotta research these I'm gonna start crafting this actual straightaway so that we've got them ready for the raid all right guys I'm just gonna go for it okay because the raid that I want to do is quite close it's over there in the launch site I'm gonna take a detour through the outpost just so that it's safe and I'm gonna go through this forest here and then straight to the range it's obviously right next to the launch site right I'm not going any weapons cuz I'm not being able to research a bit today so I'm just gonna go there with a crossbow my satchels my words to build once we get inside and that's it right we're good to go let's do it maybe not a frickin high pop server with only a crossbow where's the base I want to raid I know it's around there and it's down there all right I know exactly where his loot rooms gonna be so I'm just gonna go for it but everything we need here because someone at the launch site there's someone at the launch site whatever oh my god please please please Ross guts be with me I know there's gonna be someone at the launch site that has to be hurry up two more explosions or something I just lost half my health one more guys here we go we're in okay TC got a code lock on it enough to get through it and then I can build and stuff come on Marriott how long is it gonna take you mate blow up this is why I hate satchel so much oh my god we did it we're in TC there it is oh yes okay it's not actually amazing because of the sulfur there's 3000 sold for 2,000 of its already caught there's loads of stuff there loads of metal fragments which I will take or I can't cram their pickaxes yet because I'd like to pick actually the rest of this base because this is gonna be more loot I don't know if it this is the main loot room up in the main loot rooms through there to be honest you're gonna have to get all this loot back to base and come back with pickaxes guys to finish this raid okay let's go home all right I need to research a pickaxe or cycle all this under 25 scrap that's enough to research the pickaxe and also the hat chip okay time to see what else is in here so the fact that this wall is this way round I think he's made a mistake there because this is probably where as mainly rooms gonna be anyway let's pickaxe crews see what else is in here okay I'm about to get in but the problem is I don't have a light so I'm not to see what's what's in here here we go alright this loot yes all right here we go it's gonna press it okay a freaking Thomson and an SMG there and some right 5x6 rifle armor which just Donita research there's gonna be more loot there's gonna be more boxes but I can't see anything let's see what else boom okay there's loads of tools there oh hi external wooden wall need to research that what up I I should probably just wait until a lot of hatch freakin hell yeah okay this is loads more loot but I can't see anything so hang on oh I got two semi-automatic pistols and one spas-12 more ammo as well some key cards which I'll grab I might have to do two trips okay I'm just gonna wait for it to get to morning cuz I can't see anything okay I can see look at that yes copy gun helmet I'll wear that right now don't mind if I do pistol bullets you need to research a reinforced window bar the armored one you know this is a sick because I need to research all of this stuff metal barricade which I'll take I'm gonna need that at some point oh yes oh look it's even a garage door there so if you would have place it Lee had its wall the right way around none of this would happen to you maid okay we're gonna have to get rid of a lot of these boxes and stuff I'm gonna get I'm gonna I'm gonna throw away all my pick actors on the ground I know it seems like a waste I could just recycle them but yeah whatever all right wait if they're putting them on the ground let's put them in the boxes right here and then we might recycle them later I'll use them okay with an 8k close by okay what's at the back haha yes loads of stuff budget avoid to scrap loads of stuff to recycle in here I just want to see what's in the other boxes because there's a few more at the back over there so let's just see that okay here we go flame throw yeah I bought that before drop box need to research so I'll take that now okay while I'm here at the outpost let me just recycle a bunch of stuff all right there we go recycled we made it yes okay so first thing when a research is the hatchet and then the reinforced last window cuz I'm gonna need that for my base design that I'm gonna build next wife's nicely done okay and now we need to think about what we should research now okay pistol bullet I'm gonna research as well and the rifle ammo I'm gonna research the p250 spirit nicely done and obviously a lot of hats would be nice as well we'll leave that for now right let's go grab the rest of the loot my neighbors are online hopefully those guys don't raid me oh there's a guy getting through the TC over there for that base it's gonna try and kill him [Music] I'm leaving that alone to low HP I don't have anything to heal with okay here's the base up grab the rest of the loot right recycle everything again alright I made it back to base with all the loot bye guys well I'm gonna end the video right here I hope you've enjoyed it we've built this nice little base today in this forest next to the outpost and in the next episode I'm gonna do more raids research more stuff and also maybe build another base somewhere as well like a main base cuz this was only meant to be a temporary base and it kind of is it's kind of quite small but it's also relatively secure and it hasn't been raided so far which is nice I feel like the woods right here it's a nice touch to it because but people are not gonna raid a base that has wood on the second floor like this you know firstly flame rating through that would cost a lot of low grade secondly they'll probably see the inside and think that it's not worth it to satchel raid so that's why it's kind of that's why I've kept it wood up there just because it's a nice and like distraction or it's a nice decoy people's gonna think it's a noob living here I have a new bot not that much of a noob anyway guys thank you so much for watching the video obviously it's a longer one today and I yeah have you've enjoyed it drop a like if you have follow me on Instagram as well if you plan Instagram and I'll catch you very soon take it easy guys face [Music] you you
