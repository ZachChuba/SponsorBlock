hi everyhope you're doing well today we're taking a look at a extremely high damaged high power build for the m4 in call of duty war znow I don't really see many people running with this setup because I think it is quite a difficult and challenging build to use but once you get used to it this thing can put out some extreme firepower so this is how I've got mine set up I've got the mono suppressor the stock m16 barrel pbx optic I do have an optic on this bill because I'm purposefully engaging people at longer ranges commando foregrip and this here the ammunition this is the important part the four five eight SOCOM 10 round mags a lot of people just don't know that this is in the game especially because with the m4 usually people just go for the 50 or the 60 round mags but what this does is reduce your magazine capacity to 10 you only get 10 rounds before you have to reload however it significantly increases the damage and the range as standard I believe the maximum damage of a 556 m4 bullet like of these bullets here is 28 but if you put these in the max damage you can do is 48 so in a 1v1 it's amazing and also if you're in a squad fight just picking people off from a distance it's devastating so today we're gonna be playing solos and seeing if we can make this work I hope you guys like this if you do leave a like and subscribe for more let's get into the game can we just appreciate my skin here guys I've got a bear on my head if that won't instill fear into my enemies oh I don't know what will so as is per usual in solos I always like to go scallops first car nice yeah feel like I should do a video on the car 98 oh I'll just cuz it's so like cool in Metro I've got a bounty on me but I'm actually seeing this dude yeah but I think this m4 build is gonna be pretty junior solos I have tied it in spots a bit high that was rude I love this green p90 though like the green in the blue on the vine and crates pretty good there's a couple people fine in here in this little training camp area see if I can third by this I must didn't see that dude thinking there might be another in there nice think he was happy that I gave him along then I'm gonna go all the way around the outside and check it that way instead it was a random suppressed shot there throw this decoy I didn't want to keep eating that because I think that dude is toasting me though just give him another angle to think about you know okay also I'm pretty sure that that wasn't the guy with the Claymore I'm gonna get this build beautiful look at this here we go get that peanut you back as well something like a parachute and admit it usually makes the call-out I've really had to split up and go for the head there but you see what I'm talking about like how quickly did I drop that guy pretty sure that I killed him before I had to others another guy here he said Gulager so know sometimes that can pick up goo loggers not on the tyranny know weird right run on the left you know what I'm gonna go up this tower here see if I'm get an angle on this on this chap in here I mean it could be a gulag er I don't see where that could be right there no up in the sky I'm just gonna jump in however I missed it give him the old dip dodging weed there I did was really sneaky though let's get this bouncy it's not that far away just up a Dubai it's not the tower no dude scoff go slow I suppose it matters when you've got a big yellow circle on your head they gotta be here somewhere safe or keep you while I move out the way here so I can finish off that was that was a really interesting play didn't really bother to try and shoot me just dropped an airstrike and run away instead it's a it's a bold attempt I have to admire the imagination there should I get this other bounty though I think I think that I should keep the money flowing even that plane wreckage on the mill Aloha all right challenge accepted I can't be bothered to run that it's too far away to run that is also you know in solos especially when you're moving from A to B across ground like this it's such a big advantage to have a vehicle I don't know if you noticed as well but they've have actually removed helicopters from solos temporarily and that's because there was some horrible glitch where you could get a helicopter and go under the map and just stay there for the whole game and that's you know it's cheating really isn't it sir it's exploiting the game so they just temporarily disabled them I suppose it's much easier to do that than try and fix the problem while everyone's in this working from home situation here is this on the shot stand tracking was off really bad behind that tree no went to the right where have you gthat's what I'm talking about that's it right there did you see how quick he went down you had an m4 as well yeah if there was another target I'd have to think about moving reloading moving really quick but the damage digest here so yeah did here someelse what are you doing it's not just a dead end there like it doesn't go anywhere does it look at the damage there say for this is a dead end okay spec of me I'm gonna give him the old thumbs up thank you for playing thank you for playing I don't know if like he must've heard that gunfire then well I've got 24 grams so I'm just gonna I'm gonna get the VSAT three UAV two later it's a really good strap for solos because you just get the lay of the land like I feel like I should go and clear that northern area there because the circle is gonna end up going you know roughly in that area known up ahead I did mark that because I saw oh hello that's quite a few hits there he's got a sniper though I mean come on come on that's a lot of damage you like it comes to the fire station yeah mark the hood there because there was a guy in there on L visa request recon flyover they've gnow yeah they've gMarvin let's stay here he went running back to the hut unless they're at the top no he's looking at me the sniper here I could try and take him out with it's a badness you know I don't like it sniper I'm gonna go get my own in that p90 back what's that airstrike no there we go gonna go get my sniper hey you're gonna get my HDR instead spelling this get an angle on this rock maybe here lights out sleep side my friend I feel like I should stick to my original plan here and just clear this north area if I reckon I mean it it's not definitely gonna happen but the circle might end up here it's 50/50 at this point but I did remember a couple people appear on the visa that's how it bounces down their fire behind me well I think he was pretty low but dropped in quite fast no I don't think the other guy that he was fine actually died then like he looked like he was still peeking out like peeking over that rock there didn't they so I reckon there's still more here so I'm just gonna wait they're gonna have to go soon because the gas is pushing Alma break look at this damage you gotta move Khan known in the tower again break again right snipe I'm kind of glad that he didn't push up towards me then I'm sure that everyone's left knows exactly where I am though now well I was wrong the circle went inland which means I'm in a terrible position right now I do see you horses in the roof each time this bloke and I get the worried bank know that house down there though I don't like that that dudes gonna revive by now not feeling that I'm just wiggling here so people don't get an easy hello and easy Xiaomi contact I think though because the gas is pushing in I should be all right behind me now but this is an awful position it's only three left we know ones in the yellow house in front of me up there and there's more unaccounted for there's somein here maybe that's them so we've got in yellow in red right there I'm sure that's quicker than like an mp7 or something who's the dude still in that house the door others only there's only left so it must have been that guy from the house that's the ghosty boy from earlier now would use my air strike but as you can see it's bugged so I'm just gonna push up to the left I'm just a better spot maybe they're probably just gonna stay in that building up there oh they're not running ghosts okay okay right and for 10-round SOCOM mags there it is pretty strong pretty strong in my opinion you do have to play really careful though and you've got to hit all your shots because if you don't you're stuck in a reload unless you've got a good secondary like I had at the start with the p90 there but that was really strong I feel like in squad stole you know a growl or m4 with 60 round man would perform better because you've just got so many shots and three people potentially nine armored pledges to get through know that m4 maybe isn't gonna cut it there but for chipping damage yeah if you're in a good spot solos though if you play in that kind of fashion can be really strong anyway try for more and I'll see you in the next
