Hipple had no fury than a giant robot scorned hey guys massacre wax here one of the best things to have come out of the channel in terms of fan interaction at least and general narrative inspiration has been that of the what-if roundtable livestreams these are my weekly streams where myself have rock and so Phoebe come together to news about what if ideas that you yourself have in mind and wish to hear our thoughts on while supporting the channel at the same time and ensuring that we may be able to continue to be giant nerds for years to come you can check these out usually on a Thursday or Friday afternoon Eastern so be sure to click the notification bell for this channel to be up to date now one idea that got action from these streams is our subject for today and it's one that got me really excited and keen to make more of as well as started in general I was asked by Dahl comics on Twitter to muse the idea about bomber joining the dragon team directly instead of simply being the tech support that's good and all but it could have done with something intrinsically more Ballmer asked she wouldn't have just become a fighter plain and simple she would have used her intellect in conjunction with new strengths and thusly we would get the additional comments from the roundtable and then posed the question which has become one of my favorite waters as of late what if bomber trained like Goku like I said it wouldn't be right if bomber just became strong and didn't use her intelligence and application of engineering to help accentuate her growing powers and physical gains with the advent of technology at a disposal as well as preventing the red ribbon army from dominating the market on earth and ensuring a monopoly for the capture called crew for generations bomber was able to use kit to amplify her power and then eventually make a suit back and act as an exoskeleton of sorts to push her powers even further but having said that it wasn't a straightforward turnkey operation it had its issues including some that seemed totally obvious or silly to not think about but the road to success is always paved with stumbling blocks and thusly it made things seem a little more organic rather than just making bomber suit perfect from the start yeah a total mare sooo in the last part bomber had managed to get out of her creative rut and use a technology from the same pod and then later Raddatz his armor to kick-start her latest developments which were vital since the sands of Vegeta and nappa were on their way to earth to see what a courser convert to fall but our heroes aren't aware of this back in the previous part now before we continue I and now let's get to the content so with the new status quo settling in capture Corp is a pretty busy place to be with Goku no Yamcha training with each other bola is locked into a recent spurt of creative endeavors her suit of armor is being augmented and enhanced with new innovations left right and center thanks to the same pod and the armor she then quickly remembered to pick up yes I did read the comments about not including that so thank you people out there for that potential oversight Radhika's armor was interesting it was stronger than her own armor but was completely flexible and stretchy unlike her more solid and metallic suit perhaps she could make some kind of composite material from this something that was stronger than any earth made material but also allowed for even more movement and flexibility and was less cumbersome and not to mention make her look good in it it's the complete package there's the propulsion system the ability to withstand heat from reentry into atmospheres stasis capabilities it was all here for ball to get to grips with but this wasn't the only thing that she would choose to innovate one day when bored Goku and Yamcha had finished training with the engineer then cooling off before going back to tinkering with her toys they all get a sudden buzz from Comi about something major about to happen and that they need to report to the lookout at once Bhama is a little uneasy since her new rockets on the suit hadn't been tested yet but she needs to test them eventually so no time like the present Carmy informs everybody that two beings with great power are heading to earth and they resemble the aura of the sands that they just fought Bhama is shocked that there are more of them but isn't too frightened in fact this has given her an idea as for the others Carmy has an idea that could work he offers to take Goku to King Kai's place in the other world to train but the Sailor says that he doesn't feel comfortable going on his own unless Yamcha tags along after having gotten used to and quite like training with Yamcha again also Goku doesn't have a place to go so he's got nothing better to do and nowhere else to be Yamcha then turns to bomber you want to tag along babe sounds like you could really benefit from this Bhama thinks for a moment and declines which surprises everybody Carmy sighs but accepts her decision and that's for the others they will train up the lookout as much as they can like in the original meanwhile piccolo was able to listen in to the whole thing go down and decides that maybe world domination can wait for now since there are now two more sands coming that maze thwart his plans to take over the world or do what he wants so let's get those interlopers out of the way before then going back to his original plan the training that happens between him and Gohan then occurs like it does in the regular timeline as Goku and Yamcha head on down snake way born the heads back to the factory and decides to think big if Goku is a Saiyan then maybe the things that happened to him in the past could happen to these new Saiyans too they might be able to turn into giant monkeys like Goku did back in the day if so then her regular suit might not be enough to offer brute force no matter how powerful it gets perhaps is a way to negate it hmm doctor briefs walks in and tells bomber that her favorite sci-fi show is about to start on TV she could do with a braid for sure and as she watches her weekly fix of action and superheroes she gets the idea that she had been looking for as soon as she sees it she then rushes back to the laboratory startling her father in the process and proceeds to lock herself away for weeks whilst also training physically by herself she has definitely gotten much more muscley and she starts to focus on her core strength and certain gestures and control schemes months pass and our different fighters are busy doing their thing Goku and Yamcha have mastered the art of the coyote with Goku then going even further to learn the spirit bomb which amazes the surfer dude martial artist the gang of commies look out having gained that much in comparison but has still come on leaps and bounds since when they started and even the duo piccolo and Gohan have been able to get some good games that's for bomber she is just about finished to a project and has primed it just in case something major happens now when it comes to her regular suit it has seen some advances too it is now much more sculpted to a frame with less rigid joints that connect each piece and it can now withstand pretty much anything that the capsule Corp R&D department can throw at it it is also waterproof for those who are watching the previous episode by the way that's for the multiplier it is now one that equates to a six times multiplier sustained instead of the 3.5 one sustained from the previous generation she had also trained on her own which makes her power level without the suit a maximum of about 500 over double what she was a year ago all this thanks to a newfound vigor and enthusiasm something that she hadn't felt in years mama isn't too worried with her suits lack of major increases an overall multiplier addition but she hadn't really been fully paying attention to a suit outright to be fair I mean she was keen but not that keen she was busy with a plan B which felt much more capable as being the ultimate last resort in case the monkeys pulled a fast one and grew big Carmy then tells bomber to report to the lookout telling her that Goku and Yamcha are on their way back from training supposedly and that Saiyans are just hours away from arriving it's best to get briefed up Bulma suits up and reports to the lookout with a new rocket boost working perfectly speeding her towards the destination at twice the speed of sound it's pretty gnarly to say the least and something that makes her giggle with mirth and excitement she did this she made the most powerful device on the planet her when she arrives the gang are pleased to see her but are a little disappointed that her power level isn't that big not even the left thousands which the others have been able to do bomber then just sighs and tells them that they keep forgetting that they can't sense the suits energy output she will prove how good her powers are on the battlefield there's a problem hey Tommy uh when did you say the Saints would get here in two hours why - oh I thought you said more than that call me then look shocked and turns away to carry on the conversation in private now once the call ends Connelly receives his composure and calmly states that Goku and Yamcha won't be getting here until after the sands are right because Goku forgot the time the Earthlings are on their own you idiot bomber punches the floor of the lookout leaving a noticeable crater and explosion in our wake the gang are left stunned so yeah that's the power of the suit huh not bad sure enough nappa and Vegeta are here and the gang managed to intercept them as the two of them were heading for pickle and Gohan's location the namekian having had the highest power level that was on the planet that was recognizable by the Scouters with the group of them bomber Krillin chiaotzu intention han the gang just about congregate before the elite show up piccolo looks to bomber and comments about why she hadn't come to rescue Gohan before now she then says that she can't kept an eye on them with a Scouter that she'd nabbed from Raddatz and had now integrated into her headpiece since your pals were going up just as much the others I assume that you had heard the news about the Biggles coming to earth so uh yeah you can't be all that bad piccolo grunts and refuses to admit that yeah that was kind of true but there's no time for that because the Saiyans are here they use their Scouters to read each person's power level and are curious that the strongest here is in the MEC Ian ah where is the girl that bested raddatz i wish to meet her and challenge her myself Boman gulps and steps forward tentatively nappa reads the scouter and it says five hundred what Raddatz lost of lad man I knew he was weak but I didn't think he was that stupid come on Vegeta let's scorch this planet and get out of here I have no time for weaklings like this don't be so hasty nappa why don't you use your pits to see what they can do then scorch the planet that's right the Cybermen are brought out and the gang fight all sick of them each of the fighters has to deal with them as dust bomber who actually makes like work of her one and proceeds to off the rest of them which confuses Napper a great deal hey what's going on bomber turns to Napa and reads his power 4,000 hmm it's gonna be tough but if she uses her surges correctly she could just about win that's the other one that's 18,000 that makes bomber gasps both horror she hopes that the little one doesn't intervene yeah it was me that after your friend what are you gonna do about it bomber says trying to Moscow understandable fear the fight is relatively equal with Napa having a slight advantage before she activates her first surge and gets a direct hit on Napa stomach causing him to collapse gasping for air this catches Vegeta's attention but he still lets his minion fight for him and this surge got what Ballmer wanted Nappers power is fading and this makes the fight more and more equal this was the right thing to do buying time for Goku Yamcha to arrive sensing Napa's fading energy the others pile in and proceed to devastate nappa and ultimately defeat him Vegeta is most impressed at this teamwork and watches his minion pass on from the result of the battle he then jumps in and proceeds to curb-stomp all the fighters with bomber and piccolo being the only ones who could put up any kind of resistance towards him Bulma then even tries to use a second surge which does nothing and Vegeta smirks what's the matter your tag let you down before mocking her out just then two power levels catch his attention as dokgo yong sure arrived to make their presence felt Yamcha tends the bomber as Goku then proceeds to begin his fight with Vegeta and that proceeds as in the original right up to the point where Vegeta transforms into his great a bizarro form bomber wakes up to watch the silhouette of the giant Vegeta before her and laughed to herself weakly just as I thought it's time she gets up gingerly and then shouts sire but that gen bar away a metallic door opens up from capsule core and out of it flies a giant version of the armor going at Mach 3 the SIA Buster mech in all of its glory arrives as Goku is being trashed by the giant Vegeta who can't sense the giant robot arriving because it doesn't have ki nor here the tiny little bomber shout out what he can sense though is the shaking of the ground as the robot lands now big thanks to Charles Lord for his idea about a giant robot being used here and everybody else loving it it makes so much sense and big up to him for the overall design as seen here he did a great job for those of you thinking that there won't be a giant robot in Dragonball well of course there would be Toriyama children loved Super Sentai so why not throw in something like Ultraman you know Toriyama actually loves driving things from pop culture why not bomber flies up to the robot and leaps in connecting her suit to the power grid and thanking her lucky stars that she has one surge left to help power the mech it gets into a stance and tells Vegeta that she will stop him with this new form but she too scoffs at this what this is just more lousy gadgets the SIA Buster does what it intends to do and busts Vegeta in the face knocking Goku out of his grasp before the two of them start to grapple for what seems like ages Goku gathers energy to power a giant spirit bomb which Vegeta tries to thwart with his tail but the other Dragon team members act as decoys as well as lending son energy themselves Bulma is giving it all that she's got and Vegeta is roaring with frustration [Music] by outsmarting me Prince Goku showed me something like this when he was a kid and so I figured that hey maybe it's best to go big her visor from above covers her face and her last surge is activated landing a major head but on Vegeta which is enough to make the Prince fall backwards and become disorientated which then in turn allows Goku to activate and throw the spirit bomb and it hits vegeta directly but it's not enough to destroy him it's enough to keep him down though and with that bomber uses the mech to cut off Vegeta's tail and he reverts back to his normal form but then the robot lets out a warning that it is about to overload which is bombers qtek get out of there she exits the suit and it flies back to base the deal is done so it would seem however but Jeter comes - and tries to get back to his pod barely able to move but Goku lands before him and the others letting him go bomber is at first shocked but then allows it which catches everyone off God bummer well people why are you letting him go bomber can sort of understand now what Goku thought and why he let piccolo go all those years ago it was a feeling of unfinished business sort of that and there was some kind of a yer that bomber had - Vegeta she wanted to see the prince again to fight yes but there was a mystique that she couldn't quite explain and as Vegeta is allowed to depart vowing revenge of course Goku falls to the ground completely and utterly exhausted Jonker is then keen to give bomber a hug and tells her about what he had learnt kaio-ken bomber has certainly had treated this and the two of them fly back to capture Corp to further train and the bomber to try and learn kaio-ken herself but the engineer can't shake the thought of the Jeter off and that's where we're going to be leaving things for right now so what do you guys think do you think that anything will come of these feelings how will kaio-ken factor into the development of the suit and now the giant sia buster leave a comment below and let's get this discussion going and I shall see you in the next video catch you later
