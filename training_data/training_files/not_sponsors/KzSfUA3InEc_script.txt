website or online store make it with squarespace if you clicked on this video you probably know who phil swift is and if you didn't click it for him you may have clicked it for me in which case thank you very much my ego will feast for another day and if you're here because of neither of those things how for those of you who don't know who phil swift is and perhaps for some of you who don't know who i am you might be more familiar with the product he is the spokesperson of flex tape a tape so strong it can apparently fix everything from boats to my broken and tattered self-esteem i know that joke conflicts with the one about me having a massive ego that i made just a second ago but shut up all i know is that at vidcon a man by the name of matthew ramster tv gaming productions decided to see if his role of flex tape could make my breathing hole stop doing the breathing thing we all know flex tape can do many things but deep down we're all wondering one question can it make quite stop breathing a lot more stable after the trump came virgin fuck off safe to say i'm still around nice try bitch but today's video isn't about flex tape it's about phil swift and more specifically about what antics that man manages to get himself into on the social medias namely instagram you've seen him do some whack ass shit like saw a boat in half and apparently fix it with flex tape i don't know what i'm supposed to do with this information about what flex tape is supposedly able to do but the point is is that some of that behavior most definitely carries over to his social media presence phil swift dot tv just gonna hit that follow button real fast philip swift inventor ceo and spokesman for the flex seal family of products followed by nolan dark and hoover of course fucking grandest of the suggested people to follow a phil swift that's fucking great as you can see a lot of these are videos here is a picture of one of only many countless boats who are a victim of phil swift's wrath okay let's see what we're doing with okay people it's that time again [Music] i need my coffee [Music] [Laughter] if i don't get my coffee soon i'm gonna create a lot of damage all of his fucking videos they start like with like really close up on his face and shit and it's all fucking videos fucking christ the madman the absolute fucking madman what i love so much about phil's instagram is that it's mostly video content that he's posting and all of those videos are recorded really close to phil swift's face so you don't miss a single detail of it it really makes me feel like i'm getting to know phil on a personal level i just really like that it looks like he's having fun something about it is just really innocent and pure there's some kind of mystery to be had in regards to where film might end up next as well like you never know what might be in the background at the very edges of the video in the only spots that phil's unforgettable head and face don't take over the entire screen at like sometimes phil is just presumably chilling in his office sitting in a chair other times he's standing up in what i assume are the flex tape offices depending on how he's feeling he might just fuck around and record a video in the middle of the ocean on one of the boats he puts a gigantic door-sized hole into but more importantly it seems like phil swift has accepted his status as a living meme detained by indirect help from the likes of jontron and jontron's son hoover and he has chosen to levy this internet fame status to grow himself even further the content of his videos reflects this meme status very strongly like one of his catchphrases is a that's a lot of and you see him say that's a lot of damage in a bunch of videos like here's him celebrating 500k followers approaching 500 000 followers that's a lot of damage he'll put that's a lot of damage in the description of things sometimes my question is in the original flex tape ads where he said that when he said that's a lot of damage we know what he was referring to what kind of damage he was talking about we knew that he was talking about the fact that he just stuck a fucking chainsaw in a bucket but my question here is when you say it on social media what type of damage are you referring to here bill the people want to know are your social media antics just a psychological experiment run by harvard like timmy thick was and is the damage being done to the minds of our youth who are consuming your content or is you saying that's a lot of damage commentary on the status of yourself as a meme in the landscape of memes as a whole nowadays and the damage that they do to our culture and society by helping to perpetuate the cycle of making memes about our problems instead of truly dealing with them and then making memes about how we'd rather make memes about our problems instead of dealing with them even though we actively know it's against our best interest to ignore them now of course it probably isn't that deep and humor is a very valid coping mechanism and making memes can be very much helpful in that regard and perhaps the memes and the problems themselves don't even go that deep and i'm over analyzing this what was it again right phil swift's instagram sometimes we get a behind-the-scenes look on the productions of flex whatever commercials like there's behind the scenes footage on phil's instagram that one time he saw that boat in half sometimes the stuff we see is more boats sometimes it's those boats actually on the ocean sometimes to spice it up phil will take a video next to a different motorized contraption like he took a video next to a land vehicle once that was a real mind blown moment for me what i think i really appreciate about phil is the lengths he will go to to try and get us an inside scoop as to what's going on so we have something to look forward to like he recorded on set one time without the rest of the crew knowing and that was pretty crazy my guy yo flex fans they don't know i'm recording this that's some top secret stuff happening you're gonna love it but at the end of the day what i really love about phil swift and everything he's got going on on his instagram is that it's just really wholesome seeming on the surface perhaps he has evil machinations going on below the surface but whatever it just looks like he's having a lot of fun with all of it and you know what that's just great there's actually one thing that phil said that really spurred me to action on something and i want to share some of his words with you here hey flex fans happy sunday out here getting a good sweat on hard work pays off hard work pays off flex on hard work pays off hard work pays off flex on very wise words and for me i have to ask myself what is it that i want to work towards and personally i think i know exactly what i want to be in life i want to be phil swept so in order to get there i think we need to learn just what he does that's right everybody it's time to take everything we've learned from watching phil swift's instagram videos and to apply this knowledge to ourselves we're going to be making our very own phil swift instagram video so let's recap what we're gonna need shall we the first thing we're gonna need is our trusty inward facing phone camera and no i can't use the camera that i'm recording this video with i gotta post this shit on instagram do you know how much of a hassle it is to get the footage off the camera by copying and pasting it off the sd card and then putting it on my phone so i can upload from mobile not that much work but i still don't feel like doing it plus we want to get that authentic selfie feel so we're going for the phone cam loser the next thing we need to worry about is the environment that we record the video in now this one is tricky because like i said where phil swift records his videos is completely unpredictable so the environment changes a lot and seeing as i'm trapped in a box there's only so much leeway that we have in that matter what we do know though is that when phil records in the studio it's usually with a blue screen somewhere in frame or in that video and we have not a blue screen but a green screen and it's fucking sick because thanks to this bad baby we can go anywhere including inside your mind next we need to replicate the angle that phil records that we need to make sure that we're recording decently close to our face so that our very being overtakes the screen almost entirely until there's no room for the viewer to do anything but observe what's happening on their phone and also we should probably record at an angle that makes it hard to see where my theoretical nose would be on my face if i had a nose to be on my face and the very last thing we need to recreate to make our very own phil swift video is the dialogue and phil is one of the greats of our generation he is like gandhi like martin luther king jr before him he is humble thankful for what he has he motivates us to work for what we want and he also has great eyebrows a common through line of everybody i just mentioned all right let's give it a
