according to Tesla's website they are starting hardware three upgrades for cars that currently have hardware two which is big news because up until now it's only been Hardware 2.5 - Hardware 3 and while this is really exciting there's a little more that goes into it for hardware - owners than just getting that full self-driving computer and unless tesla announces something else it may lead to hardware - owners needing to pay for another upgrade in order to get all the false left driving features that they're expecting so let's talk about the difference between hardware to hardware 2.5 and hardware 3 and what you're gonna have to do to go from hardware - to hardware 3 and get all the features that you want if you enjoy this video please hit like and get subscribed so according to Tesla's website they are now scheduling upgrades for hardware - cars to go to hardware 3 now I'll start off by saying if you have a model 3 all model 3 is initially shipped with Hardware 2.5 and MCU 2 which we'll talk more about in a second there are no Tesla Model 3 s that have hardware - or MCU one so after Mobileye and Tesla split apart Tesla had to design their own self-driving suite of hardware and software that led to Tesla's enhanced autopilot with hardware - when buying a car in the hardware two days owners could either buy enhanced autopilot for five thousand or add-on full self-driving for three thousand for a total price of full soft driving of eight thousand dollars now back then full self-driving was no different spending that extra $3,000 just got you the promise of future software updates and Tesla did say if you need any hardware upgrades in the future you'll also get those included with that $3,000 since then a lot has changed but basically these days the cars come with standard auto pilot which is Lane keep assist and speed keep and if you want any of the more advanced features like navigate an autopilot smart summon Auto Park things like that you have to pay an additional seven thousand dollars or starting in July an additional eight thousand dollars for fall soft driving so hardware two came out in 2016 and in 2017 Tesla made some upgrades to hardware two and they called it Hardware 2.5 this included an updated radar and a different filter on the cameras so the cameras are the same they're the same amount of cameras and they're in the same spots in hardware 2.5 besides the model 3 got the in cabin one which the s and X still do not have to this day but the cameras got an additional filter so in hardware - the cameras are black and white and in her 2.5 the cameras can see color well after this change in 2018 along with the model 3 Tesla upgraded the MCU or media control unit and that is called MCU 2 so all current Tesla's ship with MCU 2 and this gives you a faster processor a redundant GPU and some other improvements but it allows things that new Tesla vehicles give you like Century mode recording dashcam recording all the games you get the Netflix YouTube all that kind of stuff along with just general improvements the performance of MCU 2 when you're just using the screen moving around the map stuff like that is much smoother there is no lag where if you use an older MCU one car it's a little laggy the screen isn't very responsive and things like that well after this change Tesla announced another upgrade to their autopilot hardware which brings us to what's shipped in cars today hardware 3 well that hardware 3 upgrade just upgrades the autopilot computer and gives you much more processing power so if you have hardware 2.5 in your SX or 3 it's as simple as swapping that out you can take your car to Tesla they say it takes about an hour for me it took about 24 hours most people say it takes 3 or 4 hours for them but the process is always changing so that time may be different now so if you purchased your car and you purchase full self-driving and your car had Hardware 2.5 eventually Tesla is supposed to contact you or they already did you take your car to them or some people are actually having Tesla come to them at home or work and they can replace that board for you and then boom you have hardware 3 there is no difference in that car from a new car rolling off the line with hardware 3 now I do get this question very often if you want your hardware 3 upgrade and you have Hardware 2 or hardware 2.5 whatever you can go into your Tesla app go to the schedule service section and then just click other at the bottom something else hit next in this window you want to type Hardware 3 upgrade and then you hit next you put in your location if you want to do it at home or work you can schedule that and Tesla will get back to you but keep in mind this is VIN dependent so if your VIN has not been called for the hardware 3 upgrade Tesla will not be able to do it they are not just putting random computers into cars they are assigning Hardware 3 to specific cars and when your vin is called they sometimes will let you know and have you come in but if they don't and you request it and your vin is called then they'll say ok you're good come on in let's do that hardware 3 upgrade again for me I had to leave my car overnight I actually left it there for two days but these days I hear it's going a lot faster and sometimes Tesla will even come to you to do the service so hardware 2.5 to hardware three upgrades have been happening for a few months now I got mine upgraded back in January or February I believe so until we got some recent updates with visualizations on the screen and now the new are stopping at stop signs and stoplights hardware 2 and hardware 2.5 and hardware 3 weren't all that different Hardware 2 can still do navigate on autopilot it can do smart summon but cars with hardware 2 incidentally do not have MCU 2 they only have MCU 1 so those cars cannot do things like play cuphead youtube netflix they do have sentry mode but the sentry mode doesn't actually record anything it's more just to deter people it puts the message on the screen but none of the cameras will actually record what's going on they don't have the dash cam feature while you're driving and because of some of the differences I talked about earlier hardware 2 is missing just a few things that hardware 2.5 and hardware 3 have so a bit weaker radar the steering rack I guess is a little different I don't know the details on that the wirings a little different and there's not as much redundancy as in hardware 3 so up until now nobody has been upgraded from hardware to to hardware 3 even though they could about their car 4 years ago paid that extra $3,000 so a total of 8,000 for full self-driving they can't use any of the full self-driving features yet until Tesla gives them this hardware 3 upgrade so what is Tesla gonna do are they gonna change out the cameras or the filters on the cameras are they gonna upgrade the radar are they gonna upgrade the steering rack I can't imagine they're gonna do any of those things well it's all possible it doesn't seem very likely Tesla would do any of this now I don't think they would sacrifice safety but I do think they would sacrifice features to save a little bit of money so Green on Twitter actually found hints that Tesla was working towards hardware to to hardware 3 upgrades in the code but he said that he also found evidence that they are not going to update that radar they are not going to update the steering rack but the bigger problem I'm seeing here is that MCU discrepancy so if you have MCU one you can't even get the visualization on the screen now could Tesla enable this for MCU one of course it's possible but it's not as powerful as a processor you're already not getting as good of an experience when you're just interacting with the map let alone doing other things like trying to use the browser you can't watch YouTube while parked you can't use Netflix you can't play any of the games well you can play some of them but most of the games aren't accessible even on the website when you talk about purchasing full self-driving Tesla says you'll get access to more advanced driver assists features like navigate an autopilot smart summon on a lane change in Auto Park and then they go on to say the full self-driving computer upgrade does enable recording from all cameras with sentry mode and dashcam from vehicles previously equipped with autopilot computer 2 or 2.5 paired with the infotainment upgrade now what's the infotainment upgrade well that's upgrading your MCU from MCU 1 to MCU - and that costs twenty-five hundred dollars to do from Tesla so three four years ago you buy a Tesla you spend eight grand for enhanced autopilot in full self-driving and now finally comes the day you get your hardware three upgrade alright we're gonna stop at stop signs and stoplights we're gonna be getting our century mode I'll wait you don't have to spend an additional $2,500 if you want to unlock those games century mode maybe the visualizations on the screen there's no way to know yet so that's a little crazy because if you buy a Tesla today you're spending seven thousand on full smart driving today you get MCU - you get all the full self-driving features you get hardware three and then in a little over a month in July the price is going up to eight thousand so not even until July if you wait until July to order your Tesla then you have to pay eight thousand for false off driving you're on the same page as all the people who bought their full self-driving three or four years ago but you're still getting the MCU upgrade and you're paying 8,000 whereas these people now have to pay an additional twenty five hundred to get all the features get their car up to date I mean it's pretty crazy and somebody has to pay for it and you know I guess Tesla can say you're getting the full self-driving features we told you you're gonna get you're just not gonna get Sentra mode you're not gonna get these games or whatever I guess technically they are delivering on their promise that they made when you paid that 3,000 your car will stop at stop signs and stoplights you'll get future updates that allow navigate in the city and stuff like that so I don't know kind of exciting news but at the same time a tiny bit of a letdown you know if you invested in Tesla earlier on you paid all that money from full self-driving you've been waiting all these years to have features that differentiate you from enhanced autopilot because back in the day you pay that five thousand dollars for enhanced autopilot you got everything up until today you were getting everything besides the visualizations on the screen and the stop signs the stoplights you got smart summon you got never get an autopilot you had Auto Park you had all the same stuff so at this point you still haven't gotten any benefits for your additional $3,000 I mean imagine in 2016 you put that $3,000 into Tesla stock it was floating around in the 200s and your $3,000 today would be worth over 10 grand you could buy that MCU upgrade you could buy full self-driving and you'd still have more money and you wouldn't have missed out on anything all these years so if you have an older Tesla with hardware - let me know your thoughts on this you do have MCU one if you have hardware - you also could have MCU one with hardware 2.5 there was a little bit of a overlay there where you were getting hardware to point five but also MCU one so I don't know it's gonna be a little weird for those guys - because they'll get their hardware three upgrade but they still won't have sentry mode they still won't have you know the games and stuff so let me know if you're gonna do that upgrade if you're gonna pay the 2500 for MCU 1 if you think this is fair not a big deal maybe to you it doesn't matter I'm really interested in your thoughts on this one I'll be talking to you down in the comments and you will see me in the next video so auto pilot and I are happily driving along [Music]
