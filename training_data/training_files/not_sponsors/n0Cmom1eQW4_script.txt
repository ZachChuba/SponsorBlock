they are so close let's pull up the oh my gosh everybody my Carolyn right so that's that batteries on the bridge had a lot of fun driving across everybody now I have to make mistakes in front of you guys I can't it's a mouth it's kind of sucks what is going on everybody I am packing up for a little road trip we're doing tomorrow me and my buddy Aaron if you watched my delivery video from well over a year ago he came and picked up my model 3 with me he ended up actually getting a mount of three himself but anyway tomorrow we're going to Mackinac City for batteries on the bridge which is just a cool little event where a bunch of Tesla's are at noon tomorrow Saturday July 11th are gonna be driving across the bridge all together there's a meet-up at the new version three supercharger in mackinaw city before that so we're gonna head out pretty early I'm recording this the night before because whenever I make these videos and it's like 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning I'm like super boring and tired it's not that long of a trip it's about 250 or 260 miles to get there so you think out a hundred percent charge you know we can make it one go but that's probably gonna happen so I'm currently at 93 percent and it's showing two hundred and eighty miles which really should be 288 but that's not actually too bad I'm not gonna complain about that I was actually gonna thinking of charging to 100% overnight I may still do it just because I like to do every once in a while just to see not that it matters all that much I've just kind of noticed on this version whatever version we're on here 20 20 20 4.6 that for my ending charges have been a little low and this one actually ended stop the charge at 277 and has continued to kind of creep up even though it's not charging anymore I've noticed that happening a lot I don't know if that's because it's summer or because I haven't been charging the 98 percent very often but I'm starting to Kurt a subscriber who I'm gonna be meeting tomorrow and he was like alright I'm gonna charge my car up to 100% and then leave in the morning I was like no don't do it so like 95 percent and finish in the morning and then I was like it probably doesn't matter that much and so I was kind of thinking to do it myself just to kind of see what happens but so I'll probably be meeting some of you there it's gonna be super fun really exciting so I guess let's just get to the next day all right we are heading out here pretty much exactly on time which is crazy we're supposed to get to Aaron's house about 6:30 says 6:30 for probably cut a couple minutes off that and then from there we're heading straight to Mackinac stop at one supercharger on the way I didn't want too much charge when we get to that first supercharger and I also kind of want to arrive at our destination with a low charge because I really want to try those version 3 superchargers because they get thousand miles an hour charging but you got to be near the bottom end of the battery so we'll check those out let's do this hi you know my car was really clean I don't want to disappoint everybody here they're gonna meet me and see my car and be like what the heck is this this isn't dirty at all also one more thing I want to mention before we get there I'm using my mic right now that I always strapped to my seatbelt but when Aaron's here I probably won't use it because it's unidirectional and you won't be able to hear him if he's not wearing it so hopefully the audio will be OK at that point I think it should be fine alright still heading over to pick up Aaron but I was just trying our route you know approximately I'm almost at his house so this will be pretty close and I just routed straight to the Mackinaw City supercharger and the car wants us to stop in Bay City get up to 58% it says about a 20 minute charge it's probably closer to 15 minutes I think it rounds to the 5s and then it says we'll arrive with 12% which is perfect that's what I want you'd think total trip 253 miles 266 is what my car says but at highway speeds of course you're not getting that so this is pretty perfect although I told my car if you look here that have the 18 inch arrow wheels without caps which is really close to what I do actually have I have the Martian wheels 18 inch wheels no arrow caps on those and they're actually lighter than the stock wheels so that probably would work out pretty well but I'll probably get this maybe closer to 15% estimated arrival just to be safe and that should allow why you stopping and that should allow us to get there with a low state of charge try out those version 3 superchargers right overhead now we're about to we actually been trim for a few minutes but we busted in on the highway talking about Cypress rock and all this sweet stuff did you do you still make videos I we're gonna make okay check out Aaron's YouTube channel charging charging chats yep okay you're really gonna be rebranding it I know I know this is the Tesla Whisperer because he makes his videos when his babies are sleeping see okay here's you know I'm always talking about my huge baby how old is Louis oh he is a year turned a year in April okay and Reese is about 300 so my giant baby she is about to turn one so April May June July so she's about three months younger than Louis and she's way taller than him right oh yeah so that's why there's nothing wrong with that I'm just saying that's why I was calling she's gigantic me and she's really hungry so this video is fine I'm just kidding it's not a sponsored video so nope we should be okay all right so it says 51% for Bay City and and 12% pretty much the exact same I did some reporting on the way here and that's what it said so I'll most likely aim for this to say 15% before we take off from Bay City and this is a version three supercharger version two is here so we are we got 28 minutes left supercharger the first one which is sweet it says 47% so this is kind of why I want it to say more than 12% because it said 51% we arrived at the first took charge when we left but now it's saying 47 so he lost 4% which really isn't that bad I guess in for bust 4% here we get there with 8% I know you want to risk it I'll push it hit the route let's get there were like 5% do it all right let's small risk it we'll get there maybe 95% I'll let it say I don't know because there might be a lot of Tesla's there and then I won't be able to judge will be stuck I'm stuck there forever that's that's a really good point oh wow we're exiting already that's really crazy I didn't notice how many miles are drove if you look back in the video you know don't tell you what it was estimated but I didn't really do anything that whole time I was tempted to make that a Tesla challenge but I seriously set my hand on the wheel and like oh look at night I screw up I say that I see oh yes ladle the breaks as he passed them nope alright that's an aggressive move but I'll take it fine with that so yeah like that whole Drive I think I changed lanes like twice and that was it so that was pretty tight I didn't even know where we're going I was paying attention all I just watch the road sounds really nice so yeah we're into this first supercharger I don't know how much longer we have to go wow that's the exit I didn't even know this is sweet I'm sorry that you're kind of behind the GoPro so heading to this first supercharger and it says you know I don't know if I should just put % here I should just get over the miles this is we're gonna have 46% when we arrive and I don't know what percentage it wants us to charge to yeah it'll be good so we're in base city I don't think I've ever been to this supercharger so be afraid have you been here oh yeah well just last week okay after all when you went to maginot yeah Ponderosa guys if you're watching this and you thought that Ponderosa was out of business it's right there hey city I never been there come on well when when restaurants are open or whatever maybe we'll go so Bay City supercharger yeah it said 20 minute charge I'm sure it's gonna be much less than that I just hope it looks like there's a gas station right here so looks like there's a gas station right here we might stop in there and use the bathroom or something or what is this oh it's a mitre oh right away why didn't I know that like all the Michigan super chargers are at Meijer so this is good we can stop in here and get something if you want or just use the bathroom then we'll be off oh my gosh oh these guys look at this these guys are definitely heading up to Mackinac with us but nobody's in there I actually last week I've seen a why here oh really yeah that's so exciting alright that's I think this is a good stall number to spread out everybody don't be at a different stall than your neighbor than the other Tesla's all right we're starting to charge probably won't get that many kilowatts because the battery now is pretty full at this point and it says 25 minutes remaining before we leave for our next destination but we'll see about that I'm actually gonna change this display two percent so when this says we're gonna arrive with you know like 15 percent or so twelve percent then we'll take off oh it's so bright you gotta teach me I don't know how to use this thing actually the mic is facing wrong direction so I'm super quiet right now but uh I don't know how to use this and like my exposure like is always look at that yeah alright what's up how's it going guys checking out the GoPro yeah stick it in I got to make another video so today alright we go and they bring my drone - all right so we're done charging we're at says 13 percent left we're gonna unplug and head out yeah can we go errands eating an apple it's gonna be it's gonna do great for your audio the Apple yeah just nice big crunch so we're heading up we have 13% one more percent and Tesla suggested but that's alright we're definitely not gonna get there with 13 percent a lot of speeding we're going like 78 the speed limit is either 70 or 75 and we are just people are flying by us so you know it's kind of like we'll go a little faster but I don't like to speed too much tickets are just not worth it alright so we are just to update got an hour 40 left or probably I really want coffee so we're probably going to stop for coffee percentage is getting a little bit low all boys 6% arrival we could I mean you know we could do it but like if you stop for coffee and do this other stuff I don't know there is another supercharger on the way I think in Gaylord so maybe we'll stop there I know okay six percent so we're gonna hovering again when we left us at 12 percent now say Sergei if there were seven but we can probably push it I don't know I always wait for like trucks like that back so we don't stop we should be good if we stop up again in charge for a few minutes but I just I hope we get there with like 10 percent or less that's really what I want so we can get full 250 kilowatts we got the message stay below 80 to reach your destination so it knows it's getting close we have not been above 80 or for a second that really yeah then it goes away so it's gonna be flipping back and forth 5% we can just slow down but I don't really want to do that oh these cones are like kind of my lane I'm trying not to interact with the car and okay sitting like that one's the lane but the cars doing pretty good I just wired that comes in the lane what are they thinking no yeah it's gonna it's fine it won't run into a cone though if they are so close let's pull up the oh my gosh I'm looking they're having some nuts oh that looks like fully in the lane all right ready oh no turn autopilot on but it's gonna go to the left when I do it oh my gosh this is you gotta trust autopilot everybody it's how to take a map look at this look at this camera I can't look at it but how close how close are they can you tell yeah we're done with that game yeah so now it says 8% we had to slow down a bit therefore that Turkoman hit that cone area because there was one lane and everything so that helped us and since the percents going back up I was also looking at this energy graph based off the last 30 miles we have bought 80 miles of range left and we only have 62 to go so we should be good I'm gonna pass this am i but I still want to stop for coffee maybe we'll see if there's like a McDonald's or something on the way [Music] good we made our exit actually missed our exit which kind of freaked me out because we only have 12 monster but you left enough like are we gonna make it but the bridge is over there somewhere if you can can they see that no probably not you could see it for a minute but the GoPro was not a battery so yeah I kinda messed that up but it's alright we are headed to the supercharger we will be there point 8 miles with 12 miles left so yeah we are good yeah so I missed the exit whatever so so yeah we should be good really a little bit I have not had my battery this low and I don't probably since the last time I made a video about charging which was like probably six months ago or something but we're gonna get really fast charging speeds here at this version 3 supercharger I'm really excited to see that yeah we got some spots open oh yeah people parked on both sides oh yeah suppose that version 3 sharing doesn't matter let's just go to 1a here and check it out vehicle consumes battery want power is idle we recommend charging alright so here we go let's do it what do we got here oh we're going just 30 minutes 120 this is not what I paid for alright here we are we got 250 kilowatts charging this is insane over a thousand miles an hour I guess it just took some time to ramp up while we're already at 45 miles it was I don't know a couple minutes you can look at the clock we were at 13 miles so really good super exciting we'll let it charged up I'll probably lower this just a little bit I guess 90 is fine for now but we can maybe charge it up some more but yeah that is really exciting another cool thing let me show you just in case you haven't used a version three these are way thinner these cables are way thinner than what you find at other superchargers so didn't really affect anything also that it was funny there's like already a spiderweb here I don't know if you can see that but these things are brand new and still spiders all over the place so we got a few cars charging here and oh another one pulling up so it's gonna be oh my gosh this exposure is terrible I need my cameraman over here it's gonna be I think a really good day [Music] by more people pulling up those wheels are sick I've not seen those in person I'm loving it my car is over here screaming must be really hot it's about 80 degrees out her cell and we're at 150 kilowatts so that's the max speed of a version - pretty much so still looking really good we're already at 133 miles is it you it's Kurt or meetup here this is Kurt no it's the hello hello everybody I've been I've been talking to this guy for over a year on Instagram mostly and he wanted he didn't have a model three he wanted to check mine out and then I just we had the baby and I can make an excuse I couldn't make it but I'm so happy to finally meet you oh it's awesome very cool and I love your wheels I was filming as you're pulling off one of these a wheel Oh awesome thank you thank you we're heading out Aaron's audio we just loved the supercharger lots of really nice people hello to everybody that I met there that was just so fun it's a little awkward because like people know my face but I don't know yeah but it was nice to be introduced to you and say hi and everything so we're hitting the bridge I actually don't know where we're going I'm just following the fleet of Tesla's all right so following everybody heading over to the bridge then we're gonna meet at the bridge View Park mm-hmm and take a picture or something maybe get the drone up get some more footage there yeah they bring in 360 cables oh sweet yeah dude do it up I don't know how to use that but you know look at them go oh my gosh it just looks so cool please don't let me be the one to break the line no oh no we're good all right we didn't break the line we got our buddy behind us here Chris Chris is behind us [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay all right we just flew that freaking drone oh my gosh oh we had to get the drone footage of yeah that was still recording all right that was insane all right so we made it across the bridge after some scary drone flying being stuck in traffic but really nice views here and we got almost all the Tesla's lined up that person is just kind of like chillin in their car right so that's that battery's on the bridge had a lot of fun driving across everybody now I have to make mistakes in front of you guys I can't it's a mouth it's kind of sucks so Matt who runs the Tesla owners of Michigan Twitter account it's going to set this up for next year so we're gonna be doing this every year so hopefully more people can come out I didn't really spread it that much I didn't do a great job of that the next time I'll give people some more fair warning and hopefully next time I'll see you and we can meet up I think we'll finish the road trip should I finish the road trip or should this be the end of the video I'm getting shrugs all right well I think we'll finish the road trip and so let's see how the drive home goes what do you think it's awesome all right so we're going back over the bridge heading back home we're gonna get some food we're gonna use I'm feeling hungry never actually use that to find food itself that'll be fun we'll try it out my current struggling struggling it doesn't know what to do it's great all that inching here now there you go it's forced it's over because of the cones so funny all right this kids fine I mean I'll take it it listen to the cones that's the important thing right this out let's do it getting hungry feel it hump your foot is it gulps Darrow's family restaurant makes it egypt's bar like fish and chips I think yep all right right so we're heading to where the heck are we what is this something Bay Bay City Bay City Bay City supercharger to charge up before we head home and we'll be done this Drive was really easy I think you know I made some lane changes but I think for as far as autopilot goes I think I took over once during that just to let somebody merge onto the highway and move over for them other than that super easy a lot of fun driving across the bridge and get some cool footage and the weather was so nice that water was awesome it was really good time so this is so fun it was interesting you brought out this point earlier that it was all model 3 oh yes yeah there were no s X anything like that so yeah I thought that was kind of strange it's he's moving out of the way and I actually just saw some news that they reduced the model my price really yeah starting price I don't know what it is I just thought of my watch for a second so I'll have to check that out don't people man pulling in with 37 miles of range and I like this I like this getting here with a really low range kind of thing I feel like we're making the best use of our time so we won't be here very long I think it's another 20 minute charge and then we're dropping you off we're done yeah so that'll be it thanks a ton for watching Thank You Aaron for joining me absolutely this was a lot of fun why is that okay I was like why is he pulled forward said a model s model s so oh man there's a lot Tesla's here awesome those are the 19th all right sweet so we're charging up here we're pretty much at full-speed 140 kilowatts I think we're sharing what this why but they were here first so they would get the most feed they may almost be full or whatever but yeah 140 kilowatts so that's a pretty good speed so I think we'll call it there thank you for watching thanks for coming mayor yeah see ya hopefully if we do this next year actually I will say I'm planning on setting up some type of Michigan meet at the end of August don't want me do that too much because I'm really busy and I might not get around to it but that's what I really want to do so if we do that hopefully I will see you there now we're gonna start an official Michigan hunters Club so that's it thanks so much for watching and you will see my car in the next video see
