When She Gets Excited Shuhua Moves Her Body
When She Gets Excited Soyeon Gets Excited with Her Mouth
Instead of Moving Her Body How can you do that to NEVERLAND? Hey, stand up! You should dance with us! Minnie and Yuqi wrote the song. (Curious)
Tell us how it was~ Since it's my first time
to work with Yuqi... Be careful what you say! It was great fun. She's saying it
because the camera is here. Honest Minnie
Actually, it was very hard. I Told You to Be Careful Any pledge for this song, Yuqi? Pledge? I won't make a pledge now. She promised to shave her head
for 1st place on Billboard. Yuqi with a Gut Promised
to Shave Her Head This time, I'll cut my hair, then.
(Somehow Teary Voice...?) (Really surprised) Did you film her just right? If we take 1st place with this song. Congrats, Minnie & Yuqi's Song 1st Place If we see a ghost when working with a song,
