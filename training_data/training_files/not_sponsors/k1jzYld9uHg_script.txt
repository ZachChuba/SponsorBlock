good boy it works it works there's absolutely nothing here [Laughter] hello commanders recently I was scrolling through Reddit and I came across a very clever post of a find my commanders who wish to remain anonymous apparently they found the location of the dark wheel station let me show you how our galaxy has many systems that are locked behind the permit some are obtainable others are not some have novice some have nice benefits to them others are useless there are three types you have by Federation permits which you can obtain unknown permits which are unobtainable and security permits there are only two of these in the galaxy and they are also unobtainable even if you don't have a permits that you want use but you still wish to check out the system you can usually buy the data in order to be able to view it you can only buy data while docked so many permit lock systems were out of reach but now that we have mobile landing pads everything changed just park your carrier within 20 light-years of a permit lock system and you can buy the data note that this is an obvious glitch and probably will get patched most systems are scannable this way but not all anyway we now have the data for every inhabited permit lock system the commanders who found all this believe that this data archive as the final piece of evidence needed to pinpoint location of the dark wheel station let me explain the theory comes down to three main points that each narrow down the possible location if we are looking for a hidden station what clues do we have and 3302 I believe Jack station attempted to jump towards Vigo point but due to a massive amount of targets answer being sold there he had a mess jump back in the day targets target commodities used to damage stations and Kosmo functions so eventually nobody knew where he was so frontier had planned a way for us to find him by putting together like transmissions that he sent out but he was eventually found by commander who simply let his population filter on while checking out to nebula this random on export system displayed an economy a population and an allegiance there is no law justification for how the galaxy map would somehow know Jack's location at that time this suggests that there is an in-game limitation that you cannot hide evidence of a station of a stations presence on the galaxy map so the dark wheel station should be subject to the same exact limitations no so our first point is if the dark news station exists the discovery of the jak station suggests that dark bean station must be present in a system that reports and Allegiance and an economy to the minimum to the galaxy map this means that we can now ignore systems listed as uninhabited the codex tells us that it is futile to attempt to contact the dark wheel of one's own initiative however it is they who always initiate contact initially in the skies revealing their true identity once a suitable test of courage and skill has been squidly administered and passed does imply that you cannot simply stumble across the station it is futile you have to go through these tests at which point the station is revealed to you as proof of their identity now how would have dev implement that a permit granted on completion of the tests is ideal choice anything else who would run into problems with multiplayer instance things such as bringing people in or traveling to the station instance in which space but permits cannot be shared if we assume that finding the dark wheels the first step on the plan to finding rack slot then this would fit in with frontiers previous comments about being a journey that everyone must take from themselves where is ranks you can just read the location online and go there you have to pass the tests so our second point is information from frontier and the Codex suggests that the dark wheel station is very likely to be located within a permit lock system and that's obtaining the permit is a reward for passing tests and being invited the codex also tells us that the darkness station is rumoured to be around the 8th moon of a gas giant so that will be our third point the system where the darkest station is located must contain a gas giants with at least eight moons each of these points help us narrow down the search and with the archive of permit maps we have all the information we need to apply each point points 1 & 2 together now we went down to permit locked inhabited systems there are six let's see if they fit the description first one has a single planet no gas giants or moons second has a single planet no gas giants or moons third contains a number of gas giants but none with eight moons fourth has two planets no gas giants or moons fifth can be disregarded here as we know its purpose already it is the site of the mega ship overlook HQ of the black flight organization now the sixth has a gas giant with eight moons can this be it LF t 509 is the only system in the galaxy to satisfy all three points if all the three points are true this is the location of a darkman station obviously for this theory to be proven we would have to be able to see the station on the map the fact that we can't and yet the galaxy map shows signs of there being a station present leads us to one of the two possibilities the darkness station is present and out of to.5 that the unique mechanic is in place to hide it from the system map that way even when you arrive you still have to seek out the station or dark wheel station is only partially implemented in the game signs of its planned properties remain at the game but it was never truly added there has to be a station there in some form for galaxy map to report the economy and allegiance there it does above the five of nine that's all three points for the tork real station let me know what you think in the comments down below I'll also leave a link to the original reddit post in the description leave a like if you enjoyed the video and take care yeah guys while finishing up this video I was told that this glitch for buying data is already fixed so we cannot buy permit log data anymore but yet we have all the facts and all the three points are still true [Music]
