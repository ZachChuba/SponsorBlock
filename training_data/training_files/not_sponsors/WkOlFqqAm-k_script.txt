of course the pressures off now because friends in the tower watching this they're going to expect a decent landing for me here is it me or is that a Malaysian Airways aircraft is waiting for me to lane alright just a normal landing step just a normal landing okay Yankee Zulu cleat direct Melbourne s 3,000 passing 2500 contact departure the 1 to 9 a decimal for clear Melbourne rate 3000 to AB 2501 tune item for a cognac you doing all right there's an incredible words to hear cleared Melbourne direct echo Yankees early oh here we go [Music] uncaps is now available feel pups days are let's turn to our track I'll track director Mel bird that's the still sounds weird to say that beautiful body for it gosh it's still up here alright everything's looking good temperatures and pressures are looking good 20 miles to help it because we're gonna be going in and out of controlled airspace and obviously cuz we going into like a big International Airport like Melbourne today what I've done is files two flight plans one to get into Melbourne which is an IFR flight plan so we're going to leave Moorabbin climb up to 3,000 feet and then fly into tullamarine IFR and hopefully you think it's cross if they can get us down and get us to land and maybe even taxi around the airport a bit what I've been done is filed a VFR flight plan to fly out again it just makes it a little bit easier on the control Thank You Julie Melbourne the Panthers identified spec vectors are both runway three or four advise when you put up your mobile information tango company we have tango and I'll expect early take a thank you do it alright god I got a photo Thank You lieutenant left heading two seven zero lap two seven zero echo you can do it alright left two seven zero so we're gonna go to heading mode now on the autopilot now we're following so we're ignoring the GPS track now we're actually just following headings following vectors I keep saying headings Prada weak vectors from air traffic control also if we're gonna go three four right what I can do here other brilliant Garmin is like a go procedure approach approach Velva and we're gonna go vectors so we'll just go visual Bree for load approached by low-fat and then here on the back page let's see I get this extended center line of three four so I know when I'm going to be on the scent liner but I'll probably get turned in to do a nice straight in approach for three four oh my god with line to Melbourne International Airport I don't think I could get across how excited I am right now I'm focusing and I'm concentrating hard this is a it's still busy airspace it's not as busy as it normally is but that my hometown to my right the main International Airport that I flight and our visit passenger and I'm about to add my own plane that is quite an epic moment something and I could sink you dilute and run hitting three zero zero Airport runway three four and turn right three zero zero and runway in sight okay activity thank you do we check the file or am only three four am i blowing huh okay final runway three-pointer I'm just loading the tower frequency next which I think should be one two zero five and slows down a little bit oh we don't need to race through and also I want to enjoy this so I want to slow down a little bit thinking thank you do agree to operate normally injury for visual approach runway three four okay Zulu all right go away autopilot I've ever in the fun a visual approach for runway three four at Melbourne International Airport holy moly all right so I've got a slows down now what I'm looking for is around 120 knots now plead for the visual approach that means I can descend as required and the good thing about the Garmin GTN 650s on here is they now give me a glide slope set up on here even though this isn't an ILS this is all done through GPS again clearly contact a120 a telephone what c05 okay in kazooie all right here we go contacting Melbourne tower tower echo Yankee Zulu is our visual final rub a 3/4 Yankee Zulu moment and Bri Landing checks brakes other carriages down lock mixed a full rich fuel pumps are everything secure secure secure we go we're below flap speed so we can do that now okay Yankee Zulu wins 3 5 0 degrees 8 knots runway 3 4 cleared to land here I wait 3 4 clear land echo Yankee Zulu and we've been cleared to land at Belvin International Airport they're going to expect they're going to expect a decent landing for me here especially because there's no whip at least divide across we don't have an excuse all right we can go second stage a flap

for a couple of minutes and then I'll get request to do a VFR departure back out south where okay thank you very much a taxi hit on tango and then lift the power echo on echo hold short of alpha ok I'll take over then left on super par and echo and hold short of alpha I think Souter oh my goodness that's the main male but terminal just over there on the right hand side if any of you flown out of Melbourne Airport before well all these aircraft which would normally be moving around I would never be able to get hard retro Roos over there as well BET's died 320 taking off ok we're holding short of echo do you want us to remain on your frequency you'll head over to ground at this point okay there's your light on this frequency they're all combined currently and did you want to hold there or do you want further taxing I think I'd like to continue taxing if we can maybe down arrow and then around alpha okay thank you continue lift them to echo and then lift at alpha hold short of uniform left on echo left on alpha hold short uniform okay excellent I've said it before on this channel but I'm gonna say it again air traffic control Airservices Australia here air traffic control in Australia is amazing is absolutely incredible so I've phoned up friend of mine in air services a little while ago to organise this they put me through various people I spoke make oh yeah Veronica I spoke to the tower I told them what I wanted to do everyone was just so 773 okay Yankees Ummah do you want to taxi for departure do you want to hold it all right at the budget I will require maybe three minutes prior to departure just to prepare for this like an exhibit thank you do it continue by Alfred to holding point kilo runway three four and report when ready for clearance okay we're going on Alfred - Holly quite kilo four three four and report ready thank you sir that's the International Terminal just to the left of me here are we going to an Alfa Takeo yep that's the International Terminal just here the main Qantas terminal where I fly out of a lot this t1 and t2 International the International Terminal is next its terminal 3 this is where virgin tigerair and jet star flying off and look at that credible site is neat to see all those aircraft out there it's an amazing experience to be down here on the ground that Melbourne International it's a real once-in-a-lifetime thing for a private pilot like me to be able to come down here into a busy while what's normally a busy International Airport but obviously there's a bit of a somber feeling as well in my heart right now just to see an industry that I love so much staying still had not moving and knowing that there are people out there many of whom I talk to online and friends I've made over the years in the aviation industry who are really finding it quite hard at the moment so look I'm making this video not to kind of flex on the fact I can fly plane into Melbourne International but really just a shared you know this is the thing that I'm passionate about this is what I love doing and this is what I love sharing because it's an industry that I love and the people in it are incredible and I really hope that by making content like this I can get people excited about travel again and hopefully the next time I make a video down here at Melbourne International Airport I'll be a passenger jumping on board hopefully one of your aircraft and going somewhere rather than looking at all these amazing planes just down on the ground not doing anything okay Yankee is really run by three four quid for takeoff make rice ten by three four clear takeoff right sir thank you silly all right normal takeoff ignore the fact but it's unfamiliar so full power damage is a precious good 805
