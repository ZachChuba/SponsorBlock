out at the link in the video description so we're here in Seagate and we don't actually cover hard drives every time because let's face it they're really really boring every year it's like oK we've got some more capacity and like it might go a bit faster who also we've got green on our stickers now but this is different so Seagate's been working on a technology called heat assisted magnetic recording or hammer since 1999 and the first time they built a drive using this technology it lasted for a grand total of one that sector worth of rights and then it was destroyed so to call it up concept at that stage is probably being generous with that said they've been hard at work on it for the last 20 years and they are finally at the point where they are ready to announce that hammer drives will be shipping to customers this year so how does it work then you can actually see a live feed of a hammer head totally intentional I'm sure so that's the drive head and it's hammer technology writing data to the platter that is running live next to me right here and every time it moves around you're gonna see a flash that's the head heating up the platter to approximately 450 degrees Celsius completely wiping out any data that was already there and rewriting it this allows them to get better areal density to the point where we should see if they stay on target 20 terabyte drives by the year 2020 so this drive right here combines their hammer technology with their shield helium drive technology which gives us the power consumption savings that you'd expect from a modern drive as well now reliability remember that story at the beginning how long are these things going to last so they have had tests running in their lab for the last 18 months where they have individual heads that have seen over 8,000 hours of just constant rates going through them to put that in perspective that's up petabyte and a half of data that's been written through a single head about equivalent to the entire Netflix library that is if the internet is to be believed so who's it going to be reliable well I mean I think that guy's job depends on it so let's go with yeah for his sake but hammer doesn't solve all of the hard drive industry's problems something that I've noticed in Seagate has had other customers point out to them is that as these drive capacities get higher and higher and higher without a performance improvement to match we're getting to the point where it's kind of like what happened with SD cards before they've got past you know 20 to 30 megabytes a second of write speeds where you'd like get a new SD card or a thumb drive and you'd be like yeah so this is you know a terabyte or whatever but it would take me literally weeks to fill it with data like it's it's not really useful anymore so to address that there's Mach 2 and oh sorry this is actually running oh it's like warm and what Mach 2 is it's really cool so they've got a glass top on this drive so we can see exactly what's happening but in effect in a multi platter drive so most of the top ones here are glass so you can see the two actuator arms moving independently of each other so it uses a single SAS interface which takes advantage of Sasa's ability to have two sort of virtual ports available for a single cable connected to a single connector so the drives firmware and processor take the incoming stream of data and split it between the two separate heads this effectively doubles the eye ops performance of this drive compared to a normal drive which would run off of a single actuator arm which brings us finally to the most controversial item here in the Seagate booth I've had everything from eye rolls to speaking directly to the person whose pet project this is but this is the you know what I forget the name so I'm going to call it the hard drive zamboni and what it effectively is is a like fiberglass shell with like these tread style you know remover type you know treads on the front that contains a for you server rack so the idea is that Amazon has a product called what if they got they got snowball which is a little one they've got snowmobile which I think like a semi-trailer where the idea is they've got these high-speed interfaces where you pull these things up to your data center offload everything and like literally drive it somewhere because it's faster than trying to send it over the internet so this is supposed to be like kind of like the middle stage where you like load a bunch of data onto it and then you like drive it over somewhere and it could be like battery power - then you could offload it and that might be faster than using a network so imma let you guys decide the controversy for me is this something the world needs more of or something the world needs less of let me know in the comments below capture that so check them out at the link in the video description so thanks for watching guys don't miss any of our CES 2019 content by making sure you're subscribed to lines tech tips and we will see you at the next absolutely nothing we're done now this one might get released like earlier because the editors I don't know how they do the things they do so there might actually be more coming but I'm done peace of now and I'm on a plane in like four hours hell yeah I mean I love seeing yes sorry that's what I meant to say
