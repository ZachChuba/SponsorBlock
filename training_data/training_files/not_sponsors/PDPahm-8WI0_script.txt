[Music] welcome to another studio blog this week I'm gonna be focusing on a project that I have basically it's a baby play mat so I'm gonna take you from my initial sketches and refining sketches today and then through to the final artwork I just purchase you can go to Squarespace TOCOM slash very little peach okay we went back and forth trying to decide what it was gonna be then we kind of talked about maybe each mat could be a different landscape and so we went with the blue mountains inspiration it's not gonna be of the blue mountains but basically Australian flora and fauna so this was the this is the first idea that we presented it's kind of really really colorful but I like the ideas of kids being able to play on the roads and in the different scenery with the toys that they already have this is not what they were after so we had to have a meeting because I think they were worried that things were going in the wrong way but it was purely just a miscommunication based on what I thought they wanted and what they actually wanted so that's why it's important to kind of figure stuff out before you start because otherwise you have a final product and then it's kind of like oh I need to start again here was my other sketch so this is the second one that we went with basically this was in a similar way kids could play in the last heads but it's more abstract and less busy less colorful it's not gonna be great I just haven't added color yet then we have the color palette here that we sent through which they originally liked but they've also asked for another variation I guess just to see what a cool Apella would look like here is the refine sketch it's kind of similar to what we presented but basically I just made the Optus that they wanted in terms of larger Australian animals here so that you can see them from afar because essentially what they want for you to be standing over the mat that looks more like this and be able to point out an animal be like where is this and the kid knows where it is so essentially it's a repeatable pattern you can see there's space up here with no animals because there's two sizes so there's this first size it goes about up to here there's a second size that goes up to here and then this is just the bleed they basically want there to be cut off with the animal just something I was trying to avoid intentionally but the client wants it so that's fine I don't have a problem with that so now what we're doing is I'm gonna make the adjustments with the horses and adding a few more characters in as well as giving them a mock-up of what the cooler palate could look like it's gonna be fun so get this done first and have a number of other to do is to do so here is the updated piece I've added extra elements of the top up here these weren't here before just so that the compositions more even I've had an extra koala in and I've removed the horses and replaced it with an echidna so those are all the compositional changes that I need to make I've sent those off along with this which is an updated pallet they wanted something cooler but all of the cooler things that I tried were I think that they could be perceived as being too stereotypically feminine or masculine so like light blues and light pinks and to avoid that just because I don't really like using bright greens and stuff in my work so to avoid that I've just kind of softened the previous pallet we had before kind of removes the balda colors besides blue and I think it works I think just what they wanted was a more contemporary childlike palette so I hope this works for them we'll get feedback on that soon what else do I have in my diary let's see refine skip to psychotic I've done and sent off email Adobe next so I'll do that I've got a justified of the PG post which is the newsletter I'm going to be trying to do this year we shall see if that heads out but for now I'm still adjusting the formatting and then I've got

Book Depository FNG talkie out of oh my god oh my god oh my god let's look at the credits best oh my god oh my god oh my god I wish I wasn't trying to pages but hey you can't have everything oh my god his looks great the reason I got this book is because I really like him at full sack - whoa lightly he likes like his children's books but I just found out that he worked on adventure time as the head

big drawing like how large this is he's actually so talented but no one knows [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm sorry about the really boring background but thought I would be a little bit closer than you do because sometimes the audio is pretty bad on this camera I think it's because hey it doesn't have like an external microphone and be probably dropped this camera a few too many times I'm gonna get it to doing a QA I just put put out the call for the questions on Twitter before I do will get a discount of 10% so enjoy let's get it to the Q&A before my battery goes out little lights ran out of battery favorite favorite cottage shows such cutting cactus I'll so top of my head I would have to say better times my favorite I know it's late but I'm sure it's everyone's favorite but it's just the character design is amazing the overall colors are incredible like the aesthetic of the of the animation is gorgeous for a long time it was still hard to automate animation which I thought was pretty cool it's on Cartoon Network which i think is a pretty forward-thinking Network and they apparently give creatives a lot of control yeah I just really love the sentiment of the show as well like it's really just innocent and sweet and joyful and that's what I'm about I want my work to make people feel like how I feel when I watch Adventure Time okay so my favorite characters Finn Bieber and LSP probably although Lemongrab is pretty amazing are you planning on selling copies observe internationally we did Purdue pre-orders for zoom it got really expensive because in lots of cases we were losing money I didn't want to make the shipping more expensive than the actual book but it's upcase the ship it was $50 like fish shipping alone and so we lost a lot of money on that I don't know if we'll be doing that again thank you thank you thank you for be interested in today thank you for even being interested in zoom you can find them at all major bookstores in Australia so places like demux and book topi I know do international shipping although I think it's pretty expensive just because shipping books is expensive what's the most challenging thing about doing Commission's I haven't done commissions for a really long time probably four years I haven't had to just because of a either just being doing design as my as a salary job and then when I left that I would have me I had enough client work so I didn't really need to take on Commission's hardest thing about commissions for me and why I don't really enjoy doing them is it's never really your idea it's not that fun doing other people's ideas and let it unless you're getting paid a lot of money or it's challenging or then I don't know it's it's a prompt rather than idea so when it comes to client work I only really take on projects that give me creative freedom and that's a luxury that I have because I'm getting enough interest in what I do so I'm thankful sometimes they can be really fun and sometimes not so much so do you find it hard to draw a slash sketch every day a lot of my friends and we're in students at the National Art School in Sydney hi find that they have no motivation or inspiration to draw everyday do you have any advice for them so this is probably one of the first types that you need to come to terms with or learn to juggle making art as a hobby and a passion and also making art for work because you have assignments and stuff and that can be really really exhausting and I don't know if you need to know how to juggle that straightaway but it will be really really good for you if you can figure out how to motivate yourself to work or how to find discipline in putting aside maybe 2 hours a week and just doing anything so that when you leave University you have like a stronger body of work and a better understanding of who you want to be as a creative because I found that with uni work it was very general one of my favorite speakers that I saw at Adobe MAX both years was Ted Carter he's really really funny illustrator guy I'll put his link in the description below he spoke about the chapter that he does it's called Sundays and basically every Sunday he sits down for at least an hour and make something that is prompted by the words son so whether it be 3d which has been doing lately or 2d and I think it's really important especially when you get into the industry because doing a lot of commercial work can really burn you out and make you not really as confident perhaps in creating work because it's a lot of it's driven and dictated by a client so it's awesome to have an outlet where you can express yourself and only yourself and only your ideas and emotions and aesthetic so yeah I guess that would be my advice set time aside on the weekend if you can I know it's hot because you have you probably have a part-time job you probably super busy with assignments just any way you can even if you go to sleep like 20 minutes later every night I'll the boss all the training unity you know to me it's always a little extra moments where you can't feel that with creative time what's the medium that intimidates you but you want to try I would love to do some ceramic work it intimidates me because although I did like a crash cosseted at university we did ceramics for a semester and I wasn't particularly be with most of my work anyway as a medium to have something that I know how to work with as in like 2d illustration so the glazing of it but that's something that's really really challenging for me which is like 3d blend love creating things that can be used very practically in people's everyday life so I'd love to do some ceramics but I definitely have to book myself a class hello Sean what's your ultimate breakfast how do you top yourself up in the morning basically anything that could be a vehicle for maple syrup because I freaking love maple syrup so much my mouth fluttering Belgian waffles when did you know it was time to find a business manager and how did you go about finding one so for those of you who don't know I work with Chris who's my producer basically he handles a lot of this day-to-day stuff that I don't need to handle do a Q&A with Chris eventually I know you guys wanted that but we haven't gotten around to figuring out how to include him in it without showing his face cuz he never shows his face on camera anytime ever I had a four day a week job almost full-time job as a designer I was a digital designer so I was designing apps of websites which is really really fun I love using interface I love like just visual design in general I did have a student I was doing freelance work at the same time but all I seem to have time for as things got busier and busier was checking my email and I remember hanging out with Chris cuz we were friends before this so until I remember being like I can't handle all these emails like I bet don't have any time to actually do any work and he was like I'll manage your emails and then shortly after he started up his artist management agency is all Haven big help because basically here does all the client liaison work he does my store management so basically sending everything off if I wanted to learn how to make something he knows where to do it he's very knowledgeable he knows everyone at Sydney and I also trust him a lot for business advice so we talked about both about businesses and it's really really refreshing to just have weekly meetings with him and he's just really clever it does really help to be able to work with some of you actually generally friends with as well and yeah also it's a really cute dog I think that's quite a few questions I feel so alive right now what is the time 12 30th but I just don't know watching Celebrity Big Brother UK because I heard that Courtney after what I didn't realize it was even on because I just finished watching the Trisha Paytas season like very recently but far out I'm only up to I don't know
