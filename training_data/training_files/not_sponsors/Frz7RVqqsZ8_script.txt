♪ Jordan's Messyges ♪ Well guys, new year, new Messyges. A new Messyges room, actually, but the old Messyges room. In fact, this is the original Messyges room. The original Messyges desk and my New Year's resolution for Messyges is that it comes back more than you could ever dream of this year. And you know what? It is going to be here more than you ever dreamed of. I don't know how often, but it's gonna be back more than you thought. I'm taking it seriously this year. We're gonna fix all of your problems. Let's get to it. There's only one thing that you can do. There's not even an option of things. There's only one thing. You can go straight to this girl, straight to her face, and say, "Girl ..." And then you walk away. You don't even need to say anything, okay? You look at her - in an intimidating manner, but you know,
- (JOSH LAUGHING) not like you're gonna harm her. You know what I'm saying, guys. And then you walk away and she knows. She knows that you know because you looked at her. It doesn't seem, honestly, like your friends want help, so I wouldn't be trying to help them, as bad as that sounds. But if they're like, "Hey, shut up. You're not in a relationship. Get away from me." What are you going to do? Okay, these people need a little awakening. You know what I'm saying? Because think of Jesus. Jesus was never married. Yet if they're Christians, which ... you're watching Messyges so you probably are ... - This is the most Christian show on all of YouTube.
- (JOSH LAUGHING) Honestly. Jesus was never married. And yet we take marriage advice from Jesus, like, 24/7. So you know what? If they don't want to take advice from you who's not married or in a relationship, then they might as well not take advice from Jesus Christ himself. JOSH: Christians take dating advice from Paul, too, and he wasn't married. - Thank you, Josh.
- JOSH: I don't think he was. - Maybe that was the thorn in his flesh. (LAUGHING)
- Was what? (LAUGHING) What? JOSH: He was married, that was—His wife was the thorn in his flesh. - Oh, well, you know who ...
- JOSH: That's sexist, I guess. - That was. We'll edit that out in post.
- JOSH: Well, it's not ... No, well ... Your mom, when she had the stomach virus, just chugged some apple cider vinegar and she didn't throw up? That's amazing, actually. Um, you're supposed to dilute this in water. Okay? You're not ... That's—that's actually probably dangerous if you're just drinking this stuff. Don't do that again. Don't do that again. Just put a little bit in water. You'll be okay. Well, Inside Out came out, and I saw it. And I'll tell you one thing. - Huge disappointment!
- (JOSH LAUGHING) No, I'm kidding. (LAUGHS) It was great. - The Good Dinosaur ... didn't even bother seeing it.
- (JOSH LAUGHING) So ... (LAUGHING) The best one, though ... out of all the Pixar movies, if I had to pick one, would probably be Toy Story 3. - JOSH: Oh, real—real tear-jerker there.
- Shocking. - I know, man.
- JOSH: That ending. - That ending, though, it was pretty good.
- (JOSH LAUGHING) And apparently they're gonna ruin it with the fourth one, so I'll come back to Messyges and let you guys know what I think of Toy Story 4. JOSH: Jordan was so mad when I told him. - I was mad.
- JOSH: And now I'm talking straight to the audience, sorry. - (LAUGHS) Don't do that.
- JOSH: Normally I talk to you. - No, you just talk to me. You can't talk to the Messyngers.
- JOSH: Well, can you tell the audience that it was really funny - Josh says ...
- JOSH: when I told you the other day? Josh says that it was funny when he told me about Toy Story 4 the other day 'cause I hate it. - So.
- JOSH: He didn't know. - I didn't—he—Josh—I didn't know.
- JOSH: Tell them that he—you didn't know. I didn't know. Guys, I'm feeling a little bit of nostalgia from being in this room. I know I'm in it all the time, but, uh, it's that we're doing Messyges in this room, okay? Messyges desk ... I hit it way too many times because I was angry in my youth. You know, I'm not as angry anymore. Because I've fixed half of your lives, so I don't have as many bad questions, but now, the questions are getting better, as we've seen from this episode. Lot of deep questions. So. I'll be back soon, guys. I'll be back more than you hope. More than you want me to be, I'll be here. Okay? Don't be messy. And leave good messyges.
