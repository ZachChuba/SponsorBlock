it's day 2 of CES / day 1 because it actually only started a day but all the other stuff happened before it's there's multiple things going on a very confused let's just get to the tech news yesterday was a busy day full of press conferences and keynotes so here's our roundup of the biggest moments from them starting with Sony who unveiled a car that's right Sony showed off a car with 33 sensors that support self-driving features such as cameras radar and lidar inside it features a huge touchscreen and speakers built into the seats as you would expect from Sony we were expecting news in the PlayStation 5 but didn't get much more than the name PS 5 and a logo so he won't have more details until later in the year Sony also has some new TVs on offer and while the underlying technology isn't anything we haven't seen before it looks like they're 8k sets are going to become a bit more affordable as a smaller 75 inch model will be available soon let's move on to AMD which headlines their press conference by officially unveiling the rise in thread ripper 3990 x the first ever consumer cpu with 64 cores and 128 threads well fittingly they announced that the price would be three thousand nine hundred ninety US dollars oh guys not exactly cheap but considering how many cores you're getting it's a steal yeah I guess so I don't know how much that is per core and you can get it next month team red also showed off its new rise in 4000 series CPUs for laptops as it tries to challenge Intel more in the laptop space than it has been in the past and line has got a chance to look at some of those in our CES coverage over on ltte so check that out it's expected that over a hundred laptops will be available this year with the new CPUs and for you gamers there's a new mid-range Radeon line of graphics cards the 5600 series oh yeah the 5600 XT which is to compete with the GTX 1660 Ti from Nvidia will go for $279 I just can't get as excited about Radeon as I can about Rison I'm sorry AMD you're almost there but not to be outdone intel had a few announcements of its own even if they weren't giving us CPUs with absurd core counts in addition to the ghost Canyon nook that we covered in yesterday's episode we also got our first official look at its new discrete GPU which was running a demo of destiny - although Intel was tight-lipped on specifications however Intel is expected to release its integrated GPU platform for laptops later this year the company has also jumped on the foldable screen bandwagon debuting a laptop codenamed Horseshoe Bend which looks like a giant tablet that folds in the middle although at this point it still appears to be a concept but what a concept seems like everybody's making foldable display laptops that's the thing that's that's a big theme so yes it happened sonic products online through the links below on to the clay pits Samsung gave us some interesting and varied offerings besides just the curved monitor we saw yesterday there's also the CRO TV which can rotate to view those vertical videos people love so much I don't though as well as Bali a robotic ball that will follow you around the house so eat your heart out bb-8 very exciting Alienware announced a prototype fittingly dubbed the UFO though it doesn't look much like a flying saucer instead it bears a resemblance to the Nintendo switch but it plays PC instead like the switch it has two controllers you can slide off and can also be connected to a larger screen no word on availability yet but one reviewer said the prototype was quite polished and felt like a finished product was that Alex that said that because alex already took a look at it and we have a video about that on LTT Hisense has a reputation for flashy press conferences and it doesn't get much flashier than a self-rising laser powered TV whoa its newest model the l5 is going to go for $1000 and uses a short-range laser protector to create an image from nothing it's said to be very good for HDR content and has a massive a hundred inch display ooh if you want some real wow factor in your living room impress the not just the ladies everybody now for something a bit more offbeat with the success of impossible foods fake beef making its way into Burger King's around the u.s. the company is now trying at an at pork oh it showed off both impossible pork and impossible sausage with the latter debuting at you guessed at Burger King later this month I guess it wasn't impossible after all and Toyota clearly isn't impressed with TVs and fake sausage as it basically said screw you guys we're building a city the automaker is planning to turn the site of an old car factory into a prototype city for testing V's robots and other futuristic technology up to 2,000 people could live there with the entire thing powered by hydrogen fuel cells including the people but let's just hope Mount Fuji doesn't erupt anytime soon as the city will be positioned right at its base whoo ending on a honest note there anyways thanks for watching and be sure to come back tomorrow for all the latest from CES 2020 now if you'll excuse me it's time for me to go lose some money at the tables I don't do that John come on I'm responsible ah thanks gotta stay hydrated
