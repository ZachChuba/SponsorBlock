Hi~ We are APRIL~~~~~ Welcome to Idol Ground~ Thank you for inviting us~ I'm happy~~~ I will try my best to play the game. I'm not usually good at games, but I'll try my best today. Cheer up~~~~!!!!! Did you practice the game? Well..... I did but........I can't do this. I kept getting it wrong in step 3. I'm not expecting anything........ Has anyone been to the last stage? Step 8????
We can never.... I'm not confident. But if we're lucky, we can succeed. There is a 60-second time limit for games. What???? Was there a time limit?  
The chance to play games is three times.
You must succeed within 60 seconds of the time limit.
If words and movements are wrong, the game will fail.
If you succeed in the game, you will be given time to promote it. (They are already in despair) Do you understand?
Yes~ Well........ Drawing lots time! I know this.... Rachel handed out the note one by one. Open it! No.1? No.2 Na Eun No.3 Rachel Just by looking at your face, you're number one. I hate No.1....... As you might have expected, the number you just picked is your game order. (A stark difference in temparature) I'm in the middle~ Please state your resolve. It's better to be beaten up quickly.... I'll do it quickly and finish it quickly! Let's get it! I'll follow her after I see her do it. As it's my last turn, I'll practice with ease. Let's start~~~ I'll fail, who will succeed? Just be successful. (She's already lost her mind) Practice is the only way to survive!!! What the??? Wait! Chae Won! I'm........2........4! (understand) No! (OMG) I'm already screwed.. This game is harder than I thought. It looks difficult.    /    You can do it! There are three chances, right? But I don't think I'll make it in time. My hands are sweating..... Cheer....... up....!!!
Cheer up~~~~~~~~~~~~ You can do it! We've been shooting the opening for 10 minutes. I'm sorry........... I think I've been practicing for 10 minutes. OK!
Shall we start? What? Why are you doing this to me? I'm scare..... Shall I start? The first try! Idol Ground~ Let me introduce myself~~ No! No! (Aagin) Idol Ground~ Let me introduce myself~~ Name : Chae Won Name : Chae Won / Age : 24 Name : Chae Won / Age : 24 / Group : APRIL Chae Won.... No... Fail~~~~~ Is that wrong?
I'm wrong!!!!!!! (Her shoulder is broken) Wait! I wasted a chance in vain.... Please let it go just this once~~~ You failed!!!! No way!!!! My shoulder is broken..... Broken Shoulder, Failure! Oh my god!!!! Broken Shoulder, Failure! We have no mercy!
You are too hilarious.... I'm sorry.............. (Again practice) My hobby is..... Watch a movie Lee Jung Hyuk~ (Her shoulder is broken.....) (She is practicing with all her body shaking) I keep hearing strange noises from somewhere.... This is the sound from the chair! Top honor! OK! I can do it!!!! Slowly!!! I'm so hot..... I'm afraid my makeup will be wiped off by sweat. The second try!

Why??????????? You should have shouted "Chae Won" while hitting your thighs. (Her soul ran away from her....) You almost succeeded, but it's too bad. You would have succeeded if you hadn't hit your thighs. Where is it....? Who am I.......? I......... I was deliberately wrong to succeed at the last chance. Your lap time was 51 seconds just now. Really? Anyway.... You failed~~~~~ That's too bad~ Am I funny? Even I think I'm funny. You are doing well now. You are getting better and better.
I know..... I think so...... I will succeed this time. If I fail again this time, I won't be able to go home because it's unfair. (She is reflecting on her movements once again) Why am I wrong before? This game makes me self-reflect. 'I was so stupid....' Your ideal type is 'Lee Jung Hyuk', right? Yes... I like him...... What is his charming point? He is so cute~~~~~~~ I don't like that style originally, but he's special. Wait! This is no time for me??? (Get a hold of yourself!!!!) Imagine he's in front of you now. Then I won't be able to do it anymore.... I'm nervous.... There's only one last chance left. Cheer for the other members. What???? Are you sure??? They're supposed to cheer me on!!!! (We raise you strong...) Dear. Na Eun & Rachel
I hope you guys succeed. I believe you~ Cheer up!!!!!!! Cheer up........... Shall we start? The last try!
