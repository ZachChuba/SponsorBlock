I'll remember this day look I'll remember the first time I had a mouthful of Brussels sprouts it was March 11th 2019 the time 10:20 a.m. we had all gathered upstairs to attend our usual weekly meeting talking about past and upcoming events looking at memes the usual stuff but this was not to be just any ordinary meeting was petrified the mere thought of having to delay my daily broadcast to indulge this undue displacement at my heart pumping no one person or object would be left untouched by what was about to transpire not even grandmaster left for any a bike ride Linus Linus but he could give no attention to my sorrow linus media group would never be the same again but first hinge swing tempered glass doors check it out today at the link below having already displaced myself from the tepid editing den I decided I could stand as witness to the ordeal somewhat it didn't take long for Linus to lose control why are we making a pile of bean bags here that Jake had been planning for this all along the voluptuous bean bags were his first target their color palette would surely make for an excellent throne all hail Jake media group I knew this was coming but I didn't expect it would actually happen amidst all of the mockery chaos and confusion little explanation was forthcoming we knew we had to do it and like good soldiers we acted on orders but not knowing why so I realized I haven't actually explained why we're doing this with the new hiring wave we're gonna be adding a couple more people to the writing team so we were out of space over on that side for writers and rather than split the writing team we figured the writing team will take the bigger space and then the salespeople and administrative people will go over there some of us were at the brink of insanity you wanna take 20 home Anthony who needs a bed who needs a couch although certain good insulators - you can replace your fringe but I'm just like put a couple ice packs in with your food I'm literally taking it off others became compassionate today I'm down so am i kicking about where does that go for a minute you know what you get 24 hours notice Linus struggled to find meaning in it all why are things just moving this is the Luminess fine James where are you going because I know you were making comments about staking out boy that's location I said you had to confirm where you were going hey I'm just listening to Jake you know what I don't know just ask Jake it was every man for himself these bean bags just get rid of Colton if you guys love you you know I think everyone's all fired up since the last time we did a vlog you know everyone's ready you know to to conquer the day I wasn't the only one concerned with the state of our real estate no one cared to really win at all except me I was like look I don't want to be by the door I don't want to do by the bathroom don't even really kitchen that leaves one logical spot the spot that Jake is now in and Jake's one who assigned the spots yes correct myself rise up at this rate it wouldn't be long before Jake's reign would come crashing down as I became more and more distraught I decided to take on discount what is this J I think it's some obscure t-shirt Lord it could have been worse King Jake had decided that the cubicles had to go shelter anyone could just come and talk to me at any time very annoy the only people you'll make random eye contact with is the spectral beings in that window when the light is dim being the good person that I am I offered assistance in the cleanup of my now wall free dwelling as matter who has no stake in the upstairs how do you feel about this move how are you feeling good about this move entirely Jake's plan you know do you think the people who'd had noticed is you're making some rise up and for state to get the worst spot oh yes okay I like that idea hey James do you want to have to get the worst [ __ ] I think riders should rise up are you gonna help you just stand there it wouldn't be long before James belligerent behavior would come to cost him his social status now sad recluse he still has not come out of his office I lied it was then that I discovered Tyler's true nature what are you helping out with right now a Prime's new role didn't seem to be fitting him very well I don't know for Linus the challenge would be amazing okay I'm gonna start with the vocal recording booth but not everyone was feeling the pressure no one's prepared the labeling process is working as intended tools that are going upstairs later which is stored upstairs Colton couldn't stop rationalizing his distaste with the very idea of dwelling with his partner I was like okay maybe we need to move the desk that room and he's like normally put it in the same room I just said I'm sorry no he's gone oh then he left the table and the monitor for me to clean up whatever would it do all right what's up I didn't do it last week we were we were saying it could be an ongoing thing just have to work it out you know and then he broke up with me okay it became clear that there were gaps in Jakes leadership Johnson accomplice boxes did they you tried to be a god does it feel good to have the power everyone blaming yeah his meeting done Luke was finally ready to join in on the chaos meanwhile Dennis was busy taking the mineral oil PC for a walk Oh Dennis it's around that time that Linus came to realize that his fabulous desk was trouble there's a certain advantage to have modularity the pain was crippling he had never asked for this the Nostalgia DVDs what is this 2002 what is this thankfully the mood was lightening up what I really want is this man I think if I do that trick or you go really fast like and yeah yeah I can get it yeah three two one you see that we are never gonna do it we weren't gonna do that double fisting Oh every single time that we use just tap water and building people get super mad so we've just had this one like bottle of UK cryo fuel and we just fill it up with tap water and then pour it in don't like get super mad at us every time holy I didn't believe that Wow magic man this is how you live with proper form okay we call these good mornings Oh we began assembling shelves that would neatly divide the space to serve as ideological barriers between the writers to get this reference a computer and a car thanks mom and dad bro I don't know what's this stupid references you make meanwhile the glittery filing apparatus was being relocated to its new dwelling look that glitter go ah are you excited to have some daylight in your office it wasn't without fault well I think was already like that no refunds oh now thankfully Nick has experience breaking into people's homes so he came up with a solution that also happened to mend our fancy to fix everything the aftermath of moving a glitter covered file cabinet this video brought to you by not actually but hey now I realize that watching people move and assemble furniture is probably not the most exhilarating use of your time but you've stuck with us this far so bear with me here hi I think I went too fast okay what can I do family huh we're just grabbing Colton's nuts geez I started at a really low point and now you get your own office what did your friends like Dennis and Taryn Etzel John and question mark they're your friends now question we're gonna keep you company and your new up no no no no this is yours I don't want to take this away I can't be my own friend this base is finally coming together all right there you go thank you thanks man heck yeah there's room for another writer right here in a swiveling chair you just get a key mouse mounted to the chair and a monitor that comes out from your crotch and you just do your best work actually I'm gonna miss it surprisingly it's so cheerful how are you gonna remember to live love and laugh it's a shame Nick won't fully embrace the glory of his space try to forgot my plan right now well you already succeeded in taking an end I didn't mean to he literally was like like he saw he came in and saw this layout he's like no I better grab this stuff and leave sounds like Colton is still dwelling on the past move on Colton protection well I guess it's time to pretend that this video made any sense at all and with that here's Linus alright so for better for worse we're kind of done I decided this is where my desk is going and my bench is gonna go over here and I'm gonna figure out how all broke the networking cable along there something I don't know I'll figure it up anyway Riley's over here he's requisitioned three bean bags for his own personal use exhale sighs this is this is exactly where you were before Anthony now has more dust face than ever before sort of all of the shelves moving from downstairs and are now up here I have no idea what the plan is for this desk and then you can always tell who was the coordinator for a move because for whatever reason jake has two desks two shelves James also has a shelf of plant no no it's a plant of Alex's plan boom and then Alex also has a - gasps of it everyone ended up with more space I guess that's good you want the windows washed yeah go for it over here we've got Lloyd's desk you've got the plugins here on video solves difficult actives like there's desk here which is like really stupid honestly no still in here head was still in here and then he moved out I don't want to move it you have to get into your chair sideways yeah and then turn it okay here's the deal here's what's actually happening though
