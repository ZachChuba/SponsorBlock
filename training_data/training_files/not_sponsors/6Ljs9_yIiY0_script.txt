this video was fostered by Bill and Melinda Gates so in the past year I've really decided I want to start caring for the environment so far I'm up to about 25 reusable bags above my closet I don't know exactly what type of cardboard is recyclable but I put it all on the blue bin anyway and I always cut the six-pack rings before I gently release them into my local wildlife reserve well everyone wants to fulfill their personal doing good quote up and I often hear conversations that go oh man these paper straws suck compared to plastic ones and the other person says yeah but they're better for the environment when I did some research it turns out that yeah a paper straw is way more effective you're looking to prevent people from weaponizing their cold brew and no joke plastic waste is a serious issue but in terms of climate change in strictly carbon footprint having a nice coffee with either a paper or plastic straw actually has less impact than driving your car from one end of the drive through to the other and today in the context of climate change in Bill and Melinda Gates his annual letter I want to look at the actual scale of things you might do or use everyday and how much it matters with regard to global carbon emission which is around 36 billion metric tons every year so first up let's look at common consumables so we'll start with the paper straw which takes about one point three eight grams of co2 to produce slightly less than a plastic straw which takes about one point four six grams of co2 for quick context a metal straw takes about 217 grams I mean you have to eliminate at least 150 C Turtles for it to be worth it going back for a second ahead of plastic straws we have plastic bags coming in at around 20 grams of co2 we have paper bags at around 80 grams reusable polypropylene bags at 300 grams and then cotton totes at around 3500 grams or 3.5 kilos for quick context this means you'd have to use a cotton bag about a hundred and fifty times to be the co2 equivalents of plastic bags and about 40 times to be the equivalent to paper bags honestly the part that I'm looking forward to is being on my deathbed and in general but also the only thing in my will is gonna be finished what I couldn't and then each of my children gets a tote bag and how many more trips they need to make to say for you to complete my legacy real joke as my children aren't inheriting anything nice we have electrical devices which start to get more significant leaving one 100 watt light bulb on for 24 hours one kilogram of co2 leaving a fridge running for 24 hours two kilograms of co2 using a work computer and monitor for 8 hours 2 kilograms of co2 using a real computer with at least 2 graphics cards 3 1440p 144 hertz monitors and an RGB backlit keyboard to play minecraft for 16 hours 10 kilograms of co2 using an oven for 2 hours 20 kilograms once again another reason to have 2 graphics cards with a clear case so you can check on your roast operating a heat pump is needed for 24 hours in a one-bedroom apartment about 20 kilograms of co2 as well but again I'm just repeating myself in this ballpark we also have driving your car each day at about 10 to 20 kilograms of co2 assuming you're the average American living the dream if we add all this up an average of down your everyday American is responsible for about 45 kilograms of co2 emission per day which is about the same as Canada or Australia but double China and most of Europe it is trailing behind Qatar which is at 38 but is in the top 10 on the full chart well the things you do every day certainly add up over time even they can pale in comparison to the amount of resources it takes to manufacture things in the first place a cell phone produces about 30 kilograms of co2 to manufacture which is the same as using it every day for about eight years a laptop produces about 250 kilograms of co2 to manufacture which is the same as using it every day for about three years this is also about the same as a five hour one-way flight per person and then a large sedan takes up to 15 tons of co2 to manufacture which is the same as about three years of driving keep in mind that manufacturing most electric vehicles is about the same sometimes slightly higher but co2 used for operation is much lower this means in terms of carbon emissions you could have one person who doesn't have heating air conditioning refrigeration electricity a cell phone or even a sick gaming computer but they do drive 45 minutes to work and that would be about the same as someone who had all those things but work from home and doesn't own a car which is the angle I go for when people find out I don't know how to drive and now you might be thinking ok well we need heating we need cooling we need refrigeration we need a cell phone we need gaming computer and many people need cars so then what can your average person do that would actually matter one suggestion I like is not to try to minimize everything because then you'll never succeed and feel guilty all the time but to ask yourself do I do anything in excess and can I cut down on that because similar to when you're trying to save money buying the drip coffee instead of the americano is going to make absolutely no difference if you're spending $500 a month on premium snapchat and Twitter donations because that's money well-spent and in truth some studies show that even if you live in complete darkness in your mom's basement eating only leftovers which honestly sounds not too bad by sheer nature of what makes a first-world country different from a third world country it's almost impossible to get your carbon footprint below about 50% of the average for your country and that brings us to the main premise of what Bill and Melinda Gates wanted to address in their letter this year which is swinging for the fences and taking big risks on big problems because well every individual can help in their own way we also need solutions for global issues that can scale as an example the previously mentioned co2 calculations for electrical devices is based on 65% of electricity coming from fossil fuels like in the US but if your country gets all of its electricity from renewables then the co2 emissions from your electronics is almost zero if you choose to have an electric car then that too will also almost be zero and as more energy comes from low emissions sources electric vehicles and devices become more and more efficient making it not just an individual's responsibility to limit consumption and choose efficient products but an international commitment to sustainable energy co2 mitigation providing aid to those afflicted or displaced by the negative outcomes of climate change well I want to focus on climate specifically in bill Melinda's letter they go into more detail about not only climate change but other global problems of equals scale that required big risks and massive action for us to address and I encourage you to take a look at the letter by clicking the link in the description where they discuss what they believe to be some of the most important global issues and how to approach them and personally for the 10 or 15 minutes it takes to read I learned a lot I didn't know and I think it's well worth the time [Music] you
