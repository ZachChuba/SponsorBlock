being hacked left and right but before we get into that story first we need to talk about PewDiePie getting married a couple days ago PewDiePie tweeted out we are married I'm the happiest I can be I'm so lucky to share my life with this amazing woman Oh Congrats to Marzia and pewdiepie but not only did we get these lovely photos today PewDiePie uploaded a video sharing his wedding with everyone he

becoming the first individual not a company to do so that along with getting married a couple of days ago looks like you're having a great week congrats to you and Murcia and if you look right now PewDiePie is only like this 65,000 subs away these are exciting times also in avenues now normally I hold this off to the very end you know I piqued your interest with hey everyone's getting hacked but before that but you know what let's just jump right into it all these youtubers are being hacked people that's right people Shane Dawson hacked King bash hat Amanda Cerny hacked attica hacked even James Charles today right now as I filmed this video hats and you know what people I think AT&T is looking at a major lawsuit because that is the one thing that connects all these accounts all these youtubers have AT&T and what the hackers are doing is they're calling in to the AT&T and they're talking to another human and they're saying yeah I forgot my password I need my sim card switched over to this new phone and they switch the SIM cards over and the hackers now have full control of these youtubers phones meaning they have access to their Twitter accounts their instagrams their emails everything and let me tell you these hackers are unreasonable when they were on a Tico's account earlier today I was talking to the most liked guys please don't do this you guys know he passed away this is so wrong it's so evil just please give it back they refused so I had to go and reach out to Twitter myself and try to get this stuff back which thank God Twitter gaming shout out to Twitter gaming they had this fixed in like 15 minutes and they got attica's account back amanda cerny said this this is the second time my phone number was hacked because of human error within the company at AT&T I have all the possible steps of verification at it the first time and again my account was still compromised time to switch carriers be careful out there everyone King bash had this to say roll it alright so I had the longest day today let's talk about a TMT and how your security is trash ok because I protect everything I have with 2 step verification passwords on pass on my passwords are not easy someone said all this pass was probably king bats no my [ __ ] was not King back to my she had letters exclamation points initials and for my [ __ ] to get hacked it was it was a AT&T employee that switched my SIM card to his SIM card and all the text messages went to his phone you can see everything I was typing in my phone so when I changed my password he saw what the [ __ ] I changed it to the stores closed the customer service is trashed I was on the phone for hours just trying to figure this [ __ ] out and I couldn't get no help so bottom line you trash a t-mobile pal at me sprint how that mean Verizon howl at me wow this is why I'm saying AT&T is dropping the ball and they could be looking at a class-action lawsuit and at the time that I'm filming this James Charles is still currently hacked and they changed his act and he is no longer verified but Twitter is on it so hopefully they'll get his account fix now listen speaking about James Charles there has been drama going around with James Charles the last couple days and it all revolves around the waiter do you guys remember the waiter during all this controversy like people were saying he was a straight waiter and James took advantage of him but then he came out and said he was bicurious so obviously James was innocent well for some reason James is hanging out with him again that's right the waiter known as Samuel will cookie posted this on Instagram saying that he was in LA and if you look closely at that pool you will see that is James Charles Poole so people are baffled with this they're like why would James Charles hang out with a guy that tried to get clout from him and tried to expose him trying to ruin his career like why is James lost his mind James did risk well I spoke to James privately have a better understanding but I can't talk about that but James did say this publicly on Instagram a fan said I'm fed up hearing about James he strives on drama and creates it just for attention he's 20 and pretends he's all grown up well he just needs to start acting like it James fired buck with this I don't know why I'm doing that what am i a cheerleader now James said this look at the comments not a single one is positive if you truly think I'm searching for more drama you are crazy this isn't fun for me my life has become miserable from everything I do getting turned into a scandal Sam and I mutually decide to meet up and talk face-to-face and get some closure after everything that happened between us over the past seven months it's no one's business but ours but unfortunately now everyone at commenting their own theories none of which are true please leave both of us alone kaboom and there you have it from James Charles also in the news Trisha Paytas is mad at the vlog squad you know like the friends squad or whatever it did david dobrik and his crew alright she's mad at them and she's upset and she's uploaded a video ranting and raving here's a clip roll cuz David do not want me in the [ __ ] friend group because I made a video about an uncomfortable in that relationship Trisha Paytas is constantly tried to expose david dobrik on her channel but
