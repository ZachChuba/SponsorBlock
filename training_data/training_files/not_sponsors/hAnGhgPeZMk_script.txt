so let's talk about lore movies whenever I begin discussing this topic with my friends they're often confused and asked me to give a definition of what the term lore movie even means to me a lore movie is a film or project which is so wholly based on playing fanservice to previously existing stories that it isn't made with the same standards or purposes of a regular film now this video is focusing on examples on the internet but really these sorts of media can exist in mainstream cultures as well I think one of the best examples of this is psych the movie the film a long way to sequel to the cult TV series still beloved by many to this day was rushed into production after extremely fast rewrites had to be made due to the health of one of the show's main actors this leads to a story which is as contrived as it is forgettable coming from a show that is known for being one of the most creative takes on its genre and format it feels a little sad to see the plot be given a treatment that feels more akin to something like CSI Miami despite this I still thoroughly enjoy psych the movie because it still delivers on everything that's important I tuned in to see all of my favorite characters again to have cameos for all the fan favorites and to have classic nods to funny moments from the past and it pulled that off it accommodated the franchise's lore to the extent that it not being a good movie really didn't matter to me and that in my eyes is what a lore movie is its media meant to subsist off existing material no matter how obscure in order to cater to a pre-existing group of hyper fans to the extent that more general quality isn't the first thing considered one of the first youtube movies I think of when it comes to this term is dick Figures the movie now I remember watching a lot of dick Figures and being really excited when they ended up crowdfunding this big professional film but by the time it was released I had stopped watching and had literally forgotten everything about the show mainly because it's called dick Figures so it's a trip watching this movie now and seeing all these characters who don't deserve to have a film made about them be introduced explicitly because they're recognizable for hardcore fans there's this raccoon in the film who is very important to the narrative and I feel like if I remembered anything about this show him getting an entire film with big character payoff would be a big deal but to get enjoyment that deep I already need to be some sort of hyper fan thus Laura movi I oh so wanted to beat around the bush for this video maybe I find a couple other youtuber lore movies to critique maybe one in particular would be good and I'd get to praise it but why waste your time we all know why we're here camo awesome is a name that is so entwined with the mistreatment of friends and co-workers and mismanagement on a ridiculous scale that even just saying their name tends to suck all of the fun out of the room now the channel that probably shouldn't be named actually used to have somewhat of a positive reputation indeed I remember when I was a kid absolutely loving watching nostalgia critic videos I would do it every Wednesday like clockwork and I was so obsessed with it that if you knew me at the time you probably can remember either a time where I tried to make you watch one of these videos or where I talked about it to an extent that probably got kind of grating as I grew older and I got through middle school and then high school I I slowly stopped watching them and it's it's mainly because I just started liking good content but even then I didn't expect all of the things that have come out since then you know I recently went to any social gathering of sorts and there was someone there who I'd never met before who knew who I was as a youtuber so he we ended up talking and it became quickly apparent that he knew me exclusively as a guy who had talked about channel awesome a while ago in one video and that's all you knew before and so he wanted like oh my oh my hot takes about like he was like what do you think the wall what do you think of this and that and I was like man you gonna be surprised by this but when I don't like a youtuber I don't keep watching them but you know I had this realization not only do I not like talking about Channel awesome I don't like thinking about channel awesome I prefer to live in a world where they cross my mind so little that I forget that they exist that tends to be where I'm the most happy after all that drama came out and I rushed to make that video there was this brief private time that I had sort of offline where I was really broken by the whole affair I became physically unwell by because of just how upset it all made me and he got to the point that like my friends would like come to the house and would drag me out and be like okay we're taking you to lunch you should be alone right now and I think a big part of it was that the channel awesome situation made me have like a full-on identity crisis where I realized if I hadn't grown up watching blockers content I would not have gone down the path that I that I had I would never made those early videos talking about rankin/bass films I wouldn't have done any of that I wouldn't have a YouTube channel I wouldn't have a career I wouldn't be on this path and I didn't know how to keep moving forward when I when I just felt those origins had been so sullied you know and you know the sad thing is channel awesome their whole strategy was just to ignore the situation and wait for people like me to become so emotionally exhausted that we never wanted to talk about it again they felt if they just never addressed any of the issues their careers would be fine at the end of the day according to Brad Jones one of the only people who stuck by them at the end of the day their careers were all that really mattered to them in this situation in this thing and one thing that we kept saying on our site and another site as well it was we were saying like I mean look like Logan Paul filmed a dead body and he still has a curtain I mean that is so upsetting to me because channel sim was essentially exposed for covering up several instances of sexual misconduct and sex harassment and all for the sake of protecting their friends and also seemingly their brand and their only response to this is that they don't really care about that because Logan Paul film the dead body and he still makes a lot of money and that's all they really care about is their careers I mean I don't know how I cannot be upset by that but I mean at the same time their strategy paid off because after a month I I made like a silent vow myself I would never talk about this stuff on the channel ever again because I was just tired of people tagging me in this stuff every day I just didn't want to hear about anymore so what changed why am I talking about it now if I felt that way so strongly well this little voice kept whispering a thought into my ear one that made me smile no matter what and I just felt the need to bring it to light when you do the name Doug Walker one of the first things you think is oh the nostalgia critic one of the most popular comedic reviewers on the entire Internet I would like to see that change from now on when you hear that name I believe you should think Doug Walker the worst film maker of all time if you've enjoyed out of my old videos you you might notice a trend where I used to always come on camera and say wow guys I think I found the worst movie of all time I know I said this a month ago but this one's really the worst and you may have noticed I have not done that in a very long while and that is because about a year and a half ago I watched two boat Leafly which is the worst film of all time there's no competition no questions anyone can ask it is legitimately the most frustratingly unentertaining unwatchable movie ever made by human hands now Quinton I hear you protest surely there are worse movies than that Birdemic the room Manos plan 9 etc and to that I say all of those movies are incredible I have had parties where I invite friends over and we put those movies on and we watch them and we have a great time how can you say those movies are truly bad when everyone loves them so much savolta flea isn't like that it's not fun it's not enjoyable it's it's sort of bad that that crushes your soul that makes you want to turn it off every frame that goes by I this video hurt to make I was in pain during this video I barely could handle it and I just hope to god it doesn't hurt as much to watch one of the things that's most frustrating about to boldly flee is that it isn't really cohesive in all the things it presents there's a lot of stuff that deserves deep dives and deconstructions but not a lot of visitors really connected one plotline has nothing to do with another it's just a lot of stuff that's all going on and a lot of it really deserves to be talked about on its own most of my videos are structured to be a series of rants and mini discussions which build up to a bigger picture but in this case the only bigger picture is that it's really hard to understand why someone made this movie and so before we get into a long-winded exploration of the many unlink threads of this project

the nostalgia critic had been up to up to this point and what struggles he had gone up against Doug Walker started his review series as a side project he worked his day job it was created on no budget and was formed for the early limitations of old YouTube most of his early content is under 10 minutes because for the time all YouTube videos had to be and because of this he was initially very sparing with what he would show and discuss most videos would go like this Doug would find something he was nostalgic for he would talk about the experience he had with it as a child and then he would go through it and talk about how silly or stupid it was while playing clips that were worthy of being quickly mocked I think early nostalgia critic can be a lot more palatable because Flanders ocean-effect hadn't quite said in yet so the punchline to every joke isn't just him screaming and he managed to have actual commentary on what he's watching and more importantly why he's watching it Doug soon left YouTube in favour of competitor blip TV and started his own website that guy with the glasses calm this granted him the right to make his videos as long as possible and to include as much of the copyrighted material as he saw fit and he also began inviting other similar craters on board to broaden the site's appeal soon the brand lasted long enough to celebrate anniversaries and to reward the fans for sticking around so long films began to be made starring the most popular and iconic reviewers of the time all you need to know about these movies is that they're bad but not as bad as the movie we're going to be reviewing today I think whenever Doug isn't in the scene it's just a bunch of friends hanging out and trying to capture a feeling of camaraderie and respect you sorta nod your head and find yourself understanding why people like sitting through these things even though they are kind of embarrassing one really important moment in Doug's devolution was his massive review of Moulin Rouge the video is a musical it features a couple reviewers singing and acting next to him some of them seem like they're being held against their will and even as a nostalgia critic obsessed Twain I sort of understood that what I was watching was really embarrassing and significantly worse than the movie they were talking about and yet I was shocked to learn later that this was the review that made Doug decide to stop being the nostalgia critic not because it's one of the cringe iasts things ever to be made but because he considered it to be a work so great that he could never top it again if he ever tried well why did he prove that wrong this brings us the long way around to his most infamous creation to boldly flee the inspiration behind this movie is essentially desired to justify the fact that Doug Walker's creations are inherently bad and not even by regular standards that an actual film student might apply but to his own limited pitching and perceptions of what makes a movie good or bad in his own reviews his films can be nitpicked very easily their stories often don't make logical sense and are filled with the proverbial plot hole there's a rip in space-time outside of the earth that's making my movies bad in this film Doug and his cast introduce us to the plot hole an anomaly in space that is affecting the nature of reality to the extent that it makes these movies not make any goddamn sense in the previous film the gag character Matty had sacrificed his life and had passed away and the critic spends the start of to boldly flee mourning his friend before discovering that he survives inside of the plot hole okay so as you can probably tell just by these last few paragraphs the weirdest thing about this movie is how oddly contained and esoteric it is understanding the long and ridiculous plot involves not only having a grasp of all of the previous channel awesome lore movies but also a surprisingly high amount of Doug Walker's content you know that thing mst3k does where most of the episode will be them riffing a movie in the theater but then it'll pan out and suddenly the characters will be acting as if they're in the movie in order to Lampoon and make commentary on it well Doug Walker usually does the same thing on his show except he's so immersed in his character that there's this expectation of some reality behind the segments as if all of these things are really happening to this character as an example the infamously bad movie Battlefield Earth features an ending where the heroes of the film teleport a bomb to the homeworld of the alien bad guys and it destroys all life on the planet due to its heavily gas based atmosphere so when Doug reviewed the film he had a skit with the same alien bad guy contacts the critic from said planet and then someone lights a cigarette in the background and the entire thing blows up what's wrong look like someone misses cigarettes on my home planet now that I hope things going to explode oh gee I'm sorry it's a dumb skit pretty easy to forget by virtue of not being very clever and yet if you haven't seen that review you will be immensely confused by to boldly flee because that character from that one skit at the end of that one review is an essential plot point for the entire runtime except it doesn't even make sense how they present it because it seems like Doug doesn't remember the content of his own videos very well so he keeps describing that skit in a way that it distinctly did not happen Doug straight-up just steals characters from other films and his only justification over why he should be allowed to do this is that he made fun of these characters in his videos like General Zod is in this movie it's Doug playing General Zod but it's literally General Zod and there's not really a bit or a point it's like General Zod being there is the entire joke and he doesn't have anything else to add really my favorite part is that Doug seemed to be aware that he couldn't just literally steal these characters and get away with it so his choice was to change the spelling of the names just enough that it was different but not enough that they're pronounced differently so he just added another D to General Zod and he called it a new character fair use everybody you know that scene in ghostbusters where two characters are talking and one of them uses like a Twinkie to explain some science and then a third character walks in and the second character goes hey tell them about the Twinkie in this movie they do that joke but it's about sages penis instead that's the movie that's that's all you need to know about it it's really fantastic scenes you've seen done well in good movies but rewritten to be about the genitalia of Internet reviewers one of the biggest plot points in to boldly flee is that star is happening I don't know how else to explain it Doug lifts numerous scenes from Star Wars he has random or viewers act them out and it's sometimes line-by-line except there are new punchlines added in it's sort of like what Robot Chicken did with their Star Wars specials except without any of the charm or production value but more importantly those skits were really compact they didn't go on for like three [ __ ] hours this isn't a small thing Star Wars happening is most of the film and it's the least interesting aspect but arguably it's also what makes it so bad because not only you sing Doug and Rob perform in ways that aren't entertaining but you're also seeing their friends acting these moments out and trying their best to slug through it in spite of their obvious embarrassment and I want to tell you that there's some point to the emperor from Star Wars being one of the big bad guys and bossing around characters from Superman to and Battlefield Earth but there is no real point other than it being throwbacks to skits that I honestly just don't remember I guess Doug really wanted to milk how much he looks like Terence Stamp but I look like Jack Aharon II you don't see me making a non standalone movie one of the strange of scenes I feel is the parody of the opera scene from Star Wars 3 where Palpatine tells Anakin about Darth Plagueis the wise in this movie they're watchin Manas the hands of fate and Palpatine is essentially pitching my opinion that it's actually really great because it's entertaining and people love watching it and he suddenly claims that the one way to make a great film that will last for all of time is to make one that is extraordinarily terrible people love him precisely because they hate him I don't understand they is fleeting but infamy lasts forever it's a technique only a true master can perfect and I can learn this technique not from a critic there's this film on Netflix called Frankenstein's monsters monster Frankenstein which is about this actor finding one of his father's lost plays and making a miniature documentary on it and of course the footage from the play is all fake and is supposed to be awkwardly bad in a really sort of funny way I'm bringing this up because I feel that the highlight of the film is how pretentiously several characters in the story will begin long conceited monologues about what it means to be an actor despite it having nothing to do with the scene showcases his talent is no better than a rich man boasting about his billfold an actor shouldn't glide across the stage more gracefully than a common man nor should he play the clown studied simplicity and every gesture I can't tell what's a clear way into boldly flee the characters talk about being reviewers in the exact same manner and it feels totally irrelevant to the situations that they're in but whoever is writing feels like talking about being a reviewer adds something when it absolutely does not the character in the story who is given the task of being Luke Skywalker is pushed through this arc where other reviewers try and teach her what it means to be a critic and it's just really bad according to what I've been told the script for to boldly fleet didn't actually include what films the scenes were copying so a lot of these actors actually shot these scenes without understanding the references that they were supposed to be making which obviously makes the parody work a whole lot less the most embarrassing part about these long portions of script is just how much they do depend on the secondary cast and how uncomfortable said people end up looking throughout the entire production as you can probably tell I'm trying not to show many of these characters for various reasons so instead let's go back to making fun of the scenes with Brad because that guy sucks oh my god this is so bad I remember watching episode three and seeing the scene they're making fun of and just thinking wow this could not have been directed more poorly but I was wrong I was dead wrong cuz look what we got here I've been informed that Brad specifically hated always being called Brad akan in the script and that when people started calling him that in the fandom he got really upset going as far as to ask the references to this be removed from the IMDB page so Brad akan is now what I'm going to call him for the rest of time the scene were Palpatine claims to Braddock in that making bad movies is the greatest way to be known and that making a bad film on purpose actually causes one to live forever an infamy is something that really caught my interest when he first said it because while intended to be a parody of bigshot Hollywood thinking it accidentally becomes a parody of how the filmmakers approach this project I mentioned earlier that the plot hole mainly exists as an explanation for why these movies are bad and that is absolutely accurate based not only on how its presented through dialogue but also stories that happen to be going on behind the scenes Rob specifically would use it as a way to shut down the cast and crew pointing out blatant disregard for the basic tenets of filmmaking rule of 180 being broken plot hole continuity of scenes being largely inconsistent from shot-to-shot plot hole the literal definition of the term plot hole not applying to half of these problems that's gonna be a plot hole this Palpatine character is a perfect representation of how shoddy the messaging of this film really ends up being because depending on what scene you're watching he's either a metaphor for scummy producers in Hollywood and also the existence of copyright law or he's an evil emperor who built a gigantic space station that can blow up a bunch of stuff that he wants to use to rule the galaxy by the way this video is unofficially an episode of knockoff November and it might actually be the final knockoff November because I am officially out of ideas for this series but that might be fitting because out of all of my years of watching knockoff movies I have never seen one fly so close to the source material and it gets away with this by claiming that it's all a parody but again and I cannot emphasize this enough I do not get the joke it seems like the joke is supposed to be that the source material is being copied as if that by itself is funny this can be most easily compared to the likes of epic movie and disaster movie but I feel like as bad as those movies worth they at least succeeded in finding interesting ways to lampoon whatever they were discussing the same it can absolutely never be said of to boldly flee when you get down to it this style of content where their reference is the entire joke has sort of been the bare-bones basics to a lot of Doug Walker's material for a very long time here's a clip from one of his recent videos let's get this podcast with sketches started I assume you want to talk about my impact on r-rated comic book movies box-office growth and groundbreaking fourth wall humor in the same sentence from another dimension going space but I'm under house arrest for being a copyright mart a good thing we got we got a space house we got a space house people so the nostalgia critic enters the plot whole space thing in his space car and the moment he enters he realizes that he's back in his own home at first he chastises I think God for being so predictable before he opens his laptop and sees a script a script to his own movie written by another version of himself oh my god so the reason that I've been going out of my way to define the Nostalgia Critic as a character is that it's actually the aspect that the creators would probably most easily identify as a defining factor the critic is a character written by many men who has simply acted out by dug like a marionette I would argue one of the main reasons that they stuck so closely this style is that it was a really good defense whenever they stepped over the line in terms of writing but to be fair pretty much most Internet reviewers at the time really stuck pretty close to this stick at the time most of these creators totally fed into the idea pitched by these movies that all of their reviews existed within a cinematic universe where Linkara was running around with a spaceship the original Spoony was killed and replaced by a clone and yes a plot hole is threatening to consume the universe I remember many reviewers built up to this event this was their crisis on Infinite Earths and people like Doug Walker started to take this idea very seriously to the extent that he started to do an IROC analysis of the critics actions within the evolution of his reviews this all leads us to the big reveal of to boldly flee this scene which could not have been more bizarre or heavy-handed I have so many questions about this scene but strangely enough I think the first one is what in the world made up walk or shoes brushing his teeth as the activity he would do as he entered his living room what made him choose that specific thing as the thing he would naturally be doing was this entire movie crafted over a flossing session I cannot emphasize enough how often I think about this scene in my eyes this is the most memorable thing about this movie that Doug Walker walks around his house casually brushing his teeth in the middle of the goddamn day nothing else is worth talking about this scene keeps me up at night for you I live the rider so I'm just a character if you watch a lot of Doug Walker's emotional videos like this one one writing trope keeps rearing its ugly head that being Doug will introduce gag characters who are meant not to be taken seriously and will then have them go through serious emotions all while pointing out how spectacular it is that all of this has happened if you're in the ninth grade this comes across as brilliant and unexpected and if you're any other age it seems charmless and shallow a fact best represented by how the characters have to analyze stories out loud for any of this to be apparent and so the ultimate twist of to boldly flee is that the nostalgia critic despite being someone who is meant to be a caricature of mean annoying people actually occasionally acts with some sense of morality this is what Doug calls developments would the dictator from kick-ass yet actually give a [ __ ] about friends with the money-grubbing egomaniac Ron suburbanite actually give a crap about a dead Indian boy people who are consistently emotionally abusive to almost everyone around them are redeemable if they occasionally seem like they care about their friends I know I've been analyzing this movie in an odd nonlinear order perhaps as a sort of rebellion against the style of videos made by the man himself but you have to keep in mind that in between scenes of Doug Walker telling himself that his writing is brilliant because the credit cares about his friends we keep cutting two ridiculously unentertaining scenes that are the pinnacle of embarrassment all starring dogs friends who clearly seem like they don't want to be there oh wow it's the throne room scene from Star Wars but with really lame jokes come on kitty some films are worth fighting for so I know I joined the Empire and betrayed my friends and nearly helped kill all life in the galaxy but the one thing I kept thinking throughout this whole thing was Logan Paul filmed a dead body and he still has a career it's up to you critic the world of endless possibilities the great mystery who do you think that is this guy just walking by on the sidewalk outside of Doug Walker's home what's his story how did his day go the overall intention of to boldly flee is that it is a swan song for Doug Walker and his creation as I mentioned before he had recently realized that his reviews had peaked and that he no longer found satisfaction making them his plan was to move on to another field of creation comedy skits he was soon fail miserably at this his popularity and his sight would tank and fail and he would put the tie back on but grudgingly under the understanding that it was his only option for longevity so what are you waiting for [Music] you know it's just a matter of time but at the time that to boldly flee was created and released if this was it this was the final piece of media that would ever feature The Critic at the climax of the film with a plot holes about to destroy everything The Critic invites the galaxy to join him in pointing out plot holes in famous films as he allows the hole to absorb the universe and then himself he becomes the world becomes the universe becomes the plot hole and allows the plot hole to become all of reality Doug Walker is now God the final scene has a discussion were Santa Christ meets with all the critics who have suddenly survived and says that the universe exists within a plot hole now so plot holes no longer really matter Oh innocent innocent Santa Christ plot holes never mattered there's this ongoing thread throughout the movie where characters keep saying like slight variations of a similar phrase and it's something like this is the end to a Golden Age of reviews and that certainly seems to imply an undeniable ego to Doug or perhaps his vision of the critic or perhaps his worth through the critic I'm not too sure I feel like if I were to quit YouTube and I were to release this gigantic movie claiming that me leaving YouTube was the end to the Golden Age of all YouTube content you guys would start retro actively liking my content unless the sex doll analysis was the peak of all YouTube content it is all downhill from there it's no wonder that the creators on that guy with the glasses com started to feel like it was less and network being supported by the big guys and more Doug Walker at center stage and the rest of them just serving as decorations around him and by the way almost everyone in the movie found out that the Nostalgia Critic was going to die and that he was going to stop making reviews when they read the script a script which implied that when he left they were going with him you know I I wrote 18 pages of analysis for and I've been editing it while I've been shooting and while I was editing I just realized there are so many like story lines I just never touched because they're they're not interesting and mainly they're the secondary cast just being like really embarrassed and I just didn't feel like touching it there's a storyline where mecha Cara is trying to like get into the ranks and he's turning some of the reviewers into like famous cyborgs that Doug Walker is stolen from other properties and it's just so bad there's a subplot where they go inside spoonie's mind and Spoony they see versions themself how Spoony perceives them which i think is funny because i imagine that's what reading the script for the first time was like except it's Doug it's Doug's mind you know you're just like man Doug really thinks I'm a I'm really whiny okay I have avoided talking about it long enough let's talk about the key aspect of what makes this film so infamous the haphazard production earlier this year I released the video that was a big deal for me because I had worked on it for literally over two years and what the video was it was an April Fool's video and in 2017 I had this idea where every time I would shoot a video I'd shoot like a gag version that was like sort of like an alternate world and I'm still not happy with a lot of it because I had to rush it to get it out when I wanted to get it out and I feel like I could have done a lot of those segments better and in total the video ended up being 3 hours and 24 minutes which is long and it's no wonder I had to rush a lot of segments despite having two years to make it the reason I'm bringing this up is to boldly flee is four minutes longer than that and it was made in a week this movie is longer than endgame and it was made in less time than I spent working on this review there's one set of shots in this movie that I think are all really really telling Doug got a bunch of other characters are in the foreground talking about something honestly who cares and in the background fayliss is there and fayliss it seems has been directed to stand his shot and mess with the house spaceship controls and pretend like he's doing something important as background filler and he seems very exhausted and is moving in the most passive-aggressive way you can imagine making it as clear as possible that he does not want to be in this movie this is the greatest performance of to boldly flee it is the one true time that the emotions of the actor come across as they are intended where you are told everything you need to know about the project another great moment is the final party scene where all of the critics are hanging out and having fun including our dear friend Brad accan except for Valen who just doesn't move the entire the cinematography in this film is so awkward so rushed it really comes across as the sort of work you get when you expect to film a three and a half hour film in seven days there's so many low angles of Doug for no reason I remember when I shot one of my first films in high school and my friends had to sit me down and explained to me that movies aren't supposed to be filmed like this I watched a brief podcast clip done by a bunch of smaller creators last year and they all started reviewing the document and talking about it and suddenly one of them invited their mom over from the hallway and it turned out that she is some sort of industry professional and they told her about the 18 hour shooting days and her perspective on the situation was actually really enlightening she basically said when you shoot a movie and produce it like these people did you either use industry professionals or your friends you can't use professionals because they'll say no because the final product will be very bad and they won't learn anything and you can't use your friends because when the film is over they won't be your friends anymore there's this really funny meta element to this movie where the movie was written under the pretense that Doug Walker was popular and friends with all the people in the movie but he's playing a character who was a jerk and is hated by all of them so everyone in the movie hates him and they don't want to be around him but by the end of production or at least their relationships with him they all really would hate him maybe not because he was a jerk but at least because he was too stupid to treat them the way that they deserved a lot of these scenes really do end up taking an entirely different meaning once you look at them under a modern Vaes it's just that whenever you contact one of your reviewers to see it's a please don't follow me mr. Kurtz none I mean everything I do seems to have a negative impact on somebody I they is fleeting but infamy lasts forever so I want to end this video on what is I think a pretty unusual note I want to discuss the blocker not as a person I dislike but as a reflection of what I don't like about myself as most of you probably know I used to be this guy who is known for making one specific style of video I would hop in front of the camera and be all full of energy and I'd be like guys I found the worst movie of all time and I want to tell you guys about it and why it's bad what kind of various strategies could we could we choose from to approach explain to you what makes it so bad what about this one what if I explained the plot to you really slowly and sometimes I make jokes and a lot of people really enjoy when I made those sorts of videos and I had a lot of fun making them you know sometimes I'd be representing my real views and sometimes I would just be totally going off the cuff and exaggerating for the sake of making the video funnier and that was just the nature of the game as I understood it but then the change the channel controversy happened and it got very dark and very upsetting very quickly and I I suddenly found it harder to go back to that old standard and you know I still did for a while because I didn't know what else to do I had I had a career I had I had to put something out and you know but I just send it up feeling empty every time I was done doing it sometimes it'll get curious and I'll go back through my old Cadillac and I'll pop on one of my old videos and some of them I think are alright I really like The Fairly OddParents video but other videos are really painful either because they like lack all self-awareness or because they're just too much like channel awesome segments you know you know hyper obsessed in all the wrong ways and and forcing anger about a topic which I I really didn't care as much about as I was pretending to you know you know it's the smallest little things that get to me in my second video we introduced this character who's just supposed to be like this big fake evil guy that I wanted to show off every you know every once in a while and we threw on whatever we had around the house this was back when I would hire people if they already had the costumes for the part like a little bud that I had and I found I remembered I had some of those like Spinney goggles and Sammy would wear and it was at a time when I wasn't really watching any of those creators but I still like I still was like oh you know a little nostalgic for that so I had this like scientist character worthies and and I really have I really like that character but just the fact that he looks like Insano makes it so much harder for me to have the same innocent fun we did the first time we used them I had made the aesthetics of my channel to be sort of a lazy copy or perhaps a homage to the works of people like Doug Walker and when I stopped being able to respect him I guess I stopped being able to respect myself to some extent you know I recently made a little short film it wasn't anything special it was just like sort of my take on what I thought what I think Garfield was about and it was a live-action Garfield fan film I called it Arbuckle I wanted to do a follow-up video that I had a sponsor for so I gave myself a very tight deadline I came across this conundrum where actors kept dropping out left and right like flies I think I went through like five Lyman's and everyone for the most part was cool they all had totally legit reasons they couldn't do it you know what life happens and you know like I was honestly so stressed during his time because I really wanted to pull this off and you know when I was in high school and I would make the shoddy films that were just as bad as to boldly flee but it was excusable because I was the Hank I was in like tenth grade I'd make these films and I would do him in almost no time and I would stay up for days and days on end and I would get more stressed every day and I won't get any sleep and one thing you know I just snap at some point but this time I didn't do that I didn't even come close I I didn't push myself nearly that hard because there was this little voice in the back of my head you know whenever I get angry that an actor had dropped it out or I couldn't meet those deadlines and that voice would go hey you're being a bit of a dog walker right now so I ended up you know pushing those deadlines away they didn't exist anymore and I I made filler content to satisfy those sponsors and everyone hated the filler content but that's the game you play and what I realized is Doug Walker isn't just bad he is this beacon of horribleness where it makes you self-critical in just the right way where you can become better just by totally avoiding being him Doug Walker personally ruined an entire sub-genre of internet reviewers for me he ruined the idea of hiding behind a character for every piece you do of nitpicking films one scene at a time but worst of all I feel he ruined lower movies for me in a big way having a channel or comes across as significantly less charming just because it's sort of associated with Doug Walker's take which was so without charm or irony and you know it's sort of hard for a sub-genre not to be defined by the literal worst film of all time existing within its sub space my biggest aspiration as a creator perhaps unconsciously has become to never make any content that even has a slight association with the work of Doug Walker I don't want my reviews to be like his I don't want my actions to reflect his but most importantly I don't want my filmmaking to even be slightly similar to anything he's ever made now if you'll excuse me I have to go brush my teeth [Music] oh my god this is candid you're gonna make my review mortar Robotech look at that very poor boys delirious [Music] hello wait a minute are you oh I'm afraid I am but that's impossible surely it would seem so and yes Here I am you're that weird guy that got bang from Magic the Gathering I'm here now sometimes I put your videos on there so funny you like like all self-awareness no no just did you shut up man shut up geez I thought this would be more obvious than this I'm you man I'm you from a parallel universe oh well that's pretty stupid so is your universe like any different from this one yes completely while in your world you talk about pop culture internet celebrities and obscure Doctor Who episodes in mine I talk about b-movie wait but but I also make videos about the movie yes yes yes buddy in my world literally every video I make is about b-movie I could literally sit down here right now and talk to you about b-movie for three hours straight yeah you know what I feel like I could also do that right now because you know B movies a fascinating film with an incredible background and a lot of lore and I don't really meet a lot of people who know as much about it as I do oh well then I I guess I'm like a deep personality level perhaps were essentially identical wait how many of your close and personal friends have you murdered zero ohoooo there we go that's how we're different I pretty much killed anyone who's ever been nice to me one time I I kidnapped a friend who said the movie was bad and I tied them up in my basement and then I killed another friend who got a piece of trivia I'll be movin wrong and I fed that friend to the friend that I tell you he was so funny oh my god why didn't you lead with that you're probably wondering how I ended up in this world well the thing is I'm not quite sure I was alone in my universe feeling quite isolated and uncertain about my future when suddenly I felt myself slipping and I disappeared from that world and appeared in yours quite mysterious my plan from here is obvious this pretty little face looks exactly like mine except you've lived in a world where you face no controversies made no mistakes if I were to take your place no one would even notice for a second yeah so I'm gonna kill you I'm gonna take your spot on your channel and I'm gonna take your whole life over and no one's gonna notice because we look exactly the same oh man I really want to like sarcastically criticize you right now it's what I usually do but this plan sounds pretty foolproof yes and now in exactly 10 seconds I shall begin murdering you five four three oh I wouldn't say the plan is entirely foolproof that voice was that Caleb in my universe like I killed Caleb just before I came here it's it's my one regret that's not the who is it oh it's just some guy that kind of looks like Caleb he shows up every once awhile let's forget his name or something like Justin or Jimmy or Jacob John miss my name is John miss and if anyone's gonna kill that Robo fool quentin reviews it's gonna be me okay I probably shouldn't tell you this but uh this guy sucks you can kick his ass who rang spit [Music] [Music] I am like the bees rose Jonas you did it you killed me I legitimately didn't think you could do it me neither why did he fade away I have no idea I'm blue okay all right all right what are you doing stop dude stop what is that stop I know how to do stuff Jesus Christ you scared me [Applause] why doesn't anyone invite me his fingers why doesn't one kind of hit me on the head to take me places welcome Quinton I've been waiting a long time for this it's nice to finally meet you by name it's Tommy tuna and I need your help to save the multiverse you Hey I don't really know what's going on right now can I go home all will be explained in due time but before you understand why I need you you must understand who I am for you see I am NOT to this world I really don't care man I hail from a parallel universe much like this one yet slightly different when I was child I wasn't spectacular but I also wasn't understood everyone I knew in my life wanted to give me these outrageous demands except for two people cosmonaut and wandered my personal fairies who granted me any wish that I chose I grew up with them they raised me as if I were their child and often this pushed me away from my peers who couldn't see my Fairley's and thus didn't believe in them as soon as I grew older my failures would be taken away from me knowing this I chose to be held back staying in the fifth grade four years after I was naturally meant to stop you're describing a movie I reviewed once that was a movie about Timmy Turner my name is Tommy Turner we're completely different people oh god I'm in a war movie oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] it was ten years later when I was 20 years of age then I came across one of those friends in the adult world Tommy its Chester remember me this is great Chester and AJ Chester so so what you didn't like college or something uh yeah dude um still in the fifth grade actually [Music] but are you serious my days are great you're so easy I just get to prank Cocker all day hang out with 10 year old girls who play dodgeball I buy him ice cream it is so cool oh yeah man that's great look I gotta like definitely talk to you later all right don't go to the park tomorrow oh god you're describing one of my old skits to me how do I escape how do I escape from the Laura movie the next day I went to the park planning to enact a very serious plot that I had thought of for years but my plans were put aside when I ran into Tootsie she was the love of my life someone I had bullied during my youth what I now couldn't keep myself from Tootsie and I spent days catching up and slowly but surely falling in love on the sixth day she gave me a gift a hat which represented my transition into maturity as I place it on my head I knew I had begun my life as an adult but my fairly soon arrives is who warned me that something was coming soon a blinding light consumed everything around us and a figure stepped out my Fairley's were stolen from me by a very specific politician who I'm choosing not to name Donald Trump what no don't drop trick nut Bailey's man I need my fair we we got a break in the drove our steal by I don't that Donald Trump who is president from that moment I no longer existed it's impossible to measure eternity to gauge how long nothing goes on for but all I do know is that eventually nothing did come to an end as I woke up I realized that everything around me wasn't quite the way it had been moments before an empty parking lot was now replaced with restaurants in a hotel the town I was from was never nice enough to have a hotel this was bizarre I believe now that the politician making that wish had somehow destabilized the multiverse leaving cracks in the foundation of reality at the same time it had sent me into a world similar to my own yet totally different after doing some searching I suddenly found myself recognizing my old friend and I ran to embrace him Jasser Chester and I know it's Jaster my name is Bruce hello fellow citizens I hope justice is proceeding as normal David multiplication man when I told you to get a secret identity I know you try harder than this everyone gonna tell it to you they thought you do after multiplying so many times this jumpsuit is melting to my skin I can't take it off does anyone else feel really tired even though it's not that late it was incredible I hadn't just arrived in any parallel or perpendicular universe to my own but in a world of metahumans with godlike abilities first there was purple guy he was purple I don't think he did anything else then there was multiplication man multiplication man had the power to multiply either one time or five million times with no in between creating perfect copies at himself at the small cost of the original dying almost immediately next was Jerry Falcon Jerry was a scientist who at the age of 22 was hit by a car which catapulted him into a show of scientific equipment which mixed together the perfect chemical concoction that maximizes his aerobic skills permanently damaging his respiratory system thus creating the asthmatic flesh [Music] [Applause] after this came perfect spear man he was a perfect sphere of human flesh and was mostly known for being depressed he made me sort of uncomfortable then there was Bruce Allen a man who looked nearly exactly like the man I knew to be named Chester a child prodigy with an incredible mind he spent his youth creating a super suit which gave him super-strength NIR and vulnerability and flights but it looks so ridiculous that he refused to ever put it on and finally there was their leader a commentary youtuber who I am again choosing not hey man this group who went by the name the supervised swad served as my one protection as I awaited the politician to eventually figure out that I had survives some months later my worst fears came true ah so this is the universe where that fool Tommy has been hiding he is one of the only remaining people who has bore witness to my plans how ironic will it be to use his own Fairley's to destroy him soon the politician began using his power to try and attack the squad he possessed mighty power but we knew the area and held the upper hand until the politician opened yet another portal swallowing us all and catapulted us into the most disgusting world I had ever seen [Music] [Applause] that's pretty cool oh my god so after that horrible acts the chemicals in my mind my depression it cured congratulations scarcely scarce to whom excuse do you Poppi for come in please Tommy Tommy we're really looking really shuttles are you we underestimate this guy seems your bad man things your bad perfect sphere man's out for the count the multiplication and a while Jarrod's have another asthma attack come on now we got to get adding at you buckle buckle are you suggesting that I abandon my squadron this demigod threat is the causality of causality itself does they face certain death I'll see one on damn it he got purple man your Fairley's make this guy impossible to defeat wait a minute that's it I'm going in what you see dude my super suit isn't immune to magic all I gotta do is walk over there kick these guys at us and then we win stay right here I'll be done with this in a second hey I don't know who you really are under that cheap Halloween mask but I do know one thing I'm your worst nightmare [Music] ah come on then eat God's bullets my one kryptonite oh goodness I must have multiplied after I entered the politicians portal before I was knocked out upon her ground I hope I haven't missed anything important and now that your friend is out of the way Toby today it's time to die Oh things are about to get crazy I assure you you and your group of super fools have ruined my evening and my best shirt and now I'm mad so let me ask you this do you have even a single reason that I shouldn't kill you this instant I mean do you know of course I don't know why else would I ask wait how come everything you're saying sounds that I can barely make sense in context what Great Scott the tummy's in grave danger and it's moments away from being shot there's nothing I can do to distract trumpet I'm stopping a mess that's it I must multiply to five million it was then in the chaos which had erupted for multiplication man's defense I happen to look down for the first time and I saw you got damaged just finished breaking after I escaped from your backyard I began to pull together the clues which had been set out before me first Chester then Bruce and now you three men from three different worlds which seemed to be the same it was then that it hit me being in the proximity of the wish had sent me spiraling into non-existence before I found myself in another universe Chester was even closer maybe the same happened to him and so I broke into the politicians HQ and stole some of his technology which I used to build my own dimensional coordinator I began hunting through the multiverse each world stranger than the last and then on one earth I found him he was outside the same building where I had last seen him after finding himself in a world where his social security number no longer worked he had become homeless living on the streets and doing god knows what for even the most basic sustenance [Applause] I'll suck your dick [ __ ] pack him hands okay it was clear that Chester had been through a lot and was likely very traumatized I needed to approach him with the utmost delicacy the sudden shock of my arrival had sent Chester into shock and he passed out I soon was able to wake him up but by that time the politician had found us and had sent some of his laser drones to assassinate us earth 9 is lined up what Chester hesitated entering the portal for just long enough to confuse the dimensional cortex just pausing his late entry to override and corrupt the portal inside we were poisoned by the dimensional Kurtz before we once again found ourselves being catapulted into completely random universe oh my face my beautiful face I'm scarred for life Chester Chester Chester [Applause] some body won't tell me my attempts to find Chester had wasted so much time and as I was gone the politician had managed to genetically modified the only living virgin of multiplication man so he would multiply into infinity this served one simple purpose to power his generator [Music] and now the politician is using the infinite death of my friend to power his massive Space Station if we don't stop him by the end of the day he shall break open the earth killing all life as he drains our world of its most profitable elements before sliding to another world to sell these spoils for profit that's a really dumb plan yeah well it's gonna happen if we don't stop it that's why I have a symbol the greatest team this earth has to offer you me and your world's greatest warrior who I personally resurrected Hey oh Jesus Christ that was you why would you resurrect John this man he sucks Hey well historically I found that many powerful evil figures in your world have resurrected him for their plans so he must be a good fighter or something oh hell no the first person to resurrect John was was an idiot the second person was just copying that guy's plan the third person was simply following a trend he always gets brought back by morons he always stabs him in the back at the last minute and then he comes back to me to try and murder me in an insanely lame way yeah but every time I get brought back a little bit stronger the opposite of that is true every time he gets brought back he sucks a little bit more I have killed this man twice by throwing a DVD at him with mild force look none of this is relevant the gist of this whole thing is that we need to stop the end of the world and we need to know if you're on board listen man I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna give you 35 minutes of my time and I don't care if every version of reality is at stake when that timer runs out no matter what I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go back to my apartment with my cat who loves me more than any cat really should and I'm gonna log in to Nord VPN which you can get at noir VPN comm slash Quentin and I'm gonna watch Canadian Netflix and just to prove to you that I'm serious you now have 25 minutes oh yeah [Music] [Music] mr. president our satellites have been tracking Tommy tuner he's just left his base with a resurrected version of John --mess and youtuber Quinton reviews how predictable of course Tommy would know that the only way to stop someone from destroying the universe is with an Internet critic but the full ISM the gathered one it would take five or twelve to stop this plan at the very least nevertheless we have planned for this contingency Carol activate operation following trend but mr. president surely you're aware that doing that could lead to a massive paradox I didn't ask for excuses Carol you know what never mind I'll do this myself [Music] mecha journeys [Music] [Music] I really think we're lost okay well that's impossible you see I uh to find the space station I actually wrote up a complex algorithm in this custom program I built and it was supposed to spit out the exact location of the space station on this kill map so unless there's some fundamental error I made in the mapping process it should be right here buddy what's his name again Oh Oh hey Thomas yeah buddy who do you suppose that is uh who the young man running towards us at supersonic speed oh it kind of looks like roderick from the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie Jonas I'm like 95% sure that's you what oh you know what I see it now come on guys just because someone looks a little bit like me doesn't mean they're actually me hello elbow bombs okay that's me Quinton darling it's so nice to see you and that it's terrible because I hate your guts last time we met I had broken into your room to show off my newfound palace and then you shot me several times with your gun but now I have returned to defeat you once and for all is that honestly what I sound like I mean sometimes it's kind of consistent half the time you show up I'm like come on dude go through a loss really what the hell is going on I honestly don't know I think I figured it out so a couple of years ago I decided to review an episode of Power Rangers I didn't like but when I got into my house to do so John Mis was there now this was the second time I'd ever seen him and the first time he had tied me up in his basement and forced me to review a Robotech movie so I was a little on edge he was pretty mad about the fact that I got him sent to jail and he started threatening me and really detailed and gruesome ways so I killed him I felt like that was a pretty normal response the weird thing was that a couple minutes later he showed up again he said he'd been resurrected he wanted to kill me again started describing how so I shot him I feel like even sort of guess what happened next for the rest of the evening John was continued to appear at my house over and over again every time under the implication that someone had decided to resurrect him sometimes he didn't tell me who and usually I didn't care to ask every time he would have some new and supposedly brilliant way to kill me which he would spend too much time explaining and then he would die in a really really sad way I never really dedicated but I guess the fact that every version of jamas that I saw that day appeared in rapid succession sometimes within seconds of the previous time that I had killed him meant that there had to be some level of time-travel involved in that whole fiasco essentially what I am proposing is that sometime later during this adventure this version of John MMus will go back into time taking his place in that former review and thus completing the circle I hate that yeah I mean it's me and I hate that - yeah right I mean have we already run out of characters we couldn't bring back cat Bernie Sanders or something now that we're all on the same page let's begin I'm here to kill all of you which I do have this still set to accomplish I'll tear you limb from limb piece by piece then I'll make you savor the pain like a full-course meal this isn't a job to MasterChef jaundice it's a spot well if my counterpart wants to play rough we'll play rough agreed just stop just ignore him what listen man I've been dealing with jaundice for yours now and if there's anything I've learned about the guy he said he's all talk he never does anything he just stands around and yaps his mouth about all the things he's gonna do and then proceeds not to do any of it the moment you respond the moment you interact that's when you've lost because that's when you've given him the power to make a huge scene out of the whole ordeal to make a huge show of it but if you just ignore him she'll burn out or explode in such a ridiculous way that will remove all doubt about the situation now if you'll excuse me I have some tune blasts to play not of course before I make sure that Nord VPN is turned on which you can get at North epen calm slash Quinton how dare you play responsa during our confrontation now I shall truly show you my wrath behold a simple baseball but also the weapon that shall kill us all you see before I left the space station I had the president used Tommy's Fairley's to multiply its force by 18 octillion times simply by throwing this baseball town I shall shatter the earth and send us all into the depths of Hades I'm in too deep enjoying the center of the earth ladies [Music] it didn't work I know it didn't work just give me a minute it this is really embarrassing you're telling me well it's no matter because the prison gave me this remote control that when I press it will not slay the drones will instantly kill you oh [ __ ] there are a little levels oh that sucks man trap it in there yeah can you please pay attention to me for one minute [Music] this is very rude I'm trying to kill you you won't even watch away to watch itself fight with you no one why are you bad anyway I take it back this is embarrassing Thomas you me maybe maybe one or two resurrections down the line but but a few to me stand with me work with me listen there's no one who shares what we do this there's no one more like you than me remember our 10th birthday party when Uncle Jack took us to the carnival he made sure I never stopped smiling that day when we watch the sunset on the ferris wheel that's the happiest I've ever been oh forget don't forget who we are I don't have an uncle Jack excuse me my parents were only children I don't have any uncle no that's it that's impossible remember he's right here at my data files data files you know what I've actually heard about this some universes have these advanced androids that can generate fake skin or extract memory as long as corpses they come pre-installed with these generic memories in the same way a Windows computer comes equipped with these stock images of like a family having dinner or a sunset or a fish with uncle okay wait a minute I remember this version to you now he calls himself Mecca John because he comes with all these cute little gadgets and his hands have no continuity this was fun okay but I'm not an Android and I've never called myself mega John this oh [ __ ] further theory the previous time-travel theory you know how every time someone resurrects you they steal better your DNA or rebuild you from scratch or whatever what if this version of you sucks so much that the next guy to come around and Wanda's on ciamis just went back a generation so like this one doesn't even count in the grand scheme and this version means it even Canada he's not even he's not even a job it's just some guy who's been programmed to believe that he's jaundice think about that being an Android you can be anyone in the multiverse and you're forced to be chopped I'm right here oh no that can't be possible no that's not true I'm Jon miss me no one else absent you John Chris you're lying to me give me Joe No [Applause] [Music] wait a minute we need to go now we're gonna miss the time limit yeah yeah cuz I'm gonna leave at some point if you guys don't hurry this up because I really don't know I'm not enjoying myself right now so everybody better run let's go we better run [Music] there it is the Space Station a pinnacle modern engineering nothing this world has ever seen before it would be truly magnificent if it weren't being used for evil we're all seeing the same thing right the series of cardboard boxes being held together with masking tape does anyone else hear distinct screaming that's multiplication man is infinite death is powering the space station honestly man that's marvelous [ __ ] wait a minute dude do we have a plan did you even think we would get this far I mean honestly Tommy I don't I don't trust your leadership here oh oh right all right so you remember how I traced Chester before before I settled for you well actually I needed one of you for a specific reason and you guys know what this is a vintage micro change watch transformer come on it's more than that it's Bruce Allan's Morpher we'll see the guy in your flashback that turned into a dinosaur come on then right this is what gave him super strength and vulnerability and the ability of fly he programmed this today only something with his DNA could use it so no one else could use it for evil I had to find someone with his exact DNA to continue this plan right okay so your logic was you had to find some of this DNA so it had to be chaste or me because you knew that the three of us were sort of interdimensional counterparts right and so your plan is I'm going to use this I'm going to morph into the superhuman dinosaur I'm going to fly up to the space station I guess punch a hole in is gonna fly down here I'll pick up all of us and we'll fly up there and then we'll have some sort of epic confrontation where I'm positioned as a god and maybe I have to sacrifice myself to save all of humanity exactly we're not doing any of that what hear me out man this entire day this entire hell of an evening has and this strange coded rhythm of bizarre references to my previous content and why are we going along with it the bad guys are using this against us why would we play along from my perspective it makes a lot more sense to stand here be logical for a moment and just think through this and try and find a way to weaponize the successive continuity against the bad guys alright but while we're doing that we could be wasting valuable time here I mean think about it lives are on the line guys I really think we need to trust win over here I mean do we really even have a choice like and plus I you know I believe even who is that mr. president Jon miss Tommy and the internet critic Quinton reviews are all directly outside of the space station yes I see them Carol go ahead and turn off the comlink I have some coding to do so Quinton my boy you have finally arrived I've tried all these years to distract you for my little project but it seems you've been drawn back to it at the end little do you realize that disappearance I've taken on is nothing more than a disguise how will you react I wonder when you discovered that the person behind all of this is not Donald Trump but in fact yeah pretty dumb come on me don't be like that what is we could use my time machine you're you're what so when I was in high school I took part in a multimedia class which basically taught us basic broadcasting tactics now this class had existed for a very long time in the school and I became personally obsessed with picking out random tapes from past classes and watching them one day while trying to do this our regular VCR happened to die on me and my media teacher mr. Nobel invited me to give another one when I hooked it up I discovered that it was set to that very day and after Nobel left into the hall for just a moment it began to pulse with electricity giving me a shock and causing me to vanish into thin air when I woke up I realized that the school looked totally different than it had moments before as did the student body the classes an ironic admiration for Will Smith hip-hop caused me to realize that I had traveled into the past I had Quentin leaped for some time after this I grew accustomed to living in the past with no real way to get back this was until a teacher at the school brought to me a new invention the same VCR which I had used to arrive I was able to quickly use it while he was out of the room and time traveled back to 2014 there my friends had just discovered a letter which I had written for them decades before causing them to celebrate my death she was dated or at least that's always how I've imagined it I wasn't actually there for that part the next year when I graduated the new media teacher was so distracted upgrading everything to HD and blu-ray that they didn't seem to notice me sneaking the VCR out under my robe also it's worth noting I had done so much time traveling by this point I'm pretty sure I was like 25 long story short is I still have the time machine it's sit around my place when you shower don't have money to leave the town that you live in time travel gets boring fast especially a small place like this I mean God god forbid this place and never changes so I mainly use it if I find like expired coupons or if I want to pick up some gas in the 80s otherwise it just like sits around my house sometimes I use as a really CR which is not advisable but you know that's that's the whole story well this is perfect we can use the VCR to go back in time before the politician even made the space station and stop them then yeah there's just one problem what's that it's back in my place I don't feel like going to get it oh well back to the drawing board Quentin you remember when you open that why you're gonna make me blush yes it is I your father many years ago I abandoned you at Disneyland and said I was going to buy cigarettes but instead I decided to become an evil scientist you have wished it on me over the years as you grew up but ironically our paths across many times do not look for other frosty sequels they do not exist they never did the hell out of my house [Music] start locking my doors but you do start knocking her door so a year ago I enacted my greatest plan against you yet make the entire third sinning movie about Wade Freeman preferably the final act of the movie would involve a scene where Wade Freeman saves the day and I think I'm gonna need that $5.00 cuz this room has just spontaneously caught on fire okay once you come upon the space station in every will you can choose between your friends or ruling the multiverse with your own father oh my god what I think I got it like for real yeah John masseur remember a couple years ago when I did that power use review we've already talked about this he kept coming back with more and more stupid ways to try and kill me and one time you weren't so intent of trying to do it you brought an army of millions of alien spaceships and you arced them right above my house then we're all gonna like blow my house up it's right to trite the this intro end track yes the zen tribe thieves and dr armada they are some of the fiercest warriors and may I say partiers of the galaxy okay all you saw the stupid stuff you do all sort of melts together in my mind after a while can you remind me how I stopped that threat okay okay um so I think you I think you got angry you walked outside your front door and then you use you glared at the Armada on until it blew up that's what I thought I did I thought I went outside I cleared it and then literally everything blow up I think I killed a bald eagle I mean Tommy no offense buddy this thread feels way less severe than that honestly what is stopping me from just doing that again the fact that this would be really anti-climactic who care quinton come on [Music] here in smoke oh is that all it's gonna do you smoke oh look at that it's on fire oh wow so it is one inferno up there look look at that look at those flames it is burning ghetto what is happening who the hell are you I'm Donald Trump under the mask you you missed a big thing there I don't know what happened quinton reviews was just staring up at us and suddenly the entire space station was on fire down the boy realizing her jeans give us an incredible glare I must get to the escape pod huh we did it I saved everyone well you did kill multiplication man and tell me stories in the process you can't prove that look the ship's gravity fields are disabled and it's lowering to the ground oh yeah look at that it's coming right down yeah yeah that's nice pretty cool that [ __ ] is gonna start a force [ __ ] you were totally right let's get the hell out of here before were killed or blamed [Applause] well guys it's been a long day but I'm glad I stuck through it in the end there's been quite an adventure yeah I couldn't agree more this has truly been one of the greatest days on all of Earth okay now you're overselling it well boys I want to thank you for your help today but I think I'm gonna head out I want to go back to my universe and see if we can rebuild well Tommy it's been good getting to know you I like you're some kind of sad to see you go in the end oh don't worry Quinton I think we'll meet again sometime [Music] huh well all's well that ends well I suppose yeah although I can't help but feel like we've forgotten something important oh really [Music] hello boys I'd like to thank you for our previous conversation oh sure at first I was horrified to learn that I am not really John miss but then I realized what a blessing this was John miss was weak and inferior we never did a damn thing right this whole life I'm not John this I'm better than John miss behold my latest creation my nano blocks are nano boxes both names are correct the perfect breed part science part Magister II and the perfect killing machines that's not true now bear witness as my bio skin finishes recharging and is fully restored oh I forgot I was naked one second as I was saying the Nano boxes taken disintegrate any any organic material with one blast and then I will finally be rid of my nemesis and be the one true Janice hey mecha John miss buddy it looks like some of your FiOS skin didn't restore right well look at that it's no matter now I can proudly show my Android heritage and prove that I am the perfect mix of machine and jaundice [Music] yeah hi MJ out of curiosity dear nano cubes have time travel technology why yes yes they do well why don't you just use them to time travel back in time for 2017 to the last time I killed you then you can kill me then it'll be like this whole adventure never took place you owe with this idea you have sealed your fate litter boxes metal blocks whatever take me back to March 2017 to this fool's home so we can kill this issue at its root john miss i'm john miss john mrs. no more i've become far more powerful than any regular jaundice ever could become for I am Wow Robo fan you you did it he's gone just like that yeah you took care of him that's incredible you're incredible good job yeah well buddy it's it's good you're not like that anymore yeah so yeah and you're gonna pull out that gun it's not like just gonna sit there you fool I was never on your side the whole time I was evil evil the whole time you never saw it coming oh no he's gone rogue oh that's not the only thing I lied about okay so I know you're going for me to be like deeply horrified but I'm more confused i-i-i i don't know what back when i was mecha john miss you had convinced me that i was not in the lineage of john miss at all so when I faced my death in 2017 at the hands of you throwing a DVD I thought it would be my final however in the year 3033 I was revived by the tang empire as super Jonas to help them destroy the sin tribe Armada however I immediately betrayed the tang empire and I was working with his end drive Armada on one condition that they first send me back to 2017 and help me blow up your house then you killed them all with your Claire but then I was resurrected as star convoys on this [Music] when I first found the orb of opulence oh my god shut up I don't care you convinced me Mecca Jonas wasn't Ken I don't know why you did it because it literally helped you in no way throughout this entire thing in fact it arguably hindered your plot but there you go you did it man you took something complex and you made it more complex congratulations oh it helped me in one way in getting assistance without you ever knowing think about it why do you think no one could detect mine Android circuitry it's almost as if I was cloaking my wavelength don't you dare you son of a [ __ ] that's right to spell dammit that's true and now Quentin watch as I take not only your life but your entire career okay do it what do it shoot me right now like what I'm not gonna do it it dies obviously trap what what's so funny who are you trying to fool here man is it me or is it yourself because we both know what's gonna happen here you're gonna keep ranting about the fact you're gonna shoot me you're not gonna do it you're not gonna shoot me because you never do and eventually you're gonna get distracted by something that just happens and and you're gonna end up focused on that and then you get a die in a really pathetic way and yeah in the end you'll come back in two or three years and a really stupid thing and you'll try and kill me and and then you'll die again in a really lame way don't you ever get tired of how like endlessly pedantic you're like your life always proves to be that that's not true that's not true and and and I don't prove it I'm gonna prove me you'll see I'm gonna kill you I'm gonna kill you right now and and and to make you suffering worse I'm gonna count down from five I'm gonna count down from five and at either one or zero you will be dead because I would have shot you all right five four three two here now what's going on here mr.
