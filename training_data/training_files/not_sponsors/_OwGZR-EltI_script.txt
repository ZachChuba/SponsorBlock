The observable universe is 93 billion light
years across. But just how big is that? Well, it's roughly 100 quintillion (10^20)
times the size of the Earth. For comparison, imagine taking this whole
1920 pixel by 1080 pixel video and making just one pixel white and the rest black. If you were to take each row of one thousand,
nine hundred and twenty pixels and string them all end to end, then shrink that huge
distance down to the size of one pixel of the video, string the new video's pixels out
end to end, shrink it all down AGAIN to the size of one pixel of video, and string the
pixels out end to end once more... that one tiny white pixel represents the earth, and
the string of all the pixels all together, is one tenth of the diameter of the observable
universe.
