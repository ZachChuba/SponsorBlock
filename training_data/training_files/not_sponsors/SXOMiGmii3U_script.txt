would you think of that buddy I like that very awesome why you got me one of those ships as a vanguard they're just blue bias sorta bin is coming yeah Erika's here it's tough which died which side find you ah sit oh I love that st. look at that cell all those bad news sounds so amazing yeah heck yeah nice oh look here comes the Valkyrie coming up with I count that whoever's flying that Valkyries awesome pilot what is going on guys thank you so much for coming back to Cobra TV this is a special video for me for me it is one of my old co-host to a show that I used to do here on YouTube joined me finally in star citizen and I was able to give him a tour and kind of show him around we went to micro tech and we showed him a few ships some flybys we showed him what you know when new Babich look like I'm long-winded so I'm gonna get through this part pretty quickly and it meant a lot to me um I had such a great time being with sword who's a no man's sky streamer and being able to just be in this verse with him was such a memorable experience for me nothing spectacular happened like we weren't attacked by anything there was no super like really I don't know emergent thing that happened to us it was just two people who've known each other for a very very long time one of which who has finally decided to jump in and fly around with me for a little bit um and it was great it was so wonderful and I just want to share this moment with you on another note we used to have a Friday podcast here on Cobra TV that's coming back it is coming back 100% so it's a call-in show where we talk about the news of the week and then you guys get to call in and have a voice and talk about star citizen and we don't bring up any topic that you would like so that is coming back this Friday on what's the date going to be just occasion watching this in the past it is going to be this Friday on June 12th June 12th we're going to be bringing back the Friday live podcast on YouTube so I look forward to hearing from you guys but please check out this video it is just some footage that means a lot to me it really does and welcome sort welcome to the first buddy I hope you stick around we need somebody like you thank you hey I got a member of one of my old co-hosts from back in the day when we stood the no man's sky sub guess we got sword sword how you doing dude what's up buddy I'm doing fine man I'm doing fine I'm gonna take you on a tour I know you'll get a whole lot of time so we're probably again to ether just go to one place or maybe only two or something like that and we took forever to get here but um I'm here now so I'm going upstairs to meet sword and we're gonna take the constellation Phoenix probably out to Microtech what do you say guys you think that's a good introduction or no oh yes yeah I guess you can start with new Babich and work towards the unfrozen lands wear something warm or just go straight to the Sun that's war soar what's up man you ready to go to somebody already go on a tour yeah man let's roll okay let me state real quick everybody knows him from the no man's sky community we I've spent many years ever since 2014 I've been heavily involved in no man's sky community I am in no way shape or form trying to steal sword from the no man's sky community let that be known and I hate Penicillium no I'm not no you know nobody's gonna believe you I both of these games can be played the other day ask these guys I fired up no masks I didn't I yes you did you could play both yes both games so sword I hold on my to figure out what Patamon it did it didn't tell me so I got a look at the computer I got a look at the computer hold on micro Tech has green very earth-like areas and then the other parts of the planet there's like frozen oceans with glaciers and frozen glaciers in the middle of them there's very snowy forest there's forest areas all over it it's very beautiful place and it's got a very high-tech city in it as well ice the whole planet is a terraforming accident that's why it's cold so well one of the reasons why some of the terraform planets in this star system look earth-like is because humans terraformed them and brought things with them from earth to use to terraform it that's the way the Lord goes now pretty soon we're gonna get space cows that are from another planet and they are alien like and they carry eggs where their udders are supposed to be they're ugly ugly and in oh sorry go ahead are you gonna talk about the space wells oh yes all right go ahead and talk about the space wells and it's very soon afterwards we'll get these massive massive space wheels they are kilometers something can be kilometers long but for the moment they are big really big massive and they man they um they used they hang they live inside this gas giant called crusader and you'll be able to from outside the planet you'll be able to see their backs like breach in the atmosphere and going back down inside and we're gonna be able to go in and either a hunt them or get resources mind resources often than like scales or whatever they got on Coco so we get space wheels before no man sky get some yes we will yes no man's sky it was more like a mean you know as you said that they didn't plan on it but it keeps ending up on the white board and he says who knows one day they might actually make it in sword this is the constellation Phoenix also known as his Cobra force one ice and sortie if you think - ship is big wait till you see some of the other ones - I've seen the 890 jump up Everest yet covered in his tour on it and I think Ivy Mike or somebody was streaming and somebody had a hammerhead and I was pretty big - that is a fun ship to play on let me get the lights turned on so you could take a look around in here all right there we go lights are turned on guys show them around back yeah shotgun all right hey cuz ones you clear for takeoff it's like thank you very much nemesis one this is what lore Ville looks like at night oh nice yeah in the external view bartender Bingaman Randy Lambert about rate of rent hugging you yeah you can go all over this planet there's beaches and all kinds of stuff here eat all right we're gonna go vertical put up the landing gear oh nice the when you're trying to go into gear the struts retracted yeah here we go exiting atmosphere rib in progress at an exit atmosphere got a character behind us to see that Carrick yeah yeah I went ahead and started I recorded whenever you popped being may added a little video about this yeah do it you could use anything from this tweet-tweet anywhere I'm low on water I might die of thirst but uh it's gonna be well worth it I got you covered okay thank you buddy knows that for bring you back to first person yes nice all right we're going to the winter wonderland one of the most beautiful planets in the verse mikrotik here's a token in the background did you up get you a quantum drive not on not on here no I gotta get out of here I'll take a while and like there can make it there two minutes lexan broke he knows I don't like to carry that's why you Kara came hurries up Phoenix shaming me right now yep yep just like you shuttle shave me in no man's sky oh wait you brought it on yourself buying a shuttle date like that is a no man's sky man listen seriously seriously that's enough man come on ships in the game shuttles are like worse than hitchhiking I'd rather fly through space thanks to other gay than the flying [ __ ] this is a real truth coming in Oh trust me I it's been long said that I should have shame you somebody here to get a star citizen alright so sword we're we're getting ready to take now is called an om if you look well you won't be able to see it but if you ever look on this video there is with the goatee galactic map it's like a GPS at galactic positioning system right and it'll show you like directions on how to get to where you're going so I plotted a course for micro tech and first it's telling us that we have to take an om 4 which is orbital marker 4 and that's a jump point that you could take - to get around a planet or get around an obstacle that's keeping you from getting where you need to go so we got to take the OM 4 which is what we're gonna jump to right now so pull up the quantum drive I fell out of your ship how I got out of the top turret and I fell right through oh no we did the other night in the Hammerhead no dude we were we're all named rands never won it never been able before and I saw an elevator I was like oh this will probably take me up to where the captain's is hammerhead is on one floor ship and I flew right out during quadrant spacing microts acts are you guys alright and now we are going to plot our course for micro tech this is a planet all these planets in this particular star system are owned by corporations micro tech makes the MOBA class that use on your wrist sort of like the iPhone of the first they got a monopoly on them on the industry there and they bought it planets and it's a cold planet which is good for making electronics and stuff like that so that's what they do here plus they also have other high-tech firms and companies that they rent space to and purchase nice and I'm liking this and we are the 37 million kilometers wait so why don't we get up and take a look go take a look around the ship any eggs you just hit white white cocoa and this is the industrial section of the ship and over here you got a bathroom here you got a bunch of places where you can put your and it's here soon we're gonna have multiple suits that we can store inside these that we could change it to for weather run a hot planet cold planet here's beds right here that you could use to log out in and this is the nice part of the ship fancy oh man right here you go yeah yeah disabled the ability to sit down because people are falling out of the ship okay perfect they're in the process of fixing it but you can sit down over here and over there at the table and stuff like that here's a bar her water captain oh thank you so much buddy is that why those chairs don't work no freakin Jacuzzi in here yeah that ship right there it it looks big from the outside but it looks bigger inside you're in and talk you're in a target stick I just joined in what's your business this is the constellation Phoenix but we're showing an 890 jump it's got full-on spa swimming pool and dude the only thing I wonders what happens when you year Sergey uh good luck yeah you can jump out of here you'll be in the middle of dead space we'll have to find you now I mean it with the jacuzzi hey man [ __ ] this yeah it's a great ship me and Vega take this out all the time family got you that jacuzzi dear come check it out you got a leg up but sword there is so much you could do in this game other than just fly around and look around we have we could go on bounty hunter missions and hunt other players who have done bad things we could send them to prison we could accidentally go to prison or we could become wanted criminals and be on the run from the law by nbc's and grill players and we would have to go to like this government security outpost and hack the computer to erase our crime stat and when I have ER I do it I always choose because you have to say the reason why you're erasing I always choose mental incompetence right right if somebody sees it they're like oh that's Korea is an idiot yeah that's there's nothing wrong here nothing here mr. Magoo who starts it you can do box delivery missions which in itself does not sound fun but it is extremely fun you never know what's gonna happen to on these missions I've been in some really immersive box delivery missions men that have just blown me away made some of the greatest memories in gaming I've ever had a chance to explore the verse yeah it takes you wanted to where the verse really and it gets you to understand the controls on how to kind of quantum and just a lot of things it's a very good training course for star citizen doing box livery missions could go to purchase drugs illegal drugs and sell them we could do cargo trading we could go and be mercenaries and do some claim-jumper missions we can be bad guys yeah just be dumped here don't forget Cobra you got to watch out what you have in your cut in your cargo because you also get interdicted you can't Lancer right yep yep if we have something illegal on the ship we we all even if you don't you'll get pulled over by the cops every now and then and they'll do a scan and if you have something bad you're in trouble you're in trouble or you can shoot up your friends like what cope with us all the time you know you if you're doing something bad and the security you don't want to take an easy route to your destination because you're more likely to get pulled over so you might want to go like all the way around to get there or do something that's out of you know unnecessary to get to your location so there's gonna be like what you call it lanes like smuggler Lane right exactly yeah it reminds me so much a Firefly and this is not a loading screen I can pull this out of quantum right now we'll be in the middle dead space and nobody ever find us nobody but yeah there's just so much that you could do in this game on on a surface like every time I upload a video I'm always uploading videos of me doing gameplay loops but as soon as I upload one we're just flying around tons of people come into comments Oh what is this a flying simulator a walk you said there's nothing else to do in this game but look at stuff I might comment that on 90% of my videos you can't you can always find things to do in star citizen oh yeah it's just costs too popular any man yeah we're almost there sunset Sun setting yes sir it'll be behind you and you're the perfect time did this him so beautiful now how realistic stood a not hold the planets there yeah I mean like if you land on dark sides it's like dark all night or the entire time your own or no yeah there's like memory and skyworks like 15 minutes and it doesn't do speed of the planet every planet has different rotations yeah yeah but this planet so if the whole planet is a physicalized object and it rotates in space yes so it used to hang what part of the place if it's dark is gonna stay dark until it's crest the horizon outside the planet is rotating so it'll I don't have a real day/night cycle actually can sit and watch the sunset and some planets the day/night cycles quicker based on the size of the planet the from the speed of the rotation and I think the longest one would you guys say is our core I think it's actually my architects the longest one right now it's the Rubies planet yeah that's a market that goes I think my dick is the longest one and then I think the Sherwood is one it might be damar because I waited on arccorp one time for it to turn daylight forever don't know they just coming near you it's your porch is ler I know the thing with damar is this is a special moon it's actually most planets bins I think counter-clock know clockwise but they Mar spins counterclockwise yeah the spaceport is off to your left those lights out there the red and white lights so if we wanted to land and go into the city we can go over there but we could land anywhere we want to you can see a little bit of the trees below us like this and there's a rail system that we're gonna fly by and the true and the bubble trains that you see on like the bubble capsules or whatever you want to call them those are real it's not an animation there could actually be players traveling on those yeah I like to hang out upside down above them yeah good good professor or whatever is like have the buildings have the neon signs on the side of them oh yeah oh this place looks beautiful at night yeah you can actually see the hotel over here probably to your right I think yeah that will cruise over there real quick okay on a pic of a Marisa we party on top of that building all the time whoa 600 I right above us yep and a hawk just flew nares yes oh this is the nest this is where we have our apartments in this we would take we would land over there straight ahead at that spaceport oh and then favoring him you know whoa whoa there was a prowler right there Wow let's go down and show him the windows good I saw you do you see the bubble trains yep yeah there could be players on that and then up here it's a very top floor and if someone was standing in there you'd be able to see them looking out yeah I now all these buildings are you able to go inside them not yet they're work you got it okay yeah there's you can go into a whole bunch of places but it's not everything yet yeah I'm not sure how much because that takes a lot of memory I don't know how they're gonna open everything up but they are gonna have a lot of key facilities with actual stuff in them because there's not much point in having just empty buildings with prep I forgot about that Pat over there tilt your camera to where you can see no an f4 and then take it look around to where the sun's going down and look at that shot nice and that beautiful this door hates you did all right formation Weiss let's go find a nice place out here to land and get out oh I want to land probably over here near the trees no no we'll go check out one of the nice green spots on the day side because it's starting to get dark here I think I think I've got a spot over here all right yeah you find a good spot and I'll quantum to you but on the planet here the green area is versatile I love the sound of the ship oh my god some of the ships if you buy the engines it's intensely loud louder than Wow engine sounds so amazing stop laughing at me stuff back in the honeymoon stage yes alright alright so let's go ahead and get out and check this uh check this area out and every place on these planets it's it's all unique turn ooh well do any of you guys okay any of you guys may grab a ground vehicle sorts yeah my car you can add your own I'm gonna grab one look at this what all these trees up here with that golden sun or golden sky any wildlife on the planets or not yet no they're adding it see that the really cool thing about star citizen is you pledged to help back the development of the game and at the same time they let you play it while they're making it yeah and so we get a chance and sometimes that could be nerve-wracking so I'm always honest in my videos there are bugs in this game because they're constantly making it as we're playing it which has got to be a very difficult thing to do um let me ask you this how responsive are they to turn to you most like like this like that like vinne desk where you report it and yeah oh very responsive the slogan is this is star citizen and it's made by the community so oh they listen to us the backers more than like you realize come into the community design and voted ship in production right now yeah I just could've Redeemer and look at anything for third person look at your suit oh man frost enough yeah if you get cold enough your screen I'll start doing it too yeah if you get hot enough you'll see your your faceplate start to warp and get what rainbowy it's pretty cool yeah this guy in front of us is gonna die soon yeah there's oxygen but he's gonna die of hypothermia here in just a second look at it running towards the ship get it running I better hurry up dude watch him die right as he gets to the same come on run Forrest run I check out this 300 by the way he made it darted aah all right all right so yeah this is the cold spot now when you're you could go through here and just explore and you could buy a suit that'll help you last longer and let you live longer how much time is this and your survival clock down there uh 24 minutes okay you're good you're good for right now so all right starting to frost up yep yep let's go ahead and get back on the ship we need better suits we're not we're not prepared to be out in this cold right now a while I guess I'm it'll frost you if you can't even see I'm liking this yeah let's go on the Prowler who's flying the Prowler right now me left for all right let's gun on a prowler source this is a really cool ship this is an alien ship from a alien race called the tour barn and they are like a bird species mr. Joe right here the ship is actually a oldest they refurbish also not rebuilt with time I forgot it's like remanufactured it's like reverse akira xperia and what they do is they take alien technology and they backwards engineer it and we can sit it's a drop ship this is where you would load up a bunch of people and we'd all go to war and they would drop us off in a battle area all right ice more okay so did you find a good spot Stephon Berg I am I'm flying them to the planet's surface I'm still 18 plus 18 kilometers high okay what of course Bora for us Stefan Berg I don't get me just yet you might die anybody have water in their inventory oh this is a cool view I haven't been inside one of these yeah so the inside is very bird because if you go in third person and look up at the top it kind of looks like nesting like bird nesting I switch views at fourth I got at four but it's dunno I'm inside the ship looking oh yeah he was talking about the top of the inside we can't yeah we can't go exile from these seats but if you look up you can see like like it looks almost look like bird nesting oh yeah yeah nemesis stuff everywhere there is a cockpit are you in the downstairs cockpit with us yes sir okay you can jump in you can fly I don't bad idea Oh made you see a 3d print model I got may know from what I got a 8 inch wide 3d print of my Explorer open up your door in front of you that's awesome now where you can see outside Oh Coco yeah big there's money here I'll do this so you can see the Sun can you see that it's kind of like the view is kind of like obstructed from the shielding ah that's a shame hawk just flew right by us so you gots me you got 3d model of what I'm sorry I didn't you you know it by wing Explorer I born my favorite Explorer in the game I had a member of the community started doing 3d print models right and I sent him some screenshots he made the cab file and made a was a 10-inch a wingspan model of mine Wow pretty cool go ahead a club to meet yeah I got a I type my spirit yeah I'm thinking about buying some models from this game too I know that's what I was gonna say man this be a great game to do oh I know you like the Eclipse and saver with us waving leans to be made I love the sounds of these ships flying around this yeah uninitialized adduction I was really under the interpretation it's gonna be a very human base universe but I gotta say they're really what I'm seeing with their alien cultures they're really doing a good job yeah the sword they got like several different alien species almost like in no man's sky right no I guess they got too far in the G on the vanduul what else guys Venu Venu man ooh and what they've done is they've actually created real languages you can learn and speak for these for these alien species like almost like learning how to speak Klingon to try I don't think bad news the language is actually compatible with our vocal cords oh really that sounds too boring man dude I think you about got me convinced this is awesome dude I like I'm gonna start doing a couple days a week star sitting on the second channel awesome dude do it George put it in auto pilot quick and how about you probably know not 21 kilometers never mind first the reason I'm in my seat buckled in and he's not joking either what was what's the key to get you to start praying when I get a copy is the X button all fourth with Cobra before then well you know we were buddies and lemon sky for a while you know it was just as bad there too oh yeah yeah the wind for a second I had a little bit of turbulence that was nice one of my first time seeing this mountain ice so and whatever you got a little bit something really you've never been here not this site then Oh my firt a machinist up all right coming it down we're landing we don't talk about my computer you're like 60 you know what's missing in the game it's it's a compass yeah why don't we know ice well we don't even have a thing that tells us what direction are you coming sir this we have yeah absolute position pursue precision positioning so we don't need north-south east-west look up but look up at the Sun it's do any go fly out so you got yeah it's flat oh by the way yeah somebody do sebab wife ice your so here we go i jusu that sword I need ship has a different sound that was the Sentinel yeah every ship has a different sound where'd you go oh good I guess okay on to all my favorite bombers coming in alright somebody's coming in for a flyby that won't be um I know all right come on keep going that was me that went over the first time yeah you should have kept on goin but now that we don't talk about my I offered to build one for him but you know I come up one on you you knit huh oh I know you can okay you know now he was he was looking up the pictures of my liquid cooling and stuff like that he was like begging me but if it of me what do you think of that buddy I like that thank you bite me one of those ships as a finger there just flew bias booming where you crossing your fingers a bit because I studied a stupid it was pretty nice coming back again right behind you was the COBOL yeah well say that that's the Vanguard he's landing a Harbinger yep and you just come over here look at these mountains over here these West iced mountains you like that size 5 fix their Cobra dude that is massive like I told you did alright Cobra I'm coming in for a flyby ok one of the best parts one of the best parts about those ships they're still working on you just because over there who is it where would you go I'm like right yeah yeah he's over this way I heard one of the things about the way the ships are right now they're still working on all their activities shooting out program systems and everything like that but you can still like right now shooting off a wing will kill all the guns on that wing all the missiles shooting off the front or the back hitting the fuel Sailaja blow up the whole ship like this parts are coming off literally where they are hit so I'm a 15 kilometer zone okay those mountains over there I know man it would take us over an hour to walk there properly oh my directly behind you guys I think and we could if we wanted to I mean we can all go hiking go out there and I don't who knows what could happen to us on the way somewhere huh huh yeah you ever try to uh you ever try to run until your heart rate goes up to the point you pass out no he has done that sort a bit is coming yeah here it comes here it stuff which guy which side find you ah sit I love that st. well here that sell all those bad news sounds so amazing it's probably the best sign in ship it is they will have a lot of reasons to wander around on the ground right now the only main interactable czar in caves they've done some good work in caves but they're working on open ground I'll do a high pass for you guys so you can secure the difference okay how do you run hold shift down shift yeah and it just make sure you know your middle mouse will scrub all the way up yep oh-ho here comes coming by again oh that's the hawk that's the hawk i suction dopamine release seen those chips go by like that alright I'll do another low flyby see how close I can get shoot at us but don't try it try not to hit us boy you can shoot a little fuss here he comes here he comes right we do see one of these guys crash in our in our in our organ day or two ago we had a lot of people blowing up ships from up in the air and watching a ship fire down on the ship on the ground is one of the most beautiful sights I've seen the video game yeah bring out my savings thank God and this safe here you could we could take off her our suit earth spacesuits and get into whatever co-op I get to pass by chickens I was try to get a screenshot mean you awesome other L group numbers cover the lawns way up we're all good Cobra is with us now where do you think buddy this is only one percent of what I can show you right now like one percent cocoa you can see it still over in the air no bind you right over there oh yeah yeah it's a big ship man huge let's get ready flybys do a nice slow flyby l later too because this sounds amazing okay goodness I can hear it already hey there boy someone like me gets lost yeah that goes Kronos great I'm stuck on our court the elevators aren't working are not our court Microtech do better sometimes i double-click no the screen is actually blank I've got a cleaner or whatever and it won't let me out yep I had no buttons there's like a minister destroyer and this ship's been vastly different to not all yeah that just flew by tastic Ellis ditalion the caracal was just hit each other feedback almost have an explosion there here comes belfry his shield saved him on that one you are atmosphere courses and like gravity and stuff can control how much of an angle you can go up in the air when you go into the space depending on what what chrono flan that's a retaliate er that is a bomber ice looks like it's Bay's open to the nice undercarriage by bed look at that carriage sword you want to see the transformation of the defender we're gonna look at the Carrick slanting all no it's not there's two carats here Carrick you back your backs on some rocks oh the banner yeah man I was watching the Tigers video when he had the banner defender are 10 feet there's gonna be a crash there's gonna be a crash oh that was fast you having a hard time landing they're growing off I've been drinking a little bit there's lots of products you're on yeah you're on oh there's a carrot coming in pretty fast Wow Fowler looks so good swords getting the nares right here it looks like the Empire's coming in [Laughter] da-da-da-dah yeah take it nice now if they blow up does it kill us too if you're close enough yes okay let's stay behind the rock and watch this you guys are oh look here comes the Valkyrie coming up with the way to us guys I count that whoever's flying that Valkyries awesome pilot its Dallas be palace good news out to you hey kid dude like I'm standing behind a rock and that was like all that rock will save you hours hit me Dallas we let a quandary yeah one record take one of these hey Dallas you ever see how many size nines nothing could take but see the sword this is what you do when you're not working when you're not earning you ec you're not delivering boxes or you're not trading or you're not bounty hunting or you're not running illegal drugs somewhere this is what you do take a vacation they come to a wedding and you hang out with your Bros yeah it was go on sword I I had so much fun with you what do you think man I like it man I like it almost are playing it has been an absolute pleasure I've had a blast tonight thank you guys for a take me on tours like Cobra take me on the toilet you made my day dude you really did ah okay made my day made my day I had something coming for you too yeah I'm more to try to uh we'll try to jump in and start jumping in on my off nights when I got some come and try jump in for a few hours welcome to the Cobra force oh thank you I thank you agents of chaos [Laughter]
