all righty folks welcome back to another episode of eggs Oriya has always brought thanks to MC pro hosting for sponsoring and now where did we leave out it's been a little while since we've been on the server she's got a significant amount of mod plaque then you should see your dentist I built I tried to build a trunk loader for this to see if they'll keep things running and then it does not appear to have done much my god oh my god oh wow we did we we did everything wow that was the exact exact amount we needed I know right also I took I couldn't help but take note that remember that the last time we played and you were like you did something and then you were like oh oh that's fine don't worry about it and I was like what are you doing you like don't worry about it you know and then I came up here and half my pistons were missing as well as the timer and this was all torn wait wasn't he would chunk mine out this like half of this oh that's what I didn't actually I was like what the heck happened here but I got lucky I got lucky because I had noticed when I was looking in the inventory for something that the our glass was in there and I was like that's weird I don't remember us having a spare one of those so when I came up here and saw that it was missing I pretty quickly was like Oh see what she said oops don't worry about it I I didn't I was underground so I just put it down and I was like ah I probably didn't hit anything important yeah yeah nothing important I built a couple more of the windmills to help power stuff again and increase our power production which is all being consumed by this we're not gathering any because this thing is just like yeah so we need to empty this out oh yeah there is a significant amount of stuff what is the stuff that we needed there was some family rights mica no but literate and literate or rhodium that that stuff coming in rhodium no but that's from the the ore miner not the resource all right so the mica then wasn't it was it mica yeah which we have a couple stacks of uh we have none in that one wait how do you spell it mi ka my que mi CA that's just a white blog Chuck's got it wait why why don't you show this in the chat what yeah is this one one of my GI is dumb oh yeah I think this is the one that the filtering isn't working well oh there's one okay cool oh it's like a transparent kind of block that's interesting I think that's the one that we needed that we were that we were looking for I'm not positive but I I want to say that's the one that we needed from the resource mine ah okay oh that's a mica there's we've got we've got something outta my K that's that's my god oh my god that's a mica yes I would have sex two and a half stacks of the old mica dude there's another stack over here that one there's zis not gonna do we're not doing anything I mean it's supposed to sort stuff but this is all like already compressed and stacked yeah it's it ain't it ain't doing it ain't doing much oh my God look at the ash blocks that we got out of this though that's nice okay about it okay cool yeah oh there's more mica we got three and a half stacks of mica okay so that's neither plastic is that right I don't know why we needed it I just want to say that I remembered that that was the one we needed where's my pouch oh we made your pouch so we can send this back yeah that's dope didn't did I give it to you no no definitely so that's sick though so now we should probably swap this back to the yeah I would do anything but we also don't have a great deal of room bit left of those chests so let's see hey I took I took the ash blocks out I don't know what more you want from me where did I put the void resource minor thing it's literally in the chest not to it okay wasn't me I left it in there that's a good point I did do that yeah I would go and do a thing like that would annoy right there right avoid all minor control very good very much what I'm looking for what is this accent we're doing with right now I don't know oh okay yeah it's I got the I got the the streamer youtuber nose tickle going on oh dude that's a classic it's it's just every time you know don't worry about it boy we are gonna possibly need to make more of the old storage modules because of how many stacks we've just acquired of this stuff I mean there's worse problems to have right I guess so but yeah we need to make more modular storage thing in module year dude dongle er ruse modular storage do me think imma doohickey on one all right so what's micah go into let's figure that out accuracy mom Wow it goes into nanobots and also apparently you stole my bucket of water I I would never do that I have a bucket of water my inventory and usually I that's it I was I was missing it and everybody blamed it like people were we're excited to point fingers at you they were like chuck it and I I was like he would never do that he's my partner and would never so much as steal yeah no I wouldn't I wouldn't know it yeah you do that yeah so so yeah that's but you probably anyway I got my pouch sending in the ash over there so that it can be sifted was it the advanced crafting table that oh you know what definitely wasn't that it is crafting table god if I if we left it on the resource miner I we just had tungsten for days and it would have been crazy you mean they were minor yeah yeah oh okay so 50 for a rhodium yeah if we had lifted on the ore miner I would have been able to do that and that would have been wild but all right I'll work on additional machines and get the iron casing and the atomic I'll reconstruct or reconstruct or I asserted I'm all about that reconstruct or I am casing this but all that away oh it's a miniaturizer with iron a sheet metal and aluminum oh she the metal I see what you did there mm-hmm that was that was close but not quite I would dude I was I was saying bad words earlier on the trial stream yeah I saying bad words all over the place it was a wild time right I mean I don't know that I I know I've told the story on stream but I don't think I've ever told you like the distinct remember the first time I got into voice chat with you okay and you know up to that point I I was a fan of yours and I had only been watching up until that point as soon as he joined voice chat though he's like I'm not a fan anymore I'm just saying as far as I knew you to that point okay how about that was my only experience was being a fan up to that huh and and so when I got on and like two words in and you you dropped it pretty some pretty powerful language I dropped two words in oh you you went full 44 for good and it was just like that instant like my brain rage like okay I need to reset expectations because what I think I know is not anything like what I'm about to get and you know a beautiful friendship developed very slowly aha very slowly it took you a while to warm up to me it's fine uh-huh I needed to just know for sure you weren't a serial demonetized yeah fair enough I mean at that point yeah most of your experience with me have been pretty truly yeah you see you gave off them serial demagnetizer vibes okay fair enough why is there just a tiny pile cold us just standing in the middle and you just drop that is that you no I did not that's like in the middle of where nothing would drop there was tiny pie it's not that it's a big deal is just curious so anyway yeah you went for it that's fine and no issues it's gonna be the name of the new idubbbz documentary the follow-up it's gonna be full fork instead of full force see I see okay you were making miniaturization have a bucket I don't know half bucket what I had the same problem but I am I have a bucket I have a bucket I just thought of anyway Frick good oh that's anyway Frick okay so wait you're doing additional machines that you said or even yah eat absolutely you best believe it that's what I'm doing dude tree fluid extractor and latex processing unit all right I'll get to work on those tree flew tree fluid extractor just it seems like a very extensive cap this is a simple machine I can make this Oh the courtesies require hardened stone or misty cobblestone yes yes anyway I basically as we were saying I just need to swear more though well this is certainly not for children content no it's not let's make some rods is to adult things like we always do which we do which we do pretty much always you know no strangers to dropping some innuendos usually it's me and then you going I can't believe you went there but you know do the thing it like honestly even a cartoon like spongebob adults can appreciate that stuff real night like spongebob I would even consider like a not made for kids thing even though kids obviously watch it but in order to fully appreciate spongebob you definitely have to be over the age of 13 is apparently the world's hardest stone and I regret placing it yeah I mean you know a lot of a lot of things I mean you just think of Shrek like Shrek has a I think it's just common to kind of have that like multi-layer of comedy for stuff to where people are like oh I see what's going on there you know it's always the berry if you ever if you ever get foggy stone which we did mine don't place it because oh yeah that breaks into rocks but you there was stacks on stacks of that yeah but the problem is is I wanted cobblestone and so I just placed some because this is the actual stone and it turns out that breaking it not terribly efficient with our picks you have the hazed upgraded of it maybe it works better for you I do not know or the niobium pickaxe potentially better yeah because this is because this is not this is an interesting experience right now yeah yeah do you have that on yours it's somewhere I can grab it I have the niobium pickaxe yes indeed well you let's not let its silver that I needed so that's definitely the right thing that I did their there you go thank you give this the old try I wonder actually the bane of Kabul works on it now that I think of things nope not at all okay niobium yeah that's better I love when I accidentally pulverize the wrong thing it's easy to do how do I make the cobblestone that's doing that oh it's right there you okay my dude you okay yeah it just it wasn't it I I was misled there we go that's similar I like it all right well hey give me one second like it one second we'll catch up on this stuff you know what the front page time you know how we do yeah yeah hey um let's see let's catch up we had silencer dude with the 13 months Hot Wheels kid with for 14 months learning manual it's going it's not too bad I haven't been able to do any real heel-toe rev-matching I need to get pedal spacers or pedal extenders I should say the gap in the Fiesta between the brake and the gas is just a little bit too wide for my foot so I need to just have a little extender and then I'll be I should be okay to actually start getting that more but otherwise you know only stalled a couple times I need to take a dedicated time to go and like practice Hill starts in a particular location where it's just like late at night and not crowded at all on a kind of an empty street and then I feel like after I do that you know master the whole hand brake clutch bite gas balance I'll probably be all good to go and then it's just gonna be practicing heel toe basically 12 Garchomp thank you for the six months and jumping in all is uh-oh let's go do it all good since I guess you last checked Danielle wait do I need to I think smelt this to get the ingots and then I don't can't put these directly into here it's a lot of copper in there air is a lot of copper think we could probably use doing that unless you needed to do anything with it hopefully not um Madge Kool Aid thank you for the eight months diamond spider thank you for the 17 months Casa Cara thank you for doing a sub gift and moobot pixel stretch thank you for the sub gift first pardon thanks for doing another sub gift it's like five or six so far the stream popping off cheap kill no sheep do monetization sheep on the line thank you for the 400 bits to London or Tallinn Aiden they give this up Amy gee thanks 15 months and Liam ghoul thank you for the sub umm yeah hey if you happen to be tune did for the front page feel free to follow if you want it's chill extreme pretty regularly here so that's a common thing for us to do oh wait is this in well it melt temperature 298 K melt Oh we'd probably be good if we had fuel in there that might help coal how about some of that a head beat oops no no no no the zine do not and do not do this I just need a little bit of coal out of that do some of that dude be sick and floriano see thank you for the sub much appreciated yeah so anyway um I don't know what we're gonna when we make the atomic Reconstructor I guess it'll allow us to do the empowering things which are stuff that might come in handy some he'll wanna fight some bosses bro I'll fight some bosses what's up kima fancy seeing you here dude get that minecraft Monday going again bro sometime soon hopefully uh how do we convert this oh yeah well that'd work I think it'll work alright hmm I supposed to use the factorize er for the Lumia block working on big things all right cool well I'm looking forward to the I don't know if I'm able to say it so I'm looking forward to the thing that you messaged about that you said we'd be doing later this year with the thing that will be helpful to the person so yeah flareon OC thanks for doing a sub gift to kiemce and here let me just check in with zine real quick I hope I didn't turn the copper into something he wasn't trying to get and then I figured out how the cauldron worked hey you you weren't you don't mind that I turn the copper into ingots right yeah it's fine okay wait were you actually trying to turn that into sauce no no no you're fine okay cool I was I was just clearing out the extra stuff but yeah you can make it into ingots can we get the 2500 in the melter right now do you know 2500 what heat yeah Kelvin uh if the cop if the coal hasn't taken it there then no oh I just I didn't know if it'll tell us if we can't it's it's climbing slowly I just didn't know if it'll reach it or not what are you trying to melt Lou Miam so that I can get a block out of it you might be able to use the press to make to push your Lumia into a block instead of having to melt it and do all that oh that's a good idea you have the packing block okay sounds good sounds great that's a cool idea you know hey room is missing block thank you put this here yeah I did I did that was this was this is very convenient very happy to have that there and why don't I go ahead and you know just move a couple blocks here and see if I can't just fix that up for you no problem don't worry about it there's that there's that and then hey give it a try nice sick dude okay cool that's not gonna bother I need a redstone furnace instead I'm smart so shall we didn't even need to do that it's probably good there uh-huh cool I don't know wait what how the Frick do I do the Lumia meeee I see when you a freaking ingot dude I've done this before and I've just forgotten oh the induction smelter that's oh god you've got an induction smell through it forgot about that oh yeah induction filter with sand that's what it is okay chill chill we're good we're good I gotta figure it out give me one more SEC anyway so the thing I was alluding to with Keene is he is doing like some scholarships for gaming folks so basically later on in this year I'm not entirely sure what it is that he's doing one a week so later on this year I don't know how the selection is gonna be made but we are on my behalf we'll be giving out a scholarship I don't know the exact amount quite yet but giving out a scholarship to someone who watches the vids and yeah hopefully it'll be of help with some school stuff so that's the idea dude that's the idea just wanted to make sure it was okay to share that before before mentioning so that should be pretty cool dude looking forward and then I guess hopefully we can use the packing thing to put these together so it's the packing thing right the 3x3 little um price not sure it'll work if you need an induction smelter to convert it but yeah it would be the you know just ingots to block is what I'm looking at here you can try the factorize er okay so you have ingots and you're trying to make a block right okay then yeah it doesn't look like there's a metal press thing for that there's the crucible I was the compacted enough to factorize er nope it'll do it'll do factorizes so yeah you can come down here and there's machine art okay cool sweets so it should be the factorize er and you want combine so put it into that should just do what you got okay being a bone that'll work all right bada bing thank you and a-one wait you just Krall the union's craft three by three that's no that doesn't work rammer you're wrong that's an unheard-of thing for me to say brand-new sentence okay cool so I tweet out the application pic winner and they get a two thousand twenty dollars for school that's pretty sweet alright so that's how it'll work thanks for clarifying that keen and circular thank you for the two hundred bits idler manual and job working for spectrum ed Ford Rangers and I had to learn with a single day uh yeah yeah that would be stressful hopefully there weren't a lot around you cuz that I feel like takes a little bit more finesse in practice but it's not like terribly difficult to get the hang of it's just the performance driving stuff that takes the fine-tuning in practice overtime anyway alrighty so welcome welcome back yeah you know just trying to balance that start that front page yeah I mean I was explaining to the people on the youtubes that you know the youtubes say for us the Utah State boards we hit the wiring here yeah I'm still jumping my face into completely your fault I don't care about that how is how is the the one thing my fault that is what you put down as far as a not insulated wiring that's it's like the one on insulated wire that you put down and it's my fault apparently because you literally have to jump into it it's faster to jump and run replace it if you bothers you fix it instead of just complaining to me about it except this I don't I don't think they did it's a lighting item unacceptable right there bro I think the people are on my side on this oh I thought they were but I guess not alright so I made a bunch of extra copper wire so I could avoid this situation and it's all right here and I think that these coils what were you doing that was business oh you were miniaturization try some currently going on I mean I figured it out pretty quick yeah you did hey dude are you gonna play the new pokemons you gonna finally play pokey man's dude it wasn't the first thing on my list of things to do what unbelievable I know right aren't I the worst the man's will never play pokemon I don't miss a Pokemon I just don't have a connection to it either that's cuz old when it came out I get it sometimes you're the worst oh okay okay Tom okay instructor he just laughed like Bill burr all right oh that's easy no wait it's come back come back come back I what do you want me to come back do not you no one no one wants you to come back okay huh okay all right I did an atomic reconstruct oh I feel empowered solar-powered ooh there's a lot of stuff do we need solar power yeah that's what I was wanting to get to but then I was like oh I got to do this thing for that thing is what you were doing so I kinda had like a little right this might be worth waiting in tuition if you had had the right thing on there imagine if I had well look at this man making upgrades imagine if I hadn't gotten all this mica that I still don't actually know we're supposed to use it for yeah we definitely need to clear all this stuff out though that's that's definitely a thing as definitely thing uh I mean I I got rid of some stuff cool no I I appreciate you doing great there's a few that are definitely oh gosh I forgot about the the boots you wanna you want to toss more into the thing your pouch you know pouch Arriba I'm working right now sir I'm slimy on top of this pole yeah dude I love climbing on top of holes bro as one does mm-hmm technically we should probably be looking at upgrading this to higher quality wires but you know hey speaking of quality would you be interested in any quality content clothing tell me about it why don't you well I'm just asking if you'd be I was actually asked today like hey I have a list of addresses of people who'd be interested in stuff I don't know anything about it you well it's um a thing so you know we got the joggers with the crucial zipper pocket so when you're driving stuff doesn't fall out of your pockets or if you're riding a roller coasters doesn't fall out of your pockets and it's sick and then also we got the tank tops for when you're getting shredded at the gym I just want to show off the guns and we got just comfy sure it's comfy sweaters hoodies and some short shorts for that gym or running time dude it's gonna be dope anyway are you interested sounds pretty we can we can talk we can talk later when you say quality it just made me think you know yeah yeah I was just mostly I was stuck on like you were like if you want to show off those guns and I was just thinking about how one of your arms is like bigger than both of mine put together kind of thing you know I got you that that was that was where I kind of got stuck and hung up on other than that though everything seemed it seemed pretty good gosh I like like I mean I think I've told you but it's just if if I ever get to where you know this is this is the sole thing and I I don't have then you're gonna shred it I cannot wait like I like I've never before in my life until fairly recently been like anxious to go to the gym like I want to so bad I want to go and like reclaim Who I am uh-huh I just feel like this little pile of bit yeah I'm sorry to hear it man I mean you know it is what it is but I found out like fairly I've had this jacket for a leather jacket for several years and it wasn't until like I put it on like a couple weeks ago that I realized that the the zipper on the pocket that I never used unzip to a second pocket there's an unzip 'red pocket and then a zippered pocket and I'd always just had the zippers up and it turns out there's like a pocket inside the pocket and I was like I didn't know this pocket was here huh so you know things about my jacket it's my story about apparel saurian wrist ownio crystals and stuff oh God and Nuria Andres Tolia are both from the atomic reconstruction laser with that's why yes yes yes why man I can't tell the difference did you do the voice acting for that I didn't but I kind of like in my off time like had always dreamed I don't think that I can use planks for this I think I need an actual oak and then we go on the other side no no I don't do that okay thank you donde that tends to read so never should toggle wait no that's no I want how do I make it do a use of but is what I wanted okay god frickin Frick god frickin Frick he says in an exclamation of some strange quality does the thing need power I can't remember absolutely what does what need power the thing going to the right spot see that I would like to search for the button yes is it which what direction oh this doesn't take power well good good thing I wired this up because it doesn't take power I would like instructions to the nearest but but please but but but alright so that's latex that's gathering so that's it laser output so you tricking wait what if I had applied energistics I would know how to automate this so it would automatically put a stump there but I don't so I don't owe the man's has completed many alvey's yeah I know I bet I I was talking about it yeah but use the insulated ones you yeah yeah yeah yeah here here I even have some of you no no I got it I got okay yeah don't don't use don't use the regular ones oh yeah I made extras so that we could have extra so that way we didn't run out of them so the cuz there were extra for Rick why don't work I do wish hold a redstone torch sitar whoa okay we got the we got the business yeah not sure why that makes you chuckle every time but hey I'll keep milking it for what it's worth thank you yeah all right I don't really want to replace like I can do this one assuming I can find where it drop and drop over here it did drop over here Wow good there we go we're good it's setup yay wait I don't have no idea what's going on right down with that what so confused everything it's very confusing okay confused guy you know so I'm gonna drop that and then that should make stuff not floating up in the air anymore that's good and then I don't know like if that actually went into the portal wooden is now gone forever I wouldn't know either but everything's power is down for a moment don't worry about it all because you can't stop jumping what what are you talking about I'm fixing I'm insulating the wires so that you can hippity hop however you need oh thank you thank you thank you your sacrifice is appreciated no idea where that went though your sacrifice will not be in vain oh he jokey artichokey so how many these suckers are we gonna me we need four five five is thirty of those boys area let me go right now back all right fine all right fine well hopefully this the olden power is necessary for things otherwise I'll be spending a lot of time doing things that aren't necessary that doesn't sound productive now it ain't front of the life thingy what the heck is the life thingy here Oh what are you all doing there and why was it showing up here I'm so confused dude it's all right you've figured it out I mean we didn't figure it out but we got past we got past the regardless do we have any late work blades of any sort what do you mean by work plates I know he made one at some point didn't we absolutely if you would tell me what you mean a worker would a work blade or can I chisel you I wonder what else I just accidentally swung shot myself through a portal is it called slung shot or slingshotted I don't know I chose longshot okay I don't I don't think it's a common it's it's not usually a verb alright I'm back don't mind me I just just visiting the misty world turns out it's still there anyway good good talk what gurgling did you start the gurgling I didn't start the gurgle it was also gurgle since the world was turned okay okay Billy all right yeah I got you I got you I see your reference and I acknowledge so that went over there this one went over here and this one connected it all together really tied the room together a good rug all right that's how insulated you can run around and yes I love jumping there's only one spot that you'll use app yourself and you'd have to get in a very specific position and you would probably die if you were to get in that Pew we can come up here and turn this back on and slip it up thanks for that you're welcome but you know what's missing in my life your Slurpee noises I know I know you've been missing it for a while so I just want to thank you for that I hope this is appealing to all those who are watching on the front page just you know two hours of ASMR Wow I know that's what they're here for can you imagine because a lot of people probably just they have Kate on their home page right they've got a tab doing it oh yeah or something and so all their hearing is audio and if that I if that's if they have it unmuted but there's a chance they have it unmuted and then I just I just come right in and I'm just like alright moving on to the latex processing unit okay I just what's next for that I just come right in like that's how we do but anyway yeah is that what we're doing now yeah dude all right cool it's Jill all right cool Wow he can do some full-on like improv effects just on that dial dude we I mean there's literally a dial there literally is I know you're manning the way do you have a physical dial or oh yeah I've got I've got a rollin vt4 so I've oh that I can Wow so do you look like a music studio what's that you look like you're in a music studio I mean I have a two different full-size mixers all the cables that it could run a make music studio and a rack mount preamp and compressor hardware and I mean no it doesn't look like it looks like my basement okay but I do have a lot of stuff I've always tried to keep the audio stuff in hardware like in my mind it's like that's better I don't know if it actually is but in mine you're you're one of those freakin audio files who's like I don't like software instruments I must use the physical well I mean these aren't instruments though they're the ignore you know but there are audio like superior wrists when it comes to dude they got they got the superior like ah dude I need it needs to be analog no I mean I don't talk about like you know oh god the sound of records just as warmer man like you get it like but but like on the vocal or at least on the audio chain like I want to not have noise introduced and I want a hat not have all that and it seems like the hardware that we've been doing is very capable so that's what the route I went but one of the things that when talking about streaming and recording stuff that I warn people is I never expected it to learn as much audio engineering as I have and I think you bother with any of that do you like you know the the the irony of the situation is that you experience far more technical difficulties and I do with stuff I play around with my setup a lot more so Z but I don't think that I mean my stuff's pretty stable as exit when was the last time you were like oh my god at the changing levels again oh it's bad couple weeks yeah yeah where's last time you do change my levels I mean I adjust you pretty much every stream and to taste what yeah no I I mean because I changed the volumes of the input computers and stuff like that so every time we start up I just oh his you've changed you've changed the volumes of other things in your chain yeah yeah got it got it got it got it so you know yeah I don't have a dedicated this is sparkles channel like you're my second computer channel and I do when I play music then I'll do that when I do a music roll off like that's all you met buddy you're all on the same line yeah anyway no one knows what we're talking about but I don't know we're talking about either I'm talking about displaced and Braille Oh more iron casings you just made me type displaced and incentive machines like I needed help so this is a block of single Ammar you kidding me right now yeah that sounds fun I've already made a few signal um so you just need to do two more bachelors probably because I think if for signal and dust probably so how do you how do you make that it looks like it's just an alloy makes her do we have an alloy mixer or how are you doing it oh wow that was exceptionally helpful of you thank you way to put in that work but he did lend a hand no no no I've done that how do you do it huh I was really paying attention it was really paying attention to it other things so the way that you make signal a liam is you have to use the pulverizer the melting crucible the Frick what's it called the thing that fills the buckets and then oh yes yeah and then you have to use the induction smelter no no the magma crucible oh and the fluid Transposer okay yes okay but the magma crucible in the fluid transpose are attached to each other so it's chill yeah yeah yeah so thermal expansion i forget that we're starting to get the good machines so that things make sense again i need to use a lot of iron on this Wow is that way a lot of iron yeah that's now she dude that's a real ouchie well fortunately wait okay so we can use the factorize er now though to unpack blocks of iron factorize er yes I think so that is a cool beam ya know I had I'd seen that machine on multiple times and like never really okay so I make the blend in the nice crucible it okay that is a very cool beam in many things and I've never really used it and now that I see it I'm like oh this is actually really cool that's the coolest beam right so i pulverize out the dust and i add in the redstone that's not hard if the question is just how much that I need because I don't know how to have any idea how much I need not the most comprehensive statement I've ever made - looks like three three buckets know how much redstone goes in the bucket it's time alright well give me a memento to try to be sociable yeah yeah yeah yeah get out of here yeah yeah yeah yeah oh hey let's catch up on some of the stuff one legged mad lad thanks for the subhead enjoyed thanks for the three months and soon three beat wait three be Maps currently figure out a new custom mechanic I have my three title and an ounce how far can you go dude we need some be parkour soon bro dark wolf thanks for the sub Jordan King thank you for the one year of subah Jareau scott ha thank you for the six months of so much much appreciated and stuff you guys think that I should do something ASMR I could be the next big thing all I would have to do you know utilize Audio Interface Braille and just take advantage of the reverb and all the other stuff and then I'll have the best ASMR channel of all time oh I need another black quartz Andrus tonyia that's fair that's fine one no more of you and the one more of and then this may I help you okay

server that we act of redstone server but look we have to we've used two of them okay did you just put these 27 in here I swear to god though that was actually in there the whole time and you're just

Horrible's sing-along blog is a fantastic internet thing it's hard to explain exactly what it is the Frick is going on why does it say doesn't call Oh stone when it does you fool is it trying to select the wrong cobblestone don't think so the Frick okay we do need to get more cobblestone though all right well uh I have the bane of Cobo I'd be happy to give it to you and then you can go over to that water that lava flow state you just take the globe you just go get those crystals and then you do something with them I get them for what was just the crystals oh it's the crystal not the sand right right right right the sand is what the crystals have to be put on yeah where are the crystals grow out of the sand yeah but all the same it's all the same [Music] in blue okay well it's okay okay okay all right settle down and you ask yourself how did I get here where's my beautiful wife she did you say like I've been wondering where did my wife go she was supposed to be here by 7:30 but ya know it's I glanced over at my viewer account just to see how like sometimes everyone is a light ship I like I like to see it plunge you know like what does it actually actually work that way does it plunge often I I mean we went from 6400 263 66 geez you got that front you got that front front page primo dog out front front page though the front page the partial front page no no we're on the front deist if you're on the front front though I mean yeah I guess yeah I mean yeah I suppose that's true all right did it did it plunge though are you back down below me I said I said we dropped 30 people you know 30 whoo-hoo it's a rough life rel rough life it's a hard rough Oh you order doing the destabilizer headstone all I need to do this I am is glowstone this is going to be problem this is conflicting to me I move I'm working here yeah that's conflict I have six more to go and then it's all yours okey-dokey it would go faster if you didn't open the door because it stops working when you open that door but that's fine don't worry about oh yeah you're not wrong tech whiz but I front t is different it's fine but I don't know it I jumped another 300 people up I don't know if like oh they like your karaoke keep singing I'm gonna claim responsibility for that one yeah yeah everyone I hear that same as it ever was is here that's my name that's why talking heads right I think yeah all right so the latex is still a taxing the red stones red stoning and all I can do is just run around the room for a second dude dude now that's gonna be stuck in my head for you know I mean he is a catchy song you can't quite it really is there's something really specific about it I can't remember what it was like a musical analysis that like elaborated on why it was catchy no not quite that but like they made it in a certain way like they like the some portion of it never changes anyway it's it's like some portion of it is the same as it ever was would you say yeah but no like there's a there's something specific about that song that's like an interesting trivia bit of how they made it that's fairly unique I don't remember what it is but it's something about the style of like something of how the music like when you listen to you go why there's just a semi brokenwood piece here yeah it's breaking what it's in process what it's in process tree fluid extract it's getting his latex I thought it was about only chews up the tree that's why I was super confused someone in chat was like the latex is late texting and it's like excuse me what well I said that I said that you've learned to ignore me pretty conditioned so you didn't even pick it up on it sad cuz it's true anyway if we had to assign a noise to this machine I believe what this noise would be is something along the lines I don't like where this is going but that was just you laughing okay yeah all right so how do I get from the blend to you is do we have oh we do have an induction smell that it's right next to the wrists of those k and then I need to add it with a glass I think ready said I should do a Slurpee mode Oh anything yeah it should you yeah I mean is this is this really like is this what we become yes you in a Slurpee mode I used to dude my mom would go to the local community college and she would go on like the stadium stairs walking up and down as exercise rather than doing a Stairmaster you know it's nice an area outside and stuff and always while we were on the way she gave me a Slurpee and then I'd drink a Slurpee while she exercised it really really sound like I was a large kid when you put it like this mmm you just kind of went on a little adventure they're like yeah that's way in you just kind of like oh man I was like I had a million slurs when I was a kid man the stuffs that I could eat kids have no idea they have no idea how easy it is now everybody is for them like like in terms of like nutritional you'd be able to just Hoover anything in and you still process it into like you know you're saying kids have no idea what it's like we have body stops working yeah yeah man when you when you could be like old decrepit like me like it's it's crazy it is very rough it I'm saying so I've her easy yeah yeah no you're you're here with me sorry I hate to break it to you dude you are old oh wait are you missing you are you making more Lumia meeee no I'm

oh the latex processing unit right so I can process my latex when were Slurpees invented actually isn't Slurpee isn't that the one that goes back to or is it I see no Slurpee that was the one that a 7-eleven worker like his his machine his refrigeration machine started running incorrectly and got that god it's too cold and it came out as slush instead of as drink and really people people like loved it and so he started doing it oh wait it was this just like a random 7-eleven worker who's like the founder no no I don't think founder I think was like a franchise owner or something like that I don't I mean I'm not claiming to know the exact specifics but it's as I recall it something like that so silver sheet metal and I could be making all that up but I don't think I am I mean happy little accidents have created many many many of the world's greatest inventions is that isn't that similar to how potato chips were invented is it the potato chips accidental I accidentally potato chips I don't I don't know I don't know oh don't you tell me that I need to make more you might need to make one more batch of aluminum no I'm making a sheet metal you mean I need to make more this is not the good this is not the good at all all right and then I need a Ruby all right this should finish up what we're doing come over here wait wait Jordan so when you don't have everything for your
