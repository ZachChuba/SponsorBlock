boom and relax hey welcome to the wedge show this week we have John it's been a while it has been a while I do you not remember the last time no I don't I wonder I vaguely remember a Santa hat maybe so Hinton has probably been the Y okay but that might have been the like I've done this every year where I bring each person onto the show at the end yeah when I got stuck at the US border people are saying John but they're spelling it wrong oh no someone else felt it right that happens literally every time like it happens to me on Twitter and my name is right there it's on in Twitter if they send you a message it has the at and then the correct spelling of your name and if you're on the forum you might know in my signature I say I spell my name without an H people still get it wrong so I'm just I'm used to it by now I don't even notice anymore yeah well that's a live I do but you know my problem is that I know like three different spellings of John well no wonder the more Johnny I guess oh yeah his is like actually kind of weird for a Johnny what is cuz it's five letters yeah yeah so I don't know yeah we're talking about the guy that does some of our staff report here who was also my landlord funnily enough and and people have seen him on camera yeah so yeah Johnny's Johnny's basically the nicest person on the entire planet but he can't make it too so every single year I will get into the show and aside don't worry but every single year since I was like 15 I've been going to PAX West and I bring all my friends every time and Johnny can't make it this time really very weird it's actually like very very weird that he's not gonna be that really estranged the rest of people that have been good that are gonna be going or all like it's so weird that Johnny's what are we gonna do I don't know I feel like he would be the straw that serves a drink so to speak yeah yeah so it'll be interesting but should be good this week we have interesting news because like Computex is happening and e3 is right around the corner and all this kind of stuff there's interesting stuff going on we don't have a lot of gaming news quite yet because I think that'll probably be next week but we've got Intel news a unnamed 28 core 56 thread CPU we've got news about second gen thread Ripper being on try for a q3 2018 launch that means this year also massive changes to the seam store we were talking about this recently on a LAN show it's gonna be crazy I actually think it's super cool but we'll talk about that later there's an obscene amount of notes on that AMD unveiling a 7 nanometre GPU that's insane gigabyte making fake ram and it's actually really cool so it's kind of like bonded leather and then actually my favorite news of this week even though it doesn't necessarily sound super cool see sonic introducing SCM d and your cable clutter it's amazing I can't show you what it is right now I'm getting one for suresies but we'll have to talk about the survey's I'm constantly kicking the cables underneath my desk in my office it won't help you with that it's like cables inside your cap off but it's super cool we'll go there later boom it worked this week is going well yes it was going well it's wide eyed again really also Anthony Bourdain died yes I know very sad he was what 61 I think I don't know I like him fresh ba ba socks LTX be there or or don't but preferably be there if you can because it's cool and I'd like to say hi also Squarespace yeah gonna put this back up here and we're back boom ok that's all it takes when show intro completed let's move up to the top because we've got this crazy Intel processor that has some interesting news coming with it thank you by the way to vegetable stew and radiating light for swab vegetable stew I see we did there oh the very clever oh yeah and I post this link in the wind doc you look like you had something to say do you I was just commenting on vegetable stew although I did cover this today well James covered it but I wrote the thing today for tech lean on this story oh ok yeah so do you have any interesting quips from that because you definitely know more about it than I do I have some interesting things to bring up but ok you thank you ok well without I guess without running through the bullet pool first so I'll give a quick peel deal yeah so Computex intel shows off this 28 core 56 threat cpu and it is demo of it and it was like oh man the CPU is running at 5 gigahertz is so cool so after it happened a few people know you said there was a gigantic weird like industrial water chiller sticking out the back of the unit I think they had it set up such that you couldn't see it straight on whether they were actually doing the demos so but that wasn't even like the worst of it they also said this chip is running at 5 gigahertz not telling people that had actually in fact been overclocked so a lot of people were thinking that oh this thing is just going to run this freaking 28 cord Xeon so it's gonna run a 5 gigahertz out of the box which was not the case at all Intel got called out on it they had to acknowledge it and then they ended up saying oh well they blamed it on quote-unquote the excitement of the moment or something like that and they said that they're a guy running the demo just forgot he forgot to say oh by the way this is not running at stock speed so people were very understandably upset about that's so lame but honestly I can kind of understand if it's just the demo guy that forgot to say it now if there was like press documents given out to any degree it should have it in there and the guy shouldn't forget admittedly I'm not sure if there were documents handed out but I have not I think it was just whoever was running the demo said 5 gigahertz if I'm come on man don't forget that so the processor is clocked at 2.7 gigahertz normally and without revealing turbo speeds they haven't done they were able to overclock it to 5 gigahertz which is pretty crazy the demo setup was cooled by an $850 aquarium chiller which yeah seems which the chiller alone consumes 1200 watts and is meant to be able to cool a thousand liters of law so we have just found an actual use if you buy a 1600 watt power supply we finally found a real-world you say you run a 400 watt computer 1200 watt chili I'll be sick I'd love to see that so yeah it's it's pretty cool we'll have to see how freakin hot this thing actually gets normally and how high you can overclock it with reasonable cooling solutions and I'm sure Linus will be all over that able to if I'm reasonable like was a 480 millimeter ie it a reasonable or that's fairly aggressive yeah but it's not the same it's been way more reasonable than this is a query yeah yeah like even like a triple personally I would like to see a double read a double 120 or a double 140 yeah that that's very if you whatever you can overclock it on that that's solid because I think that's probably where most people kind of are and when they're yeah like I really wanted to be an over call a nice thick thi CC but still regular-sized radiator yeah yeah next up in crazy processor news we've got a post from Alex solo thank you very much saying that the second-generation thread Ripper is on track for a q3 2018 launch its AMD Zeppelin silicon let me get this on screen and in the twitch discipline so we've moved away from like earthmoving material and now we're doing blimps and awesome music mm-hmm okay boop-boop-boop-boop there we go cool twelve nanometer thirty-two sixty-four second gen features I know a lot of people are saying like oh it's it's not it's not the most exciting processor ever purr purr purr purr purr I don't care is there well yeah I mainly just stoked that they're continuing to step forward instead of abandoning for a huge section of years again well if they're anything is like a most exciting process or ever anymore even just with the word really there's some really exciting computer hardware later on in the show I am so stoked for this you have no idea I think most of people in chatting Blakey on but I think it's amazing so don't worry about but yeah III think this is super cool its I think it's great that they're pushing forward again with thread Ripper going with their big heavy hitter as well bringing out another one definitely you definitely got supercool they're not backing down it's 32 64 which is sick I'm really excited for this process that's insane um 250 watt TDP boom so boom many don't even care super cool mm-hmm not not in a literal sense but yeah it's nice and warm actually they've they've got it displayed next to some Nhu 14 s's which aren't even that huge so that's not too bad that's a beautiful looking board good job at Messiah I like that aesthetic that's cool that one too well hey soos I weren't at school boards these days I like that like when I first got into computers it was like oh wow you got a board with a black PCB yeah it's amazing having a non green like it what it felt like back in what like 2009-2010 it was like oh the PCB is blue by this and that was it yeah yeah yeah and now we have like like this one has like under lighting that's RGB like metal accents and like aggressive little thing or the IO like they look so cool now I don't know that's pretty sweet but yeah this is cool I'm very happy that they're they're launching another processor I know some people aren't that interested like I was saying earlier ambi zepplin silicon has eight cores and it's the first generation thread Ripper and the first generation thread of who uses two of them to get the top skew of 16 cores that's written a little odd leaf but hopefully that makes sense yeah moving on did it do yeah I think that's pretty much about it yeah rumors are saying August and there's no pricing yet yeah so coming up hopefully hopefully you got the dollar bills for it if you need 64 threads yeah I was gonna say if you need that if you need that it's probably for some type of work application so hopefully it's I would say almost certainly for work yeah like maybe there's someone out there just really likes benchmarking just freaking loves it or like is just really really into editing home videos in like wicked quality yeah exactly like it like someone else I need to have cinema level my kid playing boss just spent like five figures in like a red or something and like I need yes I need to look make the driveway ball hockey yeah look like it was put together by I need to film my kids schooling the neighbor kid in hockey with a red yeah and then edit it very efficient so when they send like the kids like hockey mix takes the junior leagues they're gonna be like the production values are amazing moving on to the next topic posted by matrix 0 7 0 12 James and I were someone is yelling what the heck so I don't know which got to hear that but James and I were talking about this last week twitch took a game down where you were a school shoot which or steam did sorry steamed it ok completely I don't know I just I said twitch because I was clicking on the twitch tab and it just like invaded my brain but yes this team took a game down because it was like about a school shooter mm-hmm I also twitch at apparently heard the yell so thank you Ava but yeah and my stance on that was essentially if twitch wants to do this if this is within twitches policies why do I keep saying twitch if Steam wants to do this and this is within steams policies maybe guys putting recently yeah you're twerking you're actually turning red I don't like saying the wrong thing man let's go yeah before I can't tell a whole but this time this guy looks like a lobster right now like to me so I have very pale skin so it shows release yeah it's it's that Scandinavia in me but yeah I think it's completely within their right to take it down some people were screaming for free speech and I'm like this isn't a government platform it's it's a company if they don't want to have yeah they could they can do yeah but I also really like what they ended up doing which is saying that we don't care anymore yeah so what they're doing now is they're only removing items that are actually illegal or straight-up trolling so you don't quote from them so but unless it's one of those two things then the game is probably fine so yeah so like my my stance on this is interesting because people there's actually surprising amount of people that have asked me about this because of how I run the forum and how I run fo plane because they're actually so different on the forum things get axed yeah all the time this is a tech forum stop screwing around we're gonna get rid of it's a little bit different though because you're on the forum you have to like keep peace between users or a falls apart this is just a story if you don't if you don't want to act interact with anyone you don't have to and it's also like the the center of the topic here is supposed to be games yeah not a type of game and the center of the thing on the forum is tech news you go that's our tech stuff in general I was thinking the tech news section but the computer to stuff tech stuff gaming stuff whatnot if you're going outside of that it might make sense an off topic but if it's too far like we're not we don't want to mess with that kind of stuff there's a tech focused forum floatplane on the other hand is a website for creators if you are a user and you go on floatplane and you don't want to see a certain type of content don't give the person who makes that content you are money and you won't see it it's fairly straightforward hmm so I don't really care what people do on the platform and I don't I don't want to care I can I can have the stance personally where I'm like as a personal human being as Luke I don't like this content mm-hmm I don't necessarily hope that they do well I don't hope that they have a big audience so I'm just gonna vote with my wallet but I'm going on facilitate their platform and be impartial because okay I am acting on behalf of a platform and I will do nothing to hinder them in any way because that would be bad were you saying that the steam store was allowing the school shooting game or they took it down I think they took it down Hawaii I think that was because right now they're they're going with the allow everything approach but I believe they took it down and I believe they're keeping it down because I'm pretty sure the guy that made it was already banned from releasing games and he made it as a troll which they are reserving the right to kick off another interesting question is what even is a game because you can publish stuff on Steam is it a game if it's a visual novel and you just click Next constantly doesn't respects yet now they get a game if there's multiple options to click Next that still could be a visual novel it's just a choose-your-own-adventure visual novel does that make it a game is that not making a game it's a it's an interesting conversation what's up um so this is why this is why I've sort of been like silent for a second um because I think so okay really seems policy change follows two platforms banning of controversial school shooting simulation game a computer so yes you were you were correct so they they they took this down yeah yeah but I think so like I think what this is saying is that they would have left it up mm-hmm but yeah this guy was already banned off the platform yeah they are they think he's trolling he's a notorious troll he has a record of having terrible customer service and also it can suck like there's other reasons why they wanted to take this thing down so I think they're leaving it down because of those reasons gotcha it's it's gonna be an interesting time because I think this is gonna spawn not that there isn't already but I think it'll spawn an incredible amount more of garbage on Steam there is already a lot of garbage because there's no law against like a bad game yeah so yeah yeah yeah I know I know what you mean so so they have yeah they've it's it's interesting and another thing that they were talking about is how apparently there was a lot of controversy in the community as to whether or not they should allow everything or they should ban a whole bunch of different stuff or whatever there was a lot of controversy in the community right a lot of people were angry that they took this game down I'm not first of all I don't care second of all I think it's their right to do whatever they want is their platform and third of all they already didn't like the publisher bad customer service troll band already in the past so there's many reasons but some people were very upset that they took it down some people were very some people think they should have taken it down some people think they shouldn't took basically and what valve has said is internally apparently they've had essentially that same war they have like the same spectrum of people that are outside talking about this inside the company so they've essentially decided if if the community is all mixed and we're all mixed we'll kind of let the community sort it out well yeah I mean you talk about like a lot of trash potentially showing up on the platform but you know this is the same for like the App Store or this is the same for Google Play there was a lot of stuff there that all that Google or Apple have done have vetted to say this does not contain malware but other than that there's no guarantee as to the quality of what you're buying but the model still works especially on Steam or I feel like it's easier to filter out stuff that you don't want to see as far as like recommendations or whatever I do think they'll need to do a much better job of categorizing and filtering things I hope they do some suggestions already but they need to amp up that system I know that they plan on making it so there's parental controls in terms of what stuff you can see and what stuff you can't see obviously that's gonna have to come in so like theoretically you wouldn't be able to see active shooter or a game with wives or something yeah banging simulator 2019 unless you have your settings to be to be allowed to see those types of waifu banging simulator it's 2019 it's yeah it's next year yeah 10% more Paul already yeah it's amazing it's the best game if it even is a game I don't know moving on to my favorite thing in this show I don't know if everyone else is gonna agree with me but I think it's frickin fantastic I'm getting one for suresies this was posted by wmk groom a K on the forum it is a PC per article and it's from C sonic it is the C Sonic s CMD let's have a look at this thing it's the system cable management device that's what you think because well you know what I would say you think they would come up with like if they're gonna have a four letter name they could do something sexy you know like the NZXT puck or whatever it is and know that CMD doesn't sound skimmed I'm just gonna go down to the store and buy some Scribd so what's cool about this is it's this bar what is this sound good umm someone is shuffling through some equipment over there sorry about that twitch chat but it and YouTube later on but it's this bar that you can put into the back of your computer you can see there's some SSDs mounted here and stuff and you plug all your power supply cables into the bottom of the bar and then you branch off them later on higher up so it's yeah speaking of NZXT they have a few of their cases on a second oh the s3 40s go for this they have the cable management bar built-in but this one looks a little bit more like a one size fits most kind of solution yes and my understanding of it right now it's like because in this picture in this picture it shows that it's connected directly to the power supply but this bar you can see is off by itself they're like I don't know I don't have a ton of pictures of this thing but my understanding is that you should be able to get it separately that's what yeah it kind of I mean if they're going on if they're gonna inter if they're going to introduce this thing called the Scoon and it'll make a big deal out of it you would think that you could buy without buying the see sonic power supply so apparently that is an RGB logo so this see sonic logo is RGB that's am a little bit surprised by this because it's RGB see Sonic's whole like mo is a company they're very like straightforward not a whole lot of frills like if any of y'all if y'all follow see sonic on Twitter you probably know what I'm talking about but the stuff they make is pretty good so I really like even something even we were not compensated to say that just personal opinion but um but uh well if you look at my personal rig there's this e sonikuh right yeah no dude has a C so yeah that's right but yeah even if that was not a sponsorship you know just I was just gonna say even something as you know a simple provision of an RGB logo surprises me a bit but I think it looks pretty sharp yeah yeah yeah like even their prime power supplies there's no RGB on it but yeah apparently it does drop your efficiency by one percent overall that's really not a lot my main thing is in in what it looks like this case right here in my case at home kill management in the back of tempered glass cases especially when there's not a big gap he's a nightmare yeah and this was really good yeah and that's the trend now isn't it because you're seeing more more cases that even like reasonable price points where it's tempered glass all the way around and I think there was just an assumption that people thought this would be cool and that has been true to a degree but there's also plenty of you out there that just want to hide all the messy cable rallying behind a motherboard tray so it looks like it can power some fans or those who see this are those fans are those SATA I think you're right yeah those who look like fan cables yeah everything is seems like it's seemingly intelligent ly placed to like this looks like a SATA bridge coming right off of there a really short run direct just as you have some right there so it's right up at the top and it's your CPU power 24 pins right off on that side like it looks like it does as long as you're not running some like weird exotic set where you have like SATA headers like all the way up towards the top it looks like it's probably fine for most systems even then it might work I just I don't have very good pictures I don't know yeah and this okay to be fair this little blue cable I just realized almost certainly doesn't come with it these are probably after markets mm-hmm maybe they sell them is like a kit the like goes with we'll have to see ton about it right it could just be cable ma cables I don't know but but I actually think that's really cool that's that's the first I have this happen to every show I don't know why Google Docs decides to sign me out part way through every single time that's so annoying that's happened me before when I'll try to upload tech will keep videos thanks Google but but it's the first time in a long time that I've looked at a piece of computer hardware and been like I am going to buy that basically now and put it in my system right away the one percent efficiency drop is really funny to me not because well I do think it's good that they're being transparent about it but I can see someone out there with like an 80 plus power supply like the lowest year of 80 plus and they hook this thing up to it they're like oh well there goes my superior efficiency to to that to that you know rade max power supply might we'll be a neighbor blog whatever so uh will condone any sizes which makes sense there's probably like general ITX cases general mhm yeah yeah you know I and I know I said this before but I'm still baffled as to why M ATX is not a more popular thing if you're a gamer it's like the most logical form factor to get but that's a different discussion so I yeah I think it's I I like it and it's really not popular but I have no idea you're watching on twitch over there LTX Expo com it's it's super hard to get to then that brings us to the floodplain oh I don't know if I heard we had a very very very illuminating episode of tech cookie out on float plane today oh very illuminating what one is it should I tell them or originally already plugged up this one yeah oh that's pretty interest isn't it though see if this guy says it's interesting he's been doing this longer than I have so that's actually I yeah I don't know yeah and I want to know so we're gonna we're gonna show my screen so it doesn't seem insane but there's a tech kooky episode on the fastest possible internet how fast can you actually go yeah how fast can you download gotta go fast questionable videos yeah very much that's a question there's there's AMD's 32 core fu to Intel Wow for a second I thought you were gonna read out a model number the started with fu portable professional workstation with three displays that thing is actually insane and a pumpless liquid cooler from der bauer which that's another video both these videos at the top I'm super interested in checking out any time your Bower does anything it's amazing sounds very like German and intense you know well yeah it is engineering also there is bit with ultra on here and tech deals I'm not going to show you there guys as their stuff because I don't know if I'm like really necessarily even allowed to but if you're a fan of tech deals or if you're a fan of Kyle at bit wit check out their channels as well their stuff comes on here a week early everyone's using the same model right now full plane does not make people use this exact model but everyone has done the exact same thing which is fine but it's three bucks per channel so far every single person has gone with three dollars and you get their content a week early the comments section is awesome because there's way less cancer than on YouTube way less it's like always positive discussion which is super cool and we have in terms of features that are coming soon one of the really cool ones that people have been asking for a while is playback speed there's some guys that apparently watch it like two times or one-and-a-half times on YouTube I just gotta get stuff done I I'm guilty of watching things at 1.5 that's on you two sometimes that is that's actually a good feature fully operational relatively soon and just on the comment section thing on floatplane you can actually have a comment score the negative so if so just post if someone just posts the hottest of takes they'll get like a minus 50 so I thought I was on this video but I don't see it but someone said first and they're just like no no that was on mine oh that was that was on today's tech wiki I was so funny yeah there are - 29 yeah just slammed so yeah you can do that it's possible for those of you who watched already thanks very much shout out to Portugal you'll know what I'm talking about if you watched if not you'll see you next week no no - Portugal I mentioned Portugal very randomly in my videos so I'm definitely yes so so thank you to all of our fans in Porto in Lisbon in the Azores wherever you may be in Portugal good luck in the World Cup so heck yeah alright okay moving on - back to news topics Thank You atlas Rafe for posting this on the forum AMD unveils 7 nanometre GPU at Computex super cool let me just get this stuff if you want to start I'm gonna get this stuff in twitch ad and sure up on the screen ok um also at Computex big surprise there right AMD announced the first seven nanometer GPU launching in the second half of 2018 it's a big deal because Intel has Intel hasn't even gotten to ten yet and AMD is already announcing hey we're going to have a 7 nanometre GPU oh this is a GPU so to be fair dental mix it's a little different um what does in vide have right now do they have or they on 10 yet I am Italy has regarding yeah I'm sure which has screaming at me for that in Telegraph by the way cuz we're talking about GPUs but that's okay see they don't tend for a while Oh have they okay why am i blinking I shouldn't be yeah I just love having dead air yeah oh it's great it's so great it's I mean it's um yes yeah Pascal so Pascal is what fourteen sixteen fourteen sixteen fourteen okay so there you go so yes so we're they're basically having that AMD is having that with Vega so Andy will have vague on seven nanometers inside the new Radeon instinct part they're claiming 25 per source use me 35 percent more performance over the previous gen 40 nanometer part so there you're having it is what them yeah I remember there was a split and I was trying to think of what numbers that split on but okay 14 nanometer is 1030 1050 so the lower end silicon is 14 and then for the higher end chips are we using 16 yes oh but yeah okay yeah I see yeah 16 so so there you go so obviously this offerings are either 14 or 16 depending on what you get Andy is going down to 7 twice a power efficiency so which kind of makes sense right because it's 2 times the density of their last gen which was 14 so this now means Andy is a head of the GPU game in this one area because even Volta Nvidia's new urgent architecture is at 12 nanometers right now so but do note that there actually isn't an industry-standard way to measure transistor sizes so um your it I think it used to mean a little bit more than it does now so do take that number with a small grain of salt but it's still a pretty big deal also remember that it's I believe it's square nanometers so 7 is like mm-hmm considerably smaller than 10 right yeah yeah it's just like how 4 square inches is a lot smaller than yeah yeah okay just a thing to remember there you go someone in the twitch chat reminded me of that so thank you to whoever that was so prepare for high wattage power supplies being even dumber unless you have a water chiller from an aquarium with a computer so yes yes of course now okay wow what is that coughing you back there loud noises so this is another really really cool piece of news in my opinion this is posted by Shreyas one on the forum gigabyte making fake RAM it's fake except it's super cool and you want it to be fake so I'll explain that in a moment do you know about this I know about it now so apparently they're selling their a horas is a hybrid you're a source or a source or RGB LED memory which is it's not surprising that that's sort of their like game or line of stuff now so it's gonna have all all the RGB so two of the sticks are your run-of-the-mill eight gig ddr4 memory modules yeah but the other half of the bundle is two sticks of fake RAM they're made the same aluminum housing but and they have the LEDs that can sync up with your actual RAM sticks but they have none of the memory bits so if you can't afford to populate every single slot on your motherboard with actual RAM but you don't want it to look like there's big gaps in between your RGB you can get this instead you can save some money and have a look like they're all populated until you can afford more actual RAM now I don't personally care at all because I've never cared about fully populated on think it looks bad but I am 100% certain because I know them that there are people that do care about fully populating all their slots yeah and RAM is incredibly expensive right now so the fact that they are able to bridge that gap a little bit you can fill all the slots but you don't have to spend ludicrous amounts of money well there's a certain effect you get you know because when you have those slots populated if the light boards like on Pawar or th ICC thick enough then you will have an effect that looks like a big block or a big brick instead of like little strips of color or so yeah that's so I don't mind the strips of color thing but yeah I just understand how people like that aesthetic and it still gets you the the sticks of RAM that actually have memory on them in this kit that we're talking about here is 8 gig dims each so you're getting 16 total gigs of RAM which is pretty solid yeah so the modules the fake modules can still communicate with the other ones they just don't have any actual RAM on them but so do note if you're interested in this right now you have to buy as a whole kit but gigabyte is considering the possibility of just selling the fake stick separately at point so I think they'll do that based on and say we did so he has no idea no today there we go they'll probably end up selling them individually if these kits sell well enough yeah an exam it's it's probably like a manufacturing worthiness situation I could see it happening cuz I'm sure there's plenty of people who have bought ran they didn't need just so they could populate all their slots so I'm sure this hat again I'd I know people that have done that there we go even know people that have bought the same looking kit just lower capacity for the second set because it like I don't even need more RAM yeah oh man okay and then you get into this whole like catch-22 where even if you don't need more like oh let me just buy like a one gig stick of this thing but as high rent Randa has the RER GB so you can't yeah yeah so this one moving on this was posted by SC to Mitch on the forum just like every week dude thank you very much for posting the the source of this article is motherboard vice.com as many of you have probably heard github is being purchased by Microsoft now github and get lab or different things I'm just putting that out here for people that may not know so get for that for the context of this story get lab is not being purchased by Microsoft github is being purchased by Microsoft this thirteen thousand projects ditched github for gitlab Monday morning thing is a little out-of-date the current number that we have is I believe one hundred and fifty thousand of them have ditched github forget lab now more projects have bailed off of github in that time these are just the ones that have gone to get lab specific yeah there are other solutions but that that's the the majority of the movers have done that now to put to rest a little bit of the freaked out from the information that i've been able to see online and some of the stuff that's in this exact article it seems like most people are bailing because they're making like a Spock's emulators well here's I'm gonna like things that Microsoft that are going against Microsoft specifically well there's okay obviously something like an emulator you can see the problems there with like IP and copyright infringement but but okay so just one example I can think of that has some pretty recent relevance if you go on YouTube shameless plug for tech wiki we did a recent Technica sewed on dns league leaks and how they can undermine your privacy and how they can expose your browsing history even if you're using a VPN so let's say you're using a VPN that has a DNS leak protection feature on it yeah um so there is a feature in Windows 8 and in Windows 10 it has a really long acronym I can't exactly remember what it is right um SM hnr I think as well it's called but it is a feature and there's a reason I'm doing the quotation fingers that can't apparently even override DNS leak protection and compromise your privacy yeah so there was someone on github that wrote a patch for Open VPN where you could just download it and it would like take care of that for you when Microsoft consider something like that undermining their own software if they don't want people doing that you know cuz I mean copyright infringement one thing is super obvious but what if it's like there's an actual problem with a Microsoft product like Windows that someone is in good faith trying to fix for people and Microsoft just says no and people wouldn't know where to look because so many people just kind of automatically go to github and think this stuff is gonna be on there so yeah it's gonna be interesting and also I forgot to post to the YouTube announcement so rip and there's like not even that much time left in the show but I just published it so people will be able to see flawless however long we have oh no so anyways it's it's it's yeah people are even thinking projects that could easily be used to harm others like deep fakes might be a problem and a lot of those types of projects have bailed already okay which sucks because deep fakes can also be used to not hurt people yeah just like a power drill yeah pretty much so like we'll have to see how Microsoft deals with this trying to connect you are offline oh great but but yeah I just I don't think it's gonna be as nuclear as people think I suspect Microsoft isn't gonna do a ton different with it than was already being done with github hopefully everything doesn't become weird colored squares because I really have oh good lord yes not enjoy it kind of depends I mean I think there were fears about that with something like uwp for example hmm but at the same time you know the desktop experience on Windows 10 is still like largely Oh open what ever since you were garbage garbage I hate the desktop experience on Windows 10 oh no I'm not talking about UI UI is different than whether the platform is open or closed okay yeah yeah UI is a totally different story like you can hey the UI you all you want to but um that is a preference thing I know some people are gonna screech ah I don't person you want to do this thing here or this thing is better either one sure I don't know what ton of it is cool I don't know a ton about it but let's let's dive into it see what we can get so thank you Club 3d who you be 3d you be dubbed cute oh I think it's cute of course it's it's just a very tortured spelling of cube I failed that one it is cubed for suresies all right you've stake forbes is the source article here and there's bin so once it loads my internet is a not the happiest at the moment but there's been some leaks of the pixel three now one interesting thing here is that there's going to be three phones there's going to be the standard normal pixel there's gonna be the pixel XL those are already expected now there's going to be a mid-range phone and they don't mean sighs they don't mean between the normal sized pix they're talking on pix power yeah I mean power and price and stuff like that what is going on I don't care about your court of the day load the webpage please it's hard to fly without ruffling a few feathers I'm trying to ruffle your feathers Forbes let me fly please hello okay oh my goodness awesome alright well the cool part is that there's three phones there's the affordable pixel 3 which is the interesting one in this lineup not not because the other ones aren't interesting but because it's new so the affordable pixel 3 which is what we're gonna call it a set of mid-range just we don't get confused by the sizing things it is a likely going to be a game-changer for mid-range smartphone photography and that kind of makes sense because a lot of the awesomeness of the pixel camera is in the software then they can put that software on the cheap phone which is really cool the 3xl is going to have a knotch how are you feel about this yeah that's happening so I'm gonna I'm will have to see but I'm almost certainly gonna be getting a pixel 3 ok I currently still have my pixel 1 XL and I like this phone a lot but it's starting to show the signs of being tired the battery starting yeah and there's like it started yeah you can tell I can't I can't anymore it's it's still a very good phone if I wasn't a ridiculous power user of my phone I wouldn't care that much but I am a absolute ridiculous power user oh we have a power user oh yeah I'm always on this thing and I do a lot of stuff on it so I'm stoked and I will probably get the XL okay cuz I have large hands I can hide my whole phone so oh look at power user with his large hand yeah dude so the small phones are just a little too small not quite this is a 6p so yeah Nexus they're producing ok so I want the excel that means I have to do with the nagy traditionally I haven't really liked notches but it might work if the notch is small enough which I can't see because forms won't load I saw some I saw some allegedly leaked images of the thing it does look a fair bit smaller than the iPhone 10 the notch does what makes sense right guys on Android how're those notifications it fills them in from the sides right but on iphone that doesn't happen though your notifications are just in that little tray so if it is just a fairly small one mm-hmm that's cool I'm down mm-hmm it also has front-facing speakers which I can't show you because they won't load by the way I don't think this is Forbes his fault just gives anyone the audience is like what the heck I was making jokes about not to know the fly because of the Forbes thing whatever I think it our Internet's being super weird I was at the NSA because I had this problem earlier but yeah okay so I don't know that's super cool I can't show you what the small one looks like I can't show you what the mid-range one looks like it apparently the the the mid-range phone is to be based on qualcomm new Snapdragon 710 chipset which promises performance close to 20 Seventeen's flagship Snapdragon 835 did yeah I think that would be cool because one big issue that people had with pixel phones when they started being called pixel was that they were a lot more expensive than people wanted so being able to give a more affordable option is is cool let's definitely minim maybe it'll stick maybe it'll be it'll go the way the iPhone 5c who knows yeah yeah Australian gamers are being blamed for slow internet Wow okay apparently this was slightly taken out of context this is from ABC net you may be this will load maybe not I'm gonna post this in twitch chat and if you are watching on YouTube there are either timestamps posted in the description of this video or I have noticed many wonderful people also post their own custom timestamps below the video in the comments wow this looks like it's not properly loading but it's sort of working so let's show that screen why not I really like how the image I used for this story is a screen cap from Big Bang like what they don't what the heck that is them what are they doing is this like a retro addition I don't watch this show I don't know it's always been kind of weird to me but anyways moving on believe it or not some of the biggest online games use very little data when you're playing compared to streaming HD video or even high fidelity audio so people are slamming back at whoever the heck said this I don't care it doesn't matter because he's like gamers are to develop but apparently the within the context that he was saying it so someone named Mauro I don't know said it's gamers product predominantly on fixed wireless apparently what he meant is it's that he's typecasting gamers not saying that games right because later on he said that the people who game or also they've a tent-like consume more data just across the board whether it's video or others they're watching twitch streams they're watching YouTube they're they're streaming audio how they play their game they're these are power users of the internet because people asked he he originally said extreme users and then he was asked to clarify on that so he said it's gamers predominantly on fixed wireless but I don't think he meant it is video games that are the problem I think he was saying like Matt's gamers which I also think is not necessarily true because out of all people that I know that watch the ludicrous amounts of streaming video it's not a necessarily gamer no I mean you have you have people that think oh like video games are stupid but they'll sit there and they'll binge Netflix like eight hours at a time and that takes more bandwidth so yeah it's not that's not the best look for him at least to be filming home no cracking a bottle of wine yeah and chugging it while binging multiple seasons at a time of your favorite show of yeah well that is whatever on people who don't game watch so I don't I'm not very up on this hip alcoholic terminology so sorry if I said that wrong but yes wine yeah yeah do they call it wine anymore I don't know Matt I said crack in a bottle of wine that I realize you don't do that do you uncork or you do the thing that you crack a bottle of beer I'm a hip man I'm in with the the boys now it's time for you to the Macarena hip I'm with it but yeah I I don't know I think it's just something taking out of context I don't think it's actually when people are freaking out about people just like screaming I think the guys just saying its power users if people that use the internet alone it's it's this stuff yeah if he actually thinks it's video games he now for sure knows that it's not because everyone on the planet has told them you're wrong so I think he gets it now and we can probably hopefully move on but I thought it was an interesting story anyways and something to bring up Australia's Internet is actually garbage and one thing that I am very aggressively against is that apparently they've been considering throttling back data consumption of extreme users during peak periods that's ridiculous Australia just fix your freakin internet it's not that hard everyone else has seemed to figure this out might be a cost issue they are in an unfortunate place yeah for undersea cables figure it out I don't know what else to say Australia's Internet has been garbage for a very long time working at flow plain it's super expensive to get bandwidth there mm-hmm I'm trying to serve people in Australia videos and it's art it's gotta be a cost issue because of me I mean how many how many times have you had people coming on the forum saying oh like this GPU costs almost twice as much in Australia because reasons so I imagine it might be similar here I just Australia's Internet is just garbage I know quite a few people from Australia and it's it's really really expensive and it's really really bad and it's a shame because I don't think it needs to be I understand that there's definitely cost implications but there are countries not that far away that have really really bad they're the stadium nachos the internet yeah okay yeah Australia yeah you have the stadium nachos of Internet I like that analogy and you know we all understand like people like that fake cheese sauce today it's like plastic well people like that stuff it's disgusting don't even bother yeah yeah no just like order a hot dog or something like just or do what I did and smuggle in for spicy chickens from Wendy's into movie that's a great and trade them for other things bartering I hope my spice I hope no one from Cineplex is watching this doesn't let me back into a movie boy I get it done also organic carbon module modules organic carbon molecules found on Mars NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has identified a variety of organic molecules the carbon-based building blocks of life as we know it in 3.5 billion year old rocks on Mars this does not give us any evidence of life necessarily but there's a possibility that the organics are a form of an ancient life source of some kind we just don't know another finding that methane concentrations in Mars atmosphere cycle seasonally the discovery suggests that the gas is seeping out from underground reservoirs it is possible that some of the methane was produced by organisms as it is here on earth be very careful that everything in his in this has possible written all over it it's not not necessarily guaranteed they did find organic carbon molecules and methane concentrations in ours Mars atmosphere do cycle around seasonally we got that the rest of it is all hypotheticals impossible what are exactly what organics they found because obviously you know just because it has a carbon atom and it doesn't mean it you know came from life you know I see but a lot of people don't know that which is why we got a got a really tight yeah lot possible like methane is an extremely simple molecule look at forum without life around very easily so yeah I was trying going through the story to see if there were any more deets but it didn't say don't think too many but but yeah I think that's honestly about it the rest of the stuff in the doc is not crazy interesting there's the amazon thing we can go over that real quick but oh it doesn't have anything to do with tech so I don't really know what it does I think it does it the fact that they says well if that guy's Amazon and oh yeah I just store like it's it's an aunt I don't know why we always end up talking about Amazon it's the the fact that it was online made it a federal crime okay but online shopping yeah he's all as heck and Amazon is just like taking over the whole planet that's like they're like political level instead of like basically hacked news but whatever we'll talk about it Amazon return policy abusers were sentenced to nearly six years in prison basically they bought a wack ton of GoPros and other stuff so for two years the fin ends not sure what that means I'm assuming that system yeah they're a Mary they're a married couple yeah okay they ordered over 2700 electronic items from Amazon including GoPro digital cameras Xboxes smartwatches tablets laptops and then they reported them as damaged and that somehow didn't get flagged el automatic they used a lot of like shell accounts and stuff so they did it from like a bunch of different accounts to try to avoid detection good job VPNs I'm assuming once Amazon replaced the products they would sell them to a third person de Nigel glue Mac I've probably is that right oh I don't know it doesn't matter the annual glue Mac but currently it's da ni je L which is a pretty cool name that's if that is I'm sure it's just Daniel but if that is his name that name is sick it's not gel screaming I should get a dog in him a dog L don't you in all Aaron and Lea fin'in are said to have made approximately 750 thousand dollars running the scam while glumack made approximately $500,000 so the the couple the gotten nearly six years each the accomplice got two years 24 months um so I thought this was interesting because just from from a legal perspective legal corner with John real quick real quick here they they were prosecuted federally ok because it was done across state lines and the feds are pretty serious about like winning cases against people like if like like I think the feds have like an over ninety percent conviction rate when they bring charges against people and if you go to federal prison I think the rule is you have to serve 85% of your sins before you're eligible for parole so they're not getting out for a little while yeah so apparently this wasn't the only thing that happened I again I don't know why Amazon means that we're talking about it but the Amazon fraud wasn't the only problem they also bounced checks they rented cars and failed to pay for them they sold other stolen hi any others yeah and they withheld rent all of which are actions that were taken into account during the sentencing none of which mean that it makes sense being on the land show I joined that note I just realized I'm responsible for having this on here I'm sorry I just don't I just I just don't now I feel bad anyways thanks for watching I think it's time for a morale meeting next week like we need to have a company-wide dialogue oh how we like treat the contributions of our fellow I think it's high time for this I did we always talk about Amazon stuff and sometimes they do tech related things but not always thank you very much squeeze Alexa thank you for see like that accent thank you very much LTX so us for sponsoring the show and thank you very much fresh folks response for folks I just okay so my I just it's not always tech stuff when they make the stores where you can walk in and walk out you just get your stuff I think that's cool that's Texaco yeah I detect we're gonna Amazon girl was good yes always good they do have a lot of tech news but it's not just automatically I don't know anyways I'm sorry Jon bye everyone I'll see you next time
