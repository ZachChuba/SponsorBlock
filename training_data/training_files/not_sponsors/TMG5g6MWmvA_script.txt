tech trends brought to you by Starbucks double-shot from wind to solar to battery-powered cars the scientific community is constantly developing alternative energy sources for Americans to blindly waste here at green Ford in San Francisco engineers are hard at work discovering greener ways to power our lives using hydrogen cells which they say will allow us to thoughtlessly squander our planet's resources for years to come you see hydrogen energy is clean enough to neutralize your decision to keep your charged iPad plugged in overnight or your hockey table running in your basement every day of the week so if my home were to run on hydrogen technology I would need to think twice about leaving my hot tub on 24/7 we're talking four deep freezers in your home with six packets of flavor ice between them no problem the way hydrogen sells let us waste their energy saving powers is simple since combining hydrogen and oxygen for energy emits toxin free water the number of thermal units in the atmosphere decreases and that decrease is then offset when someone sits in 45 minutes of traffic with their a/c on full blast or let's the shower run for 10 minutes before getting in green Ford's goal to one day have every home and car in America run out mindlessly discarded hydrogen energy so this is all really exciting but what about the cost well anytime you transition to a new energy system you face an initial investment but you can't put a price tag on being able to keep the second full-size refrigerator in your garage for the two times a year you throw a party after seeing the green Ford Labs in progress it gives me real hope that there will be a day where I don't have to think twice about leaving two TVs on at the same time to make it sound like there are people around for tech trends I'm Erin Vaughn
