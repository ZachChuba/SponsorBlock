hey there everybody welcome back to the channel it's adam here from test Australia today I wanted to do a little bit of a video update on autopilot and specifically navigate on autopilot after receiving the new maps that became available during the week so we received another version of maps that were pushed down to the car mid last week 20/20 version maps I'm still running the same version of software that was in the last video 20 2016 or 2.1 so I haven't received any further updates since then so I just wanted to give a quick test just to see how auto pilot decides to function specifically around sort of Lane entrances freeway exits etc on this new version but first up I just wanted to do a little bit of a retest on that same roundabout that I tested a couple of videos ago there are obviously a fair few comments around roundabout support and obviously just reiterating again I know this isn't supported tests they're in no way to say that this functionality is supported but with all things tech we like to test these things out and kind of see what see what the technology can do and and right then it it didn't work so again the the instance that I had a couple of videos back was was maybe just all things kind of aligning and and that functionality decided to work that time so we all know that this isn't perfect we know there are issues we know there are bugs and that's why this feature is listed as beta and we need to be fully supervising the car when it is actually in this state so yeah again I sort of don't want to highlight the fact that we've got auto pilot on city streets etcetera working at this point in time but it's good to test it to see how far it's come so I'm a few minutes away from the motorway so when I get to the freeway entrance all already cut to the start of of that and we'll see how autopilot goes with new maps and see if maps do make any difference in the way autopilot functions or not all right we are back and just entering the m1 motorway again navigate on autopilot has been enabled just going to ramp the speed up here just so we enter the freeway at the same speed everybody else is going fair bit of traffic out today actually just obviously it's a long weekend here at the moment so this is going to be not a bad little test for the navigate on other part to see to see how we go but yeah quite a few cars I wants to make another lane change which is okay let's do it but that entrance was great no real issues seen there at all now the car is probably going to want to move over to the fast lane again which we're only about four kilometers away from the from the exit so it's always a little bit interesting when it when it decides to to kind of move all the way and I'm hoping it doesn't I'm hoping it happily kind of sits here knowing that it's gonna need to go off the motorway in about three kilometers but let's let's see what it decides to do yeah well this traffic is insane I haven't seen this obviously with with covert and all that sort of stuff going on the the freeways of being extremely light and being Monday the last day of the public holiday we've probably got quite a lot of people heading home from from up and off so but so far I'm actually quite glad the car is happily staying in the middle lane so it's obviously overtaking the cars in the slowest Lane but not moving so far out of the way to obviously cause an issue when we need to kind of move back across so we're now two kilometres away from the exit now here's around the time I would sort of hope that the car would move over to the left lane which is now saying it does want to do an upcoming lane change so we'll see what it decides to do that it is it is clear for us to do so which is always nice okay car went into lane change which is great okay so we moved across with just over a kilometer left witches which is fine again probably a little bit close for my liking but I guess we didn't knowing that there was a nice safe gap to do so between between the cars so overall not not too much of an issue so just to recap this exit we normally don't have too much of an issue in taking this exit it does do it however it does normally do it a little bit roughly so it does kind of do a bit of a semi aggressive swerve off the off the motorway and then sort of corrects itself back to the centre so we'll see if that is improved well people can't plan their driving very well and they decide to move off at the last minute and yeah pretty similar kind of a bit of a bit of a fairly rough exit and then a correction at the end so so far no real difference here let's let's navigate back to our normal exits heading back north and we're gonna have to cancel exited to move over link so we'll do that and readjust and I'll come back when we're back on the freeway heading north again okay we are now setting up for moving back up north and again same thing as before for some reason it always decides to indicate left to enter onto the freeway which isn't great so a fairly slow in terms of our move and acceleration onto the freeway there is a bus a few car lengths ahead I do have the follow length set to three right now moving across into the center lane which is okay speed moving up to just below the speed limit I'm not sure why the car does decide to indicate left when we need to go and exit on to the right to move on to the motorway so we should ideally be indicating to the right so normally what I do is I just override that by the indicator stalk and kind of turning that to containing the right indicator on which negates the left indicator so something that we haven't seen fixed but I would expect that to come in a software release sometime down the track so so far so good no issues nothing negative that's for sure cars certainly handling the traffic pretty well northbound isn't as bad we're sort of navigating pretty well here so I would expect in the next kind of 500 meters or so that we would see the car want to move over to the left lane which it now wants to do which is good again no one around so I'll let the car move across as it chooses to do so okay perfect so that was a little further out than than heading southbound so again two kilometers around my kind of sweet spot that I like to see when when kind of moving across so so far so good again similar to this exit again we don't normally see too many issues in exiting but we do to kind of see that aggressive kind of turn off and then correction so again we'll see if there is any improvement there on this specific version but again I'm doubting so but it was a good excuse for a bit of a test drive and test okay a few hundred meters away decides to mmm interesting that was a little bit different to what I have seen before it was like it kind of hesitated to to exit it didn't take the freeway exit as soon as it normally does normally it does it pretty much as soon as the the exit lane opens but on this occasion it didn't it kind of waited a little bit and then kind of handled the freeway exit like a lane change but because it handled it like that the car was actually extremely smooth in terms of the way it moved across lanes to take the freeway exit so that was uh that was pretty cool it was much smoother than than what I would normally have seen with the car so really quite happy with that all right well that's gonna be it for today's video so thanks very much for tuning in and having a look at my video today I really do appreciate it and those of you comment and I look forward to chatting with you there and until the next video I do appreciate you watching thanks so much stay safe and I'll talk to you on the next video bye for now
