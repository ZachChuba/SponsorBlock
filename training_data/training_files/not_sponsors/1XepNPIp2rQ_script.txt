Frizzle but spooky so the scary godmother kidnaps Hannah Bob Anna and they head into a painting of a haunted house just look at Hannah are you gonna tell me her head isn't drastically larger than a few minutes ago we then meet Scully who is quite literally a skeleton in her closet get it Scully is that sassy guy who makes about 300 bone puns a minute meanwhile the kids are hanging outside the house laughing in their success of trapping Hannah little do they know that she's in an alternate dimension so scary God mother sends her spook juice all over the room and real talk the theme song in this movie is honestly a Bob [Music] like this song snaps done so we cut through the kids trading candy like drugs and we get the smoothest slide of the century I'm sure this joke boy kisses oh wait I don't have any kisses Oh like that was way too smooth for a kid so back at the haunted dimension we meet Harry the werewolf Harry the whale wolf Harry the rare WA werewolf werewolf we're roof Harry the werewolf he's by far the worst character ever created in anything he starts talking incessantly and out of nowhere the godmother breaks the fourth wall and gives us a food lesson parts of this Halloween special just hit you like a weird fever dream and it's incredible I guess so she sticks that cracker in his mouth and he gets all quiet and vampires arrived to make vampire puns that's it just vampire puns do you sleep in a coffin sure I've slept my own coffin since I was three you mean you still share a coffin with your parents no I don't sleep in a coffin at all you're homeless then totally not at war dough from Foster's Home for Imaginary friend comes out and terrifies Hannah he chases her around and acts like he's gonna snatch her up and eat her all where the wild things aren't [ __ ] and she's like boom light beam it's not very effective but then they end up bonding and the mood changes in an instant so back to outside the baseball car kid has an aneurysm as well door is ajar door is ajar and then back to the haunted house everyone dances in some undefined shadow realm I'm telling you man this special is just insane during the dance Hannah just screams and Bugaboo dances all sad [Music] [Applause] [Music] and just like what what the hell like what the actual hell was that I feel weirdly sad and dirty from that small moment in a dance sequence so once again back outside the game considers checking in on Hanna to make sure that she's actually dead and they have a vote on who goes in that goes on for like 30 minutes that's still one vote for everyone recount that's one vote for everyone and yet again we go back inside the haunted house for our next plot development that revolves around pizza ordering pizza eating pizza and talking about Pizza hashtag relatable and then as we are nearing the end of our three hundred and forty minute runtime the kids decide to go chicken on Hannah so all the monsters in Hannah decide to traumatize them this causes the kids to grow bulbous eyes that bulge out of their head even if there aren't moving it's incredibly unsettling and pretty gross the Catwoman girl also has a mouth inside her mouth she got mad mouse scared God with her melts and [ __ ] dies so Hannah acts like she's killing all of them with her magic light beam and the movie ends with the kids looking up at Hannah and the monster is killing a werewolf for wanting more pizza because he's hungry and that's scary god mother Halloween spooktacular extravaganza bonanza there's something about this entire movie that I can't put my finger on it's not good in the slightest but it's weirdly charming simply for how innocent it is it's not trying to be anything it isn't just being as Halloween themed as it can by jamming never-ending puns and Halloween related things down your throat it doesn't really have a plot people just wait around eat dance and scream it's weird how much of my childhood this special was involved in I would go every single Halloween watching it and its sequel scary godmother herself is kinda hilarious she has more power than a god and has a house that srida moves on its own but it never feels like we learn enough about her and her world for having such an important part of my childhood I wanted to grow closer to her so I came up with a plan it's hard to actually find information on movies you can find information on the actual books but nothing directly on the movies I think scary godmother herself resides in New Jersey I say this because I'm from Florida the only states that Floridians know about is New York California and New Jersey and I see an episode of South Park where Kyle finds out he's from New Jersey and he has red hair just like scary godmother so she must be from New Jersey it's foolproof logic I figured this was the only way to get more information about her so I took a flight to New Jersey I took the flight at night so it's closer to spooky hour when she would be the most noticeable I went to the closest haunted house where I searched all over for her no sign of her but I did find piccolo from Dragon Ball Z I searched all around the house for a sign of her existence but I came across nothing but it did come across a blu-ray copy of the masterpiece that is Ted to completely unwrapped and everything but it could not find see her godmother soon became date I'm so defeated and saddened I took a flight back to Florida when I came home I was surprised to find copy of scary godmother on DVD waiting for me on my chair the copy came from a library in Illinois a fictional state to Floridians so I knew I had to be a sign from scary godmother herself the tattoo blu-ray was also there it followed me home from New Jersey but I knew that in my heart if I can never find out more about scary godmother directly at least I'll always have this sign from her it really turned out to be a Halloween spooktacular that flight from New Jersey purchase thanks square space
