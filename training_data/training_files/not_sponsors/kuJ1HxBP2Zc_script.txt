folks welcome back to another episode perhaps the finale also very much perhaps not a Minecraft but all the loot drops are randomized featuring or no crafting recipes I don't even know what's happening I just recorded one nas is all the loot drops crap and chill hosting providing the server on which we are playing where we now have a dragon and in crystal it's very exciting and a fountain and a fountain yeah and the the Enderman have started to spawn and I don't know why you dug out so that they can get down to us now because I wanted to make good ideas hello try to do the kill on me he did he did okay so yeah we could do we could we do need to get some ender pearls come out that was me I did oh I sweeping edged you that's yes okay whoa this the dragon is addressing to I want us to do much in the way of being able to get some ender pearls but I feel like we should have them the reason I agree I am yeah that's because you're in the purple dude you're in the purple I'm not I'm not okay I got one all right they're all you I need to heal a little bit okay we got this boys we have got this they you're not giving me uh you're not giving me any ender pearls which we should be stopped running away not giving me any underfur I've successfully managed to achieve no ender pearls I got one so I mean okay so anyway as I was saying about our sponsor I'm super hosting providing the server that we're playing on if you want to grab a server of your own perhaps do some random drop series whatever else you feel like doing you could head on over the link in the description of the stream or the video and there you'll get a discount code off your first month of server hosting from the kind folks over there and you can play some data pack random craft whatever is your choosing any minecraft but why are they not dropping ender pearls we're not playing random Luke thank you yeah we're playing random crafting animals like any minecraft but name was like it's minecraft but I insert you know you know what the but mean was I mean I'm sure the but name is the thing somewhere tell me about the but mean so basically yeah let's try to get ourselves some ender pearls so we can save ourselves in the event of bad situations taking place and not having much luck but I guess I'm used to having like weird looting 3 at this point so yeah we didn't we didn't exactly get the best of equipment before coming here we we I'm not saying it's premature I'm just saying it's optimistic you know yeah but at the same time it's like there's no guarantee that we're gonna get why no dude it would be a heck of a thing no freaking rose at all I'm just I'm slightly concerned about the food department is is the only concern 14 chickens all right we're even we're even we've got we've got chicken and then also hopefully we don't get as we get oh my gosh how are we gonna do this so do you have a building up I'm building up and then I'm gonna mine in I'm building up and then I'm mining in alright this is his plan he's there is no way that this he's way there's no way Asians no way samurais the optimal 's and has decided that this is the way to do it if it couldn't go wrong it couldn't go wrong find a mine into obsidian with no efficiency it could never go wrong it's it's a it's a you've got a diamond pickaxe you're fine the Dragons not over here right now you've got a clean I need you to distract the man's he's coming over here now let me in let me in let me in let me in let me in I mean I mean okay all right all right it's not just more obsidian yeah it's more obsidian but I do this okay okay oh yes and then it's loan up by the crystal that's what Oh what's happening where did I get hit Oh Oh Frick dude Oh Frick did the dragon come by he came by he was like yo what's up yeah he must have just actually physically hit me which was not yeah he knocked out some of your in stone - that's it understand oh he's driving by he's doing drive-bys zombie boys oh no dude stop stop stop stop stop I need to get me Jen he's he's away he's in different areas now no he's gone what is he doing me he keeps coming to me though yeah did he kill me you at all or he just ran through me like time after time all right I didn't I was just watching from below I wasn't like hey I see what's okay about this situation though is that we have blocks and I can just run right back and then I can collect my stuff and we can do it over oh good yeah yeah it's fine no problem I have most of the block and then actually that's a better way to get my food back to be completely honest with you that's a better way to get it yeah it is it have you built up - I'm in a pillar right now oh I didn't bring up Lana he's not harassing me at the moment you give me some blocks if you come over by my pillars I just toss them down toss them down I can I can throw you there there is that how many do you need I'll work that's fine that should be fine I think I can get up there why did he just he went after me like over and over and over and over he was just like hammering me yeah he he seemed interested but he's now like I can hear him right outside I think he's gonna come don't worry it's fine he's gonna come right as long as he's only killing you that I'm okay with that I'm totally ready to get just absolutely you pooped on oh no no no no no no no no no nobody pooped on no no no no no no no no no don't do it don't do it he's circling and I need a pickaxe so bad don't you know it bud don't do it Jesus Christ I got it I got my stuff you actual trash can why you actual trash can let me take you what why do you want to take me how do you propose that I break this crystal without blowing the kablooey from below do I am below I am below I can see it it's right there why is it like this I got it I got a crystal down and recited in order to do how did to do it didn't hurt at all if I only wrap nuts oh gosh oh gosh oh gosh you're a fish you're not off the edge oh no no no he managed to shoot a purple ball into my oh yeah yeah yeah I got out with two hearts but I'm digging down again haven't we got an iron pickaxe with me and just and just it's gonna be fine okay holy crap dude I my mission was successful yours was not we'll keep on doing you and I can keep being the cannon fodder and it'll work in the end did you get this one no the one the one that you died I know are you still work are you still read you mind through the Obsidian or what was your what did you do was your plan I went I literally did what you were doing okay so you did mine through the Obsidian yes okay I'm gonna come up here I'm gonna come up okay here we go here we go and wait what are you doing what are you doing I'm just gonna I'm just gonna go back up and get my stuff oh okay I thought you got your oh that's right you died again yeah that did happen it did do that yeah all right I just I just had forgotten that part where you died the second time okay out mmm okay so got some stuff again hey good good here I'm gonna toss the pickaxe yeah actually do you want to I don't know if you want to snag the beer I'm just gonna okay here we go the question is can I do this can I do this without getting hit again that was a little equivocation right hey don't worry it's fine it's chill I hate you freakin crystal dude what the heck I can't get up closer to it then you think you do I know that much okay hey gotta break one more block then eight don't come over here buddy don't come over here you know I might what we could do is just run a hey that did no damage to me at all that's a good way to do it God my plan was flawless each other than the other than the other than the dragon it was flawless yeah the dragon does seem to be a problem in this though don't worry it's gonna be approximately two hours of us digging through obsidian pillars no no I have an idea I have an idea I have a great idea oh dude are you gonna are you gonna go up throw your stuff down then kill it eat and come back no but what I am gonna do is I have a great idea Yolo oh you idiot hey take me actually it's not oh man hey I did that on purpose I did that on purpose and you will see why okay because I can make I can be wise with my what oh you are you did you then crystal huh yep that end crystal did not do no damage well the good part is you can go you can go back yes and get your stuff like I've done several times right right I know I'll be good and this time you can using blocks yes sir I can do and we fine okay so what you want tell me what you want what you really really I don't really care as long as blocks for you also here pickaxe in case you need it there you go thank you now okay here is what I was thinking here is the master plan but I have come up with is I'm going to make it easier for at least a few of the crystals right at least a few of them okay yeah alright got my stuff no problem so did you did you just get the one at the tongue okay that crystals down yeah hey very nice so here's I was directly underneath it so I think you just need to be make sure your two or have a I mean I don't know if I didn't obviously didn't have the angle I needed so no I'm about I'm about to try a legendary it's not a - you got a plan you've got a point edge Andheri when you've made it clear that there's a plan and play legendary plan absolute legend here he goes here goes the man here goes the act here goes the man who needs a height man when you have you like you're the way and you're doing it's going for it man skill we stopped fly true yes fly true yes fly true yeah there we go he levels that you have or arrows I had four so that's three down now I can get I could get one more I can get one more I just need to go see see this is what I was talking about dude this is what I was talking about so that's what you were talking about yeah yeah yeah yeah here here we are with is this ender and ender dragon and no ranged other than four arrows but the four arrows I just took out the big boys from one location 100% accuracy you can't be mad at that I'm not mad at it okay here we go why would I be mad oh there's no way you wouldn't know I'm not I would never I would never okay so I guess the play is okay here's the play here's the play the power than the other ones I don't like that I have a I have a really tall way did you get this one I got the two I got the three super duper tall ones that was my part I'm just don't worry about it tell me about it I'm going back down okay this is fine I just making sure that you got this one I think it's okay it's okay you didn't deal with mining through the obsidian at least right no no no no I was like three-quarters the way up and just like day 47 still blocking up yeah snowballs would would break it the problem is we don't have snowballs that's that's the issue there yeah there's no there's no snowballs either so but other but other than that we're good come on I like the fact that the dragons been been chilling dragons been chilling he's like these guys are obviously no threat to me there's there's no issue from any of these yeah okay so those are three ones and this one with lightroom boy boom oh no I'm in the purple shoot you have to do you have to dig wait how did you get an end crystal ah because I made one it was a craftable one oh yeah it was correct well at least I made it down so my stuff isn't floating so it makes it easier yeah yeah okay we're good everything's fine everything's fine it means Jail my way to you I'm out of my head to the end or the the Enderman platform okay oh you're gonna just toss my stuff over there yeah [Music] honestly I can't help but wonder if a better approach a more reasonable approach would simply be it would take less time if I just build up and then I do a fadeaway jump and just punch the crystal and then I get exploded and then we come right back and do it again I mean it's certainly less time it is it is cuz by night - to me it's a while 3 left right it's rad there's no we've actually gotten further than I would have expected we're doing baby why don't we have two left no that one's okay so a three yeah cuz the purple you didn't get that you were okay I see so I didn't get what do you mean I didn't get I all of my arrows hit crystals I agree I agree you just didn't get the one that you'd block up to that's all I was saying I didn't mean to offend you I'm sorry I you're you're beautiful man don't don't be upset more like it okay that's a little too high see what we can do is we just do the fadeaway shot over here dude see how it goes you're good you're gonna fade away I don't like how close that dragon is right by me but I can't look because I'm digging through obsidian if I just do this if I just go no yeah that worked I didn't even take the fall damage dude we out here boys fadeaway shot so there the win no I didn't but I will on the next one I will on the next one and I'm much more conservative than that you've just you've just got those though though that gravitas that allows you to do these hell yeah well that almost took me out that almost took me out purple is scary dude purple is very scary yeah purple is not a not a good time oh ow hey stop oh I see you okay Joe I don't like it I don't like it you're trying to dig through obsidian and all sudden damn damn yeah damn damn damn Daniel damn Daniel he is so close to me right now don't do it don't do it don't do it don't do it don't do it don't do it oh he's on that he's on the thing I think yeah okay so so much more okay so you just you just yeah a dude that works so well a purple okay fine we're fine did you get it purple no I haven't I haven't okay thing and the plays are strong here the plays are strong got it nice that's it that's it we took them out it's the final battle yeah this won't take a while I mean we just have to wait for it to land yeah I'm always so negative I need to work on being positive a positive guy big plays boys big plays here we go here we go easy peasy he's coming in for the land get in here - get in here I never why he's not coming not coming in for the land just kidding no purple come on bud come on bud it's just gonna be basically waiting waiting for some landings then do the damage why is that'll do the damage wait for landing and repeat rinse repeat and repeat rinse the rinsing and repeating see I'm gonna go for that and then I'm gonna manage to line myself up so that I get hit by a wing out into the nowhere that's why you have a pearl though that's why ya know that did be why so that he's definitely coming in definitely coming in yep yep yep okay here we go ow ow ow ow Rick go from behind and I'm good what where are you that was I landed on top of that pillar that wasn't that far befall now I have to go back up to this I was really not expecting that one I will be honest with you that was a that was a that was of a geez hey thanks right I didn't think that was far enough to fall and die at all thanks see you have you got a nice Lake it planned out landing there and everything yeah yeah like I aim for the top of the pillar I was like oh I can just land here do you have some blocks uh nope nope no big deal and then it was like yeah you're dead and I was like what what but why this one's really tall so yeah I would imagine that should be enough blocks I don't think I have ever been punted that far when the dragon is just on the ground it got some good of that it really did because if not then I'm gonna get all the way up and then not be able to do anything that would be a bummer that's pretty tall I've got what 41 blocks I don't here we go I can give you some more I'm minding a few more where are you at I'm 14 blocks up oh god he's going for the landing hold it just hold that thought stay here or should I go for it I mean I feel like it's not more than 41 out but okay hey get some hey guys you just did like he sat there for two seconds that's ridiculous I'm coming to you please please five four three two one holy crap it literally was it exactly that well exactly that okay I got I got no bad bad dragon bad nice Amy okay how you doing okay so for some reason the dragon really doesn't want to spend much time landing it's taking a while okay so let's wait for that good landing and here we go No why is it two seconds okay the dragon is supposed to take way more time than that this is ridiculous ridiculous rain we're one sixteenth of the way there oh my god dude at least we're getting used to having to do MLG plays you know with our landing on top of pillars and using the and your pariah I contend that that like I must have accumulated momentum or something in some other way because I didn't fall that III contend that was a survivable drop I see yeah we should have brought beds it would have been faster sure if you do beds in the Indian they go kaboom and they do big damn damn Oh boom boom yeah you are so so disagreeable I'm what am i I must be oh I was just disoriented I was like where did our ender pearl farming platform go but it's over here I can't believe that worked out to be literally like it was one jump up that I had to make to get onto the top of the pillar stress okay okay here we go here we go please don't punt me into the air I can you hit him from the front no it has to be for the what is with this I don't understand it seems like he just flies after two hits yeah it's not usually like that usually you can get a bunch more hits in yeah the heck um yeah we need Nico over here though to land a few more in but I've been distracted I admit but hey I did find some yellow dye so no cool that was mine I had it on me is pretty cool stuff yeah it's yours it's my gift to you oh thank you so much all right we get to just chill and wait for the dragon to go back and stuff this is a naturally spawned dragon guys I this is not the one that I spawned oh you mean the one that died just stayed for just yeah yeah okay both of us in here all right all right let's go I'm back sighs right cool whoa hi okay Oh oh nice nice not a good save doesn't even freaking two seconds what kind of weird behavior did you spawn with this thing why is it my fault it's just a dragon it obviously doesn't like to be on the freakin podium like the others do yeah it's like hey you know what these guys don't seem to have range so what I'm gonna do is not stick around down there this is ridiculous I'm gonna run out of food and have to just purposefully end myself never never the way to go oh my god bro oh my god please come here and land on the thing and don't just like it's whatever way it will always be facing you so you have to run around it so get ready get ready get ready wait wait what if what if ya go the other side go the other side that's been playing good planet the planet can't can't tackle okay okay no I like this again okay you gonna I'm not entirely sure I hit him at all like I'm swinging but I didn't see any reaction yeah I don't I don't think you hit it I only you hit it this is the world's longest Energon fight of all time I was I was there like I was I was swinging it's not that I wasn't didn't show up oh wow he's already back okay okay come on come on and he freakin please yeah okay I got it got it yeah we're good okay cool we got two hits in what are you the Frick and he's a quarter of the way down we're basically making great time I'm more than a quarter of the way down with my food oh my god this dragon is an absolute freakin idiot dude you know I'm bout I'm not ready to end crystal his ass about ready to just I'm that's I'm bout ready to I'm bout ready to resort to drastic measures here boys I'm gonna end crystal his ass literally I am going to light an end crystal under his ass and we'll see how much he likes it you might want to back up for this one you might want to back out are you I'm doing it I crafted this thing and I'll be damned if I don't get to put it to use he's he's a man with a plan guys also I write oh my god calm you're purple Jesus what the hell dude you know he heard your plan he's not he's not down with it he's like kill the one with the end crystal the man with the explosives you've basically become his sapper okay I don't remember what the end crystal crafting recipe is but if I well after I get wrecked here I'm gonna see if I can bring some beds in because this is so ridiculous um yeah I don't know what anchor so is either go in the port area unless you have a what happens if I stand in here as the dragon comes down we'll never find out cuz the dragon will never land the dragon will never land all right get ready mother trucker I'm observing all right boys here we go that did damage much dad didn't even end me oh my god that did damage damage him but not much bro that did like that did like 10% as opposed to our puny little hits I see it can we make it better you you got a good Oh buddy yes yes yes crafting thing for peds it's our end stone that's convenient Oh oh dear we are out of here we are out here purple get out of my life there's a bed here we go dude time to go night-night mr. dragons is that it turned out to be before and I know that's amazing so never tell me the odds all right I'm bad I'm bad at its bowline 370 don't want him come okay I need to do you think you could like I mean I have some obsidian do you think you'd make a little like a blast shield that you could try and use yeah yeah yeah yeah that is good idea you have good idea you have he's coming he's coming all right I'm just I'm captain lucky this is your show oh you stupid mother trucker ow he didn't want he didn't want it no I he didn't want there for that no didn't care for that okay coming back yep he heard us talking about beds and he's like I'm an insider don't threaten me with that don't threaten me with a bedtime I am a mature nine-year-old do not threaten me with bedtime I have a 1:00 a.m. bedtime and your beds will not okay hi frickin Frick wait where's my Frick where the heck okay got it you got it nope come back darn it why you hit him with beds yourself dude hit him throw everything you got at him everything you got do you want me to collect you more obsidian I mean you do you boo boo well I'm just we're trying to I'm trying to you know what are the needs here how can we help hold up Frick he doesn't want he doesn't want beds to happen he doesn't want a baby he really seems to be anti bed okay a man's is very anti bed but I'll tell you what we're gonna do this Ridgeline we're gonna line them up you're gonna line them up we're gonna knock this man's down we're gonna not wait can we do I can't remember if we can like I triple up on them or if they just come I don't even remember I don't remember how this or I've never done I don't damage I'm just observing we might want to put a roof on it if you know if you like it so much and put a roof on a kind of thing you like yeah but we need more obsidian for that I have two more well I mean if they're all gonna blow up it's fine because I'm locked in at this point I can't exactly break those beds so oh wait I can't I can't actually I just can't sleep in the bed you can't sleep in it yeah we're having to get creative here we're having the pink outside the bed hey why are you mad at me all right you ready I think you did some good damage did I good okay now okay I mean I think you did some damage on him yeah so it's like you so so you run in and do bed and blow up and then I run in and do bed and blow up and hopefully we can double up on our blow ups and thing so I line it off to the side I think I hope that my stuff wasn't incinerated in fire might have it might have gone that way no we're good we're good everything's fine it's all my stuff everything's fine there maybe I'll just you know I'll just uh I'm just gonna kind of do it from do from back up a little bit because I think it's it's I'm just too close to it and it does I mean if it I think that it's probably similar mechanics to the end stone or to the end crystals if we can okay so do you have more coming down okay it's coming down no no so you go for that one all right I got it whoa oh god oh god oh god damage to him unfortunately no they're not they're not sorry I I think I landed and then threw my under pearl-like in my panic oh yeah that that won't do it for ya no it wasn't it wasn't a saving thing all right oh dear right in the middle we need to double wammy him with beds from either side though like like you you hit one and I hit one simultaneously just the boom yeah although we might not hear the put them both down though like we're kind of observed observe your procedure so I've got a I've got a better idea of what you're going for here a bed or idea Hey okay here he comes it comes okay well I can't do much with all the purple crap sure you can here we go boys I have no girls he he took off as soon as you damaged him but that did a lot more damage on him than you had been okay good good good so many questions about about this fight right now but I'm thinking like I'm curious in the Reds closer roof the beds closer to what oh oh I see in the fountain to to the into the gentlemen oh I lost some stuff yeah it went in a fire fire well I lost my pitches and my helmet so you are the on bet here now here's your thank you yeah there's that oh he's coming in alright are you going for the hitter your money this now you you do it you're on ice - all right you go for it I'll go for it right after now no oh man we are making like he's taken yeah he's moving backwards and oh yeah yeah yeah that's it that's it damage dude that's a damn it okay definitely elevating an elevating up to him seemed to be helpful yep okay now hopefully my stuff isn't all gone again the best enderdragon fight that has ever been fought yeah this there's there's never been a more more ender fight I see your pick X is the most here oh wait my pickaxe Oh my iron one my iron one yeah yeah yeah oh here he is hmm I don't have a badge for kaboom gosh darnit hold still I like how you misplaced one of the bedrock though that's nice bedrock I can't place bedrock whatever obsidian is a grave grave difference grave and well ones gray so yes [Music] there's the there's the platform okay and there's bed all right come on buddy come on now my question is can you can you reach the bed from down here oh oh yeah like get under underneath here yeah oh you broke it it's too high don't it what a fool it's fine I can do this well oh that was a good spot look at that okay this is officially this is the place right here dude he's going down we've got this now this has been 35 minutes of the best fight anyone has ever seen that history the world so dragon fight ever but now coming from underneath he doesn't have a prayer oh here we go boys here we go look at that bite yeah wait can I do now oh I'm out of beds no I could've done another let me let me I'll gather up in stone for you do you stone Ian I I've got some obsidian two more if you feel like there's a spa we don't know I don't see a need for it currently but okay okay here we go boys here we go thank you for the raid Cara much appreciated he's coming in okay now he's all right all right here I got five more beds on the way he's still just gloating all right chill thank you it's fine oh no he did the one thing he knew how to do oh it's fine I'm actually below the surface of it so we're good night he did the one thing we couldn't have him do see coming in I wonder not yet not yet not yet so too high was too much no one find don't even worry about it we're chill we've got this no but I I'm just wondering if I can set up a bed on the opposite side have the two alright the airport oh that's gonna be bad yeah it's gonna hurt me a what an [ __ ] what an [ __ ] God he just keeps having this intelligence that's like nothing ever seen before it goddamn it God all right dance Oh like nothing ever seen before it wow you just he literally just splattered all over the place like he threads the needle freakin idiots I mean I guess when we're poking our head out like you just go nobody'll and it wasn't landed it on the proper elevation he's very hardly I can't even get it back he's he's definitely like scorched-earth around that every my god dude I can't get in because I don't have pickaxe to mine the stuff from one side holy crap okay yeah I got it I got it we're good okay we good all right okay okay hurry frickin go okay can you land mothertrucker here he comes yep oh god I'm so close got him nice we go okay and now we just need to replace a few I think like two more okay so he broke that one so we have to go we can't go any higher than that right there okay so you got that nice very concerned about making sure this is all constructed properly it's important we all got it we all good there we go and then cavern down here fairest way to the place I'm actually gonna mine steps down because then that will allow us to if he does do his little scorched earth purple oh he's coming in I think yeah yeah he is get it Oh didn't even do much I got it again I'm doing it again do it again yes I'm doing it again he's not there again yes heron he's gone okay so your explosion blue blue oh the other one that I had off that's what yeah there yeah okay let's try a little bit further away see if that old last and but otherwise the way of multiple beds feed them to you but this is it might be next round yep yep yep I'm just mining down a little bit more getting additional end stone and also places to retreat in case of purple purple he is coming hey I blew myself up but it's fine don't die hit him so I hit him several times okay I'll be right back oh yeah wow he's like one pixel yeah okay okay okay almost there boys almost there on the best ender dragon fight that's ever been fought are we are we doing it with beds this time or are we going for that hit I think we gotta keep it keep the dream alive embed it we got a bed everything on this one we're trying to bed the ender dragon guys dude all right okay all of them all the beds coming in right here dude all of them what was the logic you said all of them you would place three I was holding one in my hands I had to place the bed accepted the one you place that I was trying to pay it was bad timing okay it was bad timing that's all this it's not like I was like there's sleep in it it just it just you placed it right a see landing oh we gotta go we gotta go we we just missed the landing he's back up Oh God dang it okay my stuff wait what why do you take my stuff I'm just grabbing stuff and we'll figure it out back here okay really matter cuz yeah it doesn't matter that much there's pants there's your pants there's a sword here that's actually my sword if you want you have the sweeping edge one okay doesn't matter everything else is grainy there's some beds so I guess my my chest plate was or my legs were incinerated no oh wait could we fist punch I wonder you want to miss this point I mean he's nearly dead we have options here wonderific it fits okay yeah I've never beat a dragon with a fist your your actually your pants are right here so okay now you want hands-on be decent Oh punch him with a bed in hand that's the thing to do okay here we go boys here we go one are you one punch man can I have an ottoman yes yes here you can just lie on this bed wait where did you get I on boots I've had an boots what this is hair time out I didn't have boots I never had boots you should well I got 16 levels of experience I can do a lot okay you've got options one punch with the bed in hand as requested I delivered there's the gender dragon egg it was that was that was a fight that was an
