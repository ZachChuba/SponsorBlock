over the years we've tried every morning routine you could think of early morning yoga starting the day with a run drinking a glass of fresh-squeezed lemon water right after waking oil pulling for five minutes with coconut oil making celery juice taking the time to write in our journals working out with a simple strength training routine visualizing our goals using the law of attraction and a bunch of other crazy stuff all hoping to create a habit that could make us feel present grounded and creative but after all our experimentation there's only one habit we've been able to stick with every single day that is also transformed our mental health and that is meditation I recently posted a blog post on our Squarespace site that goes into more detail on how meditation changed our life if you're looking to create your own website I highly recommend using Squarespace but more on that later so we learned how to meditate from our friend Eddie Veera back in April of 2016 when we were still living in Berlin and ever since then we have meditated every morning for 20 minutes and if we're lucky every evening as well I'm not trying to say that those other habits aren't effective or that meditation is going to be this cure-all that solves all of your problems overnight but rather that finding something that you can actually commit to and do every day I think is the true key to supporting your mental health and for Lou and I it was really important that the thing that we chose didn't require any equipment didn't take up a lot of space and meditation turned out to be the perfect thing for that because you just get so much reward for the effort you put in and you can do it anywhere you can do it a tent in a van on an airplane visiting family and it's just this private space that we can cultivate for ourselves no matter where we are in the world let me make a graph to help explain this concept a bit so on the one axis will put effort and on the other axis let's put reward effort is a combination of things it's how much money time willpower or equipment a certain habit might require reward is simple it's basically how much a certain habit or practice affects your health and happiness so celery juice for example is incredibly healthy but unfortunately it takes a while to prepare and clean the juicer and it's expensive lemon water has some of the same benefits but it's much easier to make everyday and doesn't require electricity Yoga is somewhere in between though of course this is all totally subjective now meditation takes willpower at the beginning at least to establish the habit but it's free you can do it anywhere for any amount of time and the results are truly incredible but what I want to share with you today is actually another habit we've been developing for the past few months and that is a gratitude practice this takes almost no time or effort but can instantly make you feel more fulfilled and your recently on a trip through the Pacific Northwest you and I decided to tweak our morning routine just a little bit so instead of waking up and meditating for 20 minutes like we've been doing for the last two and a half years we decided to add sorry squirrel distracted we decided to add a moment of gratitude after our meditation where we each say three things that were grateful for and honestly I'm totally shocked by how such a small thing could change the positivity that we have in our daily life and it's been wonderful for our relationship because most mornings we argh one of the things that we're grateful for is just to have each other and to work together but yeah I thought that would today we could talk about the gratitude practice because I think when you think about it I like the chart that we showed you really for such little amount of effort you get so much reward and it can take less than a minute to think of three things that you're grateful for so my three tips for creating a gratitude practice which I know sounds very corny but I'm just gonna go with it so the first one is find a routine that works for you whether that's you think of things that you're grateful for on your commute to work or in the shower or write when you get up having something that you do at the same time every day makes keeping a habit much simpler my second tip would be to pick three things each day three has worked out really well for us it doesn't take much time at all and it kind of lets you like build up the practice as you're going so maybe when I wake up I'm like a grateful that I got to sleep well last night and then I can move forward I'm so grateful I get to work with my husband every day or I'm so grateful that we have time with my family right now or whatever whatever whatever it is that day for you but I think having three things allows you to kind of build up to something beautiful and my last tip my third tip would be have some gratitude that you do is keep in the back of your mind that are always available so when you have a bad day there you can figure out what you're grateful for you know let's say you wake up and everything is bad and you're late and you're stressed and who knows what other things are going wrong in your life it's important to be able to say like I'm grateful that I'm alive I am grateful that there's air I can breathe you know the simple things actually bring you the most pleasure and I think that sometimes those simple things are even on my best days what I'm most grateful for one of the moments that immediately taught us about credited it was coming back to the States after spending some time living in our pan life in Ooty is truly wonderful and I'm so happy we decide to live this alternative way but when we came back to my house there were a million things to feel grateful for little things that I took for granted were at every corner from turning up the thermostat when I was cold to flushing the toilet to taking a warm shower having a dishwasher or browsing the web with unlimited fast internet I think it's really easy in the Western world to have a great deal of comforts and not completely appreciate what a blessing they really are but it wasn't just material things being home we were able to cherish time with family and friends movie nights on comfy couches and epic board games in spacious living rooms next to cozy fireplaces big kitchen counters to cook together and make bread from scratch early-morning expeditions to the beach with new four-legged friends finally finally finally having a dog in our family and cherishing every moment with my new furry sister Wendy I'm eternally grateful for safe passage as we traverse through all that Mother Nature throws our way as we live out our lives on the
