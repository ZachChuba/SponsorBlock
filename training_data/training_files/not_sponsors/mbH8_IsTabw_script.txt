let me tell you a goofball this is not how I imagined adult life well what do you mean well apart from spending most of it plagued with terrifying anxiety soul-crushing depression crippling loneliness and terrible debilitating neck pain it's also just incredibly boring I mean here we are a couple of young people it's Saturday night and we're just lying on the couch watching TV in the dark we are young people well we are kind of young and we're kind of people I don't get it you came in here you turn the movie on you turn the lights off you sat down and you started watching it and now you're complaining about it because I wish I was doing something else like what don't you know the kind of things the young people do goofball they go to concerts herb they go on road trips or to music festivals or go camping or play guitar as they sit around a bonfire on the beach at night making memories falling in love but I never got to do any of that stuff you only get to be young once and I blew it you know I've been to music festivals and let me tell you Coachella is not great 125,000 people all using the same ten porta-potties the music sucks although the metallurgies are usually pretty fun you're missing the point goofball it doesn't have to be that specifically well then what are you talking about I'm talking about fun goofball surely you've heard of fun well I never get to have fun you can't tell me there aren't people out there having fun I know they do it I've seen it on Instagram I want to be one of those people one of the fun have errs well what's fun to you

going to allow yourself to enjoy something and for once in your life stop being so neurotic allow myself to enjoy something relax it's gonna be okay just allow yourself to enjoy something allow myself to enjoy something oh wow myself to enjoy something whoa it's like the pattern on the rug is moving and it's like the pattern on the rug is moving it's like the pattern on the rug it's moving it's like hey goofball have you noticed that it looks like the pattern on the rug is moving well enjoy the pattern on the rug moving then oh and by the way guess what what Wow you just made a scary face at me no I didn't well it looked like you did are you sure you weren't just looking in a mirror [Laughter] lighten up creep it's a party all right well I guess this isn't too bad hey at least we didn't

it's the astral plane of Ascension so I don't know eternity oh is that all and to think I was worried well look on the bright side creep at least you get to spend eternity with your best buddy goofball yeah that sounds like my luck all right let me tell you goofball you just keep finding new ways to take me out of my comfort zone don't you well I don't see how any of this is my fault you don't see how this is your fault are you insane are you just completely delusional do you have a single iota of logic or reason in your dumb empty head you know creep I have a feeling that you and I are destined to do this forever no no no don't say you and I are destined to do this forever goofball don't say it well what choice do we have now we're in the damn astral plane of ascension well that doesn't mean I have to talk to you in fact I'll stay here you can go over there and I don't want to hear another peep out of you for the rest of eternity I'm already lonely hahaha I miss my big warm squishy creep I'm not engaging in this conversation who dares to trespass the realm of the clockwork and we are the clockwork outs and you are unlawfully encroaching into our domain the clockwork elves yes we toil endlessly behind the scenes of physical existence forever tending to the intricately balanced inner mechanisms of the multiverse to keep the fabric of reality from falling apart you're welcome I believe the words you're looking for oh you must be the guys Joe Rogan's always talking about is it true you gave him the finger yes we flipped him the bird I guess you can say that fear was not a factor for us well you're supposed to tell us the ultimate cosmic truth right hey yeah that's right you tell us the ultimate cosmic truth and then when we wake up we can't remember it for some reason which makes the story really frustrating to hear for anybody that we tell it to you know we are sick of you Earthlings just waltzing in and demanding the ultimate cosmic truth as if we aren't always busy you know what with keeping the fabric of reality from falling apart and all but you guys do know everything right of course we are the clockwork elves all right what can I ask did Bill Cosby really do all that stuff yeah I can't believe you were still holding out hope for Cosby what kind of a sucker are you well if Michael Jackson fans can still be in denial about Michael Jackson then how come I can't be in denial about Bill Cosby he was my favorite comedian goofball well your favorite comedian is a serial rapist you callable Nimrod you know goofball you really are something even when we're in the astral plane of Ascension and we're about to get the ultimate cosmic truth from the damn clockwork elves you still have to find ways to insult me oh god it's getting worse well if you hate it so much then why don't you leave but not until I get the ultimate cosmic truth when I fail to see her it's any of your business listen you nerd give me the damn ultimate cosmic truth or else I'm gonna kick your ass all right come here and I'll whisper to you of course it all makes sense now what all makes sense I don't remember well I was one heck of a short eternity not short enough if you ask me especially since I don't recall asking for my Saturday night to be hijacked by hallucinogens I can't believe you're still belly akin you said you wanted to have a new experience and you just met the damn clockwork elves experiences don't get much newer than that hmm I suppose that was a pretty unique adventure goofball and I have you to thank for it I guess living with a cartoon ghost can have its advantages yeah and hey guess what what I knew that was you I knew that you did that [Music] today's auto-generated insult is brought goofball - 500 500 trust me you're not gonna regret it get snarfed you lard barf - arf-arf a narf [Music] burn BOTS run a search on clockwork Elf rule 34 damn this girl looking thick no no don't be ridiculous how do I turn this
