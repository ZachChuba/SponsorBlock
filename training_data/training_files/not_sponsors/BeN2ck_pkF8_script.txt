old man from draenor village if you don't already know the wise old man is the npc that gives out the quest cape so he holds a very special place in my heart wise old man used to be known all around the world this quest revolves around giving him his last hurrah before he retires we're heading all the way north of the map up to piscatora's fishing colony this young lady kathy corkett has a boat here it should take us right next to the colony she's devastated and crying i'm not sure what's going on i don't have time for this it's very dangerous up there lucky for me the ring on my finger makes me very charming i called her a beautiful lady now she's gonna put her life in danger and take me for free it's a very cool ring i highly recommend it all right here we are herman caranos lovely day isn't it the [ __ ] is wrong with this guy's face what is that oh it's a pipe his character's model's moving they definitely just made a stationary pipe it is not a part of his character model it's just literally floating in the sky where his mouth slightly is sometimes his beard matches his boots i don't like this he said he's looking for an experienced adventure to help him out sounds exactly like me let's have a look at you go ahead baby 213 quest points it's really rather a lot that's right it's literally the max you can have up to this point in my universe you were born today this is your first day alive that must be very cool for you this whole place was evacuated because they're having a sea troll problem he said even though i'm a qualified adventurer we need a truly expert adventure i've been the guild of legends he's telling me to stop blowing my own trumpet dot dot dot [ __ ] that's all i have to say to you he's telling me the wise old man of draenor is who we need what do you want with him oh you know him yeah he robs banks he's a criminal oh here we go i'm not your mate oh my god it just you know what actually respect though cause i would totally do that too yeah yeah i did that i just realized unless there's quests that i don't know about i've done the same amount of quests as the wise old man i am just as good of an adventurer as him okay actually i haven't killed this thing never mind people did not solo that thing in 2006 if they did they were maxed hey it's dad from the troll quest oh sit down okay let's go get this guy this dude makes me so uncomfortable all the time jesus christ he's just staring at me what the [ __ ] i told him the fishing colony wanted to help and he's like oh they remember me after all i'm so good and handsome and i just [ __ ] yawned in his face oh my god he's gonna make this his swan song the last who raw the big bang before his retirement he wants 10 lavaroons 10 missed runes and 5 blood runes luckily i made those things earlier combination runes are pain in the ass to make but i got it out of the way this guy knows how to dress got at least seven girlfriends i gave him the runes he's gonna meet me over at the colony he's telling me to arm myself because it could be dangerous bring food remember to bring food [ __ ] [ __ ] something about this guy just throws me off i can hear creatures moving around in the trees they're sea trolls they're not gonna be in the trees oh yeah big stretch i think something's coming ah would it be those [ __ ] things here they come yes let's get after it see strafing what's the strat here what are you doing you know you don't need to do that they're not attacking you you don't need a strafe you're losing ticks i'm out of runes what do you mean you're out of runes did you just bring the ones i gave you i gave you like 15 runes they're not gonna last very long you knew we'd be fighting [ __ ] they never stopped did you just what did you just throw he's throwing rocks at them he's throwing rocks hitting zeros and then they aggro me when he hits him this is so messed up got em all finally good god please go tell herman i'm here okay i guess we're gonna go find this guy there he is uh oh [ __ ] k did you bring the wise old man i did i don't know where he's was he just invisible standing next to him the entire time this dude's a psychopath so there's only like two dudes left in the entire town one of them is the owner of the general store over here so we're gonna go help him out my man arnold here wants help restocking the general store we just need to get him five monkfish so technically i can start fishing monkfish now uh but i'm just probably not gonna ever do that i'm gonna get this guy his five and then only come back here if i'm absolutely desperate for it oh my god hello i like how i catch like two monkfish every six hours here but i still have to fight these trolls in between i love this oh what a big big big big [ __ ] dude i'm so good at video games it's ridiculous look i am destroying this thing i've never hit better in my life and we got them all baby god damn it he wants them cooked there's no one here to buy cooked ones they're gonna go bad i'm gonna burn at least four one look two here comes the big four okay all right well i need to get two more now so i'll see you tomorrow dude i've been here for so long i'm not gonna do this anymore i got two i was gonna get like another four but i've been here for so long i just can't catch them please don't burn it thank you thank you so much dude video games that's all i gotta say video games yeah you're welcome arnold no problem yeah i didn't hate that now we gotta help frankie cool i get to fix a wall look at me i know how to do this i know what i'm doing i'm putting metal down i'm i'm cracking smashing [ __ ] sucking all right i figure while we're this early into the episode and i have a little sanity left i'm gonna go ahead and say there's not gonna be a song this episode i really appreciate your guys support on all the songs i do most of the songs are just a product of me not wanting to edit and procrastinating so i just go and do an entire other project and that's how it always is and there's just sometimes i don't really feel like making a song and even though the songs are really fun to do they're not the main point of this series i plan on doing songs in the future a lot they're not gonna be in every episode and this series is a whole lot more than that that being said i still have no words for my appreciation of you guys listening to that stuff i get comments every video asking to put it on spotify they're all there under buy release usually the songs get up on spotify about a week after the episode comes out and i think that's about it so yeah [ __ ] you no song today i make songs when i want to make songs let's go fix a goddamn wall i think the sexiest trait about me is my ability to fix anything what has someone told me to fix that i haven't you know walls fences uh bridges i don't know i fix [ __ ] dude so apparently the wise old man has come up with a big plan to get rid of the trolls he wants us to combine forces and take down all the trolls at once the thing is is there is no force we have nobody here there's two people that haven't evacuated this place and clearly neither of them can fend for themselves so i have to recruit an entire goddamn army where do i start with that i don't know but guess what it's runescape people know magic we're gonna go see if any magicians want to poof up an army or something so this is the wizard they wanted me to talk to because he's got these zombies down here he knows how to make them and produce them in mass quantities it would be super convenient for this guy to help me out but since he thinks in a way that isn't completely psychotic he knows that it's a bad idea to do that so he is not wanting any part of this so instead of going about this the smart way we're going to do some sketchy [ __ ] and talk to sketchy people which is kind of more up my alley you guys probably remember this dude from fairy tale he's a sketchy necromancer guy he could care less what anyone thinks about what he does and that's just the kind of guy we need he's got these bone seeds when i put them in a pod unpack them they'll spawn skeleton mages and they'll fight who we want him to fight he wants me to go ask the master craftsman in the crafting guild what the best way to hold the seas will be which is going to be an airtight pot which i already have but i like talking to people i don't mind you need to chill out more dude you know what i actually i needed that right now thank you also holy [ __ ] this man is high as [ __ ] look how high he is this dude is baked oh my god okay he's gonna put the seeds in our pot now we just have to open it when we need them uh okay i didn't realize i was getting teleported here that's kind of convenient but but also can i bank here please let me bank oh my i didn't know who's gonna teleport me here i don't have enough food can i take him on with this amount of food one swordfish can i take this thing on whatever dude i'm not a [ __ ] i'm doing it i'm ready let's fight this is going to go so well nothing's going to go wrong here oh yeah how do they know who to attack boo yeah get him the trolls aren't even hitting back zero casualties flawless victory the trolls are dead that was like seven of them i could have done that oh god sea troll general huh leave this to me okay no complaints from me oh my god did you see that how do you do that what happened to him running out of runes where was this when i had all those trolls attacking me earlier i wish i could just pull out some rocks start chucking them from the sidelines like he did this thing's health bar is dense thank god he's doing what that doesn't add up my guy's kissing his ass now and uh oh okay i can't move you must fight this for me dude if that just hit a 254 i'm [ __ ] how convenient for you i'm happy you don't have to do as much i'm already hit a 17. if it hits me with magic i'm fine okay so maybe if i run back and forth uh it's got to do magic and where's my prayer my prayers off my prayer is off it's working it has to hit me with magic uh my prayer is gone oh my god i just realized it's actually draining my prayer oh my god i have no food left fight to the death [ __ ] it's me and you let's see what you've got yeah video games i'm good at them don't you forget it i don't really know what happened to its attack that hit a 254 i'm glad it didn't pull that one on me but you know what i beat it and we saved this whole place i think hopefully i don't know i'm just begging for the wise old man's hat as if he's gonna give it to me man i remember everyone being so pissed off that he had that hat just knowing that he killed someone in the drainer bank and stole it that's why my guy is begging for it yeah we can catch monkfish now and there we go way to capitalize the skill names but hey that's uh some good xp baby let's keep on this momentum we're on a roll on to the next one may 22nd 2006 quest 106 royal trouble we're going back to the kingdom of miscellaneous which is going to be incredibly awkward because i have not been here in months i have not tended to the people i have not checked in on how they're doing i have not seen my wife i've done nothing productive for this place this guy's gonna spit on my shoes when i pass by him hi hey oh god that's a lot of weeds that is not a good looking farm this is the most awkward part i have to pass by my wife's room actually i'm gonna go the other way i'm not gonna pass by her room we're gonna play this smart don't talk to me don't look at me grim don't talk loud she can't know i'm here okay greetings royal hi shut up shut up shop what the [ __ ] it would appear that war is about to break out because i haven't been here to control anything i leave for a little bit everything goes to [ __ ] what do you know grimm wants me to talk to the prince and princess to find out more about the situation princess astrid's been asking about you oh perfect just groaning outside her door all right let's do this welcome back my dear oh oh you don't want me killed you haven't managed to find a priest for our marriage anyway uh how do we stop war what's going on there we're talking in this room i guess can't be alone that's fine first and foremost who broke that chair what happened they're saying that they want to declare war on each other all the time the island's a [ __ ] show per usual their suggestion is that we get the king here and the queen there to marry each other uh even though they want to kill each other but we somehow make that happen it's not a very good plan it's not gonna work i'm gonna have to figure this out on my own oh my name is jarton here i forgot they don't know me for real these people know absolutely nothing about me and i like that i could get a second wife if i wanted to but i'm not gonna do that i don't really want one wife let alone two what the holy white ass king vargas is telling me people around the town have had their stuff stolen and wants us to figure out what's going on yeah okay don't look at me when i'm talking to you it's not like i'm the king or anything you're saying some soldiers from the other side came over and stole a bunch of stuff neither side has any organization let alone an army so this story doesn't really add up i'm gonna go talk to the queen on the other side and see what's going on she's saying people over here are claiming that we stole stuff from them there's just not consistency here something's up i have to keep investigating all this running around got me thinking hear me out what if you know all these people on both sides of the island just kind of disappeared i mean clearly they're not going to amount to anything the only reason nature hasn't taken them out naturally is because they're on this island they're not doing anything for anyone and if i had this island to myself i'd have all these resources i'd have a cozy place two castles let's see what this guy has to say yeah this guy's saying soldiers on our side stole stuff this is just a [ __ ] show i would make a lot better used to this island that's all i'm saying that's all i'm saying oh excuse me sir there is uh there's something on your foot it's a dead bunny have a good day the miscellaneous quests have such an obnoxious amount of running around let me speed us through this to move along quicker grims had to talk to the sailor to see if anyone from outside the island has been around he said to ask the king about the relica teenagers in a dungeon the king said yeah there's teenagers and there's a dungeon i went to that dungeon i talked to a dwarf in a bar who gave me a stick yup i went inside a little cave and built a pulley system to lift me up deeper into a cave and then i continued the investigation well well well what do we have here a charred diary rated at your own peril if you steal this book my dad will beat you up [ __ ] i'm sorry more fire more pages it belongs to some relic teenagers going through the fremanic trials what are they doing down here those trials must have changed a lot why they make so many fires so close to each other what are they doing oh they're talking about me here they wanted to make peace with these kingdoms but i already did it and i married the daughter maybe it's way cooler than i thought it was yeah the teenagers dressed up as soldiers and stole people's [ __ ] they tried to start a war so that they could pretend to make peace these kids are starting to piss me off oh there they are look at them they're trying to [ __ ] up my kingdom the funny thing is is i've already passed my fremanic trials i have jurisdiction over them i'll have them publicly executed someone's coming hey it's me byron lee i found your diary yeah i read the whole thing you know only little cry baby babies writing diaries right yeah i'm gonna tell your dad about it too and how you dotted the eyes with hearts oh he's gonna love it their big plan to save the kingdoms got ruined by a big snake at the end of this tunnel i should be thanking the snake but instead i'm just gonna kill it should be through here oh there it is hey what's going on i don't think this fight's gonna be nearly as adrenaline pumping as the last one man i have gotten strong 22 23 the strength training is paying off man i i am unstoppable shh it's okay it's okay they wow that was violent hey a box that's uh i'm guessing this has all the people's stolen [ __ ] in it maybe all right let's get out of here tell the queen and king and uh put some teenagers on trial huh just told the queen a bunch of teenagers did it i got everyone's stuff back so she gave me 20k and a letter to take to the king i just got back to the king apparently that letter was talking about how she actually has a crush on him and stuff and how they're not that different and they should join forces so i guess they're gonna get together after all which is great for me except it would appear that not only now i need to manage miscellaneous but also that [ __ ] over there too but i do get more resources so i guess that's fine but i don't use this enough i should probably start using this again we did it we're awesome i'm gonna go ahead and call it there i know this is a shorter episode but i couldn't fit the next one in without delaying the episode another week the next two quests are going to give us access to the dorkishan crossbow and fairy rings so i'm getting pumped up catch those guys if i'm gonna leave you with one thing today just remember i am a god at video games you
