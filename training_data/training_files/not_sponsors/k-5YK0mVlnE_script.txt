on today's drive we are going out on the trip to a mall I got to pick up some stuff and we're gonna be on a bunch of different roads not any freeways though right now we might come back or freeway but we're gonna be ended up kind of testing out a little bit where things are at we've gotten quite a few updates lately and we see a lot more coming we have the dot sixteen coming out soon which is going to really be nice in terms of you know one of the questions we get all the time on this channel is how do we format you know the SD card well this trips cannot you know not long after this update when you plug your little flash drive into your car it's going to automatically format it and get it all ready to go everything you need so that's that's the rumor anyway so that that'll be nice and anyway so it's a lot of great stuff coming up you know for for Tesla but you know one thing that that I have to be aware of and one thing I want to talk about today is is is this this latest update that brought the streets and and lights onto the system and by the way today is going to be a rapist drive so we haven't done this in a while we're gonna do it again here so well here we go put the rate this drive system up here and for those you who are new here's how it works okay we start off with the cars at zero and if the car does something that I think is like well that was kind of dangerous that was not good I knock it down this way if it does good egg wiggle this way and the idea is that each Drive we wanted to end up on the positive side and so that'll work great now the times that I knock at two points are when auto pilot has to be taken off completely I have to hit the brake or I have to steer somehow these blue lines go away or this you know this blue circle goes away and if you're new to the channel how you know if I am on autopilot or not is if these lines show up as well as this line here that means that I am currently in autopilot now if this is blue here but these aren't blue that means that I am in regular cruise control you can be in cruise control but not be an autopilot and if you're in autopilot and cruise control the whole combo everything is blue one two three all are blue that means you're in full autopilot which by the way if you're on regular autopilot like I am now using stop sign streetlight recognition what happens is you can only go the speed limit you can't go any fast you see nothing's going faster but if we are just in regular old what do you call that bad I just said there were thousand times regular cruise control then you can go five over the speed limit still it's really just in autopilot you're restricted temporarily here for 50 to 50 miles an hour or the speed limit and so here's the thing with that Elon has said this is temporary it's gonna get better it drives me crazy but when anytime you see my speed going up it's because I am putting my foot on the accelerator like this and I am telling it to go faster than the speed limit okay so for example I'm going over the speed limit but you can see autopilot has not disengaged so you can still go over the speed limit like I mentioned in a previous video without disengaging autopilot so anyway we got a bit of a drive here and we're gonna experience as much stuff as we can on this drive we're gonna talk about it you definitely dipl√¥me unnie on that total totally cool so what you're experiencing right now is there's two things that would stop the car so we've got the stopping for traffic control I'm 30 or 300 feet which case I'm gonna press in the accelerator which is gonna make me go through it but if that car in front of me had stopped it would have stopped there as well you know just pick up the car stop so what's interesting is let's say that I had stopped maybe three car lengths behind the stoplight what would happen is they would go but then my car would go up to that stop line and stop again even though the light turned green because the green light is not what's making my car go when everything goes it's either me moving the gear stock here which overrides the you know me telling it to stop or or you could press in the accelerator and that will do it as well so I'm gonna I'm gonna perform what's called the manual and change so I'm gonna put the gear stock up here it tells it to go toss me the lane I'm going into and it's gonna find its way over there you see I did a little bit of a swerve kind of thing there the car behind me I just got over now but the card behind me was coming up pretty quick and it saw that so it wasn't a hundred percent confident so it kind of got to the line went away again saw it was clear and then went in and you know what I wondered I wondered if Tesla did that to kind of let the person know hey I'm coming over there's kind of your warning of a thing I mean the blinker is supposed to do that too but you know I find it does it that sometimes when the car is pretty close back there that it's pretty common to see it actually do that so so right here I'm going exactly this building because the autopilot is maxed to do that I am incapable of driving directly on the speed limit so I will be going by five over but I have to do it manually with the accelerator so my foot is down there putting me over now you know it's interesting so I'm gonna drop back here at 50 miles an hour I wanted to just kind of test this because it seems like when I accelerate over the the max speed though now the max speed means the max autopilot will let you go well on autopilot it's not the max you can go it's just saying car go up to this speed okay so what my question is if I pressing the accelerator is it gonna tell me to touch the steering wheel again because it seems like it keeps doing that so my hand is already on the wheel as it usually sits down here on the bottom left I'm just resting on it adding a little bit of pressure what happens if I accelerate here okay okay okay that's what popped up it says auto steer speed restricted to 50 miles per hour because that is the speed limit and if you ever wondering what the car thinks is the speed limit it's written right there or it displayed right there now there's a lot of issues with the speed limits right now on Tesla's menu guys I'm sure I already know it tends to be it really depends on what road you're on and all this stuff but lots of roads it's just simply wrong it says it's 35 when it's 45 you know just like I have no speed limit sometimes at all then the car goes to having like 40 like on our road by my house it's really strange but Elon has recently said I don't know when if you guys know and you feel like that's important go ahead and comment on it but just recently that they're working on it they know the maps have issues they're working on it and that should be getting an update here soon which is going to be great because it's really hard to trust your car and autopilot when it doesn't always know the speed now let me just clarify that I mean like 90 percent of the time it's right but that 10% is really awkward so you just gotta be aware of that especially when you're in a spot you get like a ticket or something like that now guys let's watch this here I am coming up to the stoplight okay and so the car is going you know fairly aggressive up to it and that's one thing you're gonna have to get used to when you get in your new Tesla is that you're gonna feel like I would be slowing down sooner than this if I was the one driving no I want to point something else here to see how that red line right there where the stop line is is dark red you see that you can see that on there okay when you have accelerator or the gear stock okay then that will go gray and that lets you know that the car knows it can go through the light so for example if I go like this look how it turns light gray that means that the car now knows it does not need to stop for that stoplight once these cars all start moving so now when when this car in front of me the Subaru goes my car is gonna start going and then I'll go right to the light but like I said earlier if I didn't do that and we'll show you this on a future light if it didn't do that it would stop at the light as well cuz right now the green lights are not what's making me go so the car is on its own going I'm not pressing on the accelerator right now it's doing this all on its own it's gonna go through this big intersection and it did stop there and look at see how look like the the green lights are glowing that's a that's a newer feature with this latest update as well which is really great because I'm colorblind right so it was hard for me to see the stoplights and I apologize guys I don't have my other camera on here today I just didn't feel like it anyway here's another stoplight again it's green and it's making me sit was making me stop there because again like I said I'm like a broken record already it does not read the lights yet okay it knows it's there they know the lights are there but as a real so now I'm gonna press in the accelerator and obviously what's going to happen is my max speed of 50 miles an hour is gonna put me right up in the backend of this whatever you call this thing garbage truck so once again I'm gonna do a manual lane change I'm gonna press on my blinker it's gonna create the Lions you don't need to use hands nothing that's going to do it all on its own it'll fight in the spot it'll look all around the car make sure that there's no one there when it's safe it's gonna pull me right on over super cool now the reason why I head into a manual in the car didn't just get over on its own is because we are not on a freeway okay so if we are on a freeway or highway and would've done it on its own so once again it's telling me it's gonna slow down and as soon as I get to 400 trainer feet here it's gonna start slowing me down so I tapped on the accelerator and here we go through the light it knows it can go through that stop line turns light gray instead of red and again I'm color blind so that might not actually be now we're getting dropped down to 40 miles an hour here which no one goes so it might be dark gray I'm not sure you guys tell me what the color of that stop line is and then I'll just know for the future I can't really see a lot of the colors so interesting now so I mean here my thing is it's working really great and I'm pretty excited I'm pretty excited about these these updates and and I'm pretty excited I'm pretty impressed just at the rate in which they're sending out these little updates to us now for those of you who are new when my screen just got blue up here that means that my hand was not putting enough pressure on the wheel I keep it resting down here in the seven o'clock seven to eight o'clock position on the steering wheel that's the universal agreed-upon I think way a place to put your hand and it basically because it's easier to rest your hand there your shoulders don't get tired and it puts pretty constant pressure on it but if you find that your hand is sliding down to like the six o'clock position then that becomes a problem because then you're no longer putting pressure on the wheel to kind of turn it a little bit it's more just pulling straight down on it and then sometimes that will happen so you just kind of move through your hand a little further over to the seven o'clock to seven and a half range and you're usually just fine for keeping enough pressure on the wheel and if I remember that I can usually go my entire drive without ever seeing that symbol but that's what that is that's why I started flashing blue if you're watching this or learning about your tester for the first time that's what that's all about we'll be doing an autopilot video here in the tutorial series we've had a great success so far I hope you guys are liking them I've tried to keep my extremely simple write to the point so that you guys are anybody who's looking for information can come in and type in a simple one topic and get right to it not ten things in a video but one thing two to four minute video real quick and just get right in there get it done so obviously there's tons of them to make and I'm working on it but on the same hand like many of you guys who have children I'm also homeschooling all day long you know my normal business my trading business so as you guys are well been noticed I'm it's really hard for me to keep up on all the comments I get 50 to 100 comments a day on the channel and so I went from checking my my youtube channel at Ferb's comments three times a day to like once every two to three days so please bear with me I'll just do my best to keep the videos coming I'm not gonna be that great on replying to the comments because they're just all my responsibilities but I'll try to keep you guys entertained and the tutorials come in the best I can how are you guys all doing by the way I mean I love to hear from you guys like you know with those you guys who have kids are you guys how's a homeschooling coming like we're having a good time teaching our kids stuff but I don't know about you guys know I can't wait for my kids to go back to school I mean wow so okay so now I'm gonna have to take over so I turn the steering wheel now watch this though see how that's still blue this is something you guys need to be very very aware of if you're new because this goes scare you a little bit okay it's blue which means that these guys go my car is still gonna go forward and it's gonna do that because it's still in cruise control adaptive cruise control which means it adapts to the car in front of you which is that gigantic why can't I remember garbage truck it's only if I hit the brake that it will disengage the whole system steering wheel disengage the auto steering which is why there's no blue lines here or the steering wheel here's not blue but until I hit the brake like this that will stay blue like that so if I put an autopilot that's what everything looks like an autopilot I touch the steering wheel autopilot turns off that stays on the cruise control if I hit the brake then it all turns off okay so right like you don't want to scare yourself so just be a little bit careful with that okay so now we're getting back onto the freeway and you can now that were on a freeway we can go over the speed limit we can accelerate is now I'm going I got it set for ten over the speed limit there I'm actually gonna back that down to five over so we're in emerg lane right now okay so the car knows we need to get over one we're in what's called navigate on autopilot which means that the car now knows what we're going and because that it can navigate itself so it's gonna use its gonna change lanes that says in order to follow the route it knows I can't get over because there's a car there so if we spin this around here you can see that what it's looking at you can see where it wants to put me and as long as my hand is putting pressure on the wheel it's going to accelerate there so you hear it you saw that punch the accelerator and gets me right over in my lane but you know it's interesting because at first I was kind of wondering like well why do they take away the two lanes to get to blue lines and give you just one when you're on navigate an autopilot which never get an auto probably you only have if you paid for the full self Drive package okay you don't have it otherwise so if you if you see it like this and you have a destination and the cars that's okay no we were trying to go and then you're able to actually go there now I'm gonna do something real quick so there we go we're now navigating back to my house we're gonna do a full full lap here and we're in this weird in this great navigate an autopilot setting so it's gonna change lanes for me it's gonna take exits for me it's gonna be great it's gonna be awesome we're gonna be getting over here we know that because it says upcoming lane change top right we see that we have to take an exit point eight miles and then on the big screen here you see that grey line right there that shows that eventually were going to be getting over and the exit is coming up now and almost half a mile and so we'd like the car to get over but it hasn't indicated that it wants to yet so now that we're in point five miles away it's getting a signal for it and we can see that there is a car there you can tell that because it makes it red the car knows it as well and it's gonna eventually decide to just go for it here so there it goes you can feel the wheel turn and we're in the lane and you know what I love that the car shows you where it's gonna end up it just really helps build the confidence in your car and you know that's the biggest question I get is how do you use Auto piles talking to a lady the other day and Sears says navigating autopilot unavailable and 400 feet that's because we've exited the freeway autopilot is still available but navigating well on autopilot is not available so now we go to regular autopilot the car is still driving so you hands are out here it's still doing it all itself I am making it faster than it usually would go because it goes way too slow and on an exit ramps and all that so I am making it go a little bit faster so check out how it followed this car into the right lane how great of a job was that I was super good but we are gonna stop here because we're at a light and even if I put my throw on the accelerator well it's gonna stop because my foot Margo cuz I puts on the accelerator see there goes see there's my indicator and we're good to go so here we go I'm now a hundred percent driving cruise control is on but it doesn't mean anything right now because I'm still on the accelerator okay so I'm gonna put it back into autopilot it's gonna put me to navigate an autopilot and it's gonna tell me these and get me out of this excellent because it knows I shouldn't be here plus they're going slow so what's gonna happen here as soon as it sees an opening it's gonna go this makes me nervous so cuz we're going super slow and they're going super fast and this is where I get nervous with autopilot is because I haven't actually tested this a ton but we're gonna to see what it's gonna do here so like right now it could go there's a big gap there but will it see it's it's uber conservative I also have my lane changing set to average so it's not being very aggressive but let's just see when it's gonna actually go because of those speeds you could tell that it's being very very very cautious in fact I might have to take over and force my way out here but I'm just curious to see yeah that's gonna make me take this exit if I jumped oh here we go it's gonna take it right after this one go go do it do it do it come on you got all the time in the world finally alright yeah so it's super unaggressive right there and that's that's you know whatever it's fine but look at this so here's how you check this out you go into autopilot settings look at this guy you go to autopilot settings and customized autopilot and you have your speed base lane changes here you have mine set of average you can go to Mad Max I don't have it there because I don't know like when you're when it's traffic time of the day it just it just makes you move too much so I like average it seems to be pretty good but I have done Mad Max a ton I did it for the first four months of having that option and then for require lane changes I have set set to no don't require them which means that as long as I'm touching the wheel it's gonna automatically change lanes for me again assuming you have the full South Drive package and then I say you know lane change notifications I have both so it's going to vibrate the steering wheel and it's going to make it a noise when that's gonna do it so that's where I have my settings set up but there's a lot of really great things right now about owning a Tesla and I think that for those of you guys who are new the you got to spend time look at this see how this car saw it need to get it that's the genius of our autopilot system I mean that the car acted exactly I don't know this is a rate that's drive and I haven't been going up and down but you're we're gonna give it points like I'm gonna go like three points right there because the car hasn't made any mistakes but it's not super well on all these Lane changes it's done super well on so many different things we're gonna give it we're gonna give it us three there because it just deserves it man that got car coming in it saw it very uh aggressively slowed down let them in it didn't try to you know be a jerk I mean look at how well I got into this Lane in preparation for the exit were about to take like this is brilliant this is absolutely incredible and and this is what it's like to own a Tesla in today's day and age and then this beautiful Nico is my guys name machine like this thing like this is only getting better you know I spent sixty three thousand dollars buying this car I've bought 60,000 cars my last two were the same and guess what they both made me bored within a month maybe two months okay and there are pretty cool cars I still cannot wait to drive this car you guys anyway it's been fun drive with you guys today hope you enjoyed this Drive those you who are new put timing the car put lots of time into it get used to this thing it's more than just a car it's a amazing piece of your life now enjoy it I'll see you guys on the and subscribe to the channel if you want to see more and more content so here's what you can expect every week my goal is to put out three videos the next one in the tutorial series an autopilot driving challenge video as well as a product review so now I just believing in me and supporting this channel and if you're looking for some while you're tricking out your car thanks again and see you soon
