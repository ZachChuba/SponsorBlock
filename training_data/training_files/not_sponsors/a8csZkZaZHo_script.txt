and i i kind of made a little following i started playing grand theft auto and h1z1 under that name but then i i really wanted to change the name up because the name was based off of my gamer tag which my 10 year old sister made yeah and the name was dragon slayer and i was like you know i already have a gamer name and i've been and i used that name on twitch as well i was dragon slayer on twitch and it just was not me and back then you couldn't change your twitch name so i had to make a whole new account and that's when i became ad underscore pt because i didn't want a long name i've always hated like a long name um dragon slayer dragon slayer that was it was a microsoft generated name because she she really liked dragons at the time and there's no way in hell it was like dragon underscore space capital s lowercase upper like 96 something bluff and she's not born in 96 so why would she ever use the number 96 and there was just so many weird parts to it true [Music] wow i never tell anyone this so you guys got a special treat today [Music] so i wanna ask you about something what's that mr sqc yes how did you guys meet we met for the first time actually in a game of overwatch yeah um i was on dps he was on tank and he didn't really talk the whole defense because in in overwatch there's two sides we started on defense and we were all playing doing stuff whatever didn't really talk because he was streaming um at least i assumed i didn't really know him at the time and he just tunes in at the end of our defense because we had a really terrible defense and he goes you guys are all dog [ __ ] and we were just like i started laughing and i was like true and then we went on to attack and nobody talked because everyone was in a bad mood because he flamed everyone and then we lost and then he was like please everyone just everyone on this [ __ ] team just uninstall the game right now uninstall it just get don't even try and then he just left and that was the first time that i met him um which was a really odd chance because he played on east coast servers and i played on west coast yeah so we we pretty much never got in games because he was one a higher rank a little bit i was grand master he was top 500 um but the servers don't really mix unless they have to very romantic yeah and then what happened um and then he got signed to a professional overwatch team and he moved to california and i lived in california um about 45 minutes away from where he lived and him and i had never really interacted we had never really talked um i genuinely the only reason i knew him was that one game and one clip where he stood on his on his chair and he had a sword and he was using his keyboard as a shield and he said be gone t-h-o-t's i don't think i could say that on twitch anymore and i thought it was the funniest [ __ ] i'd ever seen and i remember sharing it with my friends at the time that i'm no longer friends with yeah and they were like [ __ ] him he is a piece of [ __ ] he's a he's a french canadian and we hate french canadians in canada [ __ ] him i [ __ ] hate him he said i'm a trash mercy player blah blah blah and i was like i thought it was funny i'm sorry you have all those issues yeah and i just moved on and i like i never watched twitch i only streamed the only person that i sometimes watched on twitch was tim the tatman yeah because he would always be streaming when i'd go to school but anyways what happened was he moved to california and he started playing in the professional overwatch league and i was friends with a lot of overwatch players a ton of them because i was a high-ranked female dps player which was not really a common thing back then yeah um so everyone pretty much knew my name they knew who i was in the high ranks and we would all go down to like um what it's not road house the yard house the the yard house restaurant yeah we'd all go over there after all the games we'd go out clubbing we'd go out doing karaoke and one night we went to it was me felix three other guys and two girls and we did karaoke and me and my friend are huge dualipa fans yeah so we put on the song be the one by doila you guys can look that up later but it's a very repetitive song and it just goes um i could be the one be the one be the one and it kind of says that a lot yeah and felix i was singing it alone because my girlfriend wouldn't join me and so felix picked up the mic and he started singing the whole thing with me and so we were singing that together so that's kind of like one of our favorite songs ever and we just started talking a lot i think we hung out till like seven in the morning there was some other stuff too there's a lot in between but for the most part this is how we really started to get to know each other was after that night oh it's so cute it was really cute wait so you guys are dating um we we've lived together for like three years it's it's almost about three years wait so you guys are dating um chat likes to say that we're just roommates that's what chad calls it that we're just roommates wait so you guys are just roommates that's what chad says so roommates well you're his caregiver [Music] absolutely not that's a funny one though they chad says that a lot too but i don't do all that does xcc who have really bad gas he farts a lot but nothing comes from them they're they're just like air they don't stink nothing that's really personal but it's just a fart oh my god he's got gone to your farts yeah thankfully because if he smells bad i
