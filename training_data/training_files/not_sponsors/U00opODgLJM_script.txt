many pokemon trainers asked the question is it worth it to buy a pokemon champions path elite trainer box the champion's path elite trainer box like the hidden fates version before it is a special edition elite trainer box unlike the regular elite trainer box which contains 8 booster packs and related accessories the champion's path version contains 10 booster packs a bunch of accessories and a special promo charizard v foil card it's also currently one of only a small number of products in which you can find booster packs of the champions path expansion set and as this is a special expansion and not one of the scheduled four standard sets we get every year we are unable to pick up boosters or booster boxes separately at retail your best bet is to pick up an elite trainer box but that's even if you can find one at all and when you do it might be marked up significantly is it worth it and for how much well let's take a look a note on pricing the champions path elite trainer box has an msrp of 49.99 15 higher than the regular edition this is largely tied up in the charizard v promo and the two extra booster packs though the product has been available at this price the huge early demand means that the market price for one of these boxes is around 90 to 120 dollars right now and steadily rising i had to spend 100 for this box that we're using in the video so where's all this markup coming from the demand is coming from pretty much one thing charizard if there's anything a pokemon collector loves it's charizards not only does this product come with a regular charizard v promo in the box but there's also a small chance to pull one of two chase cards from this expansion set the charizard v shiny alternate color secret rare and the charizard v max rainbow rare tcg player market price says that charizard v is 589.99 at the time this video was recorded with the latest sale on ebay being 505 charizard v max market price is 742 with the latest sale on ebay around 648. so that's why people want to open this set now honestly the chances of pulling these cards in 10 packs is pretty small you're looking at around one in every three packs at having an ultra rare at all and something like 1 in 125 packs to get one of these cards in particular just remember though opening 125 packs guarantees nothing that's not how math works i'm told this from reliable sources so is the special edition elite trainer box worth it should you bother getting one while prices are high and is there going to be a restock yes there is we'll talk about that restock in just a moment but first let's open up ours and see what we got the champions path elite trainer box contents are housed in a honestly pretty sweet looking charizard themed box the contents are held in place using a cardboard structure which is a clever way to ensure they don't move around too much in transit an elite trainer box contains 10 pokemon tcg champions path booster packs each of which contains 10 cards and one basic energy one full art promo card featuring charizard v 65 card sleeves featuring gigantomax charizard six damage counter dice one competition legal coin flip die and two acrylic condition markers there's also an energy pack of 45 assorted pokemon tcg energy cards a nice player's guide to the champion's path expansion the usual pokemon tcg rulebook and four dividers to keep everything organized if you choose to use the box itself for storage which yeah the box itself makes a great storage box and of course that code card for the pokemon trading card game online to redeem the contents currently champions path booster packs are selling for seven dollars each remember this is from a special set where we can't get booster boxes of so right off the bat having 10 of these that's 70 this is why it's selling above msrp the charizard v sword and shield promo card is going for about twenty to twenty five dollars i'll be conservative here and list it at twenty dollars and i'll do the same with the giganta max charizard sleeves which are worth about four to seven we can also put in about two to four dollars for the game accessories the energy card pack they go for about two dollars online the pokemon trading card game online code card is worth about a dollar so there's a few ways to add it up for example right now you can reasonably expect to pay about 10 to 11 on ebay for the contents of the box minus the booster packs and charizard promo so yes depending on how you crunch it there's a hundred dollars of value in this msrp of 50 box great deal obviously worth it except getting it for 50 isn't that doable and the current market price as i said is 90 to 120 dollars and rising the demand is outstripping the supply the product originally was released on september the 25th and since then it's pretty much been sold out everywhere like i said the box that you're seeing in this video i had to purchase for 100 which is actually pretty much what the contents are worth if i sold it all off why is this well there's two main reasons firstly a lot of people love charizard there are a lot of casual fans who love to collect them and a lot of more invested collectors who feel the need to add this to their collections when you add these people on top of the players who play the trading card game you end up with a lot of demand secondly resellers and scalpers know that these casual fans love charizard and when there's an opportunity to be had well people will have it and so a lot of the availability especially at big box stores is simply gone because one person walked in and bought all these up however though the initial wave of products has virtually sold out keep your eyes peeled for a restock we should see a restock of champions path elite trainer boxes before christmas and maybe as early as november for some parts of the world a second wave is coming and distributors are reporting that it'll likely be a healthy wave a big printing maybe even larger than the first and in addition to the restock there are other champions path products too there's a variety of box sets featuring promo cards and champions path boosters at various price points from the three booster gym themed pin collections to the larger premium pin collections there's a good range to choose from most of these products will be in store in october or november and are another avenue in which to get those sought-after booster packs the similarly popular hidden fates elite trainer box is expected to see a restock in the new year too [Applause] so [Applause] what about looking at demand for this product as a set never minding just collecting charizard in terms of the trading card game itself a player wanting to compete and play the tcg well champions path has 73 cards with a few secret rares bringing the total up to 80 cards as a smaller set this means that you're likely to run into a good number of duplicates the more of the product you open looking at the market prices of the singles in the set there's a pretty steep drop off after you get past the chase cards of the secret and ultra rares in the set 18 of them are averaging at less than the cost of a booster pack that leaves six that will net between seven dollars and twenty dollars and then the two charizards which are off the charts considering the pull rate on ultra rares it means that for competitive players at least ordering singles is definitely the way to go here i mean as long as your deck doesn't need charizard v-max i guess buy singles final conclusion the champions path elite trainer box offers a premium version of the already solid elite trainer box for a reasonable price increase it offers two additional booster packs of a limited run set and a sought after promo card the accessories in the box are useful to both casual and competitive players alike with the tournament legal coin flip die being of particular note as ever having a code card to redeem the contents online is one of the main strengths of this game and one i hope to never see retired at or around msrp this product is a great value however once you look at above msrp you should recognize that a restock is coming and so prices hopefully will go down as a product aimed at collectors i would say that it might be better to steer clear of it as a competitive player at least until the second wave hits and helps reduce prices at retail buy singles overall grade obviously this is an a at msrp it's a great fun product and at msrp it appeals to casuals collectors and a wide swath of pokemon trainers but i wouldn't pay above msrp at least not until after the second wave hits which remember will be before the holiday season maybe going 60 to 70 dollars makes this a b product but one thing is for sure the fact that the pokemon company is offering a massive reprint in response to the huge demand and elevated secondary market prices is in my books in a response any day of the week i hope very much this review has been of some help to you today remember be savvy about your purchasing and even when there's a really great product to be had don't pay more than you should for it you
