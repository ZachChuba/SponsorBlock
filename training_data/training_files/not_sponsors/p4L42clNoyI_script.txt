hey what is going on you guys that is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new video for you all today so today I bring you guys a pretty unique one at least I think so this is not Monster related this is actually NPC related ladies and gentlemen welcome to loot from 1000 wise old man tasks so in simple terms you know as explained on screen here in this clip what we were gonna be doing for this video is basically doing 1,000 favors for this wise old man who is in Draenor now the wiki link to this mini game I guess you would consider it will be in the description below so a big shout out goes to the wiki for providing me all of the information that I did need for this video information such as all of these items that I did stack in my bank which are going to be needed throughout this video from start to finish as you will see here very shortly and as seen here on the wiki page you know this is just kind of the general idea of all of the stuff that you do nee there's easy tasks and then of course there's hard tasks it doesn't really specify you know which is which in game that's more shown on the wiki but basically you just need a lot of low tier items and some of these items actually had very low buy limits but luckily whenever I encountered a buying limit problem I just used another account of mine and that was resolved pretty quickly so there's also another problem with this video and that is that there is no way to actually track how many tasks that I've done because there's no log or anything like that like there usually is for a lot of these loot videos so I decided to just use a simple notepad document number it 1 through 1000 I don't have an Excel spreadsheet or anything so I just kept it as you know pretty much complicated as I could I guess you could say but either way every time I would finish a task I would either be rewarded with herbes or gems or XP tons of different things that you guys will see throughout the making of this video and after each task I would just simply write on the notepad document right next to the number of the task what I would receive and that was basically how I tracked it I was actually in the middle of making my 1000 for cat video I'm currently about six hundred kills into that and I decided to take one day off just to focus on this because someone in my twitch chat did suggest this idea and I figured you know it sounded really cool and I looked on YouTube and I couldn't find too many videos relating to the wise old man favors there was some wise old man videos but nothing relating to this activity and it's a pretty interesting activity so yeah let's get into this video it is important to note that as I did mention in the chatbox earlier on that if you're not going to be delivering items to the old man than you are going to be delivering letters to his friends around runescape and his friends pretty much consists of about seven people pretty close by Thoreau who is in Port Sarim rel doe who is in varrock the Oracle who's on Ice Mountain the high priest of in tirana father Lawrence and varrick father Eric and Lumbridge and Abbot Langley and edgeville monastery hopefully not too many mispronunciations there but yeah it's pretty much the same thing you know as soon as you deliver the letter to any of those NPCs around this game they will give you the reward that the wise old man originally would have given you whether it be prayer XP or an item that's pretty much the only two things that they can give you now these items that you can get rewarded from this activity of course you kind of got to see them a little bit throughout the video and then at the very end you will see the price check if you don't want to listen to you know 14 minutes of this description of this activity I completely understand you will not hurt my feelings just check out the description or the pin comment skip to the price check it's not gonna bother me at all for this activity though I would say you know delivering items straight to the wise old man would make this very fast if that was all you did but the delivering of the letters does make this much slower than it could be if you're wondering how long this took me I did this for about 11 hours straight taking no breaks did it all off stream and actually wanted to get this done just because I wanted to see what people thought of this video so I was very motivated to get this done it wasn't really boring to me I was just listening to music the whole time and the only one step that really took a lot of time was the in tirana step essentially I would just Bank my Draiman staff as well as my Construction Cape and then I would have to run to the docks sail to in tirana talk to the priest and then make my way back to Draenor of course there were other locations like northeast varrock that were kind of slow to get to but at the end of the day it didn't really make too much of a difference I would just say that in tirana one was the one that did take the longest as it goes for just delivering him items though you know stacking up every required item that he does ask you for whether its moat glass or whether it's iron maces I mean it can go from many different items as you can see the bank tab was pretty massive there in the beginning and we did price check all of those items just to see how much this video is going to cost to do you know whether you're an average player or a max main like myself how much are you gonna have to spend just to give the old man what he wants and the real question is is it going to be worth it you know with all these items that you do give him he you may wonder why he needs all this stuff and he gives a lot of different reasons for a lot of different items for example if he asks you for ammunition he claims that he's gonna use it to kill the goblins outside if he asks you for a swamp paste you know he has to fix his roof that way he may be hungry so he might be in the mood for chicken but most times he once cooked meat he's also a drinker so you always got to make sure to bring him beer when he asks for it and in order to fix his glasses believe it or not he just wants you to bring him some empty beer glasses there's also pretty strange items that like I mentioned before do have some buy limits on them for example leather cows and bronze wire as well as unfired pie dishes just really strange things that I was a little tricky to get a hold of but if you pay a lot and you have some friends and some alternate accounts it's pretty easy to get everything you need for this video I don't know how popular this method is going to be but you know it is important to note that if you are gonna camp this you are going to have a lot of items in the bank that are a little bit difficult to get on limit it was actually one point where I did run out of bronze axes so I just had an alternate account of mine just literally Smith bronze axes while I was getting all the other items for these tasks and yeah it was just kind of silly to do that but you know you got to do some weird things for some weird videos sometimes and yeah as you can see this notepad document does come up I tried to record every 50 or so tasks just to kind of show the notepad and just write down the loot at that given point if you're curious as to why I was staff bashing the old man's bed that is because there's one specific favor where he asks you to go upstairs and kill whatever is hiding underneath his bed every time you do this you don't receive an item and you don't receive prayer XP received the third thing that you can get from these tasks and that of course is HP XP so yeah very strange very very strange but nevertheless you know we did kill that thing under his bed multiple times I would say in 1,000 times I probably killed it at least 20 or be twenty five times so not too often but you still are gonna venture up there every now and again and as you can see the loot is growing you know slowly but surely I try not to show the tab too often didn't want to spoil it completely but there is a decent amount of items that you can get rewarded for I will say a lot of its low tier even for a low level it's pretty low tier but you get rewarded in GP you get a little bit of gems highest one and the rarest one being diamond you get a ton of seeds and the rarest one being a limpa root seed i also noticed on the wiki that there's no Snape grass seed but I did manage to get one very very later on in the video imagine in the highlight of a video being getting a Snape grass seed but yeah I mean there is pretty crazy things about this just in general all the items that you can get and even after doing a thousand there were still seeds that I didn't manage to get so it just kind of goes to show even if you do a long stretch of this you may not actually see all of the items that this does offer there's also a decent amount of runes you know from air all the way up to law chaos and even nature runes that's pretty nice no doubt about it the best rewards that you can get from this would be the herbs specifically the Renard's I do believe throughout this whole video the most valuable reward that I got from any given task through this 1000 was just about 40k I think it was closer to 38 K but yeah that's pretty good for you know spending like less than maybe 10 seconds to deliver him an item that's probably less than 1k but again just seeing that one reward being the maximum value out of a thousand that's kind of where the downside is so it really depends on your luck as it goes for that but in general you know these are pretty low tier rewards but doing a thousand I thought that they would stack up to a decent amount so I did think it was worth making into a video and again what a weird minigame you know maybe in the future instead of adding more monsters instead of adding more clues scrolls and different things like that I don't know maybe they'll end up adding an NPC that you can do things for or do things with and get rewarded that way yeah this wise old man a little history behind this guy you know he was released into the game June 6 2005 so he's been in here for quite a while too sure exactly of the mini game release date I guess that's what you would consider this I am assuming it would be on the same you know day that the wise old man came out and something worth noting that all of the required items that you do need for this you cannot note in hand to him you have to do it unnoted because obviously when you rob a bank you really can't bring back something to ask the bankers to unnoted for you especially when you're wearing a blue party hat and those glasses see much stick out like a sore thumb so of course you just have to make it unnoted for him there are stackable items such as you know ammunition knives and arrows and headless arrows you know occasionally he will ask for those things and you can stack those in your inventory but with all of my trips to in Tirana it really just wasn't worth doing I'd rather just go back and forth to the bank every single time it's why the gear choice for this video was just a simple set of graceful construction cape did come in handy for the teleports to the monastery of course running southwest of that to the ice mountain and of course varrock and all of the other locations that I did mention before now prayer experience you know is rewarded about forty 3.75 percent of the time according to the wiki and this ranges between 185 and 215 xp for an easy task or 372 430 for a hard task you do need at least three prayers so you can't come here with one you at least have to have three and like I mentioned before the thing under the bed upstairs if you do manage to kill it and talk to the old man once you're done he does give you anywhere from 250 to 300 HP XP I do believe that this is Members Only so free to players can't do this but that's okay honestly the teleports would make that pretty difficult for free to players in general obviously the location of this is draynor village no tutorial or anything just can get started right away if this so happens to pique your interest not too sure if it will pique anyone's interest to be honest but in general I just think it was a pretty cool video idea and yeah I'm always up to try new things you know and I always say this every video but if any of you guys have any suggestions as to what you want to see done on the channel doesn't have to be monster related it could pretty much be anything and everything also I do apologize for the screen flickering I do see a few of these clips while doing this voiceovers you have a little bit of a blue line at the bottom Camtasia eights been acting pretty weird for me lately I might switch to Camtasia 9 in next video we will see but here we are nevertheless with 1000 wise old man's complete that sounded pretty weird let me reword that loot from 1000 wise old man tasks complete here we are the one that thousand has been tracked and fully as you can see a little bit of fast forwarding involved throughout this video actually almost every single clip was fast forwarded but yeah we did track it there's my proof one to a thousand took about ten to 11 hours strong three shots of espresso kept me going throughout the whole day yeah in general you know first price check that I want to do is to price check all of the starting supplies this is the item deliveries themselves and I want to see how much you know I had at the very end because I did have a number written down at the very beginning I don't think I praise checked it on video or maybe I did I'm not too sure but overall the very first price check from the first set of delivery items does come out to be just about seven point nine mil and if we go ahead and we add it to the second price check which is just about three point one mill and we have about eleven mill with about 72 K left over which means we spent 492 K just delivering these items to the old man that's the value of everything that we gave him so obviously we are going to subtract that value from the price check and that will be our true profit so yeah you're gonna have to spend money in order to do this or you can just do very self sufficient methods to obtain all of these items I mean again I think this was centered towards low levels so ideally I don't think they would be buying these items I think they'd be probably getting them themselves but again this has been out for over ten years times have certainly changed nevertheless let's get into this price check this is all of the herbs the runes the gems in it you're looking at just about sixty 3k cash a total value of 923 K I'm not gonna lie that was more than I was expecting but of course we do have one more price check and this is all of the seeds that we do have left if we go ahead and price check all of this it comes out to a staggering 4.9 K and I will choose to round up on that so let's just call it 5 K so yeah roughly 928 K from 1,000 tasks from the wise old man - in the delivery items we are left with 436 k profit so yeah the prayer XP we started at about 18 million four hundred and fifty three thousand so approximately we ended with over one hundred and eight Caper XP since this took around ten eleven hours to do I guess that's like an average of about 10k XP per hour pretty strange way to train prayer I would say this is definitely the strangest way to obtain prayer XP a little bit of HP XP I would say no more than about 5k but give or take some more I didn't really track it as accurately as I should have but but it is a pretty uncommon occurrence to have to kill the wise old man's bed upstairs some of the seeds did sell for a little more the cactus seeds did sell for 2k each so that was kind of a surprise as well as the snape grass seeds selling for 2.4 K but in general all the items that we did receive from this you know we did receive roughly 929 K after selling a lot there was about 6 seeds that were not even sellable you know one GP still wasn't good enough that's something to keep in mind and with all of that being said we were walking away with a staggering profit of 436 K 928 K overall but of course subtracting the supplies we do walk away with that over 100 K prayer XP and a little bit of HP XP don't think I'll be doing that ever again but let me know what you guys think about this minigame in the comments below and especially let me know if you would like to see something like this added to the game that's a little bit better more worthwhile and certainly unique oh yeah with all that being said thank you guys so much for watching I will see you next time and until then miss suno's sleep ow
