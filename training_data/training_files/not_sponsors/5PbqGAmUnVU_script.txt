so you see here is a clip that was apparently leaked what we're going to break down the video pixel by pixel to determine its authenticity is it possible that the shot was faked or is it real nothing gets fans more excited than crossovers the avengers wandaverse when the guy who played quicksilver played quicksilver but he was from the other franchise what dude the spider-verse movies what turns out they're doing it in live action now multiverse is a concept about which we know frighteningly level i'm gonna put some dirt in your eye so you see here is a clip that was apparently leaked obviously showing andrew garfield on set as his character from the amazing spider-man series it's weird when a video clip like this comes out it's very clearly andrew garfield yet he turns around and says no it is not i i heard about it and i did see it and it's a photoshop who do you believe here's what people are saying online about this it's been revealed that andrew garfield's appearance in the latest spider-man movie was in fact a deep fake the hollywood star who played the webb's slinging superhero in the last movie will not be reprising his role after producers discovered he had been replaced by an ai trained to impersonate the actor we were having a difficult time with andrew garfield who couldn't get him to come to set and sometimes filming would be delayed because of his commitments to some movie about a quadriplegic single mother anyways anyways the the article goes on but it proves the point that this video of andrew garfield is fake that article is fake similarly generated it with an ai much like the actual articles written about this subject that seemed to be written by ai so sam and i are going to cut through that conflicting information today we're going to break down the video pixel by pixel to determine its authenticity is it possible that the shot was faked or is it real so come with us through the critical thinking process so next time something like this happens you can figure it out for yourself so what's interesting is that it looks like this is an actual cinema camera or a rather high quality camera it's a large sensor because you can see some depth of field here this isn't like some person on their phone either it's like some ripped footage from a behind-the-scenes crew or someone who has like tapped into one of the actual monitors on set this could just be footage from when he was filming spider-man and he's just talking to his stunt double like do you want me to stand like you were standing like this all right so if we compare that footage with the original footage from the amazing spider-man there's a pretty big difference between the two his hairdo is different he looks a lot younger he looks like he's in high school but main thing is his hair dude like they wouldn't just have a different hairdo for one day on set here so this this most likely is new footage his face looks like it's a different resolution from his costume slightly blurrier there does seem to be a slight lack of detail there it's a bit of an anomaly in my opinion because if we're looking at like the bars there we can see like surface imperfections on the beams and it does seem like there's a slight lack of quality on the face that being said like generally if you upload a video to a social media platform the chances that it's going to be a mp4 file it's it's pretty likely and the way mp4 files work is by compressing motion into an overall image so it's less about rendering an unique frame every single frame but taking one frame and then basically saying all right this is the direction the pixels are moving so that way we have motion data instead of image data it's called iframes and p frames so an example like this if you export a three second clip everything that's not moving is going to stay crisp while the things moving will have less fidelity the main claim i've seen made about this video is that we are in fact looking at a deep fake of andrew garfield i don't think this is a deep fake this would be the best defect i've ever seen if it's a deep fake 100 i mean the best defense i've ever seen is the tom cruise deep fakes what's up tick tock deep tom cruise by chris kumay i mean those are wonderful but you can tell the deep fix if you scrutinize it you can see there's no crisp shadow under the nose from the sunlight there's a bit of a sense of like his face is being lit and then like re-lit again i feel uh fresh there's a button but even like the teeth like the lighting on the teeth is not quite right also you can see it feels a little bit like it's a flat texture of a face you know as opposed to like a three-dimensional object so that's because the computer is trained on a bunch of images of a face well those images are filmed at all different focal lengths you know oftentimes if you're doing say you know training from movies like let's say we're doing a tom cruise deep fake and you're grabbing all these tom cruise shots so a lot of times you're using close-ups close-ups are often shot with the telephoto lens and what a telephoto lens does is it tends to flatten everything so my face has a lot of distortion right my nose is scaled up a little bit because it's closer to you my ears my face is probably kind of like a little fish-eyed and these get a little bit smaller get perspective on my face now you'll kind of see how everything's flattened on my face and you've probably seen like the gifs of this on reddit or something like that like look at what lenses do to the face what ends up happening is that when you put a deep dick on the face you kind of get this weird like flat nose effect or like the whole face is almost like this like squished lack of perspective almost like orthographic view when in real life should actually be getting a lot more perspective and depth and almost like vanishing points representing themselves on the face as the geometry moves around it's really really really good but just scrutinize it it's not quite right that in mind let's go back to andrew garfield whoa hey guys it's me brandy garfield as you can see i'm on the set of man who acts like a spider i don't really know what number it is but i'm here and i'm happy to be here and i'm even more happy to tell you about today's sponsor expressvpn guys if you aren't using a vpn when you're out surfing the open internet you should really be considering it as one of the most valuable tools to protect your information and give you access to content from all over the world you see the first thing that a vpn does is it reroutes your internet connection to a server in another location this gives your data additional encryption when it is out on the open internet so that hackers cannot steal your information and your internet service provider cannot take your data and sell it to third parties for advertisements and if there's one thing that i don't like it's bad guys and the second thing that a vpn is gonna do for you is it's gonna give you access to content from all over the world that's one of my favorite features about expressvpn you see the way that it works is if you're on a platform like netflix they're going to give you access to certain movie titles that are only available in the country that you're in but with a vpn you can tell websites that you are accessing the internet from an entirely different country which is going to give you all the movie titles that are available on a platform like netflix in an entirely different country meaning you can access content from all over the world now guys if you don't believe me just go on the reviews and check out expressvpn for yourself they were rated number one by platforms like cnet and tech radar i know that i might have a perfect jawline but one thing that's more perfect than my jawline is expressvpn's 24 7 customer service they're also the fastest vpn provider out there it's really beautiful i use it all the time now if you're interested you can get three months free by clicking the link in the description below or going to expressvpn.com core or crew that's e-x-p-r-e-s-s vpn corridor crew oh oh they're calling me back to set guys hey this is just another day in the life of a hollywood movie star until next time you have fun with that vpn and uh i gotta go get this shot see you guys later the first thing i'm seeing is there's an edge light coming from the top right corner kind of a bluish daylight blue edge light it's hitting the the lines on his costume it's also hitting the side of his neck at the corner of his jaw and his hair here a little bit of the corner of the jaw cash from the light is interesting because that specific kind of sharp lighting detail that's something a deep fake does not do very well most deep fakes cover this part of the face you can do whole head deep fakes but they get blurry and low resolution so that would mean that the hair has to be real you almost never deep fake hair it's very very hard to do especially especially such bountiful hair like that from your garfield another thing to look at is the eyes so your eyes are reflective they're spheres the reflections in both eyes should be consistent with each other if one eye shows one light reflection the other eye shows two light reflections well then that's a sign that the eyes are being faked and deep fake only picked up on one of the bright spots looking at his eyes i see consistent reflections in both another thing i'm seeing the sharpness of the shadows going off of his nose on the side of his face and more importantly into his mouth you can see the glistening light on the water of his tongue and it's consistent the deep fake might catch that here and there but it has no idea of what's causing highlights or light it just knows statistically where these things go you'd have to have so much very specific trained data of andrew garfield's tongue with light glistening on it at the correct color type return angle to be able to replicate it here i mean if the andrew garfield shot is a deep fake maybe somebody's just thought it'd be a funny joke to fake this i mean there are good deep fake artists out there that could theoretically do something like this yeah well as real as this looks it has been revealed that this shot is a deep fake [Music] oh yeah right i can't tell this is fake the puppet the puppet that's the pro that's the clearest sign that this is fake already he's like you would never why would you move his arm up to the pole i can tell amelia's to say no but look they defeat this see how the track the lips and the nose and the eyes are being tracked all right alex serrato is trolling all of us he's even come out and said as much on his youtube channel all right so the big giveaway here for me is this deep fake training grid so when you have this grid view one set of faces is the face that's going to be put on the other person the other set of faces is the person who will be receiving the face in other words this shouldn't all be andrew garfield one row should be andrew garfield and the other row should be the actor underneath that's that's the funny thing he's training his deep fake on the final image yeah so where's the other actor because you don't just like it doesn't generate a face from nothing that's i think it's really funny i love that alex did this but i think that the number of news articles that went out saying it turns out oh it turns out it was a deep fake after all they just point to this it's like all they had to do was show the training shot to one person who's ever done a deep dick in their life and they would immediately know it's not real there is one thing about this that caught me like well that's weird when he enhances the face and it's the way his teeth jump around when it's enhanced here so what's happening here is he's using an ai up resin algorithm here that's looking at the face and it's analyzing detail and filling in extra detail and so the reason the wrinkles are moving on the lips or the way the teeth the heights are shifting is it's identifying patterns and it's guessing yeah maybe this is the top of the tooth and then a few frames later it goes no this is the top of the tooth and so the tooth constantly jumps around all the details are not temporally consistent as we would say now in a real deep fake this is something you would actually run into you would run into the teeth shimmying around a little bit you run into the wrinkles on the lips shimming around a little bit all right so this video is fake but are there any other ways one could fake this video without using a deep fake this could be andrew garfield cut out from a film and they set up the shot to like look like it that's how i would fake it like i would find a shot of andrew garfield where i can match the lighting and like the motions and i just cut it out and stick it onto my footage you get pretty close i mean here's the thing at the end of the day could this be faked yes this could be faked it would be very very very very very good fakery i don't think it's a deep fake t-picks are not magic they're really not that crazy they require a ton of artistry to actually blend and look real also it's probably not even a leak like at this point if i was a movie studio what's gonna get more pressed like an actual official photo that's released or a leaked one you tell me i'm not supposed to see this you know it's like it's like i'm totally clicking on that yeah i mean they just got us to talk about this for a whole video look at that right hashtag ad question so this video was brought to you by disney and spider-man no way home and we even have a special additional clip for you guys to check out of the film here it is everyone's got super powers well everyone but me great character great superhero i love the original movies with tobey maguire all the spider-man movies they're super fun and would it be exciting to see one where all the cast members from different films come together for a single hit uh yeah it would be super cool thanks for watching everybody really appreciate it so we really enjoy doing these debunk videos i have to give a massive shout out to captain disillusion not that we're trying to copy his format but if there's anybody out there who does the best debunk videos on the internet it's him if you like this video go check them out but i'd love some more clips you know like real footage real footage ghost footage the bigfoot footage point us to some very specific shots that you want to see us take a look at to see if we can spot any residual artifacts of visual effects artistry or we can try to figure out if they are exactly 100 real we'll find your mysteries and we'll solve them hey look someone's on the ground hey what's up hey look it's not spiderman let's go [Music] [Applause]
