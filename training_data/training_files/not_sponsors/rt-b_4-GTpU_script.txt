what's going on guys my name's Theo attrex and in today's video I'm going to explain the new death mechanics in a lot of depth I'm pretty late to uploading about this update and that's because I was making a guide for the official old-school channel to explain the mechanics if want to check out that video the link is down below I felt like uploading a more in-depth version to my own channel to clear up any confusion that might be having about the update or if didn't see the one on the official channel when old school runescape was released in 2013 upon death your items would drop to the ground and would be available for to pick up for only 1 minute before it became visible to everyone else for two minutes and then permanently disappeared in 2015 the amount of time had to retrieve your items after dying increased to one hour and other players could no longer see or get your items this was done due to server issues and disconnections players could disconnect from the server and be unable to real aughh in time to get their items back well now a gravestone appears instead of your items dropping to the floor get 15 minutes to go and grab the items that lost but the 15 minute timer only goes down when you're logged in and only when you're active in game if stop moving your mouse or moving around the timer stops until move the mouse and start playing again so now if disconnect all your power goes out for over an hour won't lose the items like previously could also when a game update came out any items that had on the floor from dying would disappear forever but now the gravestone will be in the same spot as before even after the game update your gravestone is also available on every game world so if forget which world that died on it's not a problem anymore to find your gravestone can open the world map and in the interface can view the location of your grave indicated by a red arrow and then a big grape stone icon where died when you're nearby - your gravestone a small red arrow then a yellow arrow shows where it is on your mini when reach your gravestone checking it brings up this interface and that lets collect your items can also right-click it and loot the gravestone and that instantly gives everything in the gravestone in case it's in a dangerous area to get those items back though there's now a fee for items under 100k there's no fee so that less wealthy and newer players don't have to break the bank to get their items items over 100k cost 1k items over a milk Aust 10k and items over 10 mil cost a hundred K for each item they all stack up but there's a cap of 500k for retrieving them for Iron Men these values are half because it's a bit harder for iron men to get GP compared to the main game the cap is 250 K for Iron Men instead of 500k as well to view how much the cost is going to be can go to the items kept on death screen which now allows to see a lot of different scenarios it's a great idea to check here before do anything dangerous so know exactly how much you'll need to pay supplies like food and potions are dropped onto the ground and don't go into your gravestone they last for one hour on the floor the same as before the update and this is so can make food stacks at bosses still if die while you're going back to your gravestone the items that lose on your second death will go into the first gravestone where died in the first place and also the 15 minute timeout restarts but if don't manage to make it back to your gravestone after that 15 minute timer runs out the gravestone disappears and your items are then taken to deaths office which can access close to the spawn locations across runescape can enter at the Lumbridge graveyard at the coffins in edgeville near the altar in Camelot there's an entry in falador castle and there's one in the northern region of CRIF Dinis there's a cap of 120 stacks of items that can be stored at debts office and these items last forever but the retrieval fee our debts office is a lot higher the new cost is 5% of the eye value for anything that's over 100k so for example if lose an amulet of torture which is 16 mil it costs 800 K to get back if lost a twisted bow which is 1.2 bill it would cost 60 mil to get back of course a twisted bow is probably going to be one of the items keep on death but it really puts into perspective how much more you'll need to pay iron men also get a 50% discount at death's office so a torch amulet will be 400 instead of 800 and a Tebow would be 30 mil instead of 60 a lot of people thought that this update made dying even less detrimental to your account but if consider the huge fees that need to pay it's actually a massive gold sink compared to what it used to be at death's office can also change the look of your gravestone and currently there's only one other type of gravestone the angel version it costs 200 K to change and can change back to the original one for free just so know no one else can see your gravestone so can't really flex having the angel gravestone it's only visible on your account inside debts office there's a coffer where can sacrifice items to add money into the coffer and that money can be used to reclaim items can't withdraw from this coffer this is awesome for iron men that have a lot of spare items that don't have a very good alkyl for each item sacrifice get 105 percent of the grand exchange value but can't withdraw from this coffer so the money that put in there can only ever be used for getting items back as an ultimate Iron Man don't have a gravestone the mechanics are similar to as they were before the update where your items remain on the floor for one hour but the only change is that most untradable items are now dropped as well which is actually a massive benefit for Ultimates they can now more easily access the wilderness and other dangerous areas because untradable x' like the herb sack and rune pouch will be dropped to the floor so Ultimates can die with these items to have them dropped for an hour then go into the wilderness or wherever and then come back and get these untradable without having to risk them ultimates didn't get a gravestone after this update because leaving items on the floor has been a big part of the game-mode and it would dramatically change how the game is played dying in PvP hasn't really changed a lot the loot still goes to the ground after peeking someone but the only change is that untradable x' that can go and get off the ground like God books and God capes will end up in a gravestone the system also works it the same way in the wilderness as it does in the regular world as long as you're not killed or attacked by another player so if you're doing wilderness Slayer or bossing and die only to a monster then you'll still get a gravestone under level 20 wilderness the mechanics are as normal any untradable x' that die with will all go into your gravestone but if you're above level 20 untradable x' will disappear forever which is the same as before the update so like before don't take items like your void or fighter torso above level 20 wilderness because if die with them and they're not one of the items keep on death will permanently lose them even in PVM a few minigames and bosses have had an item retrieval service where need to pay a fee to get your items back these places haven't changed and you'll still use the same retrieval method as before and there's no gravestone with the gravestone update though Zhora now has a 100k fee to get your items back where it was previously free but that fee only applies if have over 50 Zora kills so if have under 50 kill count the cost is still free there's a number of instanced areas in old school particularly for quests quest bosses and private bossing rooms previously dying in one of these instances would permanently lose those items and there'd be no way of getting them back now with the gravestone update a gravestone appears outside that instance so you'll no longer permanently lose any items this change also affects ultimate iron men but instead of a gravestone appearing outside the instance those items will appear on the floor outside for one hour dying inside a god wars boss room has also been changed where before the update your items dropped on the floor inside the boss room and that made it kind of hard to get your items back since need to get kill count and also tank the boss while pick up your items well now a gravestone appears outside of the god wars boss room so these are the main issues that have been fixed with the gravestone update no longer need to worry about disconnecting or power outages since the timer doesn't go down when you're logged in game updates are less dangerous since your gravestone will remain in the same place as it was before the update previously if hop twirled after dying it could be very hard to find the world that your items were lost in since your gravestone appears on every single game world it's no longer an issue dying in an instanced area where previously would have lost your items permanently is no longer something to be afraid of since the gravestone appears outside so that's the death update in a nutshell I hope this cleared up any questions that had if you're still unsure about something leave a comment down below and I'll try get back to as many people as I video that I made for jagex I've linked that down in the description thanks for watching
