[Applause] on the 4th of July 1990 England faced an old enemy in the World Cup the most important soccer tournament in the world they got to the semi-finals and they played Germany and they lost they lost on penalties which means it was a draw by the end of normal time and it was a draw by the end of extra time it was an incredibly long game and a tense game watched by millions of people in England so by the end they were all busting for a pee they all went to the toilet at the same time and they all flushed the toilet at the same time imagine millions of valves in millions of cisterns all opening at the same time and the water company struggled to maintain good pressure in an attempt to keep the pressure up they put a huge demand on the National Grid in fact it was the largest spike in demand that the National Grid has ever seen an extra demand of 2,800 megawatts or in Back to the Future units that's 2.80 gigawatts it's a phenomenon called TV pick up because it happens when loads of people do the same thing at the same time and then stop doing that thing and do something else on the toilet but here's the thing when there's a spike in demand it can affect the quality of the service so ok two things about mains electricity the voltage which in the UK is either 240 or 230 depending on who you ask nominally it's 240 but the declared voltage is 230 anyway then there's the frequency which is 50 Hertz so it's AC alternating current it's alternating 50 times per second in the u.s. it's 60 here it's 15 and if either of those numbers change too much that voltage or frequency it can damage equipment like the things that you plug into the mains they're expecting 240 volts they're expecting 50 Hertz and they don't get that it can it can damage them so the National Grid are obsessed with TV schedules there's a whole department that just there to know what's on TV and when Nigel Williams of the National Grid once said that the TV pickup of Deal or No Deal was gobsmacking lehigh how sad is that the National Grid are in constant contact with the TV stations so BBC ITV channel 4 and so they know when the TV shows are going to end when their advert breaks are going to come on and so they can plan to bring power generation online to cope with the demand they even know about like unusual plot lines in soap operas so you know if dead ends coming back to the square or I don't know something like that if they know a lot of people are going to watch a soap opera then they'll have extra demand for when that soap opera finishes but what's really difficult is live events that are unpredictable like sporting events for example so the National Grid can't know in advance when there's going to be a stoppage in play and people are going to run to the toilet like send things are predictable like one half of a game is 45 minutes long so even that isn't because there's injury time in fact the most recent England game England versus Colombia is a great example of that because okay so there were five minutes of injury time added on to the end and so as the National Grid you might think well that's great they just you know push it back by five minutes except that during that five minutes of injury time there was more injury time so it went beyond that but anyway you know if there's a goal then people might go to the toilet if there's a substitution people might go to the toilet if there's an injury all those sorts of things and they're all unpredictable so my thinking was maybe I can detect goals or just stoppages of any kind in the World Cup by measuring the change in frequency in the mains electricity so I hoped my multimeter into the mains and I set the camera recording and I got this this is a great multimeter it connects my bluetooth to my phone and then I can then log the the data and then and then put on a graph so here's what I got here's the first off here's the second half first off of extra-time second off of extra time then penalties and here are the two goals so is there anything we can glean from this information well look any analysis we do is necessarily post hoc like I'm looking for patterns here you know I'm looking for a hypothesis but it's interesting you know you get this sudden dip just as the game starts guess people are running from the toilet to to catch the game you get a dip a little bit after the end of the first half you get these little dips on both of the goals interesting there's no big dip after the whole game was finished after after we won on penalties yeah so maybe there's a pattern there but look I don't think you can look at this and say I can detect goals I give you if you weren't watching the game and you're just looking at this I don't think you probably get some false positives there you go I bet there's a goal there because there isn't like that dip seems to correspond to nothing at all in the game not that I can see so yeah in other ways this post hoc analysis is bad like in science you're not supposed to do that that way in some ways you are like you you can't go searching for a hypothesis in data you're supposed to come up with a hypothesis in advance and then look at the data just to test that hypothesis because you know if you go looking for hypothesis then you're bound to find one eventually but what you can do is you know this is the first stage so I'm gonna look at this data to develop a hypothesis and then I take this hypothesis and test it against new data so I'll do this again for the the next England game which is Saturday 7th so you might be watching this video after that but anyway that's the plan we'll see how it goes obviously as the games get more and more important more more people will watch them so hopefully we'll see more and more of an effect some interesting things I learned about TV pick up it's not a but as it used to be because we because of on-demand services like Netflix people just watch things when they want to BBC iplayer things like that people don't watch things at the specific time that they're aired on national TV the way the National Grid copes with spikes in energy is really interesting one thing they've got is these Rapid Response power stations they're Hydra Pumped hydro is the name of this so you've got basically two as it was one up here one down here and when electricity is cheap at night you use the electricity to pump water up to the top reservoir and then when there's a spike in demand you open a valve the water pours through turns a turbine and and you get the electricity when you need it and that the fastest one in the UK can come online in 16 seconds absolutely amazing some other like crazy ways to to keep the power steady they've got an agreement with big companies that own tower blocks and they say look if we need to we're just going to shut off your air conditioning for a bit like you know worst case scenario if there's a real problem we'll pay you to shut off your air conditioning and if like an hour or something so you've got all these people in these dowel rods if an egg is really hot but it's actually to save people's gadgets and and equipment what else I learned that there was no obvious degradation in mains electricity during the Royal Wedding of of Harry and Megan though well possibly one finding was that people aren't that keen on hymns or at least if people need the toilet they go doing the hymns here's an interesting thing about TV pick up it's not the voltage that's the problem it's the frequency voltage is easy to maintain easy and probably over simplifying a little bit but but anyway in principle it's easy mint to maintain because of the way the National Grid is designed it's the it's the frequency that's hard to maintain a good analogy for that riding a bicycle so imagine you're pressing down on the pedals of your bike with a fixed force that's your voltage especially quite good analogy because voltage is essentially a measure of how hard are you pushing the electrons through the wire except there's a minus sign involved because of history but anyway the frequency is like how many times are you turning the pedals per second so you've got this you've decided to fix the force so it's like a fixed voltage that you're pressing down the pedals and the frequency might change if there's an increase in demand so for example if there's an inclined plane so the the bike is now going uphill you're having to do more work if you keep the force the same if you keep the voltage the same then your pedaling is going to slow down the frequency is going to slow down and it's the same thing with the National Grid in fact it is the the the thing that's turning in the National Grid the Dynamo essentially which is powered by coal or you know radioactive decay or whatever it is there's always gonna be a thing spinning somewhere and the spinning of that thing slows down used to upgrade I hope you enjoyed
