hey how's it going welcome back to another episode of the ultimate iron man we spent almost 40 hours last video hunting eclectics so that way we could stack up 200 medium caskets the goal wasn't to get rangers the goal was to reach 400 medium clues to get the clueless scroll which we did end up doing uh we not unfortunately get rangers but i wasn't really expecting it in just 200 i feel like there's always so much to do in this game unfortunately i'm only one person i can only do one thing at a time i was enjoying the clues even though i was getting a little bit burnt at the mediums uh we will go back for easys and maybe medium someday too not anytime soon though because it's been like over two months like two to three months since we've last done any slayer tasks and i missed doing slayer so we're going to get back into the slayer this video you also may remember from the last video we got over 2 000 gold bars i saved these on purpose because i want to make them to rings of recoil to charge up the suffering right now we have 17.6k charges on it and i figure we may as well fill it up uh one gold bar equates to 40 charges on the suffering and the suffering caps out at 100k charges so 2.3k is way more than we could even use anyways i just figured because we'd be gaining the gold bars that would save us time and money even though money isn't really that important for me mainly we save time doing the method that i'll be showing in this video because we have the gold bars already i gotta do a little bit of research into this method and i have to make dinner and stuff but i'll see you back once i figure out what we're going to be doing i've been doing the math and here's the conclusion i've come to so each sapphire will cost on average 34.5 tackle assuming we buy all 10 per world which is why we'll be doing and we need 2060 sapphires meaning we need 71 070 taco each cast room we buy gives us nine tackle so we have to buy about seven point nine k cash runes all right all the casters have been bought they cost about 800k yeah i'm gonna buy all the runes right now that we'll need for this method so we'll need one cosmic rune per recoil i was just doing some random prices on the math of things and it looks like we would have spent about a million gp if we didn't have cosmic rooms already so one million gp for 83 000 charges means about 12 gp per charge of recoil which also means it comes out to about 483 gp per ring of recoil now that's assuming we have the noted bars already and you're not just buying the gold or they're immoral wreck because if we were buying the gold ore it'd be a lot more expensive i had some of these extra runes left over from when i did mta that's why i have the cosmic runes but i'm gonna still have these two because i don't need them hopefully i did the math right and that should be all the toggle that we need i'm gonna go die now okay we're pretty much set up for this method now i can't be bothered to switch gloves while doing the method so i'm going to put the graceful gloves back into the magic wardrobe because this is something we can now do after the costume update also graceful was changed kind of recently so that each individual piece gives you an extra percent increase for run restore we may not be getting the full set effect but luckily because the way my inventory is laid out we're able to have staminas on this because we need 20 slots open 10 because there's 10 sapphires per world and then 10 more for the gold bars one last thing we have to do is buy the staff of water for the spell drop the extra gp now i'm gonna go figure out how to do this method so a mudkip walks into a bar and the bartender asks why so blue but first we got a sponsor sponsoring this video the tsar method for making rings of recoil on the uim is a lot more expensive than the method i've shown in the past which involves caldegram but this method is also a lot more recoils per hour you need access to more ulrec which means you have to have shown a fire cape once to get in any time if you're on rune light you can use draw distance on the gpu plug-in to zoom way out so you can click far away which is helpful if you want to try to chisel all 10 sapphires in one go you also want at least the karamja easy diary done and the karamja gloves equipped because it makes everything cheaper so that way we only have to spend an average of 34.5 tackle per sapphire if you didn't have gold bars you may have noticed the shop also sucks gold ore the price starts at 195 tackle and if you take the cast room conversion into consideration that means it costs over 2 000 gp per gold ore so i would highly highly recommend waiting until after gargle or grotesque guardians task or hunting eclectics or anything else that gives gold ore or bars right before you do this method after we finish making the sapphire rings we start running to the unloader to unnote 10 gold bars and during the run back we're going to be manually enchanting the recoils you could just afk enchant if you want but that's a lot slower then while i'm here i equip the suffering for a second to unnote and drink a stamina and then unequip the ring again because we need to be able to use the recoils on it there's a lot of variables for this method like for example if you were using gold ore instead of bars you would instead have a staff of fire and then water and nature runes in your room pouch so that way you can super heat on your way to the furnace to save time although if you were doing that you'd probably want to bring a goldsmith gauntlet switch another tip is that you'd probably want to make sure your npc attack options are hidden because if you accidentally attack a monster all the surrounding monsters attack you as well and that would be an easy way to wipe i love showing methods like this and it's the whole reason i wanted to play uim in the first place so i hope this gave some insight all these staminas here that never happened six hours later turns out we did buy enough taco here we go fill up the ring of suffering a hundred thousand charges that should hopefully last at least until the league starts which was just announced today by the way october 28th which is one month from now less than a month even okay looking at the xp here you can see it did end up being about six hours in total averaging 30.6k crafting xp per hour you get 90 xp overall for each ring that we make uh that means that we made about 340 rings of recoil per hour which is also the equivalent of 13.6 k charges on the recoil per hour i'm sure you could make more than 340 recoils per hour with this method but just in general i'm not efficient plus i was streaming it which also brings the efficiency down but i'm sure you can get over 350 per hour this is so much nicer compared to the other method i showed previously which was an episode 96 by the way when i showed the other method for making recoils using blast furnace and kilogram that was 240 recoils per hour at max efficiency so this is like 1.5 times better pretty much oh i'm so excited to get back into slayer though okay uh i'm gonna go afk sacred heelfish because i've been here all day i need to get some food in my belly i got some gold bars left over too which i'll drop over to the main it looks like we also used up like a little bit over 100 doses of stamina okay well you can see i just spent all of last night fishing and it's mooring now and we just had the game update i was taking a look at the post here there's not much really notable for you i am but one thing that i do want to point out is that right here this very last thing in other news is that after you kill cerberus those fire pools or whatever will now disappear versus previously those pools would stay there for like a few seconds and you still took damage which was a little bit annoying i never really thought that deep into it but this is a pretty nice update for serb but i've been afking long enough let's go get ready to kill some kq b gloves are getting reacquired this is how you know i'm serious about slayer oh my gosh i haven't had these for such a long time now beerus gloves then we also got the slayer helm dragging the fender and dragon ballax out the stash unit oops actually i'm going to go and get black dehyde chops i tend to just carry them around with me anyways when i'm doing slayer because i do usually have at least a couple empty bag slots the chaps only take a couple minutes to get i just grab the shield from up here and then go to the myths guild and it's really fast if you remember back when we were killing corp we got black dehyde chaps g from the elite now we can't take them out unless we ever get that top which i'd really really like to get because even though it's not really necessary it would be kind of convenient just always having that extra slot free like i don't have to always hold on to those chaps but like it's just kind of nice always being able to grab it on the fly you know if you say five minutes every couple days that does add up a little bit over time there is an update pretty recently while i was doing corp that was voted into the game uh there's a shortcut right here to get into guten off for this clue step right here instead of having to run all the way around here now if you have 71 agility you can just climb over those rocks and get straight to the step yo we got three kinds of caskets here easy through heart so here's the easy okay actually we have those already uh medium and the hard all right then so when i enter my poh like you know usually when i'm doing california queen or any other boss what i want to do is go to my pool and then go to the fairy ring but if i go to the pool you can see it paths me over here but ideally i want to be pathed over here so i save a couple tiles i know it doesn't seem like that big of a deal but over time after doing hundreds or i mean thousands of trips eventually over time that will add up so we're going to building mode and i'll show you a little trick what we can do actually we have this fern planted over here so i'm gonna go into the viewer and then rotate this room okay and now you can see the plant is over here so we're gonna re-enter the poh and when we click on the pool it'll pad us to this tile instead of having us down over here and please ignore this bag plant my inventory i ran the dps calc and apparently the mid cape actually is better than the fire cape for the hosta on crush at least in this situation against kq also wanted to point out that when we were killing corp we got addy bar drops and very early on we completely filled up the blowpipe with darts so we have 16.3 k unfortunately that means if we do get a gargoyle's task i probably won't do grotesque guardians because i only fight them if i need more addy darts but it's a very nice feeling having a full blowpipe well pretty much almost full we're starting off this task with 335 kc also rank 32 and you can see we have plenty of all the drops we just need the pet and the jar oh forgot one last thing i use vengeance kq so we gotta buy venge runes and we're gonna start with one mil gp for slayer and just i don't see it go up over time first ever slayer xp we've gained in such a long time we've got a fat task ahead of us oh man this is so fun dude oh he's got an elite clue oh wow okay all right we got the elite casket all right there's a cow fight queen head that's some prayer xp four heads in 366. all right cake you head give me that 2.5 k prayer xp thank you i want the blue helm eventually i want to get the vorkat helm oh there we go 103 virtual level of cooking crashed by the freaking noob feels bad i guess we'll get like half the xp from the kill damn dude okay i can't even type damn it i tried now that we have fouled a relief done this patch will never die so don't have to compost it so be first priority for magic trees okay there is 400kc at my queen ah there's this cute noob here who speaks spanish and he said he was killing zoro and asteroids from and i said america and he was surprised i spoke spanish and i understood it and just said he's gonna kill zora very wholesome interaction and we have a hundred and three fishing there's another caliphate queen head thank you very much kq five in 455 kq is great per xp according to the twitch chat apparently this is me right now not doing chord i'm doing corporate the ornament kid on the coffee queen ornament kit damn bro oh that's annoying yeah my instrument just went out but we have an hour yo okay apparently i actually teleport down time here we are we got everything on us and we're outside the house portal and looks like the internet literally just came back to you okay dragon chain body look at that man if only it was 2004 right now he'd be an absolute beast but we're just going to outlook it for 150k i don't know why i keep dc tonight i don't know what's wrong with the internet but i guess we'll just come back and finish the task in the morning you see we only have eight kills left apparently last night or i guess this morning there's an internet outage in my area from 1am to 6am that is prime gaming time wake up jagex okay there's the end of the cow fight queen task at 10 to 12 kills per hour it only took like 12 to 15 hours or something 488 kc we got a few uniques during it we used up 3.5 k charges on the recoil kq goes through a lot the total loot from this task was worth a little bit over 7 mil and then the loot i dropped over to the main in total is a little bit over two mil also forgot to mention about the myth cape before besides that it's just better dps for the hosta it also makes the warhammer spec more accurate and i use it to get to the myth skill to cook my food and speaking of food we went through almost a thousand sharks so at some point i have to go back to minnows to fish more because if i don't we will be running out of these pretty soon and the rank for cow fight queen with 448 kc is rank 20. we are now front page uim calpha queen killer after what's that like three cow fight tasks i love dead game mode high scores okay i'm actually really happy about this we just got blue dragon task which of course means forecast oh i'm actually really hyped because i've been wanting to get rid of this assembler for a long time only issue is that we need a voracath head for the range gate because right now the range cape only picks up 72 percent of the ammo versus the 80 percent we would get if we use divorce head on it it's really weird because when i was sacred wheel fishing the last two nights i was doing all these dps calcs for vorkath because i was like really hyped together eventually because i knew obviously once we go back to slayer we will eventually get a blue dragon task so i know all the things i want to do to prepare for this i'm very excited okay i'm about to spend a lot of money here there we go 1.6 million gp spent to buy these runes we're gonna be adding the barrows teleport into the nexus here first off there's at least one or maybe even a couple clue steps around the barrows area i don't actually plan to do barrows anymore on this account but there is a statute here that can hold a full barrow set i have my derrick set in there and we actually have to go number zone right now i remember this tunnel too this is specifically the one that's the tunnel as long as they don't actually open the chest this will always be my tunnel there we go we have it you know i was thinking about it it would kind of be best to keep on doing barrows until i get like this mound or that mound to be my tunnel but i really don't care that much i come here like once every few months anyways speaking of convenient teleports the drainer manor teleport and the nexus is super fast to get the locator orb all right well you know what apparently it costs 800k points to imbue the salvy but we're set up for it anyways you also only get 80 of the points back when you unview things so can't hurt to have a few extra points spend a little bit of time here hopefully i have enough gp in the coffer to pay for the run while we're chilling here at nightmare zone let's take a minute to look at the dps for forecast the left side right here is the setup i'll be going with the right side is just a comparison to if i was to do melee but you can see that using range is gonna be like double the dps versus just using a hosta so it says 82 seconds per kill is the expected kill time with my range setup pretty sure that doesn't include the time walking the acid and eating as well but if i were to just constantly be hitting it that's my average kill time 82 seconds with range versus 138 seconds with melee i have 91 herb wars so i could make anti-venom pluses i have to make a pie and then boost and honestly the amount of time it saves well i'll show you if we were to use void instead of the surplum set up it'd be 79 seconds on average per kill now i may have entered some of the dps wrong but the gist of it is that it won't save the amount of time that it would take for me to actually go out my way to make all those extra potions just for a one-time deal because of course i can't just keep a stack of anti-ven pluses in the bank for the future okay and apparently i just died at night rezone wasn't really paying attention salve amulet has been imbued a potion i would like to make though while we're killing vorkath or like in between the trips is the super anti-fire potions because i'll have the anti-fighters on me anyways all i have to do is crush up the superior dragon bones and then put them in the potions as i go but we need 92 herblore for that and luckily we are very close to 92 herblore from the california queen task we got some herbs that we have to clean too i'll make some prayer pots out of the ran ours and then for the remaining xp that we need i have dwarf weeds and wines of zamrak so we can just make more range pots and get more xp and there's 92 herblore you can see we also made 1.2 k doses of ranging pot but i'm gonna finish cleaning all these herbs and then we will gear up for vorkath we have to kill dust devils because i'll be using the crumble undead spell so i want to get dust runes so i'll probably get like maybe two or three drops from them the dust rings won't be good also gonna buy a pestle and mortar and keep that on me so we can crush the bones as we go to get to vorkath we now have the fremek boots 4 which we didn't have in the past and teleports us straight to relica which is a very short run to work from here now here's why i have what i have it is better to use the bgs but if i were to put the warhammer into the bag i'd have to hold on to items from the bgs dash unit and that would take it more inventory space which isn't a good thing in fact i might actually end up putting the warhammer into the bag if it proves to not be too effective i don't have much forecast kc on this account we have 52 kc and we're rate 90 at the moment i've never really done vorkath on any other account either this is the account they have the most forecast kc on i have the slayer staff because it's one of the few staffs that can cast crumble undead so when we switch to it as of like a year ago or something when you switch weapons it keeps the attack style so for stavs it keeps the spell which means all we have to do is click on the staff and then click on the spawn we don't have to actually go to the spellbook and then find crumble undead and then click on the spawn so it's slightly convenient but definitely not necessary we have some major upgrades now over what we had last time we have rigger now i think we had 80 something range now we have 99 we actually have the assembler which i got at 50kc exactly you only get one guaranteed warcap head which is at 50kc otherwise it's 1 out of 50. but we have just over 100 kills to do it's one out of 50 and i want to get two of them so hopefully we can meet the drop rate i want to get one for the range cape and then i want to recolor my slayer home to blue if we at least just get one i'll be happy so i can drop the assembler after this task my pb is 233 so hopefully we can up that by at least a little bit before the end of the task here's the full setup kind of for my own reference in the future as well let's begin i don't know how the acid walks i'll just be doing this thing the whole time if i want to lure on this account it'd be kind of annoying if i died because of like all the stuff i have to get back with the looting bag and everything so one day i'll learn on a different account oh yeah and see just switch the staff and then just click on it very easy no more switching to the spell book okay i'll just be doing one kill trip so here's the first kill and i'll show you what we'll be doing with the bones here i'll be dropping everything that i can't alk over to the main because well i don't need crafting xp and i don't need the money that could potentially come from it either oh yeah it looks like uh first try we beat the pb not surprise okay let's figure out how this works first so i want to make these uh anti-fires into four dose potions and then i guess we just crush up the bones here use them on the anti-fire and there we go 130 xp per bone and now we have super anti-fires just for reference here's the dragonfire chart so we're killing vorkath which is this last column right here previously we used pre-mage and anti-fire which means the max hit was a 20 with the fire breath attack but with the super anti-fire it's now going to be 10. okay i see how this is going to go so after every kill i'm going to teleport to the ge while i'm crushing the superior dragon bones i'll note a couple of these anti-fires get the herblor xp and then decant those back into windows potions i guess the real question it comes down to is what would i rather do with the bones get prayer xp or herbal rxp i'm probably just going to end up dropping the super antiplayers over to the main anyways because i'm pretty sure vorecath's the only place i'd even use anti-fires in the first place and i don't know how much of this boss i'd want to do in the future it's pretty tedious on the uim somehow managed a two-kill trip but probably won't be able to do these very often at all do you risk it do you risk it don't kill me please yes oh we got an elite clue cool i just caught an eclectic and we got a medium from that as well guess we got two clues to do then yo we got the elite all right we'll start with opening the medium okay and here's the elite all right that's pretty cool though it's one of 65 so we got it pretty much on the right okay i decided i'm done making these super anti-fires for the rest of the task we have plenty of doses here i only need one dose per kill so for the rest of the task i'll just use the bones on the altar here it's going to give us 375 xp per bone 750 guaranteed prxp per kill and if i'm not making the potions that means i could free up two inventory slots which means i'll have two more food and because of that hopefully i'll be able to get some more two kill trips because i'm not getting them too consistent right now every once in a while i can get a two kill trip but hopefully this should make them more consistent yeah there's gonna be a hundred kc at forecast oh 148 pb that will probably be tough to beat oh yes there it is the vore cap head i guess we were technically double the drop rate since the one guaranteed one is guaranteed so 107 kc first workout head i earned on my own oh yes okay so we'll grab the range cape out of the cape rack here and once we use the vore cat head on the cape yes it will consume it there we go 20 of the ammunition always gets destroyed no matter what but now that we use the head on the range cape it will not pick up 80 instead of 72 like it did before this is also applied to the max cape as well which obviously will never be relevant to this account but for those of you out there the max cape also would now pick up 80 of ammunition because if you didn't know the max cape has the perks of every single skill cape combined into one and we're also getting a pure level there's 87 prayer it's really weird because the whole time doing court for two months i gained zero levels and then just today we gained two levels total levels are very very far and few between for me at this point so gaining two levels in one day is just completely unheard of for me oh my god okay wait that's another four cath head 123 kc i've been waiting so long to do this every time i get a head from any boss i'm just like yeah i'm gonna turn in for prayer xp because i'm going to get the vorkat slayer home recolor we just got the abyssal head right here and we could use that to make the red slayer helm but i will be eventually making the blue one because you can store the forecast head in there so for the slayer helm the only recolored slayer hell i would personally make is the vorkat helm because it's essentially like storing an assembler in there the only slider home i want to get on this account would be the vort one because you could store a vore cathode in there meaning you could in a way like store an assembler and now here we go with an extra voracat undead head for 1 000 slater points we have 2.7 k so we have plenty now anytime we want we can put a vort head oh that's not the slighter home and now anytime i want i could just put a vorthead into this layer home yep there it is and also anytime i want i can take it out of this layer helm wait do you have to well let me drop all this stuff so you can see it there we go there's the vorkat head back so if i ever want to get an assembler on the fly for any reason i could just take the vorkat head out of the slayer helm yeah that looks freaking sweet i'm so happy with that blue's my favorite color also you know kind of fits the theme of mudkip as well man i love a happy ending after we got head twice today all right i'm still gonna finish the voracat task though we got like 41 kills to go so i mean there's a decent chance we'll probably get another head any more that we do get though is just gonna be prayer xp yo we got that undead head voice okay i don't know how i managed it but somehow we ended up getting a three kill trip i know a lot of you watching the video probably get like 10 kill trips and stuff but i'm a uim okay it's different okay something i just realized i was looking at the high scores and i was checking temple apparently i'm probably gonna get the six hour record i realized i haven't logged off for almost six hours so i decided to check we're about to break the six hour record assuming i do this refreshing thing properly which is kind of annoying because if i knew i could beat a record i definitely could have got a lot more kills than i did end up getting because you know i was like making the potions earlier i was making the helmets and the range cape and all that stuff i think it's actually one more kill we have to get to break the record and we're about to get five minute lux illiterate up okay nice there we go uh let's grab this stuff and log out and see if we did it okay just refresh let's go down to six hour oh look at that yo dead game mode temple os rs ranks which mean absolutely nothing let's freaking go boys wait i have a picture that actually feels really relevant here what do you think dude i actually could have gotten so many more kills if i'd realized that like i could be going for a record it was like the last thing on my mind until i realized it had been like five hours since i logged out man i was on discord youtube i even went to the bathroom a few times okay pretty fun day of slayer today off to stake reels now i was just looking at the xp over 50k prayer xp just from doing forecast for like half the day not all this xp's accurate because a lot of it was from kq earlier but we'll finish up the task either later tonight or tomorrow morning there we go the slayer task is complete at 165 or cat casey oh my god okay i just want to do a couple more kills for the thing on the high scores which doesn't really matter too much it's just kind of a personal thing this was the last kill i was planning to do and we just that's got aboard some free prxp but um yeah i'm gonna collect all this stuff and then i'll refresh the high scores show you what i was talking about so this is all i was going for with a couple extra kills i just want to get an extra rank for the day record it's a very arbitrary goal it really doesn't mean much but yeah here's uh the dark altar and we're gonna use the head on there and we're gonna get a thousand per xp all right we have a little bit over 300k worth of super amplifier that's getting dropped over to the main the loot from these kills came out to about 13.5 mil and i'll show you the stuff i dropped over to the main everything i picked up on the main ended up being worth 6.1 mil uh i guess i was averaging like was that 11 to 12 kills per hour overall it's a lot faster than the last time i killed vorkath on this account like seven months ago pb i ended up with was 148 and the rank we started at rank 90 and we ended up with rank 39 with the 168kc it's kinda crazy because i pretty much doubled my voracath kc like across all accounts i've ever done since this is really the only account that killed warcathon for the most part and the last order of business to take care of is to drop the assembler it served us well for a very very long time it's been stuck in the inventory for a very long time um i don't believe there's actually high out value i think it's just the game's notional value of it yeah so we're gonna say goodbye to it and say hello to the trend rangescape there it is this is gonna be the new thing that's not gonna be stuck in our inventory no matter what pvm we do because it's kind of cringe like doing cracking or doing serb and having the assembler in my inventory so now we don't have to take up that extra spot for any pvm that doesn't require range i'll put the stats on screen as a comparison between the assembler and the range cape the range cape is actually better in certain situations like it's better for hydra because of the prayer bonus uh maybe some other places as well but hydra is the main place that stands out where the range cape is better but in the past i wasn't able to use the rangescape of hydra because i only have the 72 instead of the 80 i mean i could have used it but then i'd have the assembler in my inventory and there'd be darts on the ground from it as well the assembler does have a range strength bonus which i don't know maybe that adds a max hit sometimes i'm not nerdy do the dps calc any second now though it's gonna disappear hey get out the shot okay goodbye assembler there it goes farewell old friend i really could have done work at any time to replace the assembler i just didn't really care enough the salve ei does not stack with the slayer helm so there's no like extra boost from being on task i just want to get this layer xp really but that is going to wrap it up for this video next video we are going to continue on with the slayer grind hopefully catch more sharks because that stack is starting to go down a little bit and it's kind of scaring me because i go through a lot probably like a thousand per task or something so yeah thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed and i hope that you have a great day and i will see you again next time
