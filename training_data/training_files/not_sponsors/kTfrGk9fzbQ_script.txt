there's a presence that's missing without jake packing up and moving back to la how can we build him some sort of presence some sort of avatar that will let him do his job in a physical sense as well [Music] we're gonna actually take the first step into bringing jake back into the studio oh what ups huh [Music] today is a very special day because jake is in the studio from texas he's been here for a day and i'm already noticing a palpable productivity increase now you guys might just know jake from the sponsored segments you know brandi o'daniel as we call him a lot of people don't realize he's our producer a lawyer he does a lot of like the back end stuff you don't see on camera i mean really what he does allows everything else to happen here but now that he's in texas it's like there's a presence that's missing things have gotten a little bit lacks since jake went to texas people are getting soft it's no no surprise that smash brothers is popular and you know if you ask a couple people in the studio they'd say too popular imagine if jake was here all the time we could probably put out at least another video a week so the question is you know without jake packing up and moving back to la how can we build him some sort of presence some sort of avatar that will let him do his job in a physical sense as well about a week ago i think technology got there you know elon musk announced his uh tesla bot i think we're there so what we're gonna do today is jake and i we're gonna actually take the first step into bringing jake back into the studio and we're gonna kind of figure out how to actually make this a reality what is a jake what who is jake watson let's start with the essence because the essence will inform our purpose he's a leader so he needs to you know have some sort of authority you wear some genes always that say you know i'm not afraid of some hard work positive affirmation present in the daily happenings of the studio and i think that's absolutely critical in our design here like if it if it doesn't have my presence then the whole thing's a wash i think we're gonna need some servo controlled arms yes and opposable thumbs [Music] this hat will house it'll have like a little hole for the camera sheriff sheriff star on there yeah it's gonna need a high resolution camera 4k streaming a shirt with velcro on it and we can put different brands on with the velcro oh my god that's a great idea the blaring alarm will be for when smash has gone on for too long or just when it's gone on at all you know we'll just cut it out all together yeah yeah i mean people need breaks though sometimes you know it's pretty healthy for breaks like smash is good for the morale you know like once in a while i'm not sure you really understand what we're trying to build here yeah let's move on let's move on it needs to know how to do business and crunch numbers yes yes let's just add a snow cone maker to it what's a happier thing than a snow cone and you can eat it at your desk i like raspberry snow cones led lights yeah but then also on top of that it records everything that everyone says all the time so you want to record everything yeah and then it's like listen i'm listening it's present don't you get it okay yeah well let's move on but we'll definitely add the recording thing all the time video it's cool let's move on this whole thing together no matter how much it costs we'll be able to recoup it probably in a very short amount of time and i think now is the perfect time to do it because sam and nico are out this week so they're not here to tell me not to spend this money which i think is really important because when they come back they'll see how much money i've saved i'm pretty happy with this i think what we need to do is bring down nat who's our resident maker she knows a lot about the tech that's actually going to make this happen and i think she'll be able to actually give us a tangible maybe dollar cost and time frame for like how long it's going to take her to make it what we have here is going to change everything [Music] [Applause] 60 frames per second 4k yeah and recording literally everything all the time audio visual lit everything if there's if we can record anything else let's record it not everything but some things one note on size kind of tall guy you know six feet tall about so we just figured let's make it 12. 12 feet tall if we don't fear the robot version of you how are we going to get anything done so zero productivity loss and pretty much a whole lot of productive future i think i can do this i'm gonna run the numbers and get back to these guys uh because this is gonna be a really cool build i think if anyone can do this it's nat i've seen some of the stuff she's built she knows how to model she knows 3d printing she knows like electronics this is completely ridiculous this is stupid sam nico said they don't want me using the hambone jar for anything but what really is this money for i'm just going to give them just a ridiculously high number we've got like almost 20 dollars in here probably gonna cover us yes okay got a number give it to a stranger i'm gonna give it to you gay with all the considerations there's a lot of things going on here um i here's here's the number i'm thinking of um 69 420. um is this in uh yen it's in bitcoin listen this is the price of living in the future what if we take out the snow cone machine okay well i got to think about this um you know when i said that we could spend anything on this anything was you know it was rhetorical plan b plan b [Music] so [Music] gotta go with the flow sometimes you get hired and the person that hires you lives here and then they decide to leave in the middle of your career you're talking about jake baby i know you guys think there's this huge rivalry and there might be and i'm coming for his job and i might be but it wasn't always like this you know me and jake used to work together all the time and then he just left one thing that i know about jake is that jake loves squarespace it's crazy to think that someone just up and leaves something so important to them today's video is sponsored by you guessed it squarespace it's jake's desk who sometimes it is sometimes it's not but i'm here to talk about squarespace squarespace has a huge array of

explained to you i've got this problem right i'm in texas the people are here in the studio and i i need somebody to represent me here in the studio you know you are a class act when it comes to your abilities to portray characters on screen the best thing we can do is to have you just sort of absorb my mannerisms my personality right like everything that do the way that i interact and then start to become me okay right yeah the less that i'm here the less productive the studio is i mean usually when i research a character you know i really like to to like find the clothing what you do on a regular day basis yeah so let's start there i think it's time to give you a jake over these are my favorite pair of pants right here you can see i wear them a lot mm-hmm i mean life i'm known to wear the corridor hat from time to time i really get it i think this is going great so far i'm really excited to introduce him to the final piece of this avatar but i think in the meantime you know we'll just get him in these clothes get him comfortable really just observe what it's like day in the life of jake oh it's jake it's actually working it's actually working pretty well welcome thank you for the sponsored segment by squarespace how was this son it's working great yeah yes okay great okay come here let's come into the light what do you think yeah this one this one brett you're starting to really look the part but there's one more thing you gotta be the part okay so what's happening right now is that there's a smash game going on and what i usually do around this time when the game's been going on for too long i just show up and i start harassing everybody telling them to get back to work does this happen regularly yeah this happens like every day damn it we can't let that happen right guys what are we uh what are we doing here guys hey nat yeah you know what you've been wasting a lot of time here to put that controller down and get back to work from behind it literally looks exactly like damn what's up do you like working here yes i was playing this game and i'm like oh god jake's here but it was red dude i think it's brett it's not breath what about this makes it feel like it's not me in the face the face face what about the face it's not you're not jake's face i mean it's a tough job you know i mean from my experience so far from today no one really listens to you i think there's just really there's just one more part we need to go over that's really gonna just complete the illusion the final part of the costume oh my god yes dude oh my god that's something we made this contraption it's very realistic yeah i it's uh super realistic should i uh should i put you on i mean yeah i don't feel i don't know son this is a scary moment i feel like this is the final transformation oh my god dude what's up jake sponsored by squarespace this is amazing dude yeah i think we should go into the studio and see if they even recognize that anything is different at all jake you want to tap in with dean yeah i'd love to hop in with dean let's go see what he's up to hey dean man how are you doing all right man what are you what are you what are you chopping away at there are you've been eating a lot of salt your head looks a little like puffed up no not any more than normal i mean just the normal amount of salt i've been working out a little bit more and um you know just really just excited to be here in the studio with you guys i know i don't get to do that every day but i think um that will change yeah i'm really i'm really hoping this is the new you hey so good to see you man you're here with me right now aren't you yeah i'm just checking in to see how the edits going we got another day or so we're going to give them a little bit longer react sessions so we're excited about that i'm super excited for that that's great yeah man it's gonna be good what's going on over on this side of the studio let's go see what griffin is up to man i love that guy dude hey i saw that fingerboard video that you and daniel put together it looks like a lot of fun man do you mind if i try it right here with your little set here's my own personal board right there oh man this brings me back you know whatever [Music] that was amazing i'm so glad i got to do that thank you so much jake what are you doing you look good red how was your trip up north i mean my trip started off great it didn't end that great but you know i can't complain oh everything okay i know i got in a car accident uh i got rear ended not my fault though i just i gotta wait three months for it to get fixed jeez man i'm sorry to hear that i know how much you love that car yeah so anyway how's it going man what are you working on this week i'm i'm just it's going all right i'm just very intimidated by your presence your inner pupillary distance is measured in meters look i don't want you to be intimidated by my presence i just figured we can do some cool work at the studio here together maybe i can sit down next to you and we can work this out [Music] yeah let's uh let's let's work on this i'm working on uh how many solar panels could power the world okay yeah this is better yeah this is this is better do you want to go start filming for that do you need me in any of the scenes because i could be in any of the scenes that you need oh good i think uh you know what you just take care of you know management and running the business all good high fives [Music] with any luck i can start to be here in the studio every day do you think that would be better yeah no i think i think that would really raise morale around here i always appreciate it man no one even noticed that it was an avatar version of me played by brett it just goes to show you that people don't notice things and as long as you are there in spirit that's what really matters i cannot wait to be in the studio with everybody and really just make a more positive impact each and every day it's going to be great brett oh man it works i'm sorry i you know i channeled every you know all the things i've studied about you for years yes you know brett i i thought when this started that i was actually gonna have to fire you because you couldn't see um but i think that uh i think you're hired man um i mean i'll have to check the schedule i can't come in every day from like 10 to like 7 30. um we talked about it just being kind of one day thing uh i don't know i i've got a kind of a life to live so i don't know if i can uh wear this mask of you all all day you know yeah um i i
