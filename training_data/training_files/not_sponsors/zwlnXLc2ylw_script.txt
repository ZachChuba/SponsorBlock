today we're going to look at the problem of hiding postal addresses and other sensitive information in youtube videos [Music] so let's say i was going to do an unboxing video of this box actually i don't know what's in this box sounds like it might be sausages or something yeah i think it must be sausages because i can see they've spilled some of the catch up there when they were wrapping it up so anyway if we're going to do an unboxing video of this box we want to hide the recipient's address and we want to hide the sender's address now i've seen a lot of bad solutions to this on youtube some people use painters tape this printer's tape is actually a case in point really not very good at obscuring anything other painters tapes are more opaque than this but still typically a single layer doesn't completely obscure the address some people might scribble that out with a fat marker but i've seen cases where again when it catches the light in the right way you can read the text underneath typically i use electrical tape up until now again a single layer doesn't really quite obscure the address and whilst it's not expensive this stuff it costs money and it seems like an awful waste to use vinyl tape on something for a single use we could use a more opaque tape like this this is the really good stuff this is completely opaque but it seems like that's overkill for something like this and it kind of offends me a little bit to use such good tape as this for a single use purpose such as obscuring an address on a parcel that's going to be thrown away and so i was thinking that maybe i would get some opaque labels i'd buy some opaque labels and stick on there but again they were quite expensive and so i thought maybe paper will do it so but a single sheet of paper again isn't going to completely obscure that address i could use card but again we're going more complex and expensive then so my solution to this was to print an obfuscatory sheet and the way i did that i just went into powerpoint powerpoint being the graphical design tool of choice for professionals and just for a bit of fun i found a whole load of synonyms in english for the words meaning to obscure things or to hide them or to make them less clear i love the english language because it has so many synonyms to choose from really if you want to do this very securely random data would be better but we're just kind of having a bit of fun here and this will be good enough i just colored those all different to make it more difficult to filter those out and then set them so they overlap each other and then copied that pasted it all the way down the page so we've got a full page of overlapping jumbled text so when it's printed out here's what it looks like and we can just cut a piece of this cut the piece of the approximate size we could do this more neatly if we chose to but there's really no reason to and we can fix that over the address let's see what that looks like when it's stuck in place there we go that's what it's like when it's stuck in place and i'm fairly confident that it's going to be quite impossible to recover the text from underneath that especially once this has been through the youtube compression algorithm so there we go that's how to make obfuscatery paper for concealing addresses on unboxing videos on youtube i hope this has been interesting and useful thanks for watching and i hope to see you again soon you
