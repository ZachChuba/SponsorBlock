time to save universe again then is it there's no better icon of girl power than the tough girl character type anything a man can do she can do just as well or better we can trace her roots all the way back to Greek mythology whose all-female warriors the Amazons Athena the goddess of war and wisdom and Artemis the goddess of the hunt personified female strength this type rose to popularity in the 70s somebody has to save our skins and in modern times iconic on-screen tough girls like Trinity Ripley or furiosa have made this trope a staple of the action and superhero movie genres but why do movies and TV rushed to equate female strength with being able to beat everyone up and why is the tough girl often kind of boring if we look closer at the tough girl on-screen we can break down the characteristics that define her she has extreme physical strength often superbly capable with amazing fighting skills the tough girl disproves the stereotype that women are fragile or weak in a hand no thanks I'm good her decisions are guided by logic not emotion since many of these characteristics are traditionally associated with men the tough girl can come across as a simple formulaic creation male physical power plus male rational temperament packaged in a female athletic body equals strong female character but the tough girl only becomes interesting when there's more to her personality and her story a compelling tough girl might be so hardened because she's experienced great pain or trauma or she may be tough out of necessity because she's a professional in a man's world I want to follow some semblance of procedure or trying to survive in a brutal cutthroat environment oh dear everything hurts you want to get through this do as I say it helps if she has other women in her story to define herself against and she's most captivating when she's got her fair share of flaws which combined with her superpowers to form the complex psychology of a real person is there whiskey miss I am here is our take on what the tough girl represents in our culture and why it's essential for any good character to be more than strong here we go this video is brought to you by brilliant a problem

types of tough girls on-screen let's start with type 1 the only tough girl this characters whole personality is that she's tough she is frequently not the protagonist of the story she's more likely there to support a man and service his development the only tough girl exemplifies what writer Tasha Robinson termed Trinity syndrome referring to carrion mosses character in the matrix Robinson writes of the hugely capable woman who never once becomes as independent significant and exciting as she is in her introductory scene [Music] that's impossible the movie never considers that Trinity might be the one herself her role is to fall in love with this person and facilitate his transformation into a hero so while the only tough girl arrives with a bang and the movie announces she's superficially edgy awesome and of course strong she isn't allowed to contribute meaningfully to the plot she's more or less the token woman the tough girl is set up as the polar opposite of the damsel in distress come with me if you want to not die yet these two in verse character types tend to be strangely similar in their limitations both are accessories in a male story my name is [ __ ] Galore one positive example of the tough girl Sarah Connor in the Terminator franchise takes on true complexity because she illuminates this relationship between the damsel and tough girl types she begins as a helpless damsel in the first movie I mean am i tough organized I came to balance my checkbook but transforms into a fierce fighter by the 1991 sequel an evolution made possible by actress Linda Hamilton's intensive physical training I come from the physical fitness world where you reshape and resculpt your body but that were there so there was extraordinary the only tough girl is often the lone featured woman in her cast was sophia MacDougall argues that often an interesting male character has a huge range of other characters of his own gender around him so that he never has to act as any kind of ambassador or representative for maleness but if the tough girl is the only woman with significant screen time in her story she takes on the burden of epitomizing all women thus she can't really show weakness in any way or this could be interpreted as a statement that women are weak the end result is a character who's forced to be perfect and therefore boring 2015's Mad Max fury road corrects the lone female problem by showing effectively three generations of tough girls you kill creepy with that do you killed everyone I have a mid out here hey Jose oh snap right now Madonna and Charlize Theron's furiosa takes on emotional power and her mission because she's helping other women fury road assiduously corrects the other traps of the only tough girl as well furiosa and male lead max aren't a couple but a great team each taking a turn rescuing the other nor does he overshadow her inability at one point after max repeatedly fails to shoot the approaching enemy he even hands the gun to furiosa knowing she can do it thanks to its conscious attempts to avoid common tough-girl pitfalls this installment of the classically macho Mad Max franchise was hailed as a feminist action film by Eve Ensler author of The Vagina Monologues and a consultant on the movie you can get it so what turns an only tough girl into a strong woman who's genuinely empowering and inspiring to female viewers this brings us to type 2 the tough girl plus in addition to her strength she has other qualities that make her interesting like a sharp logical mind morbid determination or wit and playfulness if the apocalypse comes beat me often this kind of tough girl is the main character or one of them and she's not the only woman so she doesn't have to stand in for femaleness in general one of the all-time best examples of the tough girl plus is ripley in the Alien franchise I can handle myself yeah I noticed ironically a big reason this part was so good and appealing to star Sigourney Weaver is that it wasn't written for a woman screenwriter Dan O'Bannon and co-writer Ronald Shusett wrote all characters as generic males referring to them only by last name Kane Lambert Parker Brett Asch then marked them as unisex in the working script it was written in a very straightforward way this was a kind of direct person who didn't have these scenes where she was suddenly vulnerable and she didn't you know throw her hands up and and wait for someone else to save her she was a thinking moving deciding creature this story underlines that to write a riveting tough-girl you merely have to approach her like you would a male character which is to say conceive of her as a complex individual with agency Ridley Scott's direction and alien also treats Ripley no differently from the male's nothing in her costume makeup or camera framing is visually reminding us that she's a woman her face is frequently lit half in shadow a stereotypically male lighting technique that emphasizes her serious dilemma rather than bathing her in an even soft flattering glow to emphasize her beauty as a person Ripley displays both stereotypically male and female qualities she's traditionally masculine in that she's logical and cool headed in a crisis wait a minute we let it in the ship could be infected you know the quarantine procedures meanwhile men she works with are histrionic and impulsive overcome by emotions that's a bunch of horseshit we can take off without that like a stereotypical female Ripley also displays a nurturing side but her caring nature isn't presented as a womanly characteristic simply a human one as a result what stands out about her is not her gender but her humanity Buffy the Vampire Slayer also imagined a world where a woman was put in the type of singular heroic role usually given to a man one girl in all the world a chosen one with the strength and scale to hunt the vampires Buffy was fiercely loyal and appealingly quippy we thought you were a myth well you were mistaken and her life was interesting because she had to balance her Slayer duties with being a normal teenage girl I was afraid that I was gonna be behind all my classes that I wouldn't make any friends and that I would have last month's hair I didn't think there'd be vampires on campus so the tough girl plus type proves that Oh in combination with her other human qualities does a woman's toughness become genuine and gripping to watch an important subcategory of the tough girl is the tough girl professional she works in a high-stakes male-dominated field like law enforcement and regularly confronts intense pressure without cracking she's believing her kidnapped response team in three years through the grinder since she got here in jail blamed she's in the frontline she likely also faces some bullying or exclusion from her mostly male colleagues in this context toughness is a job requirement the tough girl professional needs to act like a man in order to be taken seriously I don't think she's a little young for the hard stuff Washington says she's a killer but over time keeping up this hard front can have adverse side effects this career woman often has few close relationships it's been a while since I'm assuming a bra and zero dark thirty CIA agent Maya ends the movie by herself on a huge plane unable to answer a simple question where home is where do you want to go a related subtype is the tough girl born of pain extreme suffering usually in her backstory is the key to unlocking this woman's strength when Thanos took my homeworld he killed my parents in front of me he tortured me turned me into a weapon in fact one of the definitions of tough is able to endure hardship or pain the best example of the tough girl born of pain may be uma thurman's bride in Kill Bill who goes on a ruthless quest for revenge after she's brutally attacked on her wedding day it's mercy compassion and forgiveness I lack rationality the seemingly fearless furiosa also survived a formative trauma I was taken as a child stolen and Lisbeth's backbone in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is likewise a response to the misogynistic violence she's endured the story comments on how her fortitude comes at a cost as for all her badass qualities this emotionally scarred person lives a lonely life she's had a rough life Andrea please these examples remind us that whether she shaped by a hostile work environment or a terrible trauma too often a woman must be tough because she's oppressed by a man's world you know we get a lot of detectives here but I must say I can't ever remember one is attractive so while the tough girls defining quality is admirable it's also a depressing symptom of a cruel messed-up Society it's not something we want to hold up as an ideal for young women because why should any girl have to be so tough you don't have to be strong all the time Sina sometimes it's good for the soul to be soft the tough girls power is measured by a male metric through this lens toughness essentially comes down to physical strength and repressing emotion but the best tough girls excel because they hold on to their feminine qualities just wanted to save my sister sure in 1998's Mulan is decidedly not a girly girl yet she outshines the other soldiers thanks to feminine values like her profound love for her family and her creative way of thinking you're out of ideas not quite at the end of Sicario kate can't bring herself to pull the trigger on her immoral colleague while this could come across as weakness her enduring sense of decency and morality is a good thing unlike everyone around her she hasn't been corrupted madam axes furiosa and Star Wars Leia both represent the arguably feminine value of hope when I served under Leia she would say hope is like the Sun if you only believe in it when you can see it you'll never make it through the night their convictions may appear illogical and unrealistic in their dark pessimistic male-dominated worlds you know hope is a mistake but in the end that hope is earned and they assure in better peaceful eras for their societies so it turns out that having a softer side is crucial to winning audiences over it's also important for our female role models to glorify stereotypically feminine strengths instead of swearing them off William Moulton Marston the creator of Wonder Woman argued in 1943 not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force strength and power not wanting to be girls they don't want to be tender submissive peace-loving as good women are women's strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness the obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strengths of Superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman only love can truly save the world perhaps the real question we need to ask is what toughness looks like according to a female metric you don't know what it's like to really create something to create a life feel growing inside you all you know how to create his death and destroy we don't live in a primeval age where brute strength determines who leads so there's no reason that aggression should be held up as an asset to emulate a stereotypically male zest for violence or power only leads to a broken world but expressing your emotions openly being sensitive to others using what power you have to help the less powerful and willing to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves these are qualities that have the potential to heal it female characters who embody pure strength risk becoming unrealistically perfect Mary Sue's and many viewers just can't relate to someone who has no major flaws or weaknesses consider how few of our culture's most fascinating male protagonists would be summed up primarily as strong MacDougall argues that if strong male character compatibility was the primary criterion of writing heroes our fiction would be a lot poorer but it's within this claustrophobic little box that we expect our heroines to live out their lives while it's a great message that Captain Marvel the emcee use first woman to get her own movie has been labeled the franchise's most powerful character she's defined by her unprecedented strength she's one of the most powerful characters in the comics and will be the most powerful character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so her writers next challenge will be making sure she's more than just that and developing her into as much of a layered individual as beloved male heroes like Tony Stark big man in a suit of armor take that off what are you genius billionaire playboy philanthropist in recent years interest has grown in flawed female characters who may be a response to the male anti heroes that have long dominated prestige TV these women have real problems because why should the guys get to have all the fun what is wrong so when we think about the strong female character maybe we should start focusing not on whether she can win fights but on whether her writing is strong whether it feels true to a real multifaceted person movies like Terminator and die hard are unquestionably designed with a male audience in mind but in many cases the stereotypical tough girl doesn't feel like she's really for women always a pleasure now for a cold shower when she's treated it's eye candy or is only there to support the male protagonist this isn't how most female viewers want to see themselves if we broaden our understanding of what a tough girl looks like we can find many more unexpected examples who aren't ass-kicking spies but who do exhibit a inspiring real female strength while their power might go overlooked because of their femininity make no mistake they're as resilient as any macho male hero the real question isn't what strong women look like it's whether the world can handle the sheer force of their combined might I've been fighting with one arm tied behind my back what happens one I'm finally set free so are you ready this is Ripley last survivor of the Nostromo signing off this video is 200 people to click the link you'll get
