welcome to bronze man mode a series where i can only trade items where i first unlock them by pking them or iron manning them the goal of bronze men mode is to build a maxed out pking account and unlock every major item in pvp [Music] so i've got a plan for how i want to go about getting my fire cape and 52 agility is the start to that plan i also just decided to spend like 12 hours training my strengths so now i'm 74 strength kind of close to 75. so here's the plan my first milestone with this account is to get a fire cape and go peeking with it and it's about time we get after it once i actually achieve the fire cape and go peeking with it i'm going to upgrade this account to the next stage a zerker account so to put all of this into motion i'm going to need to do the quest rubbing elves for the crystal bow which will be my best and slot ranged weapon at least for jad in the fight cave 52 agility was just a piece of this puzzle since i could get 56 but i'll eventually need summer pies and 52 agility unlocks the wilderness agility course so with that unlocked i can hopefully find people that are using summer pies to boost their agility pk them for one and get that as an unlock here we go he's gone yep all right summer pie please let me go home nope [Music] of course yeah give it a pie all right this is just gonna stack yeah there we go summer pie all right we can get the hell out of here now we have those unlocked i'm actually gonna unlock burning amulets as well from this i actually didn't think to unlock those for a while that's underground pass that's regicide and with regicide i have actually unlocked zora at this point which i'm obviously not gonna do right now now i need roving elves and i have myself the crystal equipment which i think it might be advantageous for me to go get a crystal seed your blue splats yeah whatever you want to say man perfect only needed the one win first game in and out crystal see it unlocked so now i can actually uh upgrade this thing fully the way i want to i don't like running and hiding behind mushrooms who says that what a weird dork thing to say crystal bow but i'm going to use this and i'm going to make a new one i don't know if i talked to her about it i like to buy a bow 100k for new ones yup oh did i not need i didn't need that regardless i got my new bow man and i have a free bow from that too i look hot it actually feels good that this thing is going to be legitimately useful well before we go pee kang i do need to get my construction up i need exactly 6768 oak planks to get from 8 to 64. which is the level i want 800k to my name but at least we have the construction banked so maybe we can pk something nice out of this i could get this guy if he's risking like if he has the gmall and he wants to go in on that he's a bit slow yep [Music] okay yeah there you go exactly like i described anything good wrath runes unlock that's nice zamarak miter unlock ancient cloak that's a good unlock ow ow there's a fire cape and now he doesn't now he has the lack of coins did 500k i put the cage for the cape oh beautiful we're in hey that's an unlock [Music] oh my gosh like a sketch yeah dragon ball c unlock this could actually be pretty useful for training [Music] yeah at this point it's finally time to just get 60-something construction so i can get myself the pool so normally the way i build my stamina pool for special attack and run energy restoration is by getting 64 construction and building teak shelves too to get an easy plus three boost from the t you can make from it then you add the crystal saw for an extra plus three invisible boost and you can just build the stamina pool from there i'm not going to do that method this time because it's a bit costly to build the teak shelves too since you need two golden leaves so i'm just going to go the cheaper way by getting 63 construction and using the stew spice boosting method to get myself a 25 chance at getting at least a plus four boost i'll also still need the crystal saw of course but this method is definitely gonna be cheaper all right it's got 50. still obviously have a little bit to go but i can build myself a prayer alter now i can build myself a glory stand now i can get myself some portal chambers as well but i'm probably only going to do like two for now so i need to unlock teak planks and the best way for me to do that is to just cut down a teak log over here right by the ruins of oozer azure whatever it is do you think i'm the first person that's genuinely cut this tree down for genuine use because i just need one to unlock the logs to make the planks i feel like i'm literally the first person to access this tree there we go and teak blanks unlocked give me that metamorphic dose and that's my amulet of glory mount so nice man so nice to have this on this account gotta also build my portal chambers got myself a pretty altar i'll be honest with you guys i never knew that you could use a chisel on limestone to make limestone brick i feel like that was kind of right there in front of my eyes the entire time and i just never put two and two together thankfully we can do that though because now we can build this that is perfect for now i have my teleports now i can go and hire my butler and just crack out 63. that even a saying crack out yeah probably no one says that are you dumb bastard you're hired 63 construction true pain in the butt but now we can go and get our quest done get ourselves the invisible plus three construction boost and then go and try our luck with the stew boost so for the eyes of gluff request which unlocks the crystal saw we need a maple log all you have to do to get that is get 45 wood cutting which shouldn't really take me that long of a time and isn't convoluted like any other plan i have for unlocks so it just makes the most sense for me to get 45 woodcuts so i started off my search for the maple logs by going to pvp worlds and seeing if anybody would be cutting them down around camelot since i see that sometimes but i didn't find anybody there in any of the pvp worlds so then i went over to the wilderness ends and i tried to find any bots i could kill but sadly there's not really many of that bots around my combat level so i ultimately resorted to going to wintertime and seeing if i could get it in a supply crate yeah all right 10 winner todd crates all right maple lugs oh burnt pages that's good oh warm gloves uh i don't know if anything there probably stuff probably something probably something it's all peter who cares okay and now all right another 10 and if i don't get it here i guess i'll just wood cut all right gold all right i'll take that oh looking hot that's a cool item still uh not the maple logs that i need though so oh i got the maple logs nice nice dude oh my god i thought that pet was mine for a second dude that's awesome though man i had actually worked to get the freaking logs algorithm and after all of that we finally have completed the eyes of glory i think i got my first room crafting level from that too oh and here is our restore pool i did actually have a few leftover orange spices so let's see if we can get it all right that one didn't work that one didn't work oh my gosh it worked it actually worked i didn't need the grind for it yes man i have the coca-cola pool now very very long path to get here but we are here man i have the stamina pool i regenerate my run my special attack and my prayer and now that just that just feels great man that just feels great easy clue casket ah so now we're left with the issue of trying to earn cash so i'm gonna probably do something stupid here and spend 100k to see if i can pk any noobs in the rev caves because there's a 100k entry fee but anybody i kill on there i at least get 100k so could be worth it could be a terrible idea oh we're here though let's just unlock rev ether [Music] that's 100k at least look at that it's 100k at least and an unlocked too i'm just going to get all the unlocks from this you know at least it paid for itself to be in this cave i finally found a noob okay well at the very least even if i die or whatever like it's paid for itself oh why he killed all right yeah i'm this k was a waste i'll be going back there as a zerk with prayer yes what do i have roon oh this guy is total free to play newbie [Music] oh give me that oh santa hat that's actually an unlock [Music] jeez i'm gonna sell the random junk in my bank that i got which is apparently a lot more than i thought oh are they worth so much dude what the heck okay i actually had more money than i thought i did we'll spend it in the pursuit of getting more money though [Music] yeah baby give me those runes there's a lot of it but not a lot that was the other option this guy's just looting yes sir give me that i'm just picking up scraps from every noob i can find [Music] oh there was a chance yes that was my only chance to get him bless the p cass a couple hundred k and a new unlocked maybe [Music] oh good fight dark bow nice man wait my battle staff too i'm pretty sure all right let me just get out of here there's a mud battle staff that's a good unlock i think that's got to be a good unlock it's actually a really good pka i'm pretty sure money wise even all right dark bow that's got to be worth a lot those bolts alone since i unlock this i can always just sell it back or i can always just buy it back 1.2 mil nearly a three mil cash deck what's this worth oh yeah no i'm not selling that plus that's gonna be useful for me oh geez gmall yeah i'm getting this out of here safely [Music] that was like probably my only chance to get him [Music] this guy's risking a robin that'd be a really nice unlock i'm dead i've killed him once before i really want to get him did i die here oh right here jeez dude this is too sketchy for me i can't even afford to be doing this literally i can't afford to be doing this [Music] yes oh my gosh yes oh my gosh give me the robin give me the robin oh my gosh yes that's a big big big big unlock good fight man oh my gosh it's not that much money i don't think but it's a best in slot let me see i'm gonna leave the rest on the ground i don't want to die it's yeah 1.3 mil it's not that much money but unlock wise that's incredible good fight yeah oh hey ring well three that's good because that can actually make a full ring of wealth five now three decanting ring of wealth five unlocked y'all risk it here risk that was worth the risk good fight i nearly killed him i would have gotten the g mall that was worth it what's this guy doing what's he doing give me his arcade that's what he was doing yeah that's about right 600k okay i'm getting that to the bank right now i'm not getting tb for this i made out pretty well from that kill that was like an 800k pk was the next video coming along [Music] pretty good [Laughter] good fight bro oh geez well not the blue halloween mask now coins tell me you got the gmall yes that should be enough money at this point all right let's bank this all three mil cash could sell this i don't think i'm selling this robin man i like i could use the cash but i i don't want to sell it i can't do it dirty like that even if it is an unlocked item that i can buy back all right 5 mil for now that's good so i need to get like 50 000 something chaos rune so i can splash for 82 magic because next video we get the fire cape we get blitz and we go pking that's actually why we needed all this cash so i'm going to have to splash for like 50 something hours i'm gonna have to train range for like 30 something hours and strength for like 20 something hours that'll take a bit of time but once that's done this account will be very strong
