building an itx gaming pc is typically a very expensive process but i figured out how to build a very powerful one on a budget and i'm going to show you how i did it let's get into it [Music] hey welcome to zach's attack turf where i build and benchmark all sorts of gaming pcs like this one here on youtube but i also stream over on twitch every tuesday and thursday at 8 pm eastern time so make sure you're following me over there but before that make sure you hit that subscribe button down below and also that notification bell that way you never miss an episode but yeah let's check this build out after a word save 25 jumping straight into the parts list everything is linked down in the description by the way starting with the cpu just like all my build guides we have the intel 4th generation i5 4570 remember that this is a used build so we're trying to keep things low in price and you can actually find this 4 core and 4 threaded cpu that boosts up to 3.6 gigahertz on ebay for as cheap as 35 dollars which is what i did for the motherboard this is the one that i actually already had in my studio so it was an easy pick this is the asrock h97m itx ac but i would recommend just going with any itx motherboard that will support intel's fourth generation cpus for as cheap as you can in a build like this i'm certainly not going to be overclocking and i'm not taking any real advantage of the motherboard features so i would just suggest getting the cheapest one that you can i'm going to mark the price at 50 bucks even though i already have one for ram this here is a 16 gigabyte ddr3 kit that's clocked at 1600 megahertz and ddr3 is getting really tough to find these days but hopefully that changes soon i found this kit for 50 bucks but i honestly feel like that was a really great deal even though it's the same price as ddr4 moving on we get to the graphics card and i decided to use my four gigabyte rx 570 which i picked up for 80 on the used market and i originally bought this graphics card for my top three budget gpus under 100 video which you should check out up here the rx 570 is actually a really solid combination with the i5 4570 despite being much newer and i wouldn't stress too much about the four gigabytes of vram because with the 1080p settings that the system is geared for i don't even think we take advantage of those extra four gigabytes compared to an eight gigabyte model moving on to the power supply where the market is extremely limited at the time of making this video i had to settle on a whopping 66 dollar evga m1 550 watt power supply you guys know by now that i've been recommending this thing in a ton of my budget build guides mostly because of the all black cables and it usually sits at like a stupid low price point of like 40 or so but unfortunately with the market right now that's at like 66 and that's still stupid low compared to most other options do be aware that the evga m1 is not nearly the safest and most efficient power supply that you can go with it's actually ranked on the tier e of the famous linus tech tips power supply ranking list but i've had exactly zero issues using them over the years so i'm going to continue to recommend them in my build guides especially the budget ones something else that i recommend although it's similarly against the grain is the ssd choice of the silicone power a 55 500 gigabyte model the a55 is definitely one of the cheaper ssd options out there because there's no dram this means that it's not necessarily the best choice for a boot ssd with your operating system on it but to be honest with these super budget build guides it'll work absolutely just fine it's also sporting 560 over 530 megabit per second read and write speeds and finally for our last core component of the build we got to talk about this case this is the metallic gear neo mini version 2 and this thing cost me 70 brand new off amazon the neo mini version 2 is certainly one of the bigger itx cases out there but i thought that it would be perfect for honestly my first ever complete itx build the 1250 all-black build that i uploaded a few weeks ago was actually built after this one and it allowed me to get away with the super cheap non-modular power supply like the one we used typically in an itx build space is extremely critical and you definitely won't be able to get away with a non-modular power supply because the bulk of the cables is just so huge on the back of the mini version 2 there's this slot with velcro straps that's designed for that exact reason as you can see here but even then i really had to smash the back side panel on as you can see me doing here on my twitch live stream which is where i assembled this by the way and all my other build guides other than that though there's not a ton of airflow just these vents on the side of the front panel which i'm not too worried about i'm also really digging the design of the tempered glass side panel that sort of acts like a power supply shroud and once again tell me if you've heard this before but i just like the clean and simple design to this i think the mini version 2 was a great option for a first time itx builder as i did need to get a little crafty with the cable management but it was still big enough for me to use a non-modular power supply and wasn't an absolute pain to work in before checking out the entire parts list i did throw in one aesthetic only part which you guys know i don't include in the final price tag because they have absolutely no impact on performance these rgb fans are the brand new mf-120 gts from deepcool and they have a really unique x design to them these three packs are a little expensive but i always like the deepcool physical interface of their rgb products because they all work so well together and i think they look pretty legit the other non-necessary part i have is this cheapo thermaltake air cooler i would highly recommend just going with the intel stock cooler if your 4570 comes with one not because it's a good cooler or anything but just because it's cheap and unless you're overclocking you'll be perfectly fine with it with that being said here's what my final parts list is looking like and as you can see everything toted out to be just a tad bit over 400 for our used itx gaming pc before moving on to the benchmarks i want to quickly talk about some replacement parts if you're thinking about copying this build maybe you can't find one of these parts in stock or maybe you just don't like the aesthetics of one of these parts so i definitely got you covered and just like always every part that i'm about to talk about is linked down in the description as well for the cpu the 4570 is a really nice option strictly for gaming but if you want to upgrade to something more capable with hyper threading you could always go with something like the 4790k but only if you get a really good deal on it otherwise i'd switch over to the ryzen platform for the graphics card i really love the rx 570 as my first pick here but for around the same price you could certainly get a gtx 970 which is still rocking some insane price to performance value here in 2020. if you're not vibing with the neo mini version 2 case you can swap it out for something like the phanteks evolv itx which i also really like and finally if you don't want to spend the extra money on these mf 120 gt rgb fans you can use my personal favorite budget option here from up here you can usually find a three pack for just over 20 bucks and they're pretty decent quality i actually just used them in my 700 gaming pc book guide that i released a few weeks ago so there's some extra parts from you but now it's time for my favorite part of these videos the benchmarks and just like always please continue to let me know what you think down in the comment section of what other games i should add to my benchmarking run but today i got 10 games for you guys so let's get these crank in starting with fortnite just like always i put the settings at 1080p in pro that's 1080p low but with far view distance and with that i got a solid fps average of 148 keep in mind if you lock the fps at your monitor's refresh rate instead of unlimited which is what i do for benchmarking your one percent point one percent loads will be significantly higher because it's not wasting power outputting more fps than what your monitor can actually display next up is call of duty modern warfare i actually decided to benchmark this during warzone just because of how popular this is getting to be specific i actually did the new huge warzone 50 verse 50 team deathmatch so it was really graphically demanding and in 1080p and medium settings i got 71 frames per second following that was rainbow six siege starting to actually complete these situations during all these benchmarking runs i've been doing lately and with the benchmarking tool in 1080p in very high settings this build got 136 fps borderlands 3 followed up after that definitely a gpu demanding game to run and in 1080p in medium settings this budget itx system got just over our target 60fps mark next up i tested gears 5 and with the built-in benchmarking tool in 1080p and medium settings we got again a little bit above the target 60fps mark and after that i fired up a game that i haven't benchmarked for a while red dead redemption 2 but it's actually a very demanding game with an easy built-in benchmarking tool so i thought i would add it to the lineup and in 1080p in medium settings i got 53 fps counter-strike global offensive was up next and in 1080p in pro settings which is essentially just low with no anti-aliasing i got 160 frames per second that's about as best as a 4570 can do here in 2020. after that was player unknown battlegrounds i can't for the life of me record a kill during these benchmarking runs so just try to enjoy me playing this game as a walking simulator and in 1080p in medium settings we got 72 frames per second getting towards the end here we have monster hunter world this one was definitely starved by our older i5 45 70 and in 1080p i decranked the settings down too low and still only got a 42 fps average this one is certainly tough to do with older and budget cpus and finally for the 10th and final game we have forza ryzen 4. i can't run msi afterburner on this one so we'll just have to rely with the built-in benchmarking tool and in 1080p and high settings with dynamic optimization turned off i got a very solid 93 fps average so there you go as you can see this budget itx system is running any esport title at 144 fps and even all the aaa titles at about 1080p and medium for 60fps and not only are you getting those nice price to performance numbers but you're also getting a really nice looking itx gaming pc just like always please continue to let me know what other build guide prices you want to see me do in the future and also make sure you're following me over on tiktok because i actually made a video about this pc weeks ago because it's a much faster social media platform to get content out to you guys i hope you enjoyed this one
