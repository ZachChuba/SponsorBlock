uh you know a dumb name that guy looks newbie old chemicals how about new new chemicals not taken all right there we go so first of all let me explain what farrock's enclave is ferax enclave is a new wilderness hub that is located in around level 12 to level 16 wilderness the enclave is a new home to the mini-game last man standing it has a castle wars teleport it has white portal and it has purple portal for clan wars you'll also occasionally find pkr sitting outside of the enclave mainly in world 2 but you can find them in different worlds as well mechanically the enclave is a bit weird anybody standing in the safe zone is not able to be attacked at all by anybody if a player gets attacked outside of the safe zone and then runs into the safe zone they're not able to be attacked but if that player gets tb they're able to be attacked by anybody within the safe zone until their tele block runs out so someone who's standing in the safe zone can attack the person who got tb'd and they have no ability to get attacked by anybody else as long as they're in the safe zone so there's a few different methods that i use to try to bait these peekers some of them even ended up trying to lure me tell me this guy just hopped to me oh my god he did this guy's been stalking me for like half an hour there he is there he is dude there he is and that was the easiest kill of my life bro come on legit stalking me gonna be honest this takes a long time but it is literally so fun to do this i'll explain the different methods i use to bait pekers as we go on but first expressvpn.com frame to learn more the first method i used was to walk around in either world 2 or the lms world pretending like i don't want a pk there because there's too many people then i would hop worlds leaving my private on then i'd wait for any pks who had their eye on me to try to add me see what world i was in then hop to my world and try to pk me now here's the thing my bait account has tbs and i'm ready to log into my alt the second that my beta account lands the tb so all you have to do is act newbie walk into the wilderness and tb he's dead good fight sad yeah right thank you 2.2 mil that's pretty good man this guy was trying to get me to join his clan so him and his boys could all learn me but i decided to just walk out into the wilderness anyway to see if he'd follow so good luck in your endeavors and now i'm walking away he's following me he did it puff now no i have mage and i pretend i'm going for the desperate noob and tangles now we go for the tb i deserve this yep one more bolt one more thank you there we go he almost got away dude smoke battle staff that's like a couple mil kill right there this guy was so happy that i killed him this random bystander i'm giving this guy some for just being a supporter of me killing lures four mil from that he deserves this man he deserves this one mill thanks no prob another method i would use to bait pkers is i would hop into a random world see if there's any peace and if there were i'd trash talk then just walk directly into the wilderness wait why did this guy try to log in on me he could have just followed me out here and we got him there we go good fight i got 1.9 miller he was actually submitted for the smoke battle staff but i needed to make sure that i could log out in the other account so i couldn't go for the claw to ko him this guy got me to a high risk world and now he's trying to alert me outside of the enclave man out there come world five three three oh my god he has a torture [Music] i gotta bring midseeds i didn't bring myth seeds dude many hours later and this guy is trying to bait me as well and he says he's gonna bring it in but heart this actually takes a long time to find these dudes by the way i'm gonna tell you in the end how long it actually ended up taking me so same thing as before this guy lures me to a high risk world and then tries to get me to go outside the enclave when he shows me his imbued heart i didn't think he was actually gonna risk it because he has the hunter level to inbox it so he can safely bank it but i figured i'd try it anyway i don't know he has it he has it oh my god did i actually just get the heart did i actually just get it i got it i got the i got the [ __ ] heart i just got the heart oh my god i got it i got the heart i got the heart are you kidding me so when i make these videos i spend a lot of time just waiting and every now and then i end up in the right place at the right time to scout somebody who was going into the wild oh my god he's doing a clue [Music] he's going back to the enclave he doesn't know he doesn't know and he's smited and he is down oh my god what does he have he's doing a clue nature oh my god oh my god oh my god uh oh my god what in the world that's why i'm just sitting there camping how much 5.1 mil what in the world oh that was the luckiest thing i just found that guy doing a clue another way i baited peakers to be interested in stalking me or trying to learn me was i would go to world 2 i would try to tb people randomly i would inevitably get tb'd and then i would run and tank it down to level 1 wilderness after that i'd tell you back up the enclave say i'm hopping worlds and then see who followed me like this iron man right here was stalking me so i figured he was either gonna come attack me or maybe he would have one of his friends come attack me oh my god he brought someone he brought someone [Music] oh my god no so after i died i went back geared up in front of the iron man and then hopped in front of him to a high risk world and again they followed and i got him well what do you have uh that's a lot that's a lot 5.2 mil that was like a completely even exchange so this one made me really sad you'll see why in a second this guy i thought was trying to bait me with all of this gear because he was trying to fight me and i thought he was doing the same thing that i was doing i thought he was gonna bring another account to try to pkay me but it ends up that he was trying to bait with that account and he was a noob so i did kill him but i accidentally hit pause on my recording so i only got the loot i can't believe i didn't save that that's so freaking sad i actually ended up finding this guy in the high risk pk world and he so graciously offered to fight me he also told me he was risking an ags and a ring so 13 mil plus got him let's see if he actually brought the ags he did he actually brought an ags wow i actually got an ags 10.9 mil so the enclave was created as a new hotspot where pks could go in pk this was meant to be in place of the pvp worlds the reason why they'll never be able to replicate and replace pvp worlds though is because at any point in time someone could just pj your fight or you can just have someone tb for you and then you could just go attack that person and clan them now personally i'm not a fan of this and i never really do like team pking but a few of these guys keep t being me and clanning me on my bait so i asked c engineer to come tv for me so i could get a little bit of revenge [Music] oh i got him i got him nice i got him dude there we go couple mill pk i got a brimstone ring i got a fury thank you tom for the tb i'm gonna go ahead and give him a nice split after i loot this hole that was a nice 16.3 mil i'm gonna give c engineer half of that for the tb thank you very much tom you have a big [ __ ] i also ended up t being this guy on the bait and then pking him on the pure so these guys tried learning me in a high risk world this guy went out with an acb i got the tb got close to killing him and then he got his boys out there to pj pretty unfortunately and i got him that's a dragon crossbow uh 2.3 mill i saw this guy trash talking everybody so i figured it would be funny if i spellbook swapped them so permed [Music] that's it like i was trying to perm rag people and then he told me i was permed but uh instead i got his 1.4 mil what the [ __ ] you doing okay i'll hop lol yup the guy added me and followed me if you want i can kill you lol can i kill you and wildly next um no [Music] and good fight got him that's an ages right there dude i fought that guy so many times in pvp world so it's funny to see him out there trying to freaking lure innocent noobs well i don't even know if i'd say he was luring per se but still 13 mil is not anything to argue with [Music] and you're down good fight oh you're good ahead of me well that was like the easiest thing in my life 1.5 mil i barely had to do anything dude this is always so funny there's like a hole falling on me and none of them are going to kill me [Laughter] this is so stupid run for your life run for your life and he's dead 414k so i ran across some lures on my bait account noticed that the killer was hopping between worlds i finally found him i land my tb and then i didn't realize but my spell book swap is actually up for the day which means i had no way to freeze the guy and on top of that my power went out about 10 minutes later so i couldn't even find him again no not taking your [ __ ] bait again [Music] i got a ballista wait and a dragon crossbow what yeah that okay yeah i didn't drop a dragon crossbow or anything that was 3.3 mil why do you have a ballista and a dragon crossbow come on i really want to smile me as claws dude ah dang it i really wanted to smile for the claws yeah like 1.1 mill um wow are you kidding me dude he loses skull the second i kill him that would have been bank i saw this guy with some good risks so i decided to spell book swap them [Music] dead good fight here we go that was kind of poopy to be honest hey bucks thank you jeez that is not a bad kill i also had to politely inform these guys that they should not be doing edge style risk in level 15 wilderness [Music] and smited good fight got a derox axe i ended up just giving a loot to the guy he was fighting [Music] oh wow i wasn't even fighting the right thing ko light ballista 700k so this one's a bit weird over the course of the nine days that it took me to record this video i kept running into guys that would look like this and would all be kind of around the same combat level i didn't know if they were bots or what was going on and then eventually i noticed one of them that kept running outside of the enclave for some reason i wasn't sure if it was a bot or venezuelan so i decided to drop my dragon plate legs to see if he would run out and take him and surprisingly he did [Music] [Laughter] wow are you kidding me uh i got the region bracelet i got a region bracelet from that guy that's 3.5 mil from that to be honest it all felt a bit weird so i didn't really want to keep the money and i just ended up giving it to this free-to-play noob something else kind of funny i was trying to pk on one account and tank on the other account and i ended up just dying to get excited oh look at this guy this is 365. and you're down that's a free staff it's the half of the day so that was a free five miller i spent a total of nine days baiting at ferox enclave and the total loot that i ended up getting from this was 113 mil total you can also subtract 10 ml for the two deaths as well so 100 ml profit from this overall i do like for rock's enclave it's a cool addition to the game the mechanics are a bit weird and i don't necessarily like that anyone could just pj anytime but that's the wilderness can we get 10 000 likes
