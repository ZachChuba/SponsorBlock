website or online store make it with Squarespace this is my sister-in-law not that sister-in-law another one her name is Andrea and she's one of my favorite people on earth one of the many reasons why is that she's incredibly talented in a creative area that I know absolutely nothing about and that's clothing see Andrea is a seamstress she owns a small business that specializes in alterations she takes clothes that aren't quite right and she fixes them how she did this I had no idea all I knew was that whenever there was a wardrobe emergency and my wife's family you picked up the phone and called Andrea need something so call Andrea need something hemmed call Andrea something torn and need repaired then call Andrea because she can seemingly do it all I really didn't know a lot about Andrea when I started dating her sister she's kind of quiet very quirky and keeps to herself more often than not but I'm glad that I've gotten to know over the past few years and I feel privileged to now call her family recently rage and I took a vacation to visit her and her husband and I finally got to see up close what it takes for her to make stuff Lansing a great name in button's Lansing Michigan twenty nine cents these are old most of my buttons are super old because people just give them to me okay so what's the plan here I'm gonna make an Alice in Wonderland dress out of this dress I got that dress at antique aliens in the light so show me what it's going to look like okay I'm kind of channeling this one it's like a mix between the animated version where she has a shorter skirt right but it's still like the poofy light blue and it's got black buttons down the front but I don't know if I can find a picture with it yeah it's got like the black buttons that go down the front okay so the plan is I'm gonna take one of the boxes off to make it like because in some other version of the dress like you can see her shoes in her boots and I'm sure so that will cover up everything if I leave it there eventually I'm probably gonna make like a poofy under skirt so it actually stands out like her dress does probably gonna put black buttons down the front and I might put some fabric up here through the sleeve so that it's not seen how long do you think it'll take four days okay thinking about this project for forever I don't have to make any buttonholes I don't have to redo any sticking through the button collection oh they're perfect they're perfect I'm using these so what do you here you're just gonna start I start cutting what do you what are you putting I'm cutting the netting right above the lace mm-hmm to separate this piece from the rest of it so like whatever you cut off just goes in the you know the whatever election for the next project yeah whatever I think of oh I know this would be an adorable like little girl dress because that like it would just be like the skirt are we finding you said let me know who's closer so what do you do next okay next I'm going to fill in these sleeves so they're not just see-through making them more modest but it's yeah yeah that's the plan luckily you have all this stuff that I cut off the bottom so you can take the stuff from the bottom good thank you ha so I'm watching your to this stuff do it Jude I've been sitting on this like all week go ahead good do it do it do it all of a sudden this wall that's if it's shelves underneath it no I did [Music] [Applause] [Music] when did you first start sewing I think I was somewhere between the ages of like 4 and 6 somewhere in there because my mom liked the pretty little embroidery projects I really latched on to the hand sewing in particular and supposed to sewing on a sewing machine because I didn't start sewing a sewing machine so it's probably about 10 like what do people mean when they mean can because whenever I make something by hand I mean that like I I have the needle and the thread and I'm stitching the thing together as opposed to sewing it up on a machine usually when they put the sticker that says handmade that means like a human sat down and socially the thing is yeah she started me on the embroidery stuff yeah and then I took a fascination in making clothes for a doll that I had cuz I really liked those American Girl books and I had a favorite character it was Kirsten or Kirsten I couldn't afford $100 doll and so I had a blonde porcelain doll and I made her a whole outfit and did her hair up so she looked exactly like the nature I made my own you made your own American Girl and there were some steps before I got to that point that are pretty ugly some pretty horrendous looking stuff but it culminated in me wanting to make my own American Girl doll see and so now you've turned that into making clothing for people yeah when I was probably about middle school I was probably 12 or 13 I started just making stuff for me mm-hmm and I very quickly decided that I disliked sewing from patterns because I didn't like people telling me what to do right you're a rebel like that yeah so I started just making stuff from scratch at one point I made of one of the twins sit in a chair and be my dressmaker form so it was Sarah that I had her sit in this chair well I pinned all these little pieces together on her to make like this next year I could just stick reform for my birthday [Music] that's cool so that's called a what hedge again surged serged edge oh wait were you saying that that's like how it is on the bottom of this yeah yeah sure I see this is honey I never you never noticed these things it's just a t-shirt to me but there's like a whole science behind it this plates done this approach done now I'm gonna sew it into the dress so you go back through the hole right and then you go back put back up through your fabric okay yeah yeah and you just repeat that for several times so you want this to be part of your buttons do I get to sew the buttons will you let me sew a button you can sew a button oh so what am i doing you lay it on your paper lay it on my thank you to them pinch it with my thumbs and then you wrap it around around you kind of overlap it a little bit just kind of roll it off the end of your finger roll it off with your thumb like that and then you grab it up here and just pull grab it up here and just just like slide your fingers down the knot or if you want I can hold the dress so I'm gonna just put it like under just straight down like yoke through okay sure on top of the needle over below matters not so I'm just gonna poke it through okay poke it and then flip it over flip the whole dress over okay and pull it up pull it up put the button on the needle so like like that yep and just let it drop then since you started on this side of the pin you're gonna put your needle down through this others and up through this side essentially it's like you're folding it over and sticking it straight through just right through okay and then pull it this alright yeah you essentially just put a button on well we put a button okay so don't just repeat that process associated okay so back through the button that's one basically right can you do that five times yes are you so nervous like it hurt you unless you stab yourself but that's your own fault so that's two and a half more work okay that's five so now then we're going to poke the needle straight back down poke through yep and then we're turning it back over right back around so that there's your needle okay so pull it through pull it through and then we're gonna tie a knot so just stick it through and catch just a little bit of fabric but don't pull it taut yes yes I'm cold it'll it but leave yourself a loop lose your loop then you're gonna run your needle through that loop two times run it through the loop two times so we go stick it through one one time come around and do it around I'm sorry point you to and then pull it pull and that's enough it's a knot so you're done you just cut it off okay what do i scissors oh wow fancy scissors it's just little scissors so like right here little higher huh right there around look at that look at that you got this thank you says I'm a city boy I'm a Seamster is it Seamster I don't know what it is I know I think sometimes they usually choose to work Taylor Taylor so I'm just gonna so on the last three but unless you no no I'm all for you finishing this out after patiently walking me through what I'm sure is one of the most basic techniques in her line of work Andrea got back into the hot seat and expertly finished the alterations within an hour she had taken a four dollar dress and customized it into something that could retail for much much higher she's magical like that all in all it was fun to be walked through the process of a field I'm totally ignorant of I've never really given clothing costumes or wardrobes much thought but my afternoon with Andrea gave me a quick glimpse into a world she's known and worked in ever since she was a kid everybody's got their thing I guess and one of the joys I have in life is seeing how some people can turn their thing from hobby into a business this video website or domain [Music] thanks to slow-mo Monday one of my patreon supporters for suggesting this video thanks to my sister-in-law Andrea for being so awesome and letting me capture a small
