welcome back some new rock stars I'm Erik Bosse in the mandalorian chapter three the sin continues this hot streak of solid straightforward Western inspired Star Wars storytelling that has this looking of our shoulder thing and yeah this is actually good right I'm enjoying a Star Wars thing without complaint cool just making sure of the three episodes so far this one might contain some of the deepest cut Star Wars Easter eggs yet and in addition to that some really clever visual details that show how much craft has been put into these episodes so let's break it all down spoilers ahead this episode opens with the adorable moment on mando ship with baby Yoda unscrewing a knob off a lever because babies will toys I know I know I really should be calling them something like Yoda Ling because baby Yoda implies he's Yoda's baby or Yoda's clone something that's not confirmed yet but yodeling both the word itself and the sound if it's my head stupid so deal with it until he's named he's baby Yoda cool they return to the residents of the client greeted once again by the gatekeeper droid we saw one of these at Jabba's palace and Return of the Jedi this episode often places the camera inside the babies pod with him in my breakdown at chapter 2 I pointed out the parallel between baby Yoda encased in the pod and mando encased in his helmet these protective shells that limit their views of the outside world mando hands off baby Yoda to the client in dr. Pershing and Pershing's red scanner light reflects on mandos helmet as if he too is undergoing a kind of identity verification in this moment what kind of man is he is the bounty worth giving up this innocent child the container that the client stores the best car inside is an awesome Easter Egg this prop is from the Empire Strikes Back it's carried by a random Cloud City resident named will ro hood as people fled the city the prop is made from an ice cream maker so fans over the years have loved this and called him ice cream guy and during production in the mandalorian Jon Favreau's shared an Instagram post of it is love that hadn't have planed a pretty big role here her song opened it the client is insulted when mando asks what they're gonna do with the kid pointing out that asking about the fate of the bounty is against guild code this episode as a whole is very much about codes ways customs before it was quill who would repeat his mantra I now the Mandalorians repeat this is the way now this episode's title is the sin suggests it's a sin to violate such ways and means but we learn at the end of the episode that there's actually a greater sin that one could carry on one's conscience the sin of inaction the sin of letting evil go forward mando is challenged by this heavy infantry guy credited in other places as past Vizsla and I'm pretty sure this is voiced by Jon Favreau himself make a little kindly now our strength was once in our numbers this Mandalorian is proud angry over having to live like sand rats and secrecy making deals with the devil to maintain their way of life and when they fight you notice how their daggers vibrates these aren't vibro blades off to mention weapons and the Star Wars University if a current that maximizes cutting effectiveness mando tells the armour about the mud horn I guess I was its name makes sense that he defeated last episode but since it was assisted by baby Yoda he refuses to make it his signet so we learned that to the Mandalorian cygnets come from a beast that you have to kill or tame this actually stems from their ancestor Mandalore the first who first conquered the great mythos are of their planets that's why the leaders of the Mandalorians bear as their signet the skull of the mythos or the armor are forges for him whistling birds guided bullets similar to yondu's Yakka arrow and the guardians the galaxy movies which he does command via whistling and once again during the Scourge montage mando is triggered back to memories of his family under attack we see in this memory that the attackers are super battle droids these were used by the separatists during the Clone Wars so here's my question if the separatist droid is the one that attacked mando and his family leaving him with a lifelong hatred of droids who do we think rescued him here is it a clone trooper or someone we might know like Anakin Skywalker general Kenobi hello that war could his rescuer have been the great Yoda explaining his fondness for this young creature let me know who you think saved him in the comments below before I continue thank expressvpn dot-com slash new rock stars moving on mando returns to his guild leader reef carga he has been paid well in bests car to something that gives mando pause because in his eyes every piece of best car is a stolen natural resource from his homeworld that belongs to his people so later shooting him in that piece of metal seem like kind of a stinging reminder of that mandos next target is a blonde calamari whom grief describes as a nobleman's son perhaps that nobleman could be the war hero admiral ackbar though it's a little racist to assume all Mon Calamari are related Reeves says that the Bounty Hunter is on the ocean dunes of Karnak Karnak could have gotten its name from the Karnak temple ruins of Egypt I appreciated Amanda's discs of the New Republic joke it's a sobering reminder that despite the apparent universe wide celebration after the Battle of Endor the efforts to restore democracy from the ashes of the Empire are fledgling at best and barely a generation later it's all gonna be replaced by an empire doppelganger back on his ship mando fine for the knob and he freezes can you just gotta love a hero moment when the seemingly heartless guy goes still as he works at the nerve to go back and do the right thing and now notice mandos helmet reflects a green light a contrast with the red light from a poor grain being the color of Jedi lightsabers red the color of Sith lightsabers red meaning stop this and green now signaling go get up or go ahead and stop and go ahead and leave green means go so I know to go ahead and shut up about it as he marches back into danger the composer once the again sneaks in a light motif to John Williams force theme mando spots the discarded pod in the garbage I pointed out before how that pod was designed to evoke the shape of an egg and now seeing this empty eggshell in the trash reminds mando of how his previous clients handled that egg bounties greeted again by the gatekeeper droid man who rips off its head just like how baby Yoda removed the knob from the end of that lever inside mando finds per Sheen with baby Yoda and a classic IT Oh Imperial interrogator droid just like the one Vader used on Leia on the Death Star now it's not clear what procedure he was doing but his patch does look like the same emblem of the Kamino cloning facility and attack of the clones so perhaps the aim is to attempt to clone this newly discovered member of Yoda species rather than this child being a clone of anything itself because think about it the client wouldn't have cared if this kid died because all he needs is his DNA and maybe that interrogator droid was here to supervise pershing mando escapes of the kid and the other bounty hunters get notified kind of like that moment in John wick too when all the other assassins getting notified to go after him grief drops another classic Star Wars not because I'm your only hope mando escapes by taking cover in an astromech droid driven carriage that he passed earlier forcing him to finally be escorted in a vehicle driven by an astromech droid go droids gets bailed out by the other Mandalorians on jetpacks including Paz vizla who later soars behind it gives him a salute which with this being Pedro has got to be an Ironman shoutout right an coming full circle with the opening scene baby Oda finally gets his ball and it feels closely you can hear he lets up its tiny little giggle finding us at the moment that we first met one of these things back on Dagobah similarly laughing it up as he played with the stuff that he shouldn't be playing with Tom and Mo with your thoughts on this episode follow
