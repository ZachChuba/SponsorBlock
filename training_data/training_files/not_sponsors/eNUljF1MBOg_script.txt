hello in today's video we're going to be talking about cameras and what might be the best camera for landscape photography there are so many new cameras come onto the market recently but it's become almost impossible to decide where to put your money not only into cameras but into lenses as well with Christmas around the corner I imagine quite a few of you are considering a fairly big camera or lens purchase so I just wanted to go through a few of my thoughts a few options that there are on the market at the moment and should talk about that a little bit and hopefully it will give you a little bit of insight and help you out with your next purchase it's great cold outside so let's go online store then make your next move with Squarespace so I just couldn't face going out in the gray cold wind again today it's this time of year sort of between the end of autumn when old it that autumn color is gone in the start of winter when it's still relatively mild a lot of the time it's just not a particularly pleasant or interesting time to shoot I find I've had enough so I'm ready for some high pressure really cold icy snowy weather to get really excited about anyway we're talking about cameras today so like I said there's loads of new cameras coming on them out or have come onto the market and do to come onto the market so she's really difficult to know where to go for the sake of this video I'm really just talking about a camera specifically for landscape photography so we're not talking about how many frames per second it shoots or whether it does video and I really don't care about that for the sake of this video there's sort of things I am looking for in a landscape photography camera though are firstly image quality I want the highest quality images that a camera can possibly create as I'm sort of progressing through my career I'm pretty much wanting that better and better all the time I want higher resolution as well just so when I do blow those pictures up you've still got that fine crisp quality there I'm not degrading by by blowing it up I want a decent dynamic it's not something I particularly worry about because I can bracket my image is to get a bigger dynamic range but if as cameras progress the the dynamic range is ever improving and I'm a happy to receive that in my camera I also want a camera with low low very low noise some things could fall into a bit more shadow and I want to be able to preserve the detail in that with low noise and high image quality so a few other kind of minor things that I have become used to that I definitely want to see in whatever camera I moved to next are a built-in build timer I do a lot of long exposures and being able to get rid of the shutter release cable has been a real nice thing so I want a built in build timer it'd be nice if it had an intervalometer as well built in so I can do my time lapses because kind of fits in with landscape photography bringing that picture alive with the time-lapse I've also become really accustomed to the autofocus touch to focus on the live in live view I do manual focus a lot of the time but what I also do now is just touch to focus especially on the Canon 5d Mark forward it's so accurate I've really it's really started form part of my workflow I don't really want to give that up at this stage so with all that I mind what are our options I for the last few years have been shooting Canon 5d Mark 4 it has been absolutely exceptional I have loved every second of using this camera it's just laid I don't know why people give Canon such a hard time and particularly this camera it's laid out perfectly it's very intuitive you can change all settings just with one hand it's got beautiful autofocus I could say that touch to focus it's got a good dynamic range it's got decent resolution not the best but decent image quality is great low noise good in low-light that kind of thing it's just been great it's rugged as well it's weather sealed another thing that's important to me because as you've seen in the last few months I've been out in the rain a lot that is a vital part of what the camera or landscape photography camera is going to give me what are your other options so obviously budget is gonna form parts of your decision-making process and that will have often leads to what synthesize you're going to get we've got microphones small light we've got crop sensors cameras full frame and then medium format and what I have found through my personal use of these different cameras is that as a general rule image quality does improve the bigger the sensor gets I know some people are gonna like that but that is my personal experience take this camera for example of Fujifilm xt3 I reviewed it a couple of months ago it is a fantastic camera I bought it not just for landscapes but for commercial video work as well as a landscape photography camera it is great it's brilliant I love the way the dials are set out and things like that very easy to control really nice to use having used it a few times now though the cropped sensor inside here just does not match up to the quality of the Canon 5d Mark 4 and other full-frame cameras that I've used it's a shame to say that because it like I said in the review it is one of the best if not the best crop sensor camera on the markets but it is it definitely is that but it just doesn't match up to become an 5d Mark four in terms of price it's really similar as well to the full-frame Sony a7 3 so is it the right option I don't know it's a great coming you want you definitely wouldn't be sorry if you bought it it's gonna be perfect for most people just for me there's just that slight dip in image quality so that's not going to be my long-term camera and I don't think any crop sensor camera at this point here is going to be we also have the option of using an older full-frame camera so I still have the Canon 5d Mark - this is still a fantastic camera I had a client on a workshop last week using this camera and it hasn't stopped being a great camera I love this when I was using it this was a game changer in the field because it started doing video as well it caused a revolution cameras and it hasn't stopped being a great camera it takes fantastic landscape images and now you can get this such a low price for such a great camera obviously it's full-frame great lens options as well with Canon it's a great option it's just a great option as as a landscape camera it doesn't have to touch to focus which a lot of people will want but yeah that is still a great camera on the Nikon side of things the Nikon d80 is a fantastic camera I haven't used it personally but I've certainly seen the images I've seen people using it in real life and it's a fantastic camera the images that that creates are very high resolution they are superb that is a superb camera and well worth the money but would I buy it now again probably not because we're moving into a world of mirrorless the day it's sad to say but the day of the DSLR I think is coming to a close and certainly the moves that the camera companies are making does definitely suggest that Sony have caused a revolution with with their mirrorless offerings Fuji have been a part of that as well and they're just sucking customers away from Canon and Nikon into that mirrorless systems and it's because of that that Canon and Nikon have now both released a mirrors full-frame offering Nick on withersedge 7 and the Zed 6 they're a great option they definitely are they don't do everything they also have single card slots which frankly is just a strange decision it's enough to put me off as a professional as someone that just does not want to lose a single image that's enough to put me off but there's still great cameras a similar sort of thing with Canon as well as the Canon EOS R that looks like a great camera it is a pretty much a 5d Mark 4 in a mirrorless body and it does lots of it pretty much does it all like the kind of 5d Mark fathers but this doesn't feel like there's particularly anything new in it other than it being mirrorless and again that is it has a single console which just frankly it's a silly little thing to be talking about but it's enough to be putting me off but I think for a lot of people and landscape shoes as well it's a great option you're getting a brand new camera you're getting a lot of quality out of our of the sensor out of the body it's mirrorless it's gonna be slightly more future-proofed as well if you're happy with the one card slot I think that's gonna be a great option for your landscape photographs if you're already in the Canon eco system by the adapter and all your lenses will just fit on there that's the same for the NIC on as well if you're moving from Nikon DSLRs but that's the best part of a sticking point for me and what's causing a bit of the confusion because where do you go I am still shooting with a DSLR but because the mounts have changed on the EOS R and the the Zed series from Nikon I don't long-term want to be using a camera and a set of lenses with an adapter I just don't want it because the lenses are not designed for that camera and by using that adapter it just feels like you're going to be losing something in the middle of I'm sure they are very good as a bit of a transition I would be happily use it I need to test it out as well but long term that's not something I'm going to be particularly interested in if I need a new lens now what am I going to buy I don't think I'm now going to buy an EF lens for the Canon DSLRs and if I was a Nick on user would be very reluctant at the moment to buy an F mount lens because looking forward looking to the roadmap that Canon and Nikon have they're moving into that mirrorless area with the Zed mount for the Nikon and the are mounts for Canon there the lenses that I think are going to be the future already Canon have that 24 to 70 f2 which looks like a great lens Canon are also releasing I've said they're going to release it's a rumor I think at the moment they're going to release the EOS R with a 75 megapixel sensor and that's something I'm going to be hugely interested in if that's a great camera that's probably the one I'll pick up like a an adapter on it for the time being use all the lenses I've got and as time goes on knowing that there's some future proof in that mount I can buy the new lenses to fit natively onto that camera it is C I mean there's just thoughts and pro thoughts spinning around everywhere it's difficult to know what to do at the moment so I think a lot of people like me I'm just gonna bide our time and wait and terms of waiting one thing I've been waiting for is the Fujifilm gfx r which is a medium format camera you might have seen on the video the other week that I tried out the GFX at GFX s from Fujifilm the medium format camera and that was sensational as a landscape camera absolutely fantastic the GFX R is going to use the same sensor it's gonna be in a smaller rangefinder body the GFX lenses are expensive though they're also quite heavy and they're also slightly limited in their range they're 32 to 64 millimeters is amazing but then the gap between there and then 200 millimeters or the equivalent of 200 millimeters my lens choice is 16 to 35 24 to 17 and 70 to 200 I want a full 16 millimeter to 200 millimeter range that's pretty much where all my landscape photography fits in and Fuji film just don't have don't cover that in the GFX range at the moment so that'll be interesting Fujifilm are also releasing a hundred megapixel medium format camera as well I'm guessing that one's gonna be around 6,000 pounds are probably out of my budget but it's certainly interesting in where we're going so yeah difficult decisions coming the money we're spending on cameras is hard-earned it's often quite a large amount of money as well see everybody including me really wants to make sure that that money goes into the right place into a place as well it's somewhat future proofs that's certainly part for me and I want to know I'm getting the image quality in the Len that the lens choice is there as well at the moment I'm most excited about the canon eos are with the 74 whatever the gonna be called with the 75 megapixel sensor that's certainly what I'm waiting to see along with the medium formats Fuji GFX art but there's a couple of things cameras that people have asked me about recently that I cannot any longer recommend the Canon 6d mark 2 is one of those that was is a good camera I reviewed it and I liked it and it was good landscape photography but in terms of buying it now for the price it is there are definitely newer better options and that the EOS are being one of them even the Fujifilm I'd probably choose this over the Canon 6d mark - even though this is cropped sensor and that is a full-frame also the canon 7d map - I just don't see any point in buying that one now a lot of people like that for wildlife because it was a cropped sensor you could get in a bit closer it had fast frames per second but the Fuji film does as well because mirrorless and a lot of mirrorless offerings have much higher sort of burst rate if you're into wildlife photographers I know this thought process has been all over the place but I think that's where a lot of people stand at the moment I'm certainly going to bide my time if I need a lens at the moment I'll just be renting it or borrowing it as best I can over the next few months as things develop I want to try and get my hands on as many cameras as I can to test them out to review them so you'll see it all here on this channel and I'll share my thoughts stick around to see some extra thoughts on the end screen as ever I'd really be interested to hear from you on this one down below in the comments what what are your thoughts what camera are you interested in what
