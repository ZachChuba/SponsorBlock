traveling to another plane of existence and being led around by a spinning globe of light through a valley filled with waterfalls while being described the meaning of life in existence which he documented in his 2012 book proof of heaven and neurologist journey through the afterlife available on Amazon for 12:9 you know in February of 2006 and even where Johnny's organs began to fail due to end-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma she described travelling outside of her body and hearing a conversation or husband was having with a doctor down the hall before being whisked away to another dimension where she experienced true love and pure peace and goodness all around her while being described the meaning of life miraculously she recovered and went under ed a book about the experience called dying to be me available on Amazon tonight Don Piper a reverend in California was struck by an 18-wheeler in 1989 he was pronounced dead at the scene but 90 minutes later his pulse returned and he described traveling to a shimmering gate being surrounded by dead relatives that hadn't seen in years including his late grandfather he describes his conversation with those dead old people in his New York Times best seller 90 minutes in heaven payable on Amazon for $9.99 or watch the movie version starring a mustachioed Anakin Skywalker in 2003 three year old Colton Burpo underwent emergency surgery for a ruptured appendix he woke up describing a conversation that he had with his late great grandfather whom he had never met and described riding on a rainbow colored horse with Jesus book movie an entire ministry yeah some people have made a lot of money on near-death experiences which makes it really easy to roll your eyes at the entire phenomenon but today I'm gonna try to do the hard thing and actually take these seriously because not everybody that has this experience tries to monetize it and a lot of people have had this experience 48% of the population according to some studies that's up to 14 million people in the US alone and as medical science progresses and more and more people are being brought back from the brink of death this seems to be happening more than ever so let's take a look into this phenomena and examine some of the explanations for why this happens including one that you've probably never heard before too many people stories of near-death experiences just sound crazy and they automatically discount anybody who claims to have had one but we all have crazy dreams all the time dreams are a very real phenomenon you can't say that dreams don't exist just because they sound crazy and that's all I'm trying to say here you know yes there are people who try to make money and push their agenda is using near-death experiences and they do sound kind of crazy but they do happen a lot so for this video let's just take it at face value and examine what this could possibly be now I know this dips into some metaphysical territory and some of you guys are not too comfortable with that so for those of you who aren't here's your alarm now one thing that separates in des from dreams is that dreams tend to be kind of all over the place whereas near-death experiences tend to be strikingly similar some of the basic elements that tend to occur in India is include an out-of-body experience traveling through a tunnel seeing a bright light interacting the spirits or deceased loved ones a life review where your life is presented to you feelings of peace and love and the experience of having the meaning of life and the fundamental reality of existence explained to you but according to a Belgian study in the journal frontiers in science these characteristics might be prevalent in near-death experiences but they are not always in that order the order seems to be a bit more random now it needs to be said that not everybody who gets pulled back from the brink of death experiences a near-death experience in fact only about 15% according to a Gallup poll and there are also the unfortunate outliers whose experiences are anything but peaceful and serene and about 1% of near-death experiences they actually describe going to hell everything from fire pits to black voids to demons eating their flesh and of course speakers blaring Nickelback for now let's just stick with the classical near-death experience and examine what could be causing this phenomenon we're going to start from the most woowoo - the least blue blue and then go back a couple wumu steps the first in our list is your soul goes to heaven Occam's razor states that all things being equal the simplest answer is usually the correct one so is the simplest answer for the experience of somebody going to heaven just that people are going to heaven I'm gonna argue no because all things are not equal in this case some of the other explanations on this list actually have some kind of scientific basis behind them whereas the idea of actually going to heaven is only anecdotal in nature I don't say that the completely discount anecdotal evidence but when given the choice between experimental and anecdotal evidence I'll pick the experimental every time now having said that there are plenty of things in science that we only have indirect evidence of but we still believe dark matter dark energy for example we have indirect evidence of it but we've never directly observed it many people will also make the argument that the belief in an afterlife has been a part of religions and cultures and civilizations all the way back to the very beginning of time so maybe we shouldn't be so quick to dismiss that the reply to that would be that the wrestling with our own mortality has of course led to a belief in the afterlife because it serves as a bit of a salve to take away that existential angst as I've talked about in previous videos we are exceptionally good at lying to ourselves so obviously this can go back and forth forever I just felt like it should be included on here and the interest of being thorough so they're moving on your rejoining a universal consciousness there are some that believe that at a fundamental level the universe is made up of and created by consciousness itself now people use this to explain things like the double slit experiment and quantum entanglement although experts would say that this is based more on misunderstandings of those things than actual reality but in this worldview consciousness is not something that's created by the brain it's something that kind of flows through the brain but the structure of our brains only makes up our sense of self and our experience of consciousness is filtered through that self that's created by the brain so in this case when you die which really dying is your self and your experience of consciousness continues through the universal consciousness of course in the case of a near-death experience the body then becomes revived and your brain kind of boots back up along with the self that had just faded away now it needs to be said that while this idea is rooted in more actual science that is not in any way embraced by the scientific community this is still kind of fringy stuff but here's how it all fits together now if talk in the past about the global consciousness project and how changes in human emotion can actually affect the patterns and random number generators basically insinuating that our consciousness can't affect the physical world which of course would tie into the idea that all matter and energy is tied in to this underlying field of conscious this underlying fields which one could argue sounds a lot like quantum field theory then there's that work Oh our model put out there by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose which argues that microtubules and the neurons of our brains could serve as sort of quantum qubits that could transmit information through quantum entanglement in and out of our brain this could be the mechanism that allows our brains to communicate with that underlying universal consciousness now there's a whole lot of ifs for this to work and it does kind of smell like we're patching in our holes in our understanding with quantum theory stuff that we also don't fully understand which is why this is not completely embraced by the scientific community so what is supported by the overall scientific community it's all a hallucination caused by a flood of hormones and chemicals at the time of death and for the bus kill now as I mentioned earlier there are several components to the classical near-death experience and all of those can be described by different physical things that take place in the brain at the time of death for example people who experience carbon dioxide poisoning can often experience tunnel vision or seeing a blinding light obviously when your heart starts pumping carbon dioxide is not being pumped out of your brain so it can build up hence this effect the whole life review and meeting of dead relatives is often explained by the fact that the memory center is one of the last places in the brain to shut down at the time of death and now the body experiences can be created by manipulating the temporoparietal junction in the brain this is actually a part of the brain that creates a sense of connectedness to the body and then there's the DMT dimethyltryptamine is an endogenous psychedelic meaning it's produced inside the body and people who take DMT often experience feelings of love and connectedness to all of the universe it's sort of creates an artificial near-death experience in fact it's called the spirit molecule for that reason if it's imitates what they call ego death meaning the self that talked about earlier it kind of goes away in fact it makes it a very powerful treatment for people who are terminally ill helps them to kind of come to grips with their own death so it's believed by many that at the time of death the brain floods itself with DMT to sort of create this experience but why now some people suggest that the DMT is actually something of a chemical catalyst for spiritual detachment that it's not just a hallucination it's actually kind of opening a window to another dimension others say it's just nature's way of kind of the transition into death a little something to take away the anxiety and help us to let go which is nice but again why why would nature care at all that we are having a smooth transition into death you know why would we evolve to do that evolution doesn't work that way you know the smoother transition at the death is absolutely nothing to move our genes forward it's useless in terms of evolution and then if we have this ability and it wasn't put there by evolution then why is it there or who put it there just this question alone gets pretty woowoo in itself now it could be argued that DMT and all these other hormones get released for the same reason that our bowels release when we die things just kind of let go but the point is we don't know what that mechanism is or why it happens but it just goes to show that even if you go to the most reductionist physicalist explanation for NDEs there's still a lot of unanswered questions around it now there is another explanation for NDEs that I thought was interesting it was pointed out by a patreon supporter and I had never thought of this before so I thought I would include it here it's called technological resurrection there's a famous quote from arthur c clarke that says that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic it's not been called Clarke's third law for example I'm sure if he went back 300 years with an iPhone and show them that you have this rectangle that can capture people's likenesses that lights up from the inside that if you press a combination of buttons you could literally talk to anybody in the whole world they would probably burn you at the stake similarly we easily accept that future people or a super intelligent AI will be able to do things that right now we can't even conceive of things that we would consider to be magic things like curing any disease recreating entire bodies transferring consciousness even time travel none of that is beyond the realm of possibilities what the idea of technological resurrection does is basically bring all that together the idea is in the future we might be able to transfer a person's consciousness out of their body in the moments just before death and put it into a physical avatar or maybe into a virtual world that's an idea we've all heard many times before but what if they could actually do that through time they can actually manipulate time and go back and do that for dead relatives meaning the experience you have at the time of death is not into another realm but transporting into the future some of this ties into a late 1800s philosophy called Russian cosmos and which is facing a bit of a resurrection itself among Silicon Valley types osman ism was a blend of spirituality and technology centered on the idea of someday reviving our ancestors and traveling the cosmos the movement was started by russian philosopher nikolai fedorov who was also known as the socrates of moscow and he also piled around with Leo Tolstoy and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky the father of Russian rocketry now fedorov and the Kosmas and movement were the early precursors of the transhumanism movement that wants to merge humans and technology this idea of immortality through technology is championed by some of the most respected thinkers in the world today including Ray Kurzweil and Peter Thiel they think that we're coming up on a singularity where the artificial intelligence becomes exponential and completely transforms the human experience in some of these transformations include the very types of technology that would need to be created for this kind of thing to happen now it may take a couple hundred years but given the current pace of technology it's not completely out of the question now you might be wondering you know in 200 years why would somebody come back and you know resurrect me wouldn't they forgot know about me at that point which yeah they might have but it's easy to imagine somebody wanting to resurrect their dead parents and those dead parents would come back and might want to resurrect their parents who might want to resurrect their parents and so on and so on now obviously there's still a ton of ifs and maybes for this thing to ever even be considered possible but you know for one thing we've got to actually make the singularity and then you know we talk about the singularity in terms of two utopias but also nightmares so not only does the singularity have to happen but it has to happen in the right way you know in many ways this idea of a super intelligent AI of eventually making the impossible possible is a bit of a substitute for what we've always considered to be God basically putting faith in the future instead of faith in the spiritual the actual projecting back in time the whole teleportation problem whenever you talk about transferring consciousness you know these are these are particularly hard problems to solve but it's an interesting concept so I thought I would put it out there for you guys I'm putting a link in the description down below to a book called technological resurrection a thought experiment by Jonathan Jones and in it he breaks down this whole idea he talks about all the little roadblocks that we would have to over and whatnot it's really interesting he sent me a copy I really liked it I think you'll like it too by the way this is not an affiliate link I'm making no money off of this whatsoever I'm just sharing with you if you want to look further into this idea death is inevitable and it's a bummer so when you have a mysterious phenomenon that happens at the time of death it's easy to want to put a lot of meaning onto it it's easy to make it bigger than it might actually be it's something that kind of gives us hope some refer to this is death denial that we cleaned ideas or beliefs that give us hope that there might be something after this that this isn't just you know all there is but it's important to remember that ultimately what you know to be true is that you have this one lifetime and you got to make it count Kevin Smith of Silent Bob Fame actually faced this himself earlier this year when he had a massive heart attack and was told that the procedure they needed to do on him only had a 20% chance of being successful he spoke recently with Joe Rogan on his podcast about this whole experience and how you know what it was like to be in that moment and realized that this might be it you know this was the lifetime he was given and how in that moment all of his responsibilities sort of faded away and it gave him peace you know a calm that he wasn't expecting and I've heard this from other people who have been in a similar situation where they had to face their own mortality and the fact that their life might be over and then once they get past that they just appreciate every day that they're given so much more every day that they wake up in the morning is a gift I know that sounds like a cheesy sentiment but I doubt there's anything cheesy about it to them we're all living on borrowed time and I think the trick is to keep that from being an anchor that weighs you down and keeps you from being happy but instead turn that into a sense of urgency that whatever it is you want to do whoever it is you want to be whatever you want to feel do it now it's literally the only chance you have but I'm curious how many of you out there I've actually been faced with the end of your life and live to tell the tale how did it change you and did you have any kind of near-death experience whether you've had one or not what do you think is the best explanation for this phenomena I have a feeling the comments section is gonna be really interesting in this video because if you have been changed by a peek into the great beyond you should get that out there you should share that enlightenment with people links in the description thanks to Squarespace for being an awesome partner in this channel and I want to give a special shout-out to my answer files on patreon
