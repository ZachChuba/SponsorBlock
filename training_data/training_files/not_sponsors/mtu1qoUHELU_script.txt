[Music] it's the latest cancellation being attributed to the coronavirus here why Jesus Christ return to Earth may be suspended indefinitely and later can a man survive by eating nothing but spam I sure hope so because I'm currently on lockdown inside my apartment with several hundred cans of the stuff I've never had it before but I hear it's popular in Hawaii so hopefully I like it from the onion and onion Public Radio I'm Leslie price and this is the topical we've got everything you need to know on the only thing happening in the world right now stay with us the topical is up using promo code topical Jesus Christ a quick note before we get started you may be noticing a bit of a difference in audio quality today and that's because this episode of the topical is being recorded from the home of yours truly that's rights like many other employers OPR is officially implemented a podcast from home policy which they actually put into effect about two weeks ago but I didn't read the email until last night this company just sent us so much useless crap every day I don't know how they expect me to figure out what's actually important and what's not maybe if they would have said in the subject line this is useful information and not the same dumb [ __ ] we flood your inbox with and I wouldn't have had to take public transportation into the office for the last ten days but that's all in the past and we here at OPR are committed to bringing you the best in podcast journalism no matter how dire the circumstances which is exactly why we'll be broadcasting from Casa de Leslie for at least the next week or until civilization as we know it ends for good and now for today's top story adding to the spate of cancellations in recent weeks due to the threat of coronavirus Jesus Christ announced today he'll be canceling has returned to earth we've conjured OPRS afterlife correspondent Thaddeus lawson over the phone to get an idea of what impact this will have that is thanks for joining us hi Leslie so it sounds like Jesus was all set up to finally make his triumphant Second Coming and save us all from sin why call off this return now after so much build-up and planning it was definitely a hard decision it was supposed to be the biblical event of the eon and every soul in heaven was really excited and planned to watch but it seemed necessary and prudent to cancel this an order for the son of God to maintain social distancing after the CDC discouraged gatherings of more than 50 people well I suppose it's better for the Oh mighty Redeemer to err on the side of caution that's right it's essential given that at almost 2000 years old Jesus is well within the age range of those most vulnerable to the contagion plus it would not only be an unmitigated tragedy but also a PR nightmare if God were to have his only begotten Son died while trying to deliver salvation unto all of mankind just listen to what God had to say oh sorry I forgot you can't hear his voice without your eyes and ears bleeding oh he said that he's sorry for any inconveniences may have caused and that heaven is doing everything in its power to address this okay well I think the question on everyone's mind is why couldn't Jesus come down and just perform a miracle and cure every one of the disease well miracles are generally reserved for more important acts like walking on water and making a fig tree wither fair and finally Thaddeus what's the larger picture here what does Jesus's choice mean for our eternal Psalms well it's not looking good not only is there no plan for Jesus to return at any point in the future God has also mandated a total ascension ban on heaven until further notice several souls in purgatory have already tested positive for coronavirus so until the messes sorted out all newly deceased and potentially infected spirits will be held in limbo with the unbaptized babies as a precaution and if purgatory becomes full due to mass die-offs hell has agreed to welcome any overflow Souls as a gesture of goodwill with heaven in this trying time so does that mean the apocalypse is canceled as well oh no that's still very much going on we're just skipping the Jesus the Second Coming part and going straight to the agony and torment the four horsemen should arrive any day now makes sense that's OPRS Thaddeus Lawson well it's not just the youngin handsome like myself being inconvenienced by these coronavirus outbreaks with mortality rates highest among the elderly assisted living communities are taking extra precautions to discuss some of the steps being taken by facilities around the country I'm joined by Ida hallingstad executive director of briar patch nursing home Ida thanks for calling in thanks for having me Leslie could you walk me through how coronavirus has changed life at the nursing home well considering we don't usually get a ton of visitors anyway things really haven't been too different here we're still asking staff to wash their hands thoroughly and everything but honestly we're really not that worried about it not like any of you come to visit your grandparents anyway so you're telling me you don't have a policy in place for screening visitors well we would if we had anyone coming to visit we actually extended visiting hours in case anyone feels compelled to show up and treat their loved ones with a shred of human dignity but I mean who are we kidding it's not like they're people right Lesley well this is a crisis situation aren't you concerned for your residents this virus is really nothing compared to the crippling isolation they feel on a daily basis if a resident dies because of contact with the visitor then at least they'll die knowing that their child loves them but that's probably too much to ask hi Leslie to come visit your ailing mother every once in awhile all right I know what the [ __ ] you said you wouldn't do this why are you busting my balls here oh I don't know Leslie maybe because the woman who gave you literal life is spending her last years on earth alone staring out of the first-floor window all day spare me the guilt trip I pay you people good money to take care of her plus you know with the coronavirus wearing quarantine now we're supposed to be social distancing oh you're right Leslie I'm sorry I didn't realize you've been in quarantine for the last 18 months look I want to visit but things just get so busy here since the topical launch has just been Leslie can you approve this and Leslie can you take a look at that I am just pulled in so many goddamn directions since she knows that I'm sure she understands and I promise I'll visit whenever I get the chance tell her I'm coming soon real soon okay why don't you tell her yourself what no your help put her on the phone right now oh uh whoa what's that I I think you're cutting out here mrs. price it's your son Leslie Oh I'm about to lose you well that didn't go very well I'd like to thank Ida hallingstad for whatever it is she does you can find more information about briar leaf nursing or a patch briar patch nursing home at their website back in a moment got a listening you're now officially fired from home well I could sit here in my bathrobe and read the news all day but I think I'm about to run out of space on my hard drive so I better wrap this up here's what else you need to know today president Trump oh wait the music there we go president Trump announced today at a press conference that he has coronavirus and is dead the Trump administration has been under fire for their poor response during the outbreaks and this announcement only furthered confusion as president Trump appeared to be standing breathing and looking very much alive throughout the press conference good news for those trying to stay fit during their quarantine a new study has found that just three minutes of daily exercise is only 27 minutes show to being useful so keep up those bedroom jumping jacks every little bit counts and planet Earth announced today that it's not really sure how to make it any more clear that it wants everyone to leave while Earth hoped we would all have just taken the goddamn hint by now it said it was fully prepared to make its wishes even more appearance in the coming months and that's it for the topical today I'm Leslie price thanks again for sticking with the topical as we navigate this new quarantine reality of ours as a relatively mentally stable man I'm sure this sudden change in lifestyle paired with complete and total isolation won't cause me to miss a beat and if it does what's really the worst that could happen well anyway from all of us here at OPR stay safe stay healthy and stay alone we'll see you right back here tomorrow [Music]
