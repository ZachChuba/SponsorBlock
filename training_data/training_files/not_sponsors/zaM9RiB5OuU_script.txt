this video is sponsored by Squarespace oh ho ho happy holidays it's me Santa claw claw rest in and this is the first ever carson rehnquist christmas special that means it's just like every other video but this one is something to do with the holidays there were a lot of great options this year that would be great for future christmas specials but today i wanted to get meta I wanted to in this Christmas special talk about TV show Christmas specials I have always thought that the Christmas episode of my favorite show is so exciting I used to watch a lot of TV cartoons specifically so similar to a music playlist on shuffle I'd often come back to the same episodes over and over again but you never get that Christmas episode on any month other than December it felt like a rare fine that I often treated like a new episode being that it's not something I got to watch often but as I've grown older and have become more aware of what it is that I am watching I've come to realize that regardless of the show regardless of the characters all these Christmas episodes have the same plot when you first hear that you're like well yeah they all revolve around Christmas so yeah they're all gonna be the same but I'm here to say why is that the case there are tons of different things that come with the holidays that would make for good original TV episodes but every show seems to follow the same formula now they don't all necessarily follow it exactly you know this ain't the same as this but the structure and character development runs the same throughout each episode this is a topic I've really wanted to address and when trying to figure out how to do it I realize that there's no way I'm going to be able to talk about every single Christmas episode nor is it possible for me to find and watch every single Christmas episode so for this quote-unquote study I've decided to take a Christmas episode from three completely different shows and prove that they are all at their core the same thing these three shows that I have picked our Spongebob friends and because I just talked about in another video the office but carsten these are all comedies well yeah I've noticed that Christmas episodes usually happen in comedies so you know what that's that's kind of what we're gonna go with plus they all are technically different types of comedy and yeah alright alright I'll shut up now let's get into it step one now this first one is a bit subtle and small but something I've realized about all these Christmas episodes is that they start with somebody setting up some sort of Christmas decoration we'll start with spongebob in the beginning of this episode we find sandy setting up some Christmas lights only for it to be ruined shortly after bye Bob in the office the episode kicks off with Michael bringing in a Christmas tree that is clearly too large for the office and lastly in friends we see something a bit different Phoebe provides a skull but the thing about this is that it's such a small and random and insignificant part of the episode that it almost feels like the writers felt as though they were forced to include it because you know they needed some sort of decoration to be set up it's weird that this is always happening at the beginning of these episodes so I was like you know what I got included this is a trait I don't fully understand because seriously there are a lot of other ways to let the audience know it's the holiday episode without setting up decorations I don't know step2 a common thing I've seen a lot of these episodes do is explain a certain holiday tradition or just a whole holiday in general in the cases of Spongebob and friends they're explaining entire holidays with SpongeBob I understand being that it's a kids show I guess it makes sense for some explanation for what Christmas is to be included through those unfamiliar spongebob doesn't know what Christmas is hence his destruction of the decorations so sandy defines it for him the episode later gets into more description of Spongebob explains the holiday and its traditions to people all around town with friends a big part of the episode is Ross's desire to teach Cole Sprouse about Hanukkah this leads to Ross saying or at least trying to say what the meaning behind Hanukkah is thus explaining it now the office is special but still follows this rule the office doesn't have any children involved so describing a holiday would definitely feel pointless but it does come with the inclusion of a Secret Santa and Yankee Swap game a fun holiday gift thing that Michael describes later in the episode I understand that it's a bit of a stretch to call this an explanation but I'm gonna count it step 3 everybody always gets angry at each other now I know what you're thinking conflict is of course necessary for any great story to succeed regardless if it's a holiday special or not but conflict doesn't always have to result in everyone splitting up and that just always seems to be the case for these Christmas episodes in all of these there's always a scene where something goes wrong or a tradition is broken and the group somehow for whatever reason splits up and everyone becomes independent and lonely on Christmas in spongebob everyone waits around for Santa after spongebob pipe smoke but sadly Santa never comes following that everyone in town gets upset and abandoned spongebob leaving him sad and alone next we got the office the gang attempts to do Secret Santa only to have Michael ruin it by including an iPod as a gift turning the game into a Yankee Swap this basically defeats the purpose of Secret Santa as now people are getting gifts that weren't meant for them Michael ends up offending Phyllis everyone wants the iPod it's a mess it gets to a point where pretty much everyone ends up somewhat upset and splits up to do their own thing leaving everyone alone and sad and then we have friends now friends being that it's run time is so brief does manage to squeeze this moment in because what would be a holiday episode without it but it lasts very briefly it's when Cole Sprouse is being taught about Hanukkah by Ross the armadillo and suddenly Chandler comes in wearing a Santa costume causing Cole to lose interest in Ross immediately this of course hurts Ross's feelings as well as Chandler's and the two of them for like two seconds end up alone and sad so where do we go from here the final step step 4 step 4 is my favorite because it's literally like exactly the same for all of these episodes step three exists because of step 4 step 4 is when everyone comes together after being split up for a wholesome group ending because being together is what Christmas is all about let's start with spongebob since our last thing a bunch of stuff has happened where Squidward takes the role of Santa and saves Christmas it ends with spongebob some girl and even Squidward coming together to celebrate the magic of the holidays now we got friends this one is the funniest to me because everyone didn't need to come back together but again the writers were like well this is the Christmas special so like obviously we have to end it this way by the end of it you got the whole gang looking out the window celebrating the holidays together and lastly the office which in my opinion has the most wholesome ending while it isn't shown after everyone gets drunk out of their minds thanks to Michael they decide to go to a bar as a group to celebrate the best part they invite Michael someone who has been known to be left out of office events it's such a wholesome and pure moment that really proves how magical the holidays are ah so yeah notice a trend here and this happens with tons of other shows out there this is just three and I do want to emphasize that while I did tease the shows I love the holidays and these episodes are just tons of fun I really have no problem with them it's just fun to me that they're all kind of the same well anyways I hope everyone has a good holiday season and I'll see you next week with my top ten films of 2018 list happy holidays wait but before you head gonna love it that
