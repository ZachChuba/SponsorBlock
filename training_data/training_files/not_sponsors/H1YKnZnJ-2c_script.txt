Tesla Model 3 accessories visit model 3 part comm good day everybody thanks for tuning in today we're gonna take a look at the new software update 2020 dot 12.6 as it relates to the new stoplight and stop sign features on the way to work this morning we're gonna go ahead and give a quick test check them out show you a few things that you need to know and we'll take a quick look and a couple of stop signs and a couple stoplights show you how well it works in the Tesla Model 3 let's dive right in what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna quickly drop this thing into traffic aware cruise control and you could have automatically see that it's it recognizes a stop sign and this is all GPS based it's not seeing a stop sign 600 feet in front of me but let's see how well it does here if it actually stops or what we have to do and look at this beautiful however I will say it's a little abrupt right there at the end it wants to sort of slam on the brakes a little bit now that wasn't bad because I was only doing 16 miles an hour so let's see what happens when I'm going a little bit faster and then basically the note on the screen says use accelerator or gear stock to continue so we'll just go ahead and use the gear stock and boom it takes off right away so that's pretty cool I'm gonna juice up the speed here a little bit alright so now we're up to 20 miles an hour and it recognized a stop sign in 600 feet see how well it does here so yesterday when I was testing this album it didn't work all that great so we're gonna see how how it does today and I understand that it is in beta that was actually really good so as I was saying as I was saying I know this is in beta so there are some things that I want to discuss at the end of the video about the release notes that you should be aware of so this time I'm gonna go ahead and hit the stock to continue yeah okay don't know what it was doing there but didn't really want to go through the intersection alright I'm gonna crank it up here to 23 miles an hour so this is just in my subdivision folks it's very slow 25 mile an hour speed limit and not a lot of traffic so very safe to do this testing so 200 feet and yeah pretty much slam down the break there so again we're gonna go ahead and hit the stock to accelerate so the beta thing that I wanted to talk about it into the video sort of important because I think that's one thing that everybody has to understand is you know when Tesla releases software like this yes they do a lot of testing but they push it out to the fleet to be able to gain a lot of information back so that they can enhance and improve that set feature over time so just released out to the fleet a lot of you should be getting this update very very soon if you haven't already and the more we use it the more information we send back as we interact with it the better it will become so very very cool to see this feature working I don't know about you guys but I I didn't imagine that I would have a car that could do the things that this thing does in my lifetime anyway stopping at stop lights and stop signs I mean I guess if you think about it watching The Jetsons you know 20 years back or actually even more than that um you're like oh that's gonna be cool flying cars or everything well this is sort of the Jetson of the auto industry right now there is no one even close to doing what Tesla does and it's just quite amazing alright so here we go another stop sign and I wish it liked the 200-foot mark it would start to slow down a little bit more so if they have to slam on the brakes very good that one was actually perfect it was very very nice to the approach of the stop sign and stopped very very smoothly it wasn't abrupt at all so very cool one more stop sign here and then we're going to have a couple of stoplights that will go through and it's pretty quick to react so once it stops and you hit the drive stock or the accelerator to continue it it's right there it it moves pretty quickly so there's not much of a delay which is very good and we got a stop light which is awesome see it already detected that as well so let's see how it interacts here it is currently red you can't quite see it in the picture yet but coming up there you go it's behind the dACC okay and it just turned green and that's the other thing that I want to know is that look at the difference in these in the traffic lights sorry I don't know why it's going so slow here yeah so weird I don't know why it was set to 30 and it was only doing like 15 cars behind me were like hey do you mind going so we'll try the stoplight again but what I did want to note is that the color of the lights the signals have actually changed from the previous version they're a little more intense I guess you could say they're a little brighter and gives you a little more definition to the light so you know exactly what color it is and so just another enhancement that Tesla made through the 2020 that 12.6 updated all right coming up to another red light we'll see how well it does here it did recognize at 600 feet good things that looks like I'll be first in line so okay turn green so I'm gonna hit the stock to let it know that I can continue man that was brutal so I had my turn signal on and came to the stoplight turned green I hit the stock to continue went and made the turn it didn't really know what to do so it pretty much just put the brakes on so I guess that part of it still need some work I I don't know why wouldn't just proceed and the other thing that I just noticed too is that even though I was gonna take that turn it was gonna get me up to speed as quickly as it possibly could so there wasn't going to be a gradual acceleration through that turn so that's something that Tesla's gonna have to work out I think the feature is gonna work great for now when you are going straight and not having a turn left or right at the stop sign because it does a few goofy things as it relates to the acceleration from when you're stopped so we'll have to take a couple more tests here and see how that works out it's going to be interesting to see the next release or the next version as this continues to grow and using autopilot is it going to be able to make those turns left and right from a stop sign and from a stop light and I think that's not too far off I mean this is a huge huge step for Tesla and I think that the more we use it the better it's going to become and the more widely it'll be used as it gets better and better [Music] yeah it is just doesn't seem to be slowing down soon enough for me I would I would have probably let off the accelerator sooner than that but nonetheless it came to the stoplight and stopped appropriately these lights that you see here are the back of the light space in the other way and our red lights are there in the background so we'll see if it recognizes it so it can proceed correctly I just love this the GUI is just amazing and it's just getting better and better what I was hoping to see is that arrow turn green I don't know if we'll be able to see it behind all the other markings on the screen here hopefully it pushes me through the intersection and doesn't slam on the brakes so that you have people behind alright so we now we have a flashing yellow I'm gonna hit it to proceed I can press the stock and we are off now it did see it's only doing 19 miles an hour moving very slow starting to pick up the pace a little bit so you know I can't really complain about that I mean it was gradually getting up to speed as it should because you remember my rant earlier where it sort of accelerated too fast that was maybe a little bit too slow so I think eventually it will find that happy medium and understand what you're trying to do and start to be better and better so that actually worked really well I did like that it was a little bit too slow and of course you know people behind you sometime during patience anyway but nonetheless I think that worked pretty well all right so I'm gonna throw this and navigate on autopilot now and we are on a busier route here and we have a bunch of stoplights and you can see here and it recognizes it and it's just looking for your input to say yep it's okay to proceed and I interacted using the stock and I kept on going but what it does do is that soon as it recognizes the stoplight it starts to slow down and it wants your interaction fairly immediately which is a good thing because it knows that you're paying attention to the road otherwise it is going to start to slow down so let's try that again here on the next light and I'm gonna take a little bit longer to interact with it and see how well it does alright it popped up here I'm gonna let it go for a little bit you can see a certain slowdown pretty drastically there anyway and then once I interacted boom it picked speed back up and started to go change lanes here and by the way navigate on autopilot has been a lot better with this update alright recognize another stop 100 feet look how quickly if you notice that 800 700 600 so it's getting close and it needs needs to have your input to that traffic light now here's a bunch of traffic lights that we're going to be coming through we're gonna go ahead and hit accept on that one and then look at the light indications look how much brighter they are then they work previously and here comes another light go ahead and this time I'm gonna hit the accelerator and boom riding on through sorry for them talk a little bit fast folks these lights are coming up so quickly and here's another light coming up I'm gonna hit the accelerator again these are back to back to back another light I didn't interact right away it started to slow down even more look how much more vivid these lights are look at that alright I have to there's another light I'm gonna go ahead and jump through this light get on the expressway and there you have it that is the new 2020 that 12.6 stop sign and traffic light feature it is pretty phenomenal to see the car actually interact with those objects on the road and actually to a really really good job of it so now that we're done with that part of the test I wanted to go in and read you the release notes there's a few things that you have to understand and there's one thing that you have to change in the settings menu to enable the use of the stop sign and traffic light feature [Music] alright so real quick as I promised I'm gonna go over the release notes here version 10.2 2020 12.6 so let's jump right in here yes I'm going to read this because I want to make sure that it's clear to everybody on how this thing works so traffic light and stop sign control beta key word beta just like navigate on autopilot and some of the other features that were revealed so traffic light and stop sign control is designed to recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs slowing your car to a stop when using traffic aware cruise control or auto steer so you have to make sure that you're using TAC C or auto steer this is not going to work if you're on hardware 2.5 or don't have either of those engage this feature will also slow the car for all detected traffic lights keyword detected including green blinking yellow and ah I'm not really sure what that one means but maybe somebody will come across that and be able to share what that is so moving on as your car approaches an intersection your car will indicate the intention to slow down via a notification and you guys all saw those here on the screen the car will slow down and stop at the redline shown on the driving visualization noted here as well as on the Testament a bit earlier to continue through the stop line push the gear selector once or briefly press the accelerator pedal to confirm that it is safe to proceed as with autopilot features you must continue to pay attention and be ready to take immediate action including braking because this feature may not stop from all traffic controls we always say this in every video that I do auto pilot testing on you need to make sure that you're paying attention just in case something goes awry and we've all been there seen it done it that the car does do some goofy things every now and again so you have to pay attention so this feature again here noted this feature will be conservative slow down often at first and will attempt to turn through intersections over time as we learn from the fleet very very important the feature will control and more naturally now remember earlier when we tested when I was going through the intersection or in making a turn it definitely didn't know what to do and I think again here to my point it will continue to get better over time so I'm actually glad to see that in the release notes so moving on to enable shift your current park and tap control autopilot and traffic light and stop sign control beta and here are the last note when this feature is enabled the maximum set speed while using auto steer is limited there's a speed limit on the road so if the speed limit is 30 miles an hour you can't go live miles an hour over the speed limit like you can using navigate on autopilot or autopilot in general and I'm talking rural roads city streets and so forth so that is very important to note because you can sit here and flip your scroll wheel or hit the plus sign to try to increase your speed it will not work so before this feature can be enabled camera calibration may be required now I didn't have any issues with that and the latest version of navigation maps must be downloaded via Wi-Fi please refer to the owners manual for additional details about this feature now there's a couple important notes here to take is that the stop lights and stop signs are all based on the maps it's not like the the cameras are seeing a stoplight or stop sign 600 feet in front of it it's actually using the navigation map to determine where the stop lights and stop signs are located so all done with the notes thank you for sitting through that I truly appreciate it but I wanted to come back in here to the settings and show you guys exactly where this sits and you can see I think I went a little bit too fast so coming to your settings autopilot traffic light and stoplight control beta I've already turned mine on just so you know when you do turn it on you do have to agree to all of the beta testing things pretty much what we've just read and making sure that you are paying tension and basically agree to enable traffic light and stop cycling all right everybody that is it that is the new traffic light and stop sign feature update I hope I was able to provide some useful information to you all and show you how well it works as well as some of the improvements that Tessa will be making over the coming weeks and months as more information is gathered from the please so there you have it folks thanks again for tuning in we truly appreciate it we'll catch you on the next one take care [Music]
