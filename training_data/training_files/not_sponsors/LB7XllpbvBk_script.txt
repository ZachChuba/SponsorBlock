what's going on YouTube my mission and welcome to my channel where my videos straight detain you and today I'm reacting to red velvet what's up everybody welcome back to my channel fish your first time here you should know that I love to have fun with keep up and I react to many different capable groups in many different ways so if you're into that go ahead and click that subscribe button in the notification bells did you know miss any of my videos but today is day number two of red velvet week that's right I am exploring red velvet for an entire week just looking at different music videos reacting to a guide may be seeing some dance practices some live performances or really just any funny videos as well I like to do this from time to time because reacting to one group back to back to back it kind of allows me to get to know them a little bit better and really explore their journey as well so today is day number two and for day one I actually reacted to a guide and to their debut song happiness so if you haven't seen that video I'm gonna link it down below or put it right up here so you go ahead and click it and check it out now from the video in the comments I learned quite a bit about red velvet already for example that you guys taught me how to say Yeti's name because I didn't know how to say it I struggled quite a bit but somebody actually gave me the hangeul way of writing it so I learned that it said Yeti so hopefully I'm saying it right now and I also learn let's see I learned that each member has a color so let me see if I remember correctly sylvie is yellow joy is green yeti is purple Irene is pink and Wendy is a blue I believe hopefully I got those right but yeah I looked at it a lot of you guys actually told me that so hopefully I got that right let me know if I missed up another thing that a lot of you guys told me about red velvet is that they have some really good b-sides so I definitely want to check some of those out this week please let me know in the comments which ones are your favorite be size bye and if there are any like particular specific music videos or performance videos of them or concert live performances or really anything about those specific besides that you want me to check out let me know and I would definitely be reacting to those this week sometime because apparently there have really good ones and they're known for those one thing that I didn't really see I don't believe anybody tell me about is the fandom name what is your name what do you guys go by what is the name that I hopefully will be calling myself as well please let me know in the description what at the fandom name is and really anything else about the girls I know so far also like I mentioned on my other video that red velvet has two sides so I'm yet to explore that but we're gonna find out in anyway today for day two I'm going to be checking out three more music videos by red velvet which are in chronological order let's see we have B natural automatic and ice cream cake and if I remember from your comments ice cream cake is the first music video in which Yeti appears on so hopefully we have a lot of fun here and let's go ahead and check out some red bell that stuff last thing before I get started a quick note is that this week's reaction usually for the most part when I do a weak reaction I try to start on a Monday and end on a Sunday so it's seven days consecutively but this week my schedule is kind of crazy so they may not be like back to back to back or like I started on a Tuesday for instance but I promise you that I will do a full week total like seven days of a red-velvet and that doesn't mean that I will stop reacting through a velvet forever it just means that for this particular series I'll be doing seven days total but they just not might be in order but just wait for me and I promise you I would do all of them right everybody let's get started with the first music video of the day be natural featuring SR 14b I don't know if I'm saying that right at all but Taeyang music video in three two one [Music] I like [Music] it seems like a performance video which I'm about nice her voice both others [Music] they all have really awesome voices oh [Music] so I guess they like to match right cuz they're all matching like head to toe even the hairstyle is the same the chairs everything [Music] nice cheeks [Music] also the style of the song is kind of like like Jessie almost like it R&B ish right which is not what you would expect from kpop right so it's actually refreshing like I like this that is different than what you would expect from a group for my girl girl group at that but I like it [Music] whoa that was cool see how that they did a transition with her arm that was really cool let's go back to that [Music] [Music] I like [Music] [Music] the way they did his rap with his own like voice you know together like layered these suits are cool this girls can pull old suits [Music] dang okay but I cannot relate with the Fricks ability look at that that's I I wish I was that flexible [Music] ooh the echo the way it ended nice okay okay we're starting off on a really elegant really relaxed by very different and then happiness I'll tell you that much but hey if the fact that they can pull of something so vibrant and colorful and big and bold as happiness and then give you this elegant softer side I guess it's kind of like the contrast from red velvet right red and velvet I don't know if that's a good example or not but the fact that they can pull of those two different styles shows that they're very versatile and can do you know pretty much anything they want to try so that's the first impression that I get from those videos but we're gonna move on to automatic kukuku all right next one is automatic music video in three two one whoo [Music] [Music] they're all blonde [Music] [Music] [Music] I really like how they sound wait is he any part of it now one two three four five is she part of it now at the ice cream cake was the first one but maybe not [Music] it's just how do i guys see that part when they say automatic [Music] you see your eyes green or gray [Music] places see it [Music] you'll get it missile [Music] that's a goose who danced wayfarer with a little step [Music] my report one of these that I like about songs like this is that you can really appreciate their voices because they're so like soft and subtle but powerful at the same time you know and and they're actually doing a lot with their voices I mean I don't I don't I'm not a singer or anything but I can tell like it from listening to different videos I can tell when you know a particular artist or something is able to you know do different ranges with just their voice and everything and and hit specific notes and very sometimes very subtle notes very low notes or really high notes but yeah it's just something that I particularly like to play pay attention to and then in a song like this you're able to do that because it's not like a really strong beat or anything like that but it's more mellow and I'm I actually like that [Music] like that [Music] keep somebody told me that it's called by Prado when it's kind of like like a he'd hear vibration in their voice somebody taught me that and I like that word now and I would but I gotta watch the videos [Music] it's really pretty - yes red velvet killing it killing it so far man alrighty so we're coming to the end of the reaction at last video we're gonna check out it's called ice cream cake I'm excited about this one it looks so bright kind of like happiness so we'll see what it's all about I really hope you're enjoying this reaction guys please keep giving me suggestions of what you want to see this week and I will do my best to make it happens but let's go ahead and check out ice cream cake here we go in three two one mmm that looks good all diner's okay I see colors so would it be okay for me to go by the colors here to recognize them or to identify them so like I forgot green is joy [Music] oh that's gonna creepy you but it sounds cool yellow Sylvie it's alright we'll get it guys will get it [Music] I like the car [Music] oh yes [Music] do I love ice cream is sweet so everything they're eating I want to eat I like those those are outfits like uniform looking happens [Music] and their nails really really cool [Music] I like those jackets with the lights are awesome did it get a joy [Music] the quarians q2 [Music] you know what's interesting that they're talking about ice cream cake but they're in like a desert you know I mean like a dry hot desert and you're talking about ice cream [Music] report we keep going Oh give me give me that your lips okay I see I see where you're going with that alright guys and that was my reaction to three more music videos from red velvet some other older videos but I really like them I the one thing that I like about kind of getting to know these different people groups by doing a full week of reactions is that I'm able to really see them do a bunch of different things and kind of the transition of how they started until now and this is a really good example of here like I'm able to see very different size of them from you know automatic to like ice cream cake two completely different things but they did them so well so yeah I'm into it right and slowly I'm trying to trying to get it together and learn them I promise that I'm gonna study a little bit more to to differentiate them but yeah guys you guys let me know what else you want to see like I said if you liked this video go ahead and let me know in the comments I read all your comments and slowly I get to respond to them I'm also on Twitter and Instagram if you want to go ahead and follow me please go ahead and do so and let everybody know what we're doing here on this channel with red velvet and a lot of other groups I react to many different groups guys I
