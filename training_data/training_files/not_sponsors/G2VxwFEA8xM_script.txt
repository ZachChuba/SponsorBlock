Full-sized desktops are great for playing  the latest AAA games at high framerate, or if you need the extra muscle   for video editing, 3d rendering or computer system design     but   if we're being honest       for most people   a thin and light basic laptop     is more than enough these days and   comes with the extra benefits   of portability and convenience     that you simply don't get with the desktop the real bummer   is when you ended up having to buy both     a desktop for your gaming or your   heavy work, and a laptop for when you're out and about, i mean why bother having 2 full cpu's   installed on 2 motherboards when you can only really use 1 at a time           if only there was a solution where just by plugging 1 cable into that laptop you already own   you could extend it with a full sized desktop all the peripherals and expension you could want and even, a powerfull graphics card i mean, while i'm dreaming, what if wireless charging simply built, right into our desk oh wait it is, and we did all of that stuff and we're gonna show you, exactly how it works Lazslo - Supernova so step zero for making your very own 1 cable desk-top thing is having a compatible laptop you don't get dual 4k monitors 10 gig file transfers and 85 watt of charging to a regular old micro usb port and cable now, for this to work we need a laptop with atleast 1 thunderbolt free port and we would strongly recommend finding 1 that has a 4x Pcie lane interface so thunderbolt 3 looks like a normal usb type c port except for this liiitle lighting bolt emblem that isn't keep on this there so the thunderbolt 3 port on our 2018 razerblade still for example is totally on mark if you need to double check your device you can always search for it on the thunderbolt technology website now, for step 1 plan yor layout at a minimum, your desktop is going to need a thunderbolt 3 hub for everything to run through luckily for us, Caldigit was kind enough to send us their flagship Ts3 plus which can provide 85 watts of power that's enough to charge my macbook pro and, it's got enough port for your peripherals wired internet, and a 10 gigabit external drive oh, also up to 2 4k monitors now you could just get the device like this and call it a day with no other parts necessary but to make our setup really special we want it to add an external graphic card enclosure so that our desktop not only makes our laptop easier to use with the monitors, peripherals, and you know a lot of ports and all that but also, substancially more powerful so that ended up making things a lil bit complicated for started, while thunderbolt 3 does support daisy chaining up to 6 devices off of a single port you can't just plug your graphics card into your dock unless your egpu is the 1st device in the chain you'll get often latency at desk and at worst, random crashes or total malfunctionality okay, so we just switch the order then, right ? laptop to egpu epu to dock, ooh so at the time we writing, the odds of your egpu having 2 ports on it for daisy chaining are pretty low the only option we're aware are a Blackmagic egpu it's only works with max akitio node duo which is designed to hold 2 cards but at only half the benefit each and the akinio node pro which is exactly what we ended up using i solves our problems, but it has a even tho our ts3 plus hub can deliver 85 watts of power your laptop only receive power from the device that it is directly connected to so on our case, that the node pro whose the thunderbolt 3 ports can only deriver up to 60 watts of power so, machine with higher power demands like the macbook pro could ended up triple charging fortunately for us, that is not the case for my blade stealth 2017 so, our journey continues step 2 then, choose a suitable desk as you can see, our finished desktop is completely meaning that, even tho it's got an integrated wireless charging and a freaking graphics card you can't see either of those things when you're sitting on the desk and that is only possible because of the planning that we did back in the step 1 so we limited our options to runs with enough cabinet space and thickness to containing all of our devices and our cables with obvious cable management runs for bonus points
