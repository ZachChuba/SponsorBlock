we're making a steak salad and before you go oh no a steak salad just stay right where you are Bucky this is going to be tremendous he's making a steak stand he's making a steak salad I can just hear that why can t make another Oh 20 pound of cheeseburger why can't he make a 5 pound burrito well I do that a lot but the weather is improving you can't eat heavy stuff all the time can you max you can't can you chance sometimes it's fun to make a great salad and that's what we're gonna do the steak part of it is a tri-tip ladies and gentlemen so named because of the triangular shape of this I've said this before I think if you looked up beef flavor in the dictionary there should be a picture of a tri-tip it's the consummate delicious smelling tasting cooking beef centric thing and I'm gonna smoke it essentially reverse searing it and for those of you who don't have a smoker I will talk you through what to do to get it exactly where I'm gonna get it today will not be left in the dark I promise right chance right right max right let's let's just trim this guy up a little bit season it and then we're on our way so here's what we've got looks pretty nice like nice marbling on this is a nice it's about a two pound tri-tip I like this but I want to get rid of these extra bits of fat here because that's not necessary so these guys can come off if you look at the top of it you'll see some of this some of this stuff just pulls right off so these pieces look I say it all the time I'm okay with that fat is flavor we all know that but I don't need too much of it so I'm okay here the backside though has a couple of pieces that I don't like so just using our knife we'll just skin these guys off once it's gone most of this fat I'm okay with this so to season this here's what we're gonna do we're gonna give it a little bit of oil just a tiny bit both sides and then we go to things a nice healthy dose of kosher salt and pepper and even though there will be garlic in other parts of this a little extra garlic on here is not a bad thing if you get a bite of steak by itself you want to taste everything so we'll season it the right way garlic here good and this guys ready I'll just put them on my baking sheet while I was at the store getting my provisions for today I came across these beautiful little Tomatoes still on the vine or parts of the vine I suppose the vine is still in the field so I've got parts of it here and I thought ah let's smoke these along with the tri-tip they'll be amazingly delicious so here's what we do put them in a bowl like that see what else we got these guys here okay we'll give them a little bit of oil as well kosher salt and pepper a little nice pinch beautiful now these guys are gonna go into this this is a grill wok pan perfect for all kinds of things when you want the flames to come through the bottom and get what's going on here well of course we don't have flames in the smoker but we do have the smoke that we're hoping will travel in and around all these gorgeous Tomatoes and do some beautiful stuff to them I'll take the handle off we won't need that we'll take the tomatoes take our tri-tip go ahead to the smoker so here we go tri-tip comes off why don't we go right there are lovely tomatoes or tomatoes go in and now what we want to do is put our temperature probe in to keep an eye on this so I don't have to I mark it where my fingers are so I know how far to push in I don't want it sticking out the other side or close to the other side so in like that perfectly close this now I'm going to set the probe to 125 anywhere between 125 and 130 will make me happy all right you're watching me and you're thinking Sam this is great and should be lots of fun for people that have a smoker but I don't have one what do I do do exactly what I'm about to tell you reverse searing is cooking a steak at a lower temperature allowing it to cook perfectly all the way through without that gray ring part of it around the outside my smoker is set at 250 simply set your oven at 250 or 275 fine in that range take the steak in this case the tri-tip out of the fridge say a half an hour before let it come to room temperature then a little oil season it just like I did and then it goes into your 250 260 275 oven I'll go hotter than 275 Tomatoes same thing put them on a baking sheet throw them in the oven along with the steak you'll be fine when it's done I'm using a probe that comes with my smoker you can but I'll show you okay you can buy a aftermarket I guess probe thermometer just like this works inside works outside works in your grill works anywhere you want it to work we'll stick a link below to one if you want to get your hands on they're really useful it takes the guessing out of this entire protein cooking game ladies and gentlemen unless you've been a chef in a proper steak restaurant for 125 years pushing on the meat to know that oh that's rare that's medium rare that's a well-done that's difficult to do and it's not foolproof I find using a thermometer is foolproof for me and it's not cheated I want a great steak I not losing any pride by training wheels like this you good chance you good would you buy a probe thermometer chance yes a little hesitation he's young he's getting there and by the way we still have not even had the win a date with chance contest yet can we do that soon max please we can't max has new gear before I would turn my head this way to see him on the side of his camera now he's got all this stuff I don't what are we gonna put on our steak it's gonna be great by itself we're gonna make a quick little chimichurri and Argentinian parsley oregano oil garlic combination that is fantastic you could do it in a processor or if you're a lazy son of a [ __ ] like I am and you don't want to clean the processor after or as we say in Canada processor we just do it by hand and you'll be no worse than where you'll be happy and not cleaning extra stuff we begin with the four big cloves of garlic chopped up you could use a garlic press if I could find it but somebody has it and I don't know where it is somebody somebody took it and now a head of parsley chopped up fine I will say one of the things I like about hand chopping this is that it makes it chunkier big pinch of kosher salt and pepper nice sized pinch of red pepper flakes olive oil about a half a cup or so right a couple tablespoons of red wine vinegar the next ingredient would be fresh oregano if I'd remember to get it and I didn't so I'm using dried oregano and yes someone will the [ __ ] me out for not making a proper chimichurri will mind be delicious absolutely would any of my guests no absolutely not unless they were douchey Culinary Institute of America wannabes but I don't have friends like that so a nice big pinch of I don't know two teaspoons of this dried oregano and and then last but not least the juice of a whole lemon squeezed in beautiful and don't see it stay in my hand and max we mix mmm I can smell I can see I know exactly what this is gonna be like when it goes on top of that warm tri-tip chunky amazing and delicious alright next our dressing we're making a ranch a homemade ranch I know it doesn't sound very sophisticated for a steak salad but when you make your own it's really good it goes great with the steak the whole thing's gonna be fantastic together it's the same ranch that we made for the chicken bacon ranch the CBR that was oh my god mind blowing chance remember that oh yeah Laila do you remember that Laila wasn't here for the chicken bacon ranch sorry intern interning thinking she wants to be in this business does she max enchants alright everything in the bowl we mix and then yeah it's over this starts with equal parts of sour cream buttermilk love buttermilk and mayonnaise and then it gets fresh garlic always a big pinch of salt and pepper juice of half a lemon yeah and the following a combination of herbs parsley fresh chopped dill and chive and everybody goes in this is what makes this rather exquisite mmm mmm we should taste this shouldn't wait actually I'll just put a little on tomato half and it's great Max's technologies about to blow up oh the smoker this smoker oh my god this is so good that's the reason folks that's the reason why you make your own we're waiting on the tomatoes in the tri-tip we're gonna do a little bread thing right at the last minute we're so close should be a perfect time for one of Max's black screens with my face all over it and that noise the tri-tip Freddie the tomatoes are ready let's get our bread ready then we'll get that then we'll build then we'll eat then we all go home you're at home we'll go cut the bread take our beautiful gorgeous crusty country loaf we're gonna cut a couple nice slices out of this guy okay maybe four and then we give them a quick little bit of olive oil on top it's gonna help these guys brown up on the grill gorgeously set these off to the side and after they come off the grill we're gonna take this clove of garlic cut it in half this way with the paper on and we're gonna rub the raw garlic on the cooked grilled bread that will give it the most delicate gorgeous garlic flavor ever but now let's get the steak and there we have it okay take the tomatoes off lovingly stay like that guys hello everyone this this now pull that rowboat and there's the tri-tip oh my god what wait I know what it is I need to clean it if I can do it on here but I don't I don't know what happened here ladies and gentlemen that's a direct result of someone we don't know who but you can be assured that we are gonna look into this someone not cleaning that grill well enough or ever apparently gonna have to have a talk with somebody when we find out who they are in the meantime we're back in business and now we can sear up this tri-tip to put some beautiful color on the outside and our friend goes on for color and flavor of course the little marks it's gonna get that means flavor don't forget that so we're only gonna go about a minute a side total I feel like I'm at about 30 seconds here so I'll give it a 45 degree flip lovely lovely here we go so this sides good here you go just a little color that's all you're going for another 45 degree flip 30 seconds or so off it comes and we build our salad or base for what I'm calling a share salad is baby red butter lettuce leaves I mean come on I could stop right here and it would be amazing so put a bunch of look you want people not to have to feel like they can only have one or two pieces so you got a beautiful base of this next we've got these gorgeous Tomatoes that we want to strategically place got a couple other randoms that we can just throw in to make this pretty now on top this is gonna be a pretty simple salad don't forget the steak is gonna be really the crowning glory so I've got some Persian cucumbers they're just the little guys you can eat them skin and all they're really like one of my favorite things in the cucumber world to have I've got those let's put some avocado on here let's cut the tri-tip now and here's the important part to know we talked about this all the time you only want to cut against the grain you know hard it is for me to say that an American against the grain you can see the grain runs this way so you don't want to cut like this so my favorite thing to do with a tri-tip let's figure out where the grain starts to change it runs lengthwise on this little small end so I cut it right here in the middle and looking at the beautiful doneness and ladies and gentlemen I ain't that's at 130 and that is what we want exactly so now we can cut against the grain like this beautiful beautiful pieces and you look in here and you see like little rivers of fat that is only gonna add to make this a ridiculously amazing salad cut some off of this side same thing tri-tip it really is a fantastic cut it's very popular on the west coast if you don't have it on the East Coast then just ask your butcher because all cows have two of them they may just call them something different there all right I think we're almost there let me get rid of this for a sec now it's time for our steak look like this how do you not like this you want to bring this to the table we have this grilled bread that's very hot out that needs now this garlic to be rubbed on it so we take the garlic like this and we rub Wow and it just gives it that really nice perfume of gorgeous garlic nests last piece so here we have our two dressings that we can set up here for now but I definitely want to take some of the chimichurri well the steak is still a little bit warm and just do this with it just this oil starting to soak into the beautiful nicely cooked and then because I have - just a little more kosher salt and pepper over the whole thing and that ladies and gentlemen is I think one of the most perfect share salads ever you put some tongs with it your guests get some steak some avocado the tomatoes so the beautiful butter lettuce underneath they've got dressing right here on the side and so now let's imagine that this is what your actual party is liking your guests come up and they go my god this is beautiful so allow me to take some of these beautiful greens underneath and they say what are these and you say oh those are red butter leaf greens so take some of those please and now some of the steak to go on top of this is gorgeous look at that and I need a few Tomatoes so let me just get a grab this little side guy here and I do love my avocado so I'll take some of this and put it here but I haven't done anything with the dressing yet and here's the dressing so the dressing yes just like this on the outskirts of these things so when you get a bite it's there and if you want more of the tremendously flavorful chimichurri it's a little bit more on the steak would be a loving thing to do fine I'll have a piece of garlic bread and then you stand back and you admire and first you go well maybe I'll just start with an innocent little tomato that's been smoked that's just a smoky explosion of absolute deliciousness holy [ __ ] even if you didn't do them on the smoker you just roasted them in the oven while the steak was cooking a roasted tomato is glorious how about some of these leaves with our homemade ranch ahh this is not even ranch like seriously it bears no resemblance to real ranch other than is incredible and I know people love their ranch so and then sorry for the fingers but I must a piece of the tri-tip that gloriously garlic-infused it's tender it's beefy there's so much flavor by itself but with the chimichurri it's mental and then the real happy accident happens when you get some chimichurri and some of this ranch all together on a bite of the tri-tip people are gonna love you for this love you and if you first thought salad I can't serve people just salad well it's way more than that oh my god and the bread don't forget about the bread with the rubbed garlic last but not least what if you took your bread with the rub garlic that you really taste and then put a couple leaves on it with some of the ranch wait wait and then you you took a tomato and squash the tomato on top with a little bit of avocado and then a piece of the steak on top of that and you made yourself a little tri-tip crostini
