why hello there my name is 25 buttholes and today we're going to be using one of the most unpopular weapons in pvp that weapon being the black salamander giveaway wow for months i have been getting requests that ipk using the black salamander and now the time has finally come take note that our max with the black salamander is only at 29. so this weapons is just a tad bit worse than using a magic short bow but nonetheless it is still fully capable of delivering some skin scorching burns to the face not to mention we still have our dark bow tucked in our backpacks just in case we gotta whip out the big guns did you freaking see that boys just as this mary poppins cowboy tried to assassinate me with his ags i rebuckled with my vengeance and my special attack right at the perfect time and completely annihilated this pure straight back to the lumbridge steps which were only a few feet away ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha wow good fight bro good fight but not quite as good as a fight as i'm about to have with this nice young dumb ass right here this guy was actually so bad that i managed to clap him out with the black salamander wow can you imagine getting clapped by the black sally you would feel like the ultimate goblin but don't worry billy boy i'm the best peak here of all time i could clap you out with a bronze pickaxe if i truly wanted to instead you should feel humbled nowadays a lot of players get the sense that they can't get clapped by some of these unpopular weapons which was the exact reason why any of these noobs even got clapped in the first place here this guy was dressed up like he was some kind of hybrid guy when in reality he was actually just a gigantic dumb ass who got smited for his bank in front of all the tryhard hybrids in edgeville you see that boys this young man just got humbled with the quickness wow that's what happens when you play a couple of last man standing games and then try to go hybrid pk in edgeville it's not the same body it's not the same wow the game is to be sold boys not told which is why i need each and every one of you savage goons to hit the join button and become a channel member because i just released a bunch of new badges and emojis that are super fresh and if i get four more channel members i'll be able to unlock seven more so stay tuned or else i'm going to slap your chests pink just like how i slapped this zuma boy harder than he slaps his own mother one second you see the black sally the next second you see a dragon arrow piercing your face good fight zoomer boy good fight your methods were quick but my methods were 40 times quicker which is why you are now standing but naked outside of the lumbridge castle and i'm standing here with some massive massive bank wow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] the black sally is without a doubt a force to be reckoned with it slaps it claps and it yaps and it also has the ability to use all three combat styles but since our magic bonus is crap and our strength level is 70 we will most likely only use it for range but that doesn't mean that we won't be able to fool some of these clowns into thinking that we are using magic after all these gold farmer boys usually don't waste their time into understanding the mechanics of shitty weapons like the black salamander because they are too busy focusing on chasing that bag say what you want about gold farmers but they are truly some of the hardest hustlers i have ever seen in my entire life and they are one of the only reasons the wilderness isn't completely dead in old school runescape but that doesn't mean that i'm not going to slap them for their banks because runescape is a dog-eat-dog world boys i have said it thousands of times these streets have a strict code there are pimps and hustlers and there are wimps and busters pick a side but make sure you pick wisely because once picked it can never be unpicked wow these goblins were jumping me back and forth doing whatever it took to guard their territory since i was out of food i began running south still applying pressure on the goblin who kept chasing me please man please just let me live i'm sorry i swear what we're actually trying to do is trick this goblin into turning off his protect from range if he does that then we might just have a chance to clap him out come on goblin boy come on crap boys he switched to smite this is a matter of life or death oh my freaking crap boys did you see that right as this noob thought he was going to send me to the steps of lumbridge i turned around and delivered one of the coldest comebacks that this generation has ever seen in their entire life wow little goblin got just a little bit too cocky and ended up getting clapped for his chins good fight goal farmer boy good fight now boys i want you all to pay strict attention to this next clip because this clip is a firm firm message to the iron man community iron man task i got a key shut the hell up you goblin shut the [ __ ] up these iron girls are so quick to yap about their gains that they don't even realize they are about to get clapped this is the exact reason why you iron boys don't belong in my wilderness i can only imagine how hard this iron man was punching his keyboard and screaming at the top of his lungs when he got clapped for his mossy key but guess what boys i was proud of it wow tell your friends 1000 gecks tell your stupid friends wow this weapon sucks and i'm proud of it don't forget to follow my instagram account for a chance to win that 100 ml boys and make sure you leave a comment down below for which unpopular weapon that you would like to see me use next and until next time boys make sure that you sleep with your eyelids open we got snakes in the lawn boys it's time to cut the grasshouse you
