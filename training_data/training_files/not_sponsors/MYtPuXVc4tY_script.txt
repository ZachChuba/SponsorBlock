[SINB finished her shoot in between the sparkles] [The sparkles got all over her hands]
They live off of me. They disappear when I do this though. The stylist team doesn't know. [Red hair looks good on you!]
Right? I should stop doing these stuff. I saw the Behind The Scenes for Crossroads
and these were the only scenes with me in it! So I'm gonna stop now. I don't appear that often in the BTS's, but whenever I do When someone tells me 'SINB you look good in this or that' I say 'I know, I'm SINB' and those are the only scenes that are in the video of me. I'm not gonna do it anymore. I gave up on that concept. [Gave up on the 'SINB is the best' concept]
Should I try another concept? I'm thinking. Or should I be like EUNHA when someone calls me pretty And be like 'Ang~' And SOWON does this When someone calls her pretty. What does YUJU do? YUJU does this When someone calls her pretty. [Copying YUJU's signature hand gesture] So weird, she's actually the weirdest one.
