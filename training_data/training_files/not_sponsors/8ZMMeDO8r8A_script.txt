hey everyone welcome to today's then we fight the alphabet pvp challenge in this video lincoln myself will spin a giant wheel containing the letters of the alphabet we are only allowed to kill monsters that start with the same letter that the wheel lands on we have 20 minutes per letter and we allowed to kill multiple monsters if we so choose to we are allowed to create armor if we happen to get all the materials needed we start off with lobsters for the fight but that of course can be upgraded after we kill all of our monsters we gear up and then we fight hey everyone and welcome to today's pvp challenge as you can see the wheel was ready to be spun we get five spins this episode 20 minutes each the timer doesn't start per letter until we get the first hit of course if we want to go to the next monster we cannot pause the timer now it did take off f q u x and y from the wheel because those letters give absolutely no value to this challenge so if you're looking at the letters right there and you don't see those that is why it literally would have been a waste of a spin if we landed on any of those but let's spin the wheel guys and see the first letter that we get in this challenge i really don't know if it's good off the top of my head jay i'm thinking about jellies that's the only thing i can think of they actually have an okay drop table um i can't kill the warped ones though because you know that would be a w but let's take a look at the be series and see if that's pretty much the only thing i can kill so as it turns out i was right jellies are the only monster that are worth killing the other monsters that i could kill are things like jungle horrors which have a really bad drop table like iron and jokers which drop nothing but really shitty spears and everything so we're definitely not gonna focus on that so we start the timer the moment we get the first hit in let's get that timer ready and bam okay so the items we're looking for is roon full helm mithril kite mithril boots and i think there's a few more other drops it has like steel battle axes and stuff but let's be honest if we're taking that to the final fight then we have issues let's get the pity on i don't know why i'm not fighting max melee everything let's go all right i'll be honest if i said that i wasn't a bit nervous right now roonlight says we are 78 kills in but they always don't drop everything so that's not 100 accurate it's probably closer like 85 or so um and i have nothing really show for it i have a steel battle axe and 15 chaos runes even the chaos runs are one in 42 and i'm not even getting those that commonly but uh roon full helm 1 and 128 myth boots what a 128 mithral kite 1 in 64. and i haven't gotten any of that in like roughly 85-ish kills plus so hello bees and g's welcome back to another pvp challenge i hope you're doing well today don't to rog if you haven't already uh bees and geez i'm sure kins has gone on some long-winded intro where he talks for bloody i was going to say talks for england but he talks from america doesn't he um so you know what i'm just going to get straight into this we are going to fire into this find out what our first monster's gonna be let's do it come on something good something good something good something good d d okay let me have a little think and i will be back and we'll find out what i'm gonna be killing all right bees and geez i am gonna go for dust devils i did look at the daggone off kings but for this challenge the dagnath kings just aren't going to drop me anything uh too great i mean if i could be there for like two hours then yeah that would be great but a lot of the good things are like one in one two eight and it's just not really going to happen is it whereas with the dust devils i can sit here barrage and get like probably a hundred plus kills which probably means a dragon dagger thank you kebabs which heal 19 and they drop them in fours mystic staffs you know van braces etc etc i think it's just going to be the way to go and the fact they drop a 19 hill food means that we can probably just sit here for 20 minutes um and just and just it's just so worth it you know so that's the plan let's get into this let's do it and just before i started i just asked kins because i uh i didn't want to you know break the rules but it goes off the loot tracker not stuff i pick up i will try and pick up everything for a visual point of view for you guys but you know if there's like ted ugg thank yous on the floor uh just because they got dropped means i can use them in the final fight but i will try and keep it as visual as possible but obviously we are going to be struggling to keep a full inventory here or keep her on full inventory so i'll just show you the uh the loot tracker at the end of these kills as well all right as soon as the first one gets hit we are there so let's chuck that on let's boom and the timer has started hey myth boots yes probably the worst upgrade of all of them but at least we got something dude ah at least it's something you watch us not even go melee and they're freaking 100 pointless oh we have like no time left get him kill him five seconds come on a zero what that counts that totally counts come on oh dude that should have been a rune full helm come on that clutch ending right there okay jay has to be the worst one of all the ones we can get i took out all the bad ones so i know i i know we can't get that unlucky jay literally has to be one of the worst ones we can get and i'm sticking by that fact let's open up the spinner and let's get our next letter you watch it bj again we actually can't get back to back b oh i'm thinking of uh some brutal black dragons off the top of my head our first drop was a rune hostas so that is the best weapon we have right now they actually are quite dog [ __ ] another rune hosta come on so out of all the items we could get here the two i most want are two of the most common ones room plate legs one out of 18 rune full helm one out of 21. i'm pretty confident we can get at least one or the other they of course drop a bunch of other stuff and we can get a big ticket item like you know dragon plate legs or dragon plate skirts um black dehyde bodies dragon med helms rune plate bodies but those are definitely pretty rare but there's a lot of things on this drop table and of course when you average it all together i wouldn't be that surprised if i walk out of here with like a dragon dagger or a dragon long sword so we are gonna stick here we're gonna try to go big or go home but even if we don't get those items hopefully we at least secure ourselves a few pieces of roon oh dragon dart tips if i get c or a chickens aviances for feathers maybe bringing dragon darts to the fight who knows who oh my god okay i think everything's written to stars right now you watch my next role be a c you're [ __ ] me what oh it's like i can't even end the recording because something just happens team rogue let's go let's get one little swing in for good luck okay we hit a zero as expected guys i'm [ __ ] buzzing right now that has to be your weapon next kill black dehydrated body dude this is unreal is this what it feels like to be link i genuinely think link feels like this every single pvp challenge just gets everything he [ __ ] wants uh rune arrows a sapphire some chaos runes that's another one 80 chaos runes at a time is so so nice it means we're gonna be able to get some decent spells together if we want we've got the dust runes as well coming through so uh yeah we might be able to pull something together which would be really nice but uh yeah as i say this is more just to sort of throw everything at the wall and see what sticks you know see what sort of plan we can come up with because they just dropped so many different varieties of things black dehydrators rune dagger oh yes we got earth battle stuff coming in this is exactly what we wanted to see just out of nowhere we've pulled eight ugg thank yous i was getting worried we hadn't got any at all in like 63 kills i guess that's actually really really good but there's eight there obviously as i say can't really pick them up but they are in the loot track and i will show that at the end so you guys can see exactly what we've got but uh huge to see that still no uh dragon dagger unfortunately we've already had a mystic air stuff so we've got two of those now but yeah no dragon dagger yet right i think this is gonna be the last bunch guys 30 seconds left i haven't got a dragon dagger yet it has to come here it has to come here or we're done or we are done oh no that's like the main reason i wanted dust devils we keep getting black dehydrators which i think are the same rarity i've have i've had seven black di band braces i know the mystic air stuffs definitely are and i've had three of those six seconds left come on finish this one off finish this one off one second nope no dragon dagger b's and g's let me uh let me get this over so i can show you uh it says we killed 109 but i think with the barrage it gets it slightly wrong we've actually killed 165 so we were over drop rate by quite a bit for the dragon dagger yeah no dragon dagger 16 ugg thank you kebabs which is uh probably a little bit lucky just slightly nothing too crazy there we got some soul rooms which is nice and other runes that we can use um for maybe if you want to go barrage you've got 60 mithral bars so if we can pull a hammer together uh we could make the bars into something uh also got a raynar um somewhere where is it two of them actually um yeah to be honest other than that nothing too great dust devils let me down a little bit there a little bit let down but you know what we'll get on to the next one let's spin okay what are we getting next off the top of my head i can't think of anything let's have a look this is crazy i'm so distracted i'm not even getting my prayer back up dude looks like we're gonna get the kill nice okay our last kill oop sorry about that death runes okay so we got 28 brutal black dragon kills in 20 minutes we didn't end up banking at all we had just enough supplies but we got the room plate legs a dragon long sword black dehyde body and potentially dragon darts if we can get something that drops feathers so let's get up the wheel and let's spin our next letter and uh figure out what we're killing p i'm definitely gonna have to look that up i don't know anything off the top of my head for this next monster we only realistically have two options one being a little bit of a wild card the first option would be pyre fiends and that's where i would have gone if i did not already have a body slot but because we have the black d-head body i don't need to go for that mithril chain body the only two upgrades i could realistically get from pyrophenes is an addie medhelm or a steel full helm the other p is this dude right here p hat can't kill kraka i could only kill p-hat because he starts with a p he drops a granite shield and he also drops an adamant square shield both are one out of 128. since the addie medhelm is one out of 128 from pyrofeins i figured it's too rare to absolutely secure its spot that i want to go big and kill the monster i've never killed before in a pvp challenge now it looks like they're not aggressive which is kind of weird oh nope just kidding okay i gotta figure out how i'm gonna do this uh thankfully i have time to think because the timer doesn't start until i attack it but all right we're just gonna go for it pot up pity and let's go does it work oh oh come on cracker i'm not trying to attack you dude this is this is not gonna be good at all oh wait oh yeah get him imagine that was the shield okay then i think i can run over here get on aggro'd right right okay cool no oh my god okay harder than i thought harder than i thought but we've already committed wait he doesn't attack me over here this has the weirdest aggro i i will never understand this game okay let's hop worlds and keep killing them so in this spot right here nothing can attack you unless a troll walks over oh but i was just about to say that they're unaggressive now so it doesn't matter and i could keep hopping whirls freely and not have to worry about being attacked but i just got an addy square shields okay guys yes the the aggro is off so i don't even have to worry about being attacked anymore i guess it was only 10 minutes or 8 10 i don't know something like that i wasn't keeping track because in these two squares you really don't get attacked unless like i said a mountain troll walks just like that he would have attacked me all right guys e was a really horrible one so we're gonna be going with elf warrior and elf archer it's like it it's so bad the options are just so it was like earth warrior and something else there was literally like three monsters so we're gonna have to go uh uh earth warrior we're getting elf warrior elf archer and hopefully we can just uh put a cannon down here and it catches enough of them i think it's gonna be quite hard to get a lot of kills here but um we will see we will see so as soon as this one starts firing and we hit the first one let's have a look where's the xp drop see this is gonna be the problem there we go start the timer and boom let's do this hey hey we got a green dehyde body which is very very nice to see um on top of that also got some water runes and fire runes so the water runes might be good if we want to go down the ancients route we will see um but very happy with the green d-hard body oh and a bass nice and there are the green d-hide chaps as well that's what we wanted to see so we now got full green d-hide to be fair the elf archers and warriors haven't been too bad got ourselves our first shark as well they are one in 42 so i'm only expecting to get maybe one or two um but it's a nice little bonus to see that there and a one in one two eight adamant full helm there which you know we didn't have a helm slot so we will take it um we are coming down to what the last eight minutes here of this monster to be honest the last thing i'd love to see would be maybe a bit more sharks obviously but um i'd love to be able to see a mithril uh kite shield come out because that is one of the drops they do drop it would be nice to see it but it is again one in one two eight so not expecting it right this is probably gonna be we might get one more killing actually um let's see what we get come on more food i'll take the food now there's some fire runes let's see what we're going to be killing last one's probably going to be an elf arch although we might even get another one that was such a quick kill boom let's go are we going to get it i don't think we will uh maybe we will actually smashed it oh yeah smashed it absolutely smashed it um yeah got two sharks in the end um and we also i'll stop the timer there boom um yeah we got two sharks we got three of the bass which is quite nice we got the adam and forehand we got the full green d hide we got a lot of water runes pretty happy to be honest like in terms of how bad he was that's done all right okay let's find out what our third l okay l right i've decided to go for lizardmen shamans they drop a good amount of rune stuff that we could uh chuck on um i did think about doing lava dragons but the problem with lava dragons is if i if i get pk'd i'm probably gonna then spend what five ten minutes running all the way back or just getting the teleports together again um and i think it would just mean that i'd only get a few lava dragon kills so that's why we're choosing the lizardmen shamans but um yeah i'm already like 18 p hat kills in in 12 minutes it's actually not too bad at all and especially now um it should be a breeze but we just got an upgrade so i am pretty stoked about that very happy all right guys the last kill will we get the granite shield no but that's okay let's pause the timer so i saved you guys from that horrible beeping sound that is our third monster done and we did get an upgrade not the best one but i am stoked to be having this uh for the final fight especially if you go range too if you find a way to get those um darts these don't give any negative range attack bonus now so yeah it's gonna be good it's gonna be good anyways guys let's get up that wheel and let's spin our fourth monster or fourth letter i should say g okay gargoyles come to mind um i want specifically a helm i don't know if they're the best thing to kill for a helm right now so i'm gonna give a quick look guys and i will get back to you next up guys we have greater neck rolls i know it's a bit of the cliche option but imagine getting g and not coming here addie kite shield roon square shield rune med helm roon full helm roon boots and a rune chain body i probably wouldn't take the room chain body even if i got it but um such such such amazing upgrades so uh guys let's fling right into this we're gonna use use these to actually set the timer first so let's start that timer start getting the aggro and start getting kills as fast as we possibly can i mean 20 minutes isn't too long of a time set but um with barraging it probably will be rather quick in terms of the kills we can get so let's hope we at least get like two upgrades here it kind of sucks that we did that whole plan with p hat and it ended up working out and now we just might get an upgrade anyway but hey it is what it is dude the first kill it's an upgrade runefull helms better but i mean that is an upgrade i cannot believe the luck tonight what the heck man insane a room full helm i haven't picked up the med helm and a natty kite shield oh god oh my god did did i just get everything i need guys should i mean should i go for the room i did not plan for this i actually have to look now if it's worth killing something else what all right this is gonna be a bit of a long shot but since the only upgrade i can get from the greater neck rolls is rune boots i decided to actually go and kill the giant mole and try to get the strength ammy there it is such a long shot it's like 1 in 18 but we're so lucky this episode i mean why the hell not right it's gonna take me like two minutes to gear though unfortunately okay let's do this start the timer and let's see if we can pull the dragon warhammer imagine imagine uh even my rng isn't that good first drop is catatine there's a room warhammer guys i've been uh i'm actually watching the euros right now at the same time and uh whales just scored and that's why i've got a little bit of hp down because i was i was a little bit distracted i won't lie but yeah room warhammer coming in love to see that oh bees and geez roon med helms straight after yes these are g's they're sorting us right out there's the roon chain body there's the rune chain body yes oh we are becoming a bit of a uh a room warrior here i'll tell you that right here we go guys i don't think we're gonna get another kill uh yeah i really doubt we will uh this was actually the first time i've ever done this by the way i didn't mention that at the start it's uh a lot more chill than i thought it was gonna be a lot more chill than i thought it was gonna be um there's these sort of jumping safe spots on the edge of these pillars that means that they can't actually jump on you i know it just jumped but that was me being more of an idiot than anything 17 seconds left i would have to have an insane bit of rng here for this to come off and i don't think it's going to nine seconds left no way no way we'll see what we would have got though this one won't count i'll stop the clock let's see what we would have got if there's a dragon warhammer i'm going to cry it wasn't it was a room warhammer you know what though i'll take that we got the roommate helm we got the rune chain we got the room warhammer we got a couple chains three warhammers um we got some oars as well which i mean maybe it'll be useful i don't know few air runes few death runes but uh yeah other than that nothing too crazy the rune is the stuff we wanted and we got it so i'm happy about that let's see where we're gonna be going for our fourth monster s okay all right guys we are going to be going for skeletal wyverns or skelly wyverns you guys like to piss out me saying skeletal so uh yeah let's start the timer boom there is the uh two pro pots they do drop them in twos so we will probably only take one to the fight but very nice to have so we can keep piety on or whatever we want to keep on um for the whole fight which is huge i think i am going to stay for the um room full helm i thought about the weapon poison thing the problem with the weapon poison thing is i'd have to then take the rune dagger as a another inventory slot and i don't really want to be wasting too many if i'm going to be taking two pieces of green dragon hide i don't really want to be wasting more on um you know rune stuff and poison and stuff like that so i think i will just forget that idea we'll just try and get this room full help be as tanky as possible uh because if we do need to change that that rune chain then it's gonna be a bit of a problem although we don't have legs yet do we except for the green d-hides so i guess the only switch we'd need is the body so we'll see but yeah the poison thing is definitely something that i'm probably not gonna do definitely probably great stuff okay the inventory was done really really fast but this is the gear we're taking to the mall uh but do you kill them all some saturdays when i stream we gotta find a world [ __ ] so if you guys don't know you can get like 70 plus mole kills an hour so i wouldn't be surprised if i get like 15 16 kills when i'm here plus i'm like a mole expert um look at that kc so i know what i'm doing that's a flight that's such a weird flex will definitely be the last kill and we did not get the string family we got what is that 16 kills though guys wow and it's 1 in 18. we got three myth plate bodies though which are around the same rarity and we got three adi long swords which are also around the same rarity to the uh strength family is what it is guys i mean with the g we got incredibly incredibly lucky still so uh let's roll that next one guys and uh take a look at our last monster for this episode i don't know what i'd want to be honest i feel like all my slots are filled b we actually can't get the same one twice so i do have to respin we didn't say it in the rules but link and i did talk about it um but that's actually a really good one to get i almost got g again e okay e so e is a very weird role guys there is things i could have killed if i already didn't have a decent setup two of those things for example elder chaos druids enraged barbarian spirits things like that i mean there is a little bit more i look through it there's nothing that can give me an upgrade there is however one thing that i can kill and i'll actually start the timer because you'll soon realize that um i'm not gonna need all this time an evil chicken i have the dragon dart tips in my inventory and we are going to in fact make some dragon darts but other than that there is nothing i can do to improve my setup this isn't even a flex or anything i j 173 all right guys this is gonna be the last kill of the fourth out of five are we gonna get the kill eight seconds seven seconds oh you've got to be joking me are we not going to get this kill oh thank god okay and it was runex it doesn't even matter pretty happy with that to be honest guys pretty happy we only got the shield in the end but to be honest that's the one i would have wanted out of a lot um so let's find out what our fifth and final letter is gonna be w w what what starts with our worms i guess is there anything else oh no all right b's and g's gonna start the timer and start attacking there we go i'm we're gonna go worms the reason for this is they dropped red d hide chaps which obviously an upgrade on the greens that we currently have and they also drop the dragon dagger which we failed to get our dust devils earlier so we will see if we can grab the uh the dragon dagger this time uh but yeah it's it's it's the it's the only option really i looked at a few other things there was obviously wolves no werewolves they dropped a room med helm we've already got a remed helm so that doesn't matter there's a room ed helm guys can you just start to understand my rng how weird it is i'm talking about a roommate home and it drops mental um water fiends as well that these are just the best option unfortunately um yeah w just isn't the best but if we can get ourselves the red d hard chaps and the dragon dagger which it's very likely we do neither of them are very rare at all like i think the drain dagger is one in 70 and the red deal chaps like one in 25 or something um so there's a very good chance we do it especially with this setup um then it'll be a pretty good one to come away with wow six minutes left we got the dragon dagger but we still don't have the red d hard chaps the red deal jets are one in 25. but we'll take it we'll take it i've done 45 kills right now so we should get about 55 60 total i would say um so i mean we should get the red dehydra chaps like the chances of not is just insanely high or low even i'm i can't even talk today i can't even i've been shocking on the commentary today guys i hope you're having a good day everybody welcome to the video oh dear but yeah i i'm like i don't think i've ever been to worms and not got like seven red dehyde chaps i was just i thought it was even more common than it was i thought it was like one and eight or something but the dragon dagger is huge it's a big one we get a speck weapon which is very very nice um and especially with having the 99s plus the biot that should do some work on him um even though it's only a dragon dagger so we have what five and a half minutes to try and get these red dehyd chaps there's a snake grass seed it is just it's just raining drops i don't need this isn't even a flex guys i trust me i would really really really prefer to finish off my 19.5 minutes here but there is genuinely nothing in the e category that i can improve upon but since we have some time to kill look at these stats 18 range 20 range strength i don't know if they're worth bringing i'll be completely honest with you i don't know but we do have the dragon hide body with it so like everything just kind of lined up perfectly for this but i swear guys there is nothing i can do right now for an upgrade so we are gonna have to call the episode but at least we got the dragon darts i'm gonna have to run some little dps calcs to see if they're kind of worth bringing um but we do have the dragon long sword as well so you have options anyways let's get that final gear set up and i'll see you guys in edgeville so here we are for the final fight i actually haven't run the dps calcs yet um i will before the fight of course don't you worry but i decided that regardless of what's better the dragon long sword or the dragon darts i'm going to bring both i was taking a look at all the gear that i got and i had a ton of runes so of course it is possible that link has some runes too and that he brings barrages in the fight the one bad thing about barrages is that it is farther range than darts hopefully link either doesn't know that or forgets that in the fight because he could get distance on me but you know it's a very easy thing to forget especially in the hecticness of a battle when you're trying to win an episode but um the really cool thing about my armor and especially the new updates with this shield specifically doesn't give any negative magic defense the legs do give four the helm only negative one so if he's hybriding me to be honest i might not change my setup at all i will only take off this and this if he only has magic and nothing else but i feel pretty confident going into this fight i mean who knows what he got maybe he got just as lucky or whatever but uh i do feel good and we have two combat styles of course we didn't get any food upgrades unfortunately so we're rocking a full inventory of lobsters to the fight so i will see you guys in the fight pizza geez 36 seconds left and uh it doesn't look like we're gonna get our red d hud chaps which is uh very painful very painful indeed we might get one more kill after this hopefully this is going to be that's 68 this will be 69 if we do get it course it will be um yeah wow wow wow well we went over double drop rate and still didn't have it oh we've got nine seconds left i don't think we'll get another kill but i will start it and that is no red d hud chaps i'm going to stop the timer just because uh it makes that annoying noise when it finishes he's these are i can't believe that but that is the five done so let me get my setup together and i'll show you what we're going for i forgot to show you this so yeah there's the uh dragon dagger but i forgot to show you this we also got two chili potatoes from lizardmen shamans so i will be taking them as well but uh let's get into this and i'll show you the setup all right guys this is what i'm gonna be going for this would be the main setup i dropped the rune warhammer just because it's a six tick and i think the dragon dagger will be better for tick it's the the stats are obviously a lot worse on it but four tick compared to six tick i think this will do more damage uh also means we don't have to waste an inventory slot to have it as a spec weapon we could just have it out got the prayer potion so that we can uh keep on piety um i'm also going to bring the green d high body just because i only have 12 magic defense in this whereas if we chuck that on it goes to 35 so if he has gone magic we will be looking really really decent and to be honest we still have a really decent range defense if he's going range and same with all the melees as well so it won't be a massive issue if he does go down that route like mage into range or something uh we should be all right then we've got the thank you kebabs which we got from the dust devils two sharks that we got from the elves um a couple chili potatoes that we got from the elizabeth sharmas and then the rest of the bass were from the elves slash and the worms so yeah i think uh i think i've done okay here i think i think we've covered a lot of bases uh shane we couldn't like fill a few more slots but you know what we'll take him let's get into this fight and don't forget guys after you've watched this fight there's another pvp on my channel as well i'm sure rag has linked it in the description so give that a click after and you've got another bit of content to watch hello link we are here hello five letters split on the wheel 20 minutes per letter how many monsters do you think you killed link do you think it was just five or did you kind of have planning while you were doing it in switch monsters and stuff i actually did it today so i still got my loot tracker up i killed six oh okay okay i think i did two on the top of my head i filmed yesterday so right but uh yeah yeah okay all right i mean just i i always have to ask what's your confidence level coming into this fight based on the letters that you had i it's one of those again where you can't tell what combat level what combat like style someone's going so it's very difficult to know your confidence but like let's say if you were going my style i'd be fairly confident i feel pretty confident but again you know if someone goes a different style or but i i i i won't lie i do feel confident coming into this place wow you also got something really good we'll see let's go gloves mate i don't have any gloves the hell is he killing the drops gloves okay dust devils yeah and so i uh i barraged them right yeah for like loads of loads and loads of kills mm-hmm um i got 109 no 165 dust double kills at least he's probably not going magic because they'll get those give like negative 10 [ __ ] magic attacks so that's great all right all right let's go let's go boots you want gloves i'm going booze i don't have any boots mate okay so my first monster was jellies jay mithril booze did he get the fruit no that's warp jellies that's doug yeah unfortunately i was raging about this is all i got from jellies okay um let's go legs mate oh it is one of the best that makes me feel really confident my guys go in range i got i got e i got elfs because there's literally [ __ ] nothing decent free so i did elf warriors and elf archers elencia oh my god wait but they also dropped the body too don't they they do yeah i think it's no it's my pick all right barty wants to know he wants to know okay is my guy going full green deid what's he got oh wow i got b so you know where i went dude i couldn't not go to brutal yeah and you got it as a drop yeah and the ruined legs as well so um i sawed you out oh my

my own because we sit in our rooms recording to a screen but uh yeah we had a little laugh about uh me getting a dragon warhammer with my rng but uh did not happen so i mean that would have been your fight i mean it's one in 5k i i did not expect you to have one but yeah do they drop dragon weaponry and stuff i don't know you have to find out in a bit why don't you mate i'm gonna go shield okay i'm gonna go shield i'm actually a bit upset at this shield but also like very happy so i i got p now i had two options to kill p hat he's a troll or yeah go to the other easter yeah or or granite um or or pyre fiends i ended up getting the addie square and it was like super hype it's 1 in 128 and then i get g next and i'm like okay well i have to go to great greater neck rules i get this i'm like for [ __ ] sake very happy obviously but it's just like that that planning i was so proud of it and it meant nothing it meant absolutely nothing okay all right well um i got w oh no warp jellies why this oh my god i've just realized it's called skelly wyverns oh no no no no we're good we're good we're good i got i got s i got w for worms [ __ ] i'm scared so you went to worms oh god okay i went to worms and skelly wyverns s and w i got but i got this god i just really had a mini heart yeah dude me too because that means you want to pause the recording and try to figure something out oh tonight yeah so i got s for skelly wyverns went here and uh and yeah got this 5kc [ __ ] so pretty happy with it pretty happy with it all right let's go helm [ __ ] my guy's a tanky boy so i got this from uh lisbon shamans which was quite nice okay so you got also from brutal black dragons they sword they sorted me out bro all i have is a weapon me too right that's all i got herself what is your defensive stats right now just uh okay just to read from top to bottom from stab to range 182 177 180 45 172. wow you kill me one five seven one six four one seven six eleven one five five oh that's good okay okay you're wow okay so it's gonna come down to the weapon then okay okay all right all right let's do it let's do it three two one go they sorted you out give me the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] dragging down set ups from there except two items oh i do do dude there there i i have another item from brutal black dragons uh a hasta or spear oh i got 80 tips my last one i actually spun b again but we can't get it twice so i had to re-roll e evil chickens four feathers i do everything wow went so right but i don't know how good i'll be against i don't know if i'd had no range defense then that's a play and a half i don't know how they'll do what's the uh attack on them the attack is uh uh you mean like attack speed or a range of strength sorry yeah right uh well 33 attack 20 strength if you were wearing full rune with a rune chain body because i figured that's the one of the best setups you could have ever gotten from all the uh monsters that we had this is better dps than this wow man's been and everything hey you you upped the game when in season two you were dps cocking everything and i was like for [ __ ] sake like now i have to do i i only dps calc in seasons not for solos there's a massive difference here i think you've got me slightly all right link let's uh let's see how many ugg thankies this man has so you know i have the dragon long sword yeah you know i've got that oh okay here's your [ __ ] can go really south i get dropped in four they get dropped in fours oh no chat this could be my downfall i'll be honest link oh my god don't tell me you have mo oh my god what the actual [ __ ] this man's gonna win on sheer [ __ ] food alone wow dude nothing wow even a prayer pot yeah i got prayer pot from skelly wyverns i got the sharks from elves i got the chili potatoes from lizardmon and then the bass came from elves uh worms wow wow wow wow i mean all my upgrades were tuna and more lobsters or not even upgrades i say that with quotations around it upgrades i uh like i don't know i i thought food was just gonna be fairly easy to come by because i was looking at my inventory of food and i was like okay this isn't gonna be huge i didn't realize [Music] all right now you're ready dude just give me two second warning all right here is your two second warning boom to see okay yes oh he's trusting the dragon darts all right let's get in one spec just to oh man how many did you get 80 80 oh yes oh he's gonna be [ __ ] talking about the episode here come the um just enjoy my food i'm here trying to [ __ ] enjoy my lunch it's like throwing darts at me oh this is just going to be if you can like keep the dps going and keep me eating that's going to be the way to win this for sure yeah but there's a lot of zeroes for both of us wow this is going to be close dude oh no it is your highest i think you might have this genuinely i think you might have this if i can keep him eating if i can keep him eating come on i thought i can't [ __ ] just keep my prayer on like you can yeah which is very very nice especially as for those of you who aren't completely familiar with our setup whoever's video it is gets the home world so my ping is like through the roof right now so having a prayer part in this challenge is so much bigger than having it in like a home challenge and i know that's not something we really comment on too often but it's so huge it's nice it's like the genuine is homing away fixtures in this and it's great yeah loving it well you you just told the audience right now that in this case it doesn't matter so no but like like the prayer pot was a big item for me to go for because i knew that you know yeah yeah for sure i can tell he's concentrating on his flex because he doesn't want any conversation right now i will probably ignore you if you talk to me oh this is what's the meaning of uh [ __ ] you dude i i i suck at flicking [ __ ] dart speed man oh horrible horrible i feel you on that one mate i can't hit though i cannot hit okay wow not [ __ ] hitting with the specs i hit that one that was like a 29 or something just go for every other just so i know i get it stop hitting twos oh my god [ __ ] me okay i can't hit i can't hit i think you've got this just because you're too tanky okay that was a good little comeback why i should have eaten right there i don't know why i did don't know why i did yes come on do you know what would be a great mechanic it could be fake specs like an item that allowed you to fake spec i'd love that i just think that's a no dude these fights are agonizing enough link okay like you know you know how it's like oh okay i'm gonna have to eat because i know he's got specs or not you know it takes that out and it's like oh you can start faking love that name give him fake specs no no no i i i will rebuttal that [ __ ] though here's i think you've got this i think you've got this i think this is yours i'm starting to think the [ __ ] long swords better dps just because i know i can hit my flicks god i'm so sorry guys you guys have permission to roast my flicks in this one not like they needed permission anyway so one bad thing about lobsters too you just spend more time eating at once to be fair i feel like you haven't eaten much at all and i keep hitting twos and ones it's actually [ __ ] infuriating my hands are so damn small come on where are the [ __ ] 18s at oh come on he's got this piece of geez he's got this i'm almost out of it you know what let's not fix what wasn't broken it was annoying but oh god is he out no he's not oh my god it's hitting like a truck [ __ ] brutal black dragon [ __ ] them oh thank god you're not hitting those specs i've hit one spec [ __ ] sake he's out gg come on finish him off come on just get the damn kill oh my god hey it's the comeback the comeback okay i have two two [ __ ] lobsters dude oh that was actually so close wow i cannot believe your food upgrades i cannot believe your [ __ ] food upgrades weren't enough mate they weren't enough they weren't enough just makes you think though if those if that if that bass was boric thankies or something could have been yours man if i finished my food i only had 70 hp that's it painful i pulled up a couple huge specs on the d-long i know a 31-29 i think yes yes yes guys go check out link's episode he actually posted one over on tuesday it is where
