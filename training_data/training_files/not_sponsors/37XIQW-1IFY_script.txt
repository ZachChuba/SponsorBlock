this video is sponsored by brilliant so there are several different ways to represent the structure of molecules with the most common probably being blue structures and Lewis structures are useful for showing how the atoms in a molecule are connected by covalent bonds but they don't always give a clear description of how the atoms are arranged in space for example the lewis structure for methane is probably going to be over here in a second or ch4 shows the four covalent bonds connected to the central carbon atom to the hydrogen atoms however this Lewis structure seems to indicate that the five items are all located on the same plane and that the angles between the atoms are all 90 degrees or 180 degrees but as we know this is not true the actual shape of the molecule can be more accurately represented by knowing that they be negatively charged electrons that form covalent bonds and lone pairs purl each other therefore the most stable arrangement of the electron groups is that color shape that keeps the groups as far away from each other as possible and the best way to keep the negative charges for the four covalent bonds and a methane molecule as far apart from each other as possible is to place them in a three dimensional molecular shape called a tetrahedral which has Allah has angles of 109.5 degrees between the bonds such as this one that I made earlier so we can see here if you can see it that we have little lines here are little sticks that represent the covalent bonds we have got the carbon atom in the middle which is um accurately painted black and then we've got the white with the bolt on the outside which are hydrogen atoms so these angles between the bonds are called bond angles each of these little buddy bonds bond angles are 109.5 degrees so there are three different ways to represent the anything molecule or any other molecule as a 3d shape and that includes a space-filling model which provides the most accurate representation of the electron charge clouds for the and then we've got the ball and stick model and I have here which emphasizes a wolf emphasizes the molecule to correct molecular shape and it shows a covalent bond quite clearly or more clearly than other things such as Geo might check the drawings which we're going to come to next and the drawings show a three dimensional tetrahedral structure such as this one or any other shape with a two dimensional drawing so for methane we've got two hydrogen atoms which are connected to the central carbon atom with solid lines and think of these are things in the same plane as a carbon atom and then we've got a third hydrogen atom connected to the central carbon with a solid wedge and that comes out of the plane towards you and then we have got a fourth hydrogen atom which is connected to the carbon atom by a dash wedge and that is situated behind the carbon to really learn something you an awesome 20% off their annual premium subscription
