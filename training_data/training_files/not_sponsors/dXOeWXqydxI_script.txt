here's everything that changed on old school runescape in June the biggest quest of the year sins of the father was finally released and along with it our fourth ever server roll back to the game that's right a year and a half after the legendary twisted bow roll back we've got another one so why did this quest release lead to a roll back at the game a reason than the actual reason why the game got rolled back to put it simply the game update corrupted item IDs a number of items from before the release of the quest we're using incorrect IDs so players who items like the twisted ancestral robes twisted ancestral robe kits the flying Vespa cow or enraged tech titty found that those items change to new items that arrived alongside dark mire over 1,100 items were affected in total owned by 846 unique accounts at the time they weren't able to discern the precise number of accounts affected and they had no way of knowing whether the accounts kept the affected items or discarded so they decided the safest option would be to roll back the game if you're looking for a Michael Scott explanation some items had incorrect IDs the release caused the items to then either disappear or appear as different items this was bad so they rolled back and that is the story of the games latest roll back in the new quest you and your revolutionary friends must take the fight to the vampires by infiltrating the vampire city of dark mire and facing Lord rackin on his own turf this quest is a continuation of the my request line and involves new never-before-seen puzzles in the

attachment for the amulet of fury that will transform it into a blood fury amulet the amulet will allow you to try and SAP your opponent's lifeforce with a 10% chance to heal you for 10 percent of the

support curb you'll have the opportunity to loot the grand Hollow chest which can get you some unique rewards these include the new ring of endurance which can be charged with stamina potions if you

barrows doors a charge is consumed when you use the lock pick to open a door which was previously unpassable to you once a charge has been lost it becomes untradable in addition it will speed up looting coffins in the hollows of poelker and lower the chance of triggering the trap without using any charges this was the biggest update of the summer and has brought quite a bit of new content to the game if you'd like more information on everything including some of the behind-the-scenes details from the j-mods make sure to check out the description for links a brand new Gillan orgas that was released that offers updates to the new leaks projects to adventure paths the new clan system group iron men a kingdom divided updates to pvp and PVE m achievements account security and login issues ice cores problems and of course sores the new clan system will allow clan leaders to enable up to 15 ranks the usual military titles are offered along with various other tier systems that relate to runescape metals and gems color codes and much more you'll also be able to customize what actions each rank is permitted to take this is just a small look at the client system update as they have a lot more to work on and plan on releasing more information in the near future PvP has a massive post about all the potential changes that could be coming to the wilderness including the addition of a brand new wilderness hub called the fear ox + clave clan wars and last and standing could potentially move to the wilderness wilderness bosses may be redesigned and overall while it would not be an overhaul of PvP it would definitely be a breath of fresh air but that of course depends on the player and now to an update that I'm sure many of you will have something to say about the new death mechanics when you die outside of PvP your three most valuable items will remain in your inventory when you respawn the rest will be dropped near where you died and the location will be marked with a gravestone to get your items back you can return to the gravestone and click on it however your gravestone will all be there for 15 minutes before it disappears and all of your items get sent to deaths office a timer will appear on-screen to let you know how long your grave will remain accessible the timer will pause if you become inactive or if you log out so those with poor internet connections won't be punished if you happen to drop offline your grave will give you some comet items for free but more valuable items will cost you fees start at 1,000 GP for an item worth 100,000 GP rising do 100,000 GP for items worth 10 million or above iron players will get a 50% discount it's this much harder for them to obtain cash quickly should you forget the money or simply not want to risk it on the way there the grave can uses mystical powers to take the fee straight from your bank the items kept on death screen has been updated to show you exactly what you're risking and what gravestone fees to expect items which require charges to use such as the toxic blowpipe will convert to their uncharged tradable version upon death outside of PvP they'll go to your gravestone you'll also get any leftover charges back in the toxic blowpipe example this would be an amount of Zorah scales equivalent to the charges remaining some items such as the fire cape will break on death and must be repaired how this works depends on where you are in the game and how you died if you're unlucky enough to die a second time on the way back to your grave any items you drop will usually be put in the same grave and it's timer will reset food and potions will not go to the grave and will automatically be dropped on the ground under it so it's still possible to make a supply pile they'll stay on the ground for an hour - any time that has already ticked down from the gravestone if you don't get back to your gravestone in time it will collapse and anything left in it will be sent to deaths office your items will never disappear from deaths office however you'll have to pay more to get your items back items valued at under 100,000 GP are returned for free but anything more will cost you 5% of its current granox change value again iron players will get a 50% discount you can find an entrance to deaths office near all major respawn points now here's the interesting part suppose for a moment that you didn't have the cash on hand to pay for the gravestone fees or retrieve your items from deaths office if you have any items you don't really want you can offer them up as collateral to death's coffer which you can find in the office 105 percent of the cost of the items you sacrifice will be stored in the coffer and can be used to pay any future fees you might incur so if you got a lot of unwanted alka bowls and a chronic lack of nature ruins you can stick them in the coffer instead each individual item you place in the coffer must be it worth at least 10,000 GP or he'll reject it ultimate Ironman accounts will not have gravestones and will not have their items sent to death's office the first time you die in-game you'll be sent to deaths office for a further explanation of the new gravestone and death system so you can better understand everything that's changed so what do you guys think you're new to the channel but those were all of the updates for June this month quite a few updates to go over next month we'll see some interesting updates as well so let's hope that they don't cause any rollbacks in the first rune light update of the month they added support for track and collected loot as well as completion counts and personal bests in the hallowed suppo kerr they've also added support for adding menu options to info boxes now if you have the death info box option enabled and your death indicator plugin you can right click the info box to clear it if you die which to revisit it in the second update of the month a new pyramid of plunder plug-in was added which can hide the vanilla timer display and substitute it with an accurate timer info box additionally can highlight the spear traps unopened doors unopened urns chests and sarcophagi the ground items plugin can now draw an outline around ground item text instead of the simple shadow and you can now toggle multiple overlay styles for the npc indicators plugged in to show any combination of NPC location Southwest style and Hall so there you have it all the changes to old school runescape and the rune light client in June thank you very much for watching this far in the video if you guys have been wondering why the uploads have been a bit slow and the streams have been non-existent well let's just say that for the past seven months I've been working on something behind the scenes and soon I will finally be able to release it to you all look out for a trailer in the upcoming weeks and soon the games will begin [Music]
