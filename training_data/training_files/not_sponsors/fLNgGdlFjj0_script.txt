hello this is chef john from
foodwishes.com with watermelon pizza that's right there are two kinds of
people in the world those that think topping a slice of watermelon with feta
and olives is insane and the people that have actually tried
it and that's because while this does seem kind of crazy
once you taste this amazingly delicious combination you understand
you understand everything and you'll probably spend the rest of the summer
trying to get that first group of people to give this a try
so good luck with that and to get started the first thing we're going to
do is cut the largest watermelon we can find in half
and to be specific we're going to cut it in half lengthwise which i like to do
very slowly and methodically by first making sure my knife is going
through the rind right in the center and then i'll cut down a few inches and
turn it and continue slicing and i will not attempt to go all the way
through until i'm sure my cut is nice and straight
and my fingers aren't anywhere close to the blade
and then what we'll do once we eventually get that cut in half is that
we'll cut those halves in the quarters at which point we can start creating our
wedges and it should be super obvious but let
me make it official and tell you that you definitely want to
use a nice red seedless watermelon for this
since topping a watermelon with seeds with feta and olives would be
problematic to say the least but anyway once we have that in quarters
we are only going to take the best four or five slices from the center
so i'm going to cut this right in the middle at the thickest point and then
make some nice even slices about three quarters of an inch thick
and when it tapers down and becomes too small for your liking we can just save
those to eat as is later most likely given those end pieces to
the kids since it's been my experience you have to be of a certain age to
really appreciate this approach and by the way if you did want to slice
all the way to the ends and just serve wedges that vary in size that's up to
you i mean you guys are after all the lords
of your gourds but since we are calling this pizza
personally i think it looks a little better if all our slices are about the
same size and then even though this is called a
seedless watermelon we're still always going to have a few of those white
immature seeds here and there which while you could leave i think we
should remove with the tip of a spoon and as we do that we're going to be
leaving these little divots on the surface
which is a very good thing in fact once we transfer these to whatever we're
going to serve them on we should actually take the tip of our
spoon and make even more and what those are going to do is
prevent our feta and olives from falling off
our slice as we eat it which is one of the problems with your average slice of
watermelon pizza right so this counts as my major
innovation and that's it once we've dinged our melon
we can go ahead and crumble over our feta and you know how in all those
videos where we use cheese i will almost always tell you to use
whatever cheese you want and that you're the jesus of your
cheeses and whatever other variety you like will work fine
well i'm not saying that in this video all right you have to use feta
since it has the perfect combination of creamy briny and salty
to pair with our sweet juicy watermelon of course if where you live there's
another kind of cheese that's also creamy salty and briny
that's just like fat only it's called something different then by all means
use that and then speaking of salty and briny we
will also scatter over some pieces of olive
and i'm using both green and black well actually not black
purple okay those watery tasteless black olives out of the can are not something
i recommend here and instead you should find a nice
beautiful pitted purple kalamata olive which has that much more intense flavor
profile that really is going to work so much better here
and of course unless you're playing some kind of sadistic practical joke
we don't want any pits so be careful and then once our olives are down we
will do a very very light sprinkling of freshly ground black pepper
right just a tiny touch and yes of course you could sneak on some cayenne
but to me the fragrance of the black pepper works a little bit better
and then next up we're going to scatter over some freshly and finely sliced
mints or if you want basil would also work
here but the mint's a little sweeter which i think pairs better with this and
by eye i mean michelle thinks that but i agree and then you could serve
this as is right now but i'm going to finish this up by
dressing ever so lightly with just a few drops of rice vinegar
or maybe some other sweet vinegar like balsamic
and then last but not least just a few drops of olive oil for just a touch of
richness and of course it will give that surface
a little bit of a sparkle especially if you're in the sunlight
which while you're eating this would be a great place to be
and that's it our watermelon pizza is ready to enjoy
and i'm really kind of hoping you've never had this combination before so
that i'm the one that gets credit for blowing your mind
which is how unbelievably delicious this is i mean the combination of that sweet
juicy watermelon with the salty brininess of the feta and
olives and that sweet fragrant herbaceous mint
is just absolute perfection and this always reminds me that when i was a kid
i saw one of the adults sprinkle salt on watermelon okay i don't remember if it
was my father or my uncle but i do remember being shocked as my
young undeveloped brain could not comprehend such a thing
but now that i have an older undeveloped brain it all makes absolutely perfect
sense i mean if friends of mine were having a
big summer garden party which they're not this is something i
hope they would be serving and i'm going to go ahead and sign off
and finish those other three and while i'm doing that i hope you go
