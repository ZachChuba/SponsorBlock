[Music] hello everybody I think we should be live I think we should be live I don't know exactly they I just got a tweet from kids as well I don't know what the hell that treats about hello guys ah we live I'm what 100 cents sure why is this chat here as well oh it's all going on okay I guess we can get rid of this one then sorry guys right we're like yeah cool let me check this out and let everybody know we're live and but didn't get here and then we will go ahead and get into some upgrade and unlock which is quite cool to say it was quite good make sure I'm not daxing all my messages no beautiful lets out everyone and then we should be fine we're live hello everybody welcome our grand unlock is back I've got two episodes ready so they'll be going out at least if I need to edit them that's all I need to do now so I'm sure a lot of people are gonna come in here today and not know what grade unlock is so we're probably gonna have to explain that a bit we're probably gonna have to explain it a few times but that's the way it goes hello everybody welcome to the stream thank you very much coming and joining and we're gonna do a bit questing today I'll show you the chunks I'll show you the levels this is the current levels Oh Britain unlocked hog like there's so much love so much love right brain unlock it's crazy wait was this always a hardcore did you start over it's always been a hardcore mate always been a hardcore these are the current starts been I've been grinding pretty hard last few days we've been going for attack strength defence levels then pushing magic weren't 4:55 magic so I could use high out which has been huge give me a load of money on the account i but also pushed a 40 prayer so that we can unlock the protec from missiles unfortunately I don't have the active hunters a lot so going for 43 is a little bit pointless at the moment I'll show you the chunks in a minute but yeah that's that's effectively where we are also when I got 57 agility so we had four graceful and I think that's about all I've done in terms of grinding a little bit of mining I've been doing as well just afk in that so you know nothing too crazy but we progress the account a little bit if we grab out this is the current SAP I need to go and get he's going to get a broom plate money to be honest but this is the current setup depending on defense and whatever that we're currently rocking I need a room plate money we've done the quest so I probably need to go and get that but we could dig out a Drang defender we also got to ruin kite shield which was a one in six thousand drop from cyclopses and it was pretty much the only way I could get one on rare drop table so that was pretty nice too to get that and then obviously got the DDS as well but we will not be using that for now because we are going for questing weird they cut away five pounds think teamlink my man how are we thank you very much appreciate it dude I'm gonna pop this chat out because this is a they've changed how I see the chat and I really don't like it I really don't like it at all so we're gonna we're gonna grab that there we go much nicer much nicer weird date May appreciate it how are we today dude and then I'll show you the chunks as well quickly and then we'll get into some question guys might as well be wearing that and there was a Michael Cole Pfeiffer's upgrade unlock height a Michael thanks very much man it's always so much love Rock great unlock it does it does feel nice but I genuinely appreciate it's crazy how much love it gets I'm Live Chat thank you very much femke home yeah so Michael and weird no preciate guys let's get the chunks up and then you guys can see what we've unlocked so you can ask some questions as well in the chat guys if you want to see anything specific because we've got we've got a fair amount unlock now we are starting to push out a little bit and I guess we'll start from we'll start from top right and we'll go left to right or right to left even and we'll go from there cool concept thank you very much mate appreciate it slows you you have never watched up great an unlock or anything you can see like each of these little chunks are like chunks of the map and I can only use ones that I've unlocked so we randomly unlock a chunk on the map every time we do something I'll explain the rules as we go throughout the whole livestream if people want to ask those sort of questions but as you can see like for example here I haven't unlocked like Rd I believe in a lot normal Rd it's one of the next potentials anything without a number in it means I've unlocked it and I can go there but it creates these weird sort of things where like but I actually did fairy rings not too long ago like a couple of days ago and I got fairy rings unlocked which means I can now use the fairing to get to the what's it called what they called [ __ ] while they called the crab ones whereas before there was no way of me getting here because this was blocked off so I had loads of karanji trunks unlocked but it was no actual way of me getting here because brim Haven was cut off and the other thing down here was cut off so until I got this and fairings unlocked I wasn't able to get to karanji so there's some interesting things that go on but we'll go through all of this and I will I will talk it through but 8th Lake came over 5 pounds saying god I love this account you [ __ ] Savage pretty sure man thank you very much dude weapon whoa there we go I'm using the wrong one now I do have the crazy Archon locked but I'm a hardcore I'm and if I die I lose 10 chunks so I don't really want to be doing that right now so eight lay thank you so much to the 5 pounds but uh going from here we have Frankenstein scars two unlocked haunted woods we got the the fairy ring here we've got canif it's opened up which meant I could get my marks of grace which is really nice obviously the whole route to here as well links a few unlock a chunk in a different part of the world where unlocked chunks are in between you have to wait until you unlock apart yeah I have to wait until i unlock a path so as I was just sharing with Carranza I had Kuran door open for ages but there was no way of me actually getting to Carranza now I can use the fairy rings to get there so yeah the whole path has to be unlocked I can't just go somewhere because because of it so we'll just do the whole of the right side first and then we'll go left and we've unlocked the whole roof some bullets and amber to rock we're actually one square off getting barrows so that would be interesting once we do get barrows unlocked start going for some some interesting pieces there so that's that's pretty cool it's gonna be super slow the way to do it it's probably fairy ring here jump over and then go round to Morton that's probably gonna be the quickest way obviously will unlock the shades of Morton teleport as well so we can use that but that's probably the quickest way to barrows we've got a lot to load of the desert which is pretty annoying to be honest so we got the shanty pass tourist trap we're gonna do today actually we got the ruins of ooze and then we just got sort of this so like the quarry I can't get to there's no way for me physically getting to the quarry because everything is locked around it so let's go up here and then obviously Lumbridge is where we started jewel arena our careers and the whole of barracks unlock pretty much the whole of free to players unlock still don't have the top of dig site unlocked pretty much all the free to play so is unlocked to be honest which meant I can do pretty much everything free to play wise which is quite nice then as I said we are love karanji I do have Charlotte village but there's no way of me actually getting into Charlotte village right now because I don't have the car unlocked so yeah I can't really get in there which is a bit annoying and yeah chrome drawn locked which is nice we've also got the desire area or unlocked kranj door unlocked which meant I could do Dragon Slayer again all the free-to-play taverley the hero's guild birth of warriors guild where I got the drain defender death plateau which is quite a good one that that quest we're gonna be doing today as well alright and then we started to like open up like this sort of area where like seers village you know the ranging guild legends guild suffer that witch Haven fishing platform and so that's about all of unlocks at the moment but you know it is starting to push out it is starting to push out unfortunately we're pushing a lot down here which is kind of useless not too far off being able to unlock a portal which means I'll be able to get dragon scimitar which would be really really nice but oh yeah that's the little run down I'll do a very quick version of that every so often during stream guys but obviously you know I don't want to keep going on about that because that is just going to take forever if I do that every time so boom hello they want to chunk you're most looking forward to the a Batol chunks I really want to get a dragon scimitar really really badly cuz like the dragon long you'd look like a new band and it is worse DPS as well you know it's really bad XP per hour compared to a drain scimitar so that would be really nice um I'd like to get Rd as well RT would be a really nice one to unlock so we're gonna do the we're gonna do dead death plateau first is what we're gonna go ahead and do so let's let's take like 5k out we need some coins Sweeny bread we need trout so let's get a fly fishing rods let's get feathers also I'll quickly show you like things I've been about 3,500 iron ore we've got 480 coal decent amount of like steel bars we can make and I'll probably get a few more cards as well together 256 radars so happy with that but that's just amazing when we unlock the ability to make then got a few energy pots as well I've been making which is quite nice 1700 nature runes which is massive really really nice feather shield some installed heads bit of fletching stuff I've got 4,000 willow long bows which allow at some point probably or sell them to a shop probably loads of seeds and loads of herbs and stuff so we can start the farming grind when I feel like it's more of an efficient time to do it this is currently the the setup we got yeah why is nothing too crazy dragon daggers probably the drain defenders probably the you know prized possession and we got like 258 K from alchimia loader stuff and that's about it really that is about it really I've just closed that out what the hell happened hey anonymous coming in with 25 pounds thanks so much bad because you know I love this account I guess the community and you were alright as well thanks very much Dave appreciate about what about sleep let you oh thank you so much dude really do appreciate it cool so let's go ahead and start that but I twenty five pounds man I know exactly who that is fresh air thank you what the [ __ ] bright solid color with 20 pounds saying thank you for being live I've had a really [ __ ] couple of days but you being live has made my day I got you right thank you so much dude really do appreciate it 20 pounds Brad I'm glad I'm glad the string could help you out a little bit like I really am thank you so much I'm does anyone know the edgeville fairy code I mean I could look it up but by the time I look it up one of you guys would have said it and Brad thank you so much mate and then Bailey came in for a pound saying can't stay I'm just saying you're a good thank you very much Bailey appreciate Francie DKR thank you very much Bailey thank you very much and Brad thank you so much appreciate DK ah guys you are so generous what the [ __ ] Thank You B's and G's got to throw in my chunk of change and my usual bad pun love you Linc always more than super satisfied spoil your content Nick appreciate man very kind of you do thank you so much big man really do appreciate what a lovely message [Music] you having fun boy I've been loving playing this account I've really been grinding it like the last five six days and I've been going hard on it like like multiple amounts of more time that I usually would put in we just need one bar but I might as well make make as many as we possibly can um yeah I've been been thoroughly enjoying it the defender grind took me about 14 hours to get a dragon defender you guys will see that in the next video the one that you guys are gonna see which hopefully will come out sometime this week we're gonna go to barbarian village and fish to Trout Renault hide fog great unlock episodes I love you RNA it's the nicest thing you've said to me in a long time love you too big man how are we fried sad my bad everyone's so excited to see Brad I love it all right but yeah we've been smashed up I have to head out go to a baseball game can't wait to see the next episode drop love you or a thanks man appreciate I'm going the wrong way yeah appreciate it dude I'm and I had a few questions earlier about like when we were shown the chunks and stuff so let me just let me read these are to to to to to to to to ah where did the dragon longsword drop like I bought it from sonorous mate Oh Denis is playing one as well awesome man where were we yeah you're playing it again yeah playing it a lot I'm really enjoying it so I think I've thought I have changed I've changed the rules a little bit and you guys will see that in the next episode it's nothing that you guys didn't vote for though I made a community table ages ago I'm just giving it a little making a little easier to unlock some chunks and I think 72% of you or something voted yes so we went for it which has made me enjoy the account a lot more because I don't have to rely on just getting in dumb amount of levels those who wanted to see the levels there they asked so yeah that's quite nice as the challenge came in I likes that how are we met then we fight has come so far I'm convinced there are infinite possibilities for the series so watch them and I can laughs you're bad PvP skills a lull a joke my man start free Shadid me and start he was like I spoke to statistically challenged before I spoke to rod guys like I remember he made a email like a piano video where he played through the fire in the flames by dragonforce in runescape on a piano and that made him like blow up blow up back bend where where we have like a couple hundred subs and he suddenly had loads and I was like what the [ __ ] this blew up wildy is dead on it on my hardcore didn't see a soul the 46 kills really like you're gonna be making vids on this account as well as streaming it yeah our and so our gonna be streaming like the downtime and stuff but the the videos will continue so yeah you're all good there you're all good there we need 10 trout for deaf birthday do you choose the chunks no they're totally random mate you have chunks that are for water though previously it was all water you do another chunk yeah I am still Jacob it's just annoying that it was pushing down that way rather than going left if that makes sense climbing boots yes we're about to get we're about to get climbing boots which is going to be huge what's that four five six seven eight cool cool cool cool I'll probably just bank these Salmons I mean we've got the Warriors Guild now but you know might as well have a little bit food in there uh let's have a look at what I missed as well oh hello Trevon came in with $10 yield then we fight season two drug has kept me sane in quieting these past few weeks so I've got a pay it forward a Trevor and I'm glad you enjoyed it now it's crazy that some people are still watching that cuz obviously like for me and kins that that ended like months ago and we started it like eight months ago now say it's so odd to see people still enjoying it but I'm very glad that people are so I'm glad that I'm glad you enjoyed it they seem little team right that's the question David Trevon I work with Devon Trevon thank you very much mate I've missed seeing your videos on this account happy to see you back into it love the content wish you luck on your next chunk a Thank You Agustin appreciate it man it's a bright very wholesome comment I like it I like it thank you very much Steve okay cool so we have our own bars we have our salmon oh no we have our trial we just get bread and you guys are about to see where this account gets a little bit annoying and odd how we're gonna have to get bread is because I could make it but [ __ ] that we're not making bread I'm gonna I'm just gonna buy it so yeah we have to we have to go through a like a weird a weird route to do it often gave me with five pounds hey thank you ma'am um hi link just wanna say thanks been supporting my parents my dad got diagnosed with terminal lung car cancer in April and keeping the family business afloat during the word that we can't say or maybe we can but you know YouTube probably doesn't like it everything that's going on the world your uggs videos that kept me sane during this a orphan thank you very much man that's horrible news are really really sad to hear that mate hopefully he's in a stage where everything's gonna be okay I mean you didn't touch on it so I'm not 100% sure but a guy's horrible news mate but a fair play to you taking on the family business and smashing it in this hard time so fair [ __ ] play mate appreciate the five pounds dude very very kind of you and all the best man thank you so much cool let's go on over to here and we need to get to a fairy ring so let's go back up here hmm make the bread [ __ ] that but we're not making the bread still love you though link team Rock really everyone's team rag everybody absolutely everyone nice car alarm with zero car alarm going up I've got the window a bit insane possibly possibly I think I can't come to you and I that's the painful thing about it the painful thing about this if you are playing a chunk account you get lost in a where is it there we go no not that one that's the one I can't go to that one DK pay that's it raagh is ambitious but kind of sucks that's why we love him I know you guys like you guys [ __ ] get right round a bit kitten so to you I probably should have brought a little bit more food in case we do get into some trouble because I've got a couple of in the thing you don't I see yeah because I can't access anywhere that sells bread we have to we have to fairy ring here go across the bloody go across the log this is the only way I can get to this shot and then hit up hit up thingy shop up here so that we can grab it and they sell bread in there I think I'm pretty sure they do team link up the UK [ __ ] yeah I don't know if some reason Raj gets mean to me at times linky is the true boy I think rugs just more wholesome than me and more people identify with someone who's super wholesome than someone telling people to shove plate legs up there ourselves in strop bread I mean I could sit here and kill him but that seems very seems very silly to do when I can just go over here like I think making the bread myself would have taken longer as well cuz you gotta like get the wheat and then you go like don't poison me I've got no Telly's at me I am literally we are a hardcore by the way for those you haven't seen that it is a hardcore account so it is not you know do whatever I want if I do die I lose 10 chunks right you sell bread Danny yes beautiful let's send it over to I think that's everything I need I'm Bart anchor crowd 10 bread asgardian out could be bought or found in the pub at birth or beautiful let's hit bertha charlie job done right kids I'm gonna quickly remind you to like the stream I'm not drinking today - yeah I'll drink I'll drink diet coke man kids are streaming tomorrow when we drinkin so yo amps to get the champion in scroll you know what on my main I've got over to Keitel on the main I've never had a champion scroll of any type like ever I don't know that just seems a bit odd is that is that normal about what I said sure speak to down late in the birth of camp an awesome how long you been working this account seeing you alive and had to check it out usually hit up the Friday drinking it's difficult to say I started this series six months ago maybe a little bit more and probably more than that maybe eight months ago and I've been very inconsistent with it but I've sort of got to a place now where I know how my week is is structured and I can put the time and effort into this and I can also stream it which will help a lot with you know how how we go about making episodes so a bit of time but not a massive amount of time has actually gone into the account if that makes sense you know okay try and find one so we're going to do Jeff Plateau that's gonna give us our new best in slot obviously the climbing boots which is gonna be huge on the account because we're not gonna get an upgrade on those for a [ __ ] long time so there we go we started it but it's just came in with eight pounds hey man how we doing today so I'm doing the wonderful 85 crafting grind - fury boost on the iron man good luck on hard cry man a man smash it very love to hear it mate making huge gains though making huge gains congratulations first of all the castle beautiful boot it's in the house boot you see not [ __ ] around I'm a fresh coat for a hundred like Jesus right oh there I got my first champion scroll on second earth warriors let's ask ya I just never seen one you know I've got a one in two billion chance drops from try giant tires got champions : like five long bones and curved bones like back-to-back or they just sort of happened I'm looking for the God that was on last night I think that is correct make sense been thinking about making a hardcore I honestly so I have a main hard core which is like 1500 - oh I love that account unfortunately the content just didn't really fit how the channel was going at that time so I sort of thin back out but I loved that account [Music] these are G's about to see how new things are unlocked on the account I'm gonna have to just quickly go to record but it's thanks very much for the eight pounds man appreciate it you won't be able to hear any music guys cuz I am recording but here we go guys you would not believe it back to back freaky foresters absolutely mental two-tailed two-tailed we're currently doing death plateau here just about to start death plateau so that we can get ourselves the climbing boots and looks like we're gonna get ourselves another chunk here so open up if we get I think I think you get the whole outfit I know once you have the outfit there we go another item for the collection log which means we get ourselves another chunk let's go and open it up youtube voice you know it you know it um yes so that's what I asked you guys let me let me go and grab it [Music] let me go grab it so what I asked you guys a few months ago and that was if the collection log everything on there should unlock chunks and as I said it was like 70% somewhere around that so we get to grab the collection log out we we grab this out and go to other and go to random events these now unlock chunks which is awesome I actually got the the Hat earlier today so that was pretty cool to get so it means like doing things like minigames like I went ahead and did like the rogues then I got all of that for some chunks doing clues becomes interesting but obviously none of this is that easy because you got to unlock a chunk to do things so like without unlocking the chunks to start with I wasn't able to do the rogues dead and I'm sure a lot of clues are gonna come up I'm gonna but I can't do that clue you know I met obviously the bosses and stuff that was always that was always a thing so there's some interesting ways of like getting clues now which obviously pets champions girls chaos druids Chompy bird hunting is going to be a nice one for clues but that's so far away in the account and so yeah we got we got loads of different things of how we can do it now so we don't just rely on like don't just rely on like oh I'm gonna go and get 40 fire-making now so I can get a chunk you know which is quite nice so those you just joined the stream you will now see you will now see how we're unlocking chunks or how how this how this account works if you've never seen this before femke thank you so much for the three paths team ragout an idiot sandwich but I don't dislike you love it when your missus tell us about thank you right so those he just joining it we are a hull quraíam an lots of chunks of the world every time we do certain actions for example getting a new thing on the collection log getting 25 total levels getting a unique from a boss but that's collection of these days etc go into a new guild so like when i unlock the ranging guild that was a new chunk so there's several ways of getting it if I die on the account I lose 10 chunks so that's currently what we're doing for but you guys are gonna see a live one here so we're gonna actually go and that music down come again a live opening here guys youtube voice you ready are you ready record right let's go ahead and pick this chunk where are we gonna go woohoo we get the Sinclair mansion which actually is a fairy ring which is really really nice so we've got a quick telly over to Sears now previously we were using the legends guild one and of course it's pushing up towards relic ER as well which is really really nice once we once we unlock this sort of area we can start thinking about going to the islands and stuff like that getting ourselves up hell with Nate is not which should be really nice for other than having to borrow a rueful helm so not a bad chunk um this also covers the whole house which means we can actually do the the murder mystery quest because you go to Sears to talk to the poison salesman and you do everything over there so there we go there's another quest unlocked so we can get another chunk just for this chunk okay scuffed that's another wide yells we get we get a chunk every time we complete a quest as well very nice murder mystery completed that we got we got good do that at some point very happy with that very happy with that let's get death bat so back up I'm so that's what we now have so every time we get something on the collection log we actually get ourselves a chunk now which is really really nice and it's maybe enjoying the account a lot more because I can do a lot of diverse things now rather than just relying on you know this and that getting levels having to grind that wasn't fun so this this adds a bit of like enjoyment to it it means if I'm feeling like I wanted to go and do clues I can and hope I get chunk from it etc so yeah I like it that way a lot better it's been making me enjoy sup voucher coming in with two 7:20 Oh the second of the seventh or is that the American way of doing it 2.7 2019 is when I made the link chunk account there you go guys there you go I've just grabbed myself an emergency teleport just in case self thank you very much for the 272 may appreciate this also lets you do Matt a mystery I'm reading I'm reading comments

death plateau and job done and then we got another chunk to open guys another chunk to open because there we will have completed another question hey with a potato thank you so much for joining room

link or team raagh this is how you stream but I liked the content Thank You Brendan are you saying I'm streaming while I'm confused by the first part of that free [ __ ] you like to the content they wait oh you guys smashed it with the boats as well red dick salad soul EULA's Marc mega Austin and the Robin ye [ __ ] sake all smash in the emotes and the team bogs cover yet beautiful love it I'll see you love it where they're coming in with a lockers love it they love it thank you very much with their appreciate you already bud right that's a theme there we go thank you very much so now we can go up here probably gonna have to record this bit guys so oh no sorry right not the most interesting of quests I've just sort of skip to the end of it guys we had to just bring a few things here and there but we are about to complete it we're gonna find a new way up des plateau and then we will unlock the climbing boots which are gonna be best in slot for our character for quite a while so yeah really looking forward to getting those and if we keep on going we should get a little pop up there we go and that we just returned and we get ourselves the climbing boots youtube voice I don't think the YouTube voice is that different everyone's like you cheap voice you didn't mention getting cleaned by Harold yeah that's the thing stream exclusive the people who watch the videos will never know but you guys will you could comment on the video Harold cleaned you come on mo your link have you seen the Chuck plug-in in the plug-in hub I have they the problem is like I probably would use it now but it will make this it will make the video so inconsistent suddenly I've got the plug-in and it's like what the first videos didn't have this so I think I'm just a bit past it now to be honest but I appreciate you letting me know dude hello Tenzing no that's the wrong one but congratulations are gonna get in the plug in a bit mate it's always good to good to see before link loss 5k - Harold I want it all back so we're all good we're all good it's more than YouTube impersonality over the youtuber voice yeah I guess it's like being like enthusiastic and crazy about runescape okay guys we're about to kill a troll this is crazy it's like yeah okay cool you guys have been doing more on the game than usual I love the G sitting but the newbies I think they'll like the are at drunk RS content the drunk Aras content we are just getting ready for an for a bit more free time between me and Kings so we can we can start doing some new projects and stuff which is gonna be great so yeah that's that's the main reason really we're about to find ourselves a little bit more time on our hands which would be great and then and then they just means we could do a load more a load more things you know then leave like okay cool and I think there we go there we go guys def Bartow completed 3000 attack the ability to make claws and we also got some steel claws totally pointless I don't know why they bother giving us them I'm but let's go up and grab ourselves the climbing boots but back to this hello [Music] the YouTube boys just feels more like you're directly talking to a person and are you talking though I know you're talking directly only but it's hard to explain yeah I don't know it's a difficult one but everyone everyone goes wrong about everyone gets it you know I finally doing start grating unlock I'd say put this week maybe 30 40 hours into it in the last like 7 days it's not like this week if that makes sense the last 7 days of my time I'd probably put like 30 40 hours in which yeah it's a lot for this account and I've been really enjoying it still massively enjoying it can i buy some climbing boots correct links voice IRL over youtube gloss stream voice yeah and then and then people who met me IRL like yeah then your your 3 voice is different to you or your real voice it's all going on okay sounds good let's grab this quickly here we go so for like 10 GP or something - plus melee strength and then to defense and crush so it gives us to melee strength then gives us a to slash and to crush in the defensive bonuses which is absolutely awesome mainly there you know that the melee strength is the big one the defensive bonuses who really cares but the melee strength very very nice indeed and that is why we had it things I'll probably grab another one just in case I have to drop them or lose somewhere cannot bite applying beads okay sounds good 12 GPA they go hmm digging the new collection log chunk unlocking updates sounds like it's gonna streamline the content nicely Thank You hands pretty sure man yeah I think I'm it's just gonna mean that we can we could do a lot more diverse content whereas before it was very much just relying on quests and total level which wasn't the most fun you know when I was sat there like I can't do any quests I have to get 25 total levels now this it wasn't the most fun prospect because it's all forced me into doing things I didn't want to do so with this I can at least take a pic of what how I want to unlock my next chunks and let's unlock the next chunk while we talk about it because we have just completed the quest so let's get the chunks up chunks boom what were you thinking guys where we gonna go I don't know what I'd massively want if I could have anything like a one chunk on unlock like obviously like opening up a baton would be great but that's like it needs a few chunks to happen I think warriors guild wouldn't be too bad I think the Warriors girl would be okay not the Warriors good the Wizards guild we can't get in there but I'm not far off nice motorbike thank you I'm and that's only one square away and we can we can favoring over to Hazel base house that wouldn't be too bad [Music] chat one is the only wilderness no node world this Rd would be pretty nice as well Camelot don't think I've really cared too much about maybe um seven because then we get the Crone's and we can start to think about doing animal magnetism 71 would be really nice actually we'd be able to go this way to the ecto pontus and be able to put dragon bones in there which would be really nice so maybe 71 actually out of the lot or of course bear berries would be a nice one as well but we'll probably get something like [ __ ] 18 down here here we go let's see what are we gonna get right guys because we completed death plateau we did get another chunk so let's go ahead open this up oh it was so close so close to barrows I thought it was at one point just opening up some pretty pointless I think that is a fairy ring maybe but we got the favoring there yeah not great bit few about to be honest oh okay David that chunk away guys though for those who just joining for those who don't know what the hell is going on we're on a hardcore Ironman and when we do certain things on the account we unlock another chunk and these chunks are squares of the map which means that I can go to them so like for example right now I could not get into the Camelot castle because like the gate here is locked behind number 20 but I can use like seers village and I can walk around it's a catherby and stuff like that but you know every time we do complete something we click a button and it randomly assigns one of the numbers to be an unlocked chunk and then we can go ahead and start using that chunk so that's what we're currently doing right now and if you've just joined you like what the [ __ ] is going on okay hopefully that's a good enough explanation can ask any questions you want I'll try and do it 29 more for hammer ons I've been slacking all the farm runs 21 21 farming's what we've got the moment and you're actually two squares to the active funds list and now you can go underneath thingy and the stairs are in that side and the and the and the basements on that side as well that's a good chunk is the boat from Canopus so it's not a bad way to get to is it [Music] I don't think I can get there though because I can't actually get out yeah I don't have the chunk to the start of the boat if that makes sense very annoying very annoying job there the other day I have no idea where that is Scott ocular thigh mate anyone I will be I'll be in like 20 minutes or so trying to get my cards and par submissions and have to take it to for a small drive to help reset the computer hey I'll get one mark and good luck on it mate but isn't the bone meal grinder on the other half if I can get up it doesn't matter if I'd quickly show you might as well just show you on here actually so like for example like if I have I have this square unlocked which means the hole doesn't matter click down there brilliant and that's so annoying maybe this one so I have the mining guild unlocked which means everything in the mining guild is unlocked so same thing applies to the ecto where the stairs are on this side of the ecto so I can climb up there and I can use everything upstairs same with the dungeon I think I could use everything down there if that makes sense I'm so as long as you unlock the place to get into it you know that it's fine you can go up and down or wherever you want to go where you lot - link I'll quickly show you briefly because I have just showed it me but it's not like a conventional lot to one area it's a we started with just the Lumbridge chunk as you can see as I'm hovering over these are all chunks so were just a Lumbridge chunk and as we complete actions in the world by upgrading the account we slowly unlock more and more chunks as you can see these chunks have numbers on them their potential chunks that can be unlocked and you guys can't quite see it right if I grab this over and oh no did not mean to do that go with this see right here says pick a random chunk we just click this and one of those numbers will then randomly unlock and then we can we can go ahead and use whatever has been unlocked randomly so that's it's it's slightly different another car alarm really slightly different to what you're used to in terms of like hard grime and what somewhere where as we slowly get more and more of the map how'd you unlock saya by getting all quickly show you again so what we're gonna do is we're gonna grab so obviously we're gonna push out push out push out push out push out and then like say we get to this square water squares don't count so these will all be like potentially unlocked and then every time I get one we're just quickly quickly you know be like okay what chunk doesn't count randomly pick again what Chung doesn't count and then you know we'll hit this aisle and we'll land on the aisle and then wherever we start to unlock it well you know it's probably gonna come from this side isn't it and then we'll slowly unlock that side so yeah it's gonna be interesting and I was explaining earlier to those who you were here and like karanji I couldn't get on because brim Haven locked it here which men even if I went to music boosted point I couldn't just like walk around because the brim Haven chunk is locked so I had to unlock fairy rings - fairy ring up here and then I can run round this area so that's currently what is going on for those you've just joined let's get this back up and I think I missed no no I did Jonathan Wilson let me just replay this mm-hmm thank you so much to the $5 mate and it was just a love heart the only has a three there for whatever reason but it was a love heart I'll tell you that thank you very much man appreciate so it's like the gridlock series frame did yeah but I actually started it before Freight so I just decided not to play this account for months and months and months but framed had areas he had like he had like a whole map if that makes sense to start with in a corner and then unlocked another one or another one whereas I started with just like one chunk lumbridge and then we slowly pushed out from that my sense is the crossbow shortcut from user point to the bigger part of chrome did not available I don't think I have the fletching level to make a mithril crossbow is it other maybe I don't know where it is it's a crossbows I don't know where it is but it's you know you I think you have to make like a missile grapple or something I thought about making it unlockable a lot of people have asked that I don't think so because then it's gonna be like scattered I'd rather finish the whole of this bit to start with you know and then and then move on over because I don't think say is massively important to start with at the moment um next up we're gonna do tourist trap what do we need for this tourist trap turn fletching 20 smithing we have let's just quickly put these boots in oh thank you boy you got the Kraken no mate still haven't got the Kraken on the maid she she's letting me down ed stop I think we've only got like one point one point two to one point five kkc I can't remember exactly what I've got now for them yeah no we don't have it yet a bit GP that'd be fine we need four desert clothes do I have the desert clothes at the moment I don't know desert nope we don't so we're gonna have to buy those one two three bronze bars do I have any bones bars probably gonna have a al-quran' gee I'd rather just get them from parameter because I don't have any tin or copper a hammer which surely we have a hammer there we go [ __ ] yeah feathers we have feathers feathers fifty a shanty pass we can buy that okay so we're gonna quickly fairy ring over to karanji take like I know 10k with us there we go so that's barrold telly I need to start getting some Lauren's together as well this is all the Lauren's I have a iron green trick my man bronze was a transpose [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah there are I know that what am i doing okay gross abandoned you put a yeah grab some energy potions as well I [Music] don't near have the pages of this kind of account I get bored after two hours of ppm I think it's a lot different when you can stream it and make videos on it and a lot of people like getting involved and stuff like that makes it a lot more enjoyable I won't lie I wish you could like shift-click or like control click so it used rather than having to do this it's so [ __ ] annoying man just take those few energy pots very nice I'm not going to use the home telly just because I'm fuming that I use this barrel telly so we're gonna do this 59 fletching for a myth grapple oh ok so a one-off ok but I have fairy rings now so it doesn't really matter hey Josh flicky boy how are we my work just closed for the second time whereabouts are you man I'm guessing America or possibly Australia cuz I know where he is right now Ethan's closing again or getting worse and let me know dude sorry to hear that D thank you so much for for pouncer no worries femke get yourself some sleep we're going shanty our twin people shift pick bones an altar would be awesome yeah that would be pretty cool now you can do that menu entry swapper and then you right click you're in a tree icon and select configure shift click really this is the thing is it is it legit right-click in the tree configure menu entry let's have a look man you entry swapper where's it in is there item swaps object swaps I'm not gonna bother with it I don't care that much I don't care that much training per is not enjoyable without the feature yeah I used the berry bones to get 99 prayer on the men Here I am bringing energy pots not even using them legend call we probably need to grab a knife as well just to keep our finger up these Bank chest grab ourselves a knife one please and shanty big man Shantay how many do we need 1 2 3 bronze bars 1 2 3 then we need the desert robes grab like 5 water skins might as well buy a few shanty passes I'm gonna need them anyway shut those on awesome I think we start it just here don't we this is the tourist trap start isn't it yeah nice and I've clicked off brilliant ah let's get the quick guide up quick guide can be found here say 250 huts feathers a shanty pass hammer bronze bars full desert clothes a pickaxe let's go pickaxe pink beautiful a knife or slash weapon got one samer energy box hundred coins ring a Julie we don't have awesome okay cool grab like a couple potato and cheese or something I've got a few yeah that's grab like two great for bucket we'll leave one okay cool awesome James got on the record saying any setting in moonlight are okay with them yeah I just don't really need it that much it was more like if if JX could do it I'll do it but I am NOT that bothered right let's record this quickly right guys we're gonna go ahead and start the tourist trap now another question we can do and also will get a little bit of XP in any combat skill 10k in any combat spirit skill except Piraeus and we'll probably put it into range just to get that level up a little bit so let's go ahead and start it and we'll also by the end of this be able to make darts which would be really useful because we've got all of those iron ores and coals turn them into steel turn those into dart tips and get a load of fletching levels and load of smithing levels so that'd be really helpful and obviously darts are quite good later on in the account let's go back here [Music] let's [ __ ] do this Chris Russell came in with $3 saying are the unlocks gonna be chunk in bulk today I'm we're gonna be doing them as we get the mate we've already done how many unlocks we don't stay on stream guys too - I think what's the matter this is a bit of a annoying one one two [Music]

much fun it's so much fun you guys have just made it amazing and I can't wait to just keep on going keep on making content it's gonna be really good so yeah thanks very much everybody I keep going the wrong [ __ ] way again again again Nick let's go do with that nah legitly complete now moments genuinely it's very hard to very hard to [ __ ] off it's very hard to get your head around people wanting you to succeed and want to support you that much you know in this day and age you don't you don't get that very often and there's so many people in this community it was so nice and I'm really proud of what we've what we put together here guys not just me as well like I started the community but the mods and you guys have really shaped it and I'm impressed I'm impressed with how well you guys have done in terms of making this community awesome so yeah thank you thank you everyone then I think we can get in now [Music] Concha break this cheeky heifer when he isn't drinking maybe there is a bit of whiskey in that though I'm soaking these I'm reading thingies talking about telling people to [ __ ] off like 50 people asking about the schedule so me and Rob duo stream on Wednesdays 10:00 p.m. UK time 11 p.m. UK time on Wednesdays we do through Mon Sundays as well so there are two days that you can catch me in drag streaming at the same time then I solo stream on Fridays every single Friday 10:00 p.m. UK time and then raagh so those streams on Saturdays so if you're like a watch of the then we fights we stream on Wednesday then then we fight comes out on Thursday then Friday I solo stream Saturday skin solo streams and then Sunday we duo stream so if you enjoy our content you have 5 days straight of concert from us from Wednesday to Sunday you can just check both channels Wednesday through through to Sunday around 10 p.m. UK time and you'll and you'll catch everything right now we need to get these these boys in are we doing this we have to get someone in like a barrel or some [ __ ] don't we say ok so the cave search must right-click the nearby barrels search get into the minecart by search again yeah cool and then search you're talking about how it's hard to accept people wanting you to succeed however you interrupt yourself with a [ __ ] so it sounded like you said it's hard to [ __ ] up alright thank you babe sometimes it is hard to [ __ ] off Cory I only ever drink my own whiskey with diet drinks because the extra calories are just definitely not needed thank you babe in a while hello Robbie how are we make legends thank you now huh sometimes it's hard to [ __ ] off exactly what we gonna do now search get minecart go down the West northern path and use the barrel and Anna okay where's Anna that's not Anna that's a female slave let's just use this bad boy in Anna sounds like your hands full would you be able to squeeze it another group dead man mode like content maybe in PvP both just a request unfortunately not man just isn't enough there is enough time and also everyone being on different time zones just does not work Rob's got a full time job as well fortunately not maybe one group iron man comes out something will be remade but no no real plans to do anything like that at the moment what I was saying earlier is being kins are gonna be making some extra videos on Mondays not every Monday doesn't it's not going to have a schedule but Mondays every so often will come out with with a video that we've we've done together we've got one in the works at the moment which is we're making 10 HP 60 range dark dope yours and we're gonna make a video on that of some sort of like how much money did we make killing you know weird level accounts with our with our Devo specs and obviously being one defense at 10 HP it's like mad low combat so yeah that'll be coming out at some point a Monday soon so yeah we're doing a little bit more content in terms of videos which would be good right I'm pretty much done with this quest now go down the northwest path and use a bow on an ax head to the bar put an ax in the cart then take it cut yourself alright use an ax on there when you PK on the dark bear accounts how you avoid getting HP XP that's that they get ruined that's why no one really does it thinking because the accounts get ruined pretty much instantly obviously you can still use them when they're like 20 HP but they're nowhere near as low combat level you know so that's why not many people do it but it'd be it's just a fun side project we're doing and we're making those accounts we did on Sunday we'll be making those accounts and then on Wednesday we'll be doing it again finishing off those accounts but I got me moonshine so that'll be Robbie you've loved your moonshine don't you know roses fun try be roots just something will you stop doing but i rewatch group dead ma'am both bits recently and remember how good they work yeah and legit III miss them I miss them for sure it was a great it was great fun but unfortunately yeah just not not durable my men don't get PvP XP that's how you fight that yeah but getting like 40 [ __ ] thousand cannonballs okay yeah or they uh was it good on an Ironman is not a fun feet you're damn right my man can't wait until I'll be able to travel I'll see bringing some to the meetup bit of moonshine to the meet up or more can do one like put our in the wind certs than that the nearby barrels to find Ana okay I think she's in one of these and she I think it's this one actually steer yourself man [ __ ] off I don't even care if it's a maze or not search this is this one if you pay about it but it's not the one with an ax in it this one oh it's over there my ID should be over there think it might be over here search how about some minecart then take the kite yourself search nearby boughs to find it Anna yeah I think and find out that there we go cool right put Anna on the winch bucket use Anna on the winch bucket well I remember Sunday was Nicky boy dying every 15 minutes yeah it was not a great time it was not a great time the officer helped and then I think you can get caught here so I don't wanna yeah there we go cool right yeah well cuz Dodos are flying in I've had a few drinks and and I literally had 10 HP so I was dying constantly then every time I die dad do a shot because we do a [ __ ] shot for dying so I was I was in all sorts of trouble on Sunday honestly awful ray maneuvers just coupled as well don't raise the gas suspicion when he offers to help head back to surface okay cool thank you boy buses rocks rocks win absolutely awful hey blanket how we doing ma'am I hate this quest this is not a bad start awful quest not even Friday yet mega didn't get my whiskey James what we planning on getting what we plan on getting for Friday's stream guys I think I might get myself I'm getting some burritos for sure for Friday and then maybe a woody maybe a woody any plans and some some exotic stuff beats and cheesy search okay operate the winch it's over in this corner isn't it operate feel like crap still hate to hear that mate I'm doing all right thank you like it alright I hope you I hope you you know start to feel a little bit better dude down gave a sambuca lemonade that car be nice Shirley barold West that card that caught me sambuca and lemonade I hate sambuca so much so [ __ ] much put ad on the wooden cart they might be having a drink myself to than enjoy my kite it's still the woody and the Wild Turkey since you told me it was cheap at Tesco yeah the wild turkey was on it was on offer okay so we put the barrel on there talk to the minecart driver put Aaron on the wind truck here don't Rosa guard suspicions and you help fund that bit talk to okay now we gotta [ __ ] get these right otherwise we gonna mess it up two to one three just bear with me chat one second three [Music] three-one so cool I think we tell them some sort of joke can you [ __ ] Lobster think this is gonna be it talk hurry up and get in the cart or I'll go without you okay so I think we're gonna have to record this one here we go guys again not the most interesting request so I thought I'd just skip to the end of it so we're gonna get on the back of this car and we're gonna get out of here with Anna who is who we had to save in this quest she's in our little barrel if we look at her she look how few min she looks and then a bit of awkward silence right now this is when I'm usually filming this is just awkward silence oh I just sit here wait for wait foot to get to where I need to get to and then I can start talking again but thankfully we're on stream and I'm not just talking to myself energy pots not even using them I'm [ __ ] awful of that okay okay cool and then we talk to this guy and then if we talk to Irina this should be quest completed there we go and talk to her this should be it what we're gonna put it into fletching your gypsy smithing or thieving it's between the Jersey and fletching I think I'm going to go fletching because I actually quite enjoyed agility so we're gonna go with fletching and fletching again and that is gonna get us there we go a bility to make throwing darts access to the desert mining account with mithril and adamant rocks and obviously the XP we just got there as well I'm gonna take us to half way to 59 fletching and at 59 fletching we can make the mithril grapple which is used for a few Diaries as well so that'll be pretty cool boom our beeeautiful and while I was doing this crystal Russell came in my Rose my son says you need twenty hundred dollars and I should send it to you cuz you said his name also balefire is on a all loving the attention a balefire mate I rate that they I rate that massively yeah keep telling you dad I love how balefire and Christopher just sat there enjoying the street together that is like father-son girls love it there are people that enjoy the Jersey I love agility all day long fletchings horrible agility is like chill I love it agility on the stream it's great great I'm gonna go to the our crib Bank I don't know this Bank feels so wrong to use anyone get a vibe like I don't like sitting at that I want to be a bank booth Christopher exhorts the $5 man appreciate it sorry that one took a little bit of time to read but I had to record the old footage he's in child labor to get his dad's money for [ __ ] sake a CLI vodka have a good slave have a good sleep you cheeky bugger you'd love a chair see not even 76 agility on your main yeah but I don't need it like just cuz I love it doesn't mean I just go out of my way to do it you know like I enjoyed it see if I have to do it and I've got like I've got like 65 agility on like five or six different accounts like it's not something that I shy away from it's a it's definitely that it's something that I that I can get involved in alright I think we're gonna go oh we've got to open a chunk oh we got open a chunk let's go ahead and open this chunk right chunks boom let's get this up on screen there we go cool so is he just joining this is the chunk locked hard cry man we're chunks of the map are locked and by doing certain quests while by doing quests by doing certain levels getting collection log stuff we unlock randomly a chunk every time and it slowly pushes us out further and further so let's go ahead and record this and of course for completing the quest we do get ourselves another chunk let's go ahead and open this up see where we're gonna go that is gonna be a dead child so we will go again here we go [Laughter] why do you do this today why why I don't want the wilderness remember if we do die we lose ten ten chunks so going to the wilderness before we've died is just a no-no at the moment so what there we go that is our chunk for doing the tourist trap hate to see that yeah hate to see that that is painful it's such a dead chunk as well as not even like a good will leech angler forgotten it's just anchors you get a ring crossbow now I could have before any way but like I'm not that far off just being able to make one myself where we were saga' suppose that 69 lychee like ten and a half levels I've done it I did sit I actually did the fletching root on my other hard core and didn't take that long and especially with darts now like we just unlock the the darts from tourist track look how many like I've obviously got to get the call just a little bit of mother like minding and I can have like thousands of steel bars turn them all into dart tips then it's just bang bang mmm mmm bang it's gonna be unreal it's gonna be so quick I cry man ko soldier incoming [ __ ] that tell you that tell you that for nothing I'm right what have we got next elemental workshop I think is what we're gonna go ahead and do let's have a look elemental what do we need for this elemental workshop 1 mmm look at the bright side if you die are you more likely to loot wilderness chance for [ __ ] sake we need a knife pickaxe ok cool I'm hating that double [ __ ] noise coming through horrible knife pickaxe I actually quite hate elemental workshop 1 it's the one where you have to like make a furnace work isn't it I remember finding it's so [ __ ] difficult because I'm just a bit of a dumb [ __ ] thread leather obtainable during the quest do we have any no we'll get it during the quest hammer for coal more if you would like to produce multiple bars I'm ok thank you for awesome let's grab ourselves the drayman's staff shanty pass shanti shanti shanti there we go and graceful I think that's gonna be everything for the quest a chi nice hmm 69 but not Bank nice it's at one of the times hey Dan walk link you're handsome [ __ ] good see your chunk account bag hey thank you mate how are we got luck mmm music plays oh sorry thank you appreciate so hard like when you go from recording cuz obviously so much changes on my end in terms of recording and then trying to go to like trying to go back to stream og do forget to do certain things it's hard to get back into the chat sometimes as well just to check the phone ring that we just unlocked above Camelot or above seers anyone know the code I mean I'm gonna look anyway but see if anyone gets it we could use them ago as woods one as well I guess but I'd rather useful one up by Sinclair mansion Sinclair Sinclair there we go c.j ah got it for a chat got it before the chat no worries I'm sure it's not easy it is for people who are good at it a load mate thank you very much for coming in with that I appreciate you man preciate you there it is configure me Gerber's woods is that stuff he say I don't know probably oh [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] away from de configure CJ ah can you get keyboard before you got to it I respect it though you know you've got to help me out and that's why I'm writing it you know how does it look when you lose shucks so they randomly appear so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna number all of the chunks I have and then I'm gonna put the random generator to generate ten different numbers and then I'm just gonna take those away so they could highly [ __ ] me in certain ways I really don't want to die it'd be nice never to die on the account but it's not gonna happen probably not probably not cause let's grab the quick guide I love hunt for hunter bagel hunter hunters a bit of a legend thank you boy hello Justin now while we make SIDS village go to the house immediately south of the anvil that's so I mean I guess it's this one isn't it but that's not exactly massively obvious such a bookcase in the east and more and then I think we use Vinay , you read it and then use the knife on it there we go beautiful go to the building with the anvil and open the odd-looking wall probably shouldn't call this actually God right guys we're gonna go ahead and do the elemental workshop just when I got the book starting this off I think we go down here and we need to kill a few of these elementals and then and then once we've done that we need to fix like an anvil or something or like a machine that machine I think all that might be number two I don't know whether it is or not will though we'll make it into the Edit live scene boom jae-joon as well go down the stairs into the room with the North Terminal water controls East yeah I hate this one I I remember struggling with it I think I fought to like one thing up so I'm going to make sure I do everything properly here turn the water controls east of the waterwheel it's a clip do a great weight coming to chill for a while good to hear Justin I've never consider trying see Angela's PvP hug cry my challenge I'm not a good enough Pierre to get away and I doubt the time to do it man in all honesty a lot of people are getting on at the moment I know they're gonna be popular but I'd start the time to the war controls Wes the walk wheel okay pull the lever by the water wheel nice this is the easy one oh is it the number two that's annoying okay I might be getting confused optional kill water bucket go on then God then no food I'll cry man I think we're gonna be okay I really need to unlock this soon I'll protect from LA [Music] okay cool it's obtained leather such a great north of the staircase in the middle of the room it's a staircase there maybe here yeah there we go beautiful the needle and thread and fix them fellows where the bellows there we go the Picts bellows watch it it's the one with the convey about okay yeah that is the one that's annoying yeah and the conveyor belt and you have to like twistings left right and center horrible [Music] fix bellows go to the middle room and search the small boxes we have to kill one of these as well don't we to do all of these go to the middle room in search of small boxes in the north east to get a stone bowl okay northeast northeast okay thank you Aran's this one probably doesn't our s we have a limit until workshop three really yeah rs3 has three and four Jesus Christ [ __ ] that probably means our sir s will get at some point gets a South Rim the South room use a stone bowl on the lava use the bowl on the furnace okay bang yeah this is a super easy quest use [ __ ] hunter obviously UNT the lava into there go to the western room all we need to kill her these as well don't we man I'm going to try and knock out some feeding levels go [ __ ] colic on Somali nights for for a half hours mate there is a door down there where elemental workshop free would be but AUVs not in the game yet if I remember right yeah they probably they do take a lot from rs3 and put it into the game so I'm sure we'll probably get it at some point but three and four I made that bad definite one of my least favorite me shirt just got the request Cape in rs3 and that's one of your least favorite that is [ __ ] brutal man alright mine elemental rock then we need to get the elemental wall that drops get to more if you're planning on doing elemental workshop - we'll get them later it's not exactly the hardest thing to do is it I should have brought a weapon is that better that's probably is better isn't it although it's a tick slower probably would have been better to stick with the older the old Raven but here we go Oh beautiful and then we need to use the elemental or and for coal on the furnace in the southern room get an elemental bar okay cool right let's record this okay that was pretty easy actually it's elemental workshop - that is just horrible furnace needs to be hotter ah [ __ ] he says that and now it's not even working what have I done what am I done wrong why is the furnace not hot enough what have I missed pull the lever oh I didn't pull the lever oh yeah there we go now we're good we're good we're good mm-hmm scoffs this should do it this should do it I forgot to pull the lever by the bellows I think this should be fine now we should get an elemental bar from it yep awesome and now if we go into the middle of the room and Smith we can make an elemental shield use this on here and we should there we go five thousand crafting XP 5000 smithing XP that's actually a really nice reward for how long this quest took and of course we get the elemental shield as well which does give us six magic defense bonus which is nice thirty-seven crafting coming in forty-eight sniffing coming in as well steel plate bodies can now be made and we are nine levels away from getting a chunk for the total level but we do get a chunk for completing the quest so let's open that up they obey whom that beauty I love that animation like that is unreal isn't it I wish more things had an animation like that when you put them on that is just such a great job on that such a great job I respect that massively right let's get the chunks up boom let's get these bad boys up there it lives chase absolute shade I'm gonna have to turn the music off though guys well we get this chunk I'm sorry too bad it's useless yeah is is a bit useless isn't it although I don't know if I've got a magic shield on the account no delay we'll have to look into it the equipped animation is sexy guys [ __ ] I'm real like fair play to em did that right guys what we thinking I'd really love to get marrows I would love to get marrows I'd have to go ahead and get 43 prayers so we had the the melee protection but that would be pretty sick again I'd love to get I'd love to get you kneel and I'd love to get arty and pushing over to the grand chewiness as well because we need to do monkey madness at some point but that's still probably quite a way off to be honest because we still need to unlock this as well here we go let's have a look at what we're gonna unlock guys record YouTube's voice music off right B's and G's here we go let's see what we're gonna get pick a random chunk and it is gonna be a water square up there so that's not gonna count let's go pick a random chunk opens are more the desert we get the bandit camp which doesn't mean we can get asked the quarry now I know it doesn't cuz you go walk through that gonna walk that way around so unfortunately doesn't even unlock the the quarry bandit camp I don't think that unlocks much I think you need it for desert treasure at some point but obviously you know we're nowhere near doing that so a bit of a dead chunk for now chunks haven't been too good in the last few to be honest but another desert chunk unlock that and I'm actually gonna restart the song because it is such a [ __ ] shade let me know the music by the way guys is it little bitty loud or what [Music] get rid of the chunk [Music] Candyland legit such a tune should we see if we can do a clue do you guys want to see a clue I think I've got a few in the bank should we see if we can do a clue I've never done a coil on this account but we got quite a lot open now we could give it a go boys a song it's called Candyland mate by V Lee which is ve like Neil a but they ve l ee you're my Candyland [Music] 3 boy you want to see a clue I mean there wasn't much love for it so like I don't want to go and do clothes that people don't want to see that but I'm a habit like what oh my god clue wires clue yeah [ __ ] out we've got a hard medium easy and beginner Chloe the clue for like teens clues cool okay let's try to do a beginner first because if we get any unique set we do unlock chunks so let's do a quick clip [Music] okay so we've started to unlock a decent amount of the map now so I think I might give it a go at trying to do some clues so we're gonna try to do the beginner one first easy than the medium then the hard I doubt we'll be able to do the medium the hard but maybe the easy in the beginner the beginner I think we should be able to do and if we get any uniques from this in the collection log then we get chunks as well so a bit of a win-win so let's give it a go begin a clue scroll yes I need to take a leather body I craft it to Charlie there you go that's one we can definitely do your my candy of the [ __ ] a [ __ ] the music again am i right we'll go back a little bit I won't restart the whole song there we go might just quickly jump into here to get another piece of leather hopefully it's unlimited amounts of leather just so we can grab it what mixed version of this of Candyland feat Frigga and manta Circle is what it says mate that's what it says thank you boy open I need a little [ __ ] knife sigh I'm [ __ ] drink screwdriver this weak-ass what the [ __ ] is screwdriver mate that's good beautiful okay let's grab a knife should probably bring a spade with me as well makes me need something like that and we'll see about the Tally's what I get backup Volker and fresh orange I've been vodka and orange it's lovely the King died near [ __ ] you [Music] anyway you can screenshot publish to play this the problem is mega it's like 500 songs long so it's like it's a bit TAS getting like 8 songs at a time you know we'll have to try and work something out I don't know exactly how I can do it let's get all the runes out just so I've got runes as well for Telly's I don't have that many luring so that is one problem let's grab those and it's got a key do we know which key it was cuz I'm not 100% sure now bad key I think it was examined I think examines tell you now provides access to the elemental workshop yep cool helpful useful hello hello what's going on hello Nova we are playing some upgrade and unlock those you don't know what upgrading unlock is is my hard cry man which is locked to chunks of the map I'll quickly show you I won't go on too long about it because I have literally just showed the chat this but we started with one chunk it's a little bit laggy for whatever reason I think I've had it open a bit too Don we start with one chunk which was the lumbridge chunk and as I did quests and got levels and unlock new things more and more chunks got unlocks and as you can see these chunks with like a number on them are potentially unlockable so whenever we do you know complete a quest for example get a new unique we click a button which is just up here you guys can't see it but it's it says random and you click the button and it randomly picks one of these squares to be unlocked and slowly we unlock more and more of a map and so that's what you're currently watching it's a series you are watching we're currently doing a beginner clue scroll to see if we can get a unique from the from the beginning clue where was it was it and then here the lever it's empty I know you can't just keep getting it okay we're gonna have to go to the Lummi let's just tell you to let me kill a cow what's the play this on it's on epidemic sound which is a content creator advertisers sort of website it's not like it's not like for normal people people don't use epidemic sounds and listen to music you know it's more like commercial use why am i going this way so it's not something I can just share if that makes sense any reason you chose those chunks I didn't choose the mate they're totally random totally random and so we just click a button in it and it chooses chunks randomly which is quite cool very happy that we have that that application to do that for me cowhide iron in a bit GP I think I've done the quest though so we can get em for free it's Noble okay no BOTS [ __ ] having arrows left right center struggling minkbert 280 top I didn't but I don't Bert Brendan you cheeky bugger don't need to make it from scratch you do you have to make it from scratch it's uh it's the clue step is I need to take a leather body I crafted to Charlie I remember when I first started this account why am I in here when I first start this account I just took your lower body to him and it didn't work unless they've changed it since then but uh yeah it definitely can do the start yes please I don't get any [ __ ] coins need some dollar link why what's going on thingy GP let's take 10k with us that should be enough we need new thread as well why didn't I get out of the bank when I was there scuffed I'm Scott that's why yes please I could just trade it as well is it softly they're all [ __ ] hard leather I need to make a leather body that's soft leather isn't it everybody leather bodies that surely and [ __ ] it how much GP does it cost of you to buy it I'm sort of strayed away from that I haven't done it at all in the last two episodes soft leather thank you I haven't done it at all in the last two episodes because I now have the collection log I don't know if the money route I haven't mentioned it though I haven't got rid of it but I just haven't mentioned it so maybe later on the account when things were a bit stale or something I can just be like yeah we're gonna buy a chunk but I don't think I'm sort of thinking that I won't use it at all to be honest threat as well [Music] other body they beautiful I'm gonna run there I'm gonna run that rather than tele because we just don't have that many just don't have that many Lawrence and I'd rather not waste them on something that isn't too far of a run and we've got these energy pots I made anyway say a medium lever they need three or is that di D idea just need one favoring uh yeah I guess I could have fairy rings where's the best place that I I've been it's really not that far is it I get a fairy ring I respect it but then like I guess I could have gone I could have gone shanty past bearing from there probably not too much difference because the fairy ring doesn't take you right to Charlie Rock ooh I love how it's still what the rug still that's the rag thing nightbot soon as the rag thing don't you have the Chronicle Y be done that why have you done that why are you running that side I think I probably do have the Chronicle that would have probably been the best route probably would have been the best room I don't have this got any charge isn't it because when I bought that it was back in the day when like you go put five charges in there or you go D by fight one charge at a time or something along those lines and annoying an annoying annoying way of doing it who's taking bets on the clue value who will say I probably won't film every step of this I thought [ __ ] Charlie was half his body was invisible there if China great and the place Duke Horatio calls home talk to the man with a hat dropped by goblins Kirk in the lumbridge castle and just use that didn't we [ __ ] it we'll just run it we'll run it we're here to chill we're here to have a good time convene you buy 50 a day yeah but like before the update before the update it was like you go you could only buy one at a time and you had to go through like dialogue or something I don't know exactly how it was there was an annoying feature that they've changed recently any thoughts on completing difficult tasks that let you select one of the possible chunks like in hindsight I probably would have but the fact like if I just introduced that now I think a lot of people would be like dude what the [ __ ] so yeah that's that's the reason why why I'm not gonna do it but yeah I think it's a pretty good rule but with the collection log I think we're gonna unlock so much through fairly passive stuff that if I do something cool that's just an added bonus for the account you know [Music] all the time I spend trying to get figure out how to get places quickest I could usually be there in that time yeah I do that a lot in PvP challenges I always work out my roots first because I know if I'm in the middle of a PvP challenge and I can't work out where I meant to go I will waste so much time being like is this way quicker I don't know so I always make sure that I've got that you know smashing it [ __ ] bucket I'm gonna use one one tele for the clue this could be it so let's record oK we've done a few steps here this will be step three I believe we're going back to Charlie the first clue step was to Charlie think for [ __ ] sake so got to make some leather chaps now I hate you Charlie I honestly troll what a [ __ ] troll man dick dick a Charlie a Charlie things always make some leather crap [ __ ] sake so just use a tele2 then go all the way back they better give me the bloody you better give me the bloody casket I want the little own I want the little power that sits on your shoulder that thing's sick as well guys another 20 letters [ __ ] good sendin oh I hate this like you're too far away to jump to that yeah okay fine but just my character where it needs to go you know pop thank you yeah well we'll get like ten we'll get like ten letters and talam or I shall just leave cow hides in the bank we on live scene yeah we are cool people mate you drinking a Coors Light now we're drinking a diet a diet coke mate almost a healthier option probably a healthier option just wherever they put this [ __ ] the beginner cleats are the worst I just want to get it done you know try and get ourselves one then we'll would it be easy I think the easies are actually quite nice that's a [ __ ] [ __ ] off Gilly cowhide gimme gimme I'm a free-to-play hard cry man with one mining one smithing and he gave me make one iron dagger cheeky [ __ ] hey I won't take you too long it won't take too long you'll be alright hey broseph thank you very much for the ten pounds and that word that was censored on scary on screen it says come so thank you very much my man love being quarter come every time I scream bye bro sit I go jeepers get have enjoyed the other day on an easy Wow Wow race of rotating how are we today mate how are we my man okay we're gonna kill one more cow man and then that'll do I know I said I'd get ten but I'm already bored of killing cows that Aldo [ __ ] question link [ __ ] I like that I like that Nick that's good what's up race if I'm good with engine let's show your vans off the chaps I'll literally kill Charlie I'll get the DDS out and end his life a Sir Trevor Dallas big man a dog [Music] thank you what was it we need to make chaps how we don't know miss thread left some other chaps okay course that one body used all my thread finally back in this series I've been missing it's so much mate hello Andrew thank you back yeah we've put a lot of time left it into the into the account recently 1041 total at the moment do some clues right now see if we get ourselves a unique and and in essence a unique is gonna mean chunks I'm already forgotten was a chaps just cool chappie believes you complete choice ass go give them back the leather chaps [ __ ] it just cuz Charlie's annoyed me and we can we can probably go farm some we can probably farm some war rooms at some point right charlie I've got your chaps mate give me the bloody casket please yeah Wow okay the first clue ever on this account guys the first clue ever I don't know exactly what's a unique but I think it'd be quite kind of obvious when we open there and we will check with the collection log but uh here we go live stream this bit won't make the video but what we think in what we think in value wise I would go to two thousand GP here we go let's open up oh that's definitely a unique that has to be I don't do enough clues to know but there's no way that isn't surely not I mean it's just a pink skirt but it's the sandwich lady isn't it that's a unique isn't it I see you naked YOUnique right we're gonna get we're gonna get excited here on the recording collection log let's have a look busy geez I'm almost sad I am always certain this is other I know clothes even hahahaha she is there's only 16 as well that must have been fairly rare let me have a look at the wiki quickly let's have a look at the wiki to see how rare that was to get beginner clue [ __ ] casket as a 1 in 360 Wow place obtained on average one unique per 12 clue scrolls so it's a 1 in 12 to get a unique and we got one on the first one that's what we love to see means we get a chunk to open let's go ahead and open it boom [ __ ] I'm over the moon about that that's awesome so yeah it's a 1 in 360 but obviously it didn't matter what unique we got so let's get the chunks up guys and we got another one to open here right it's record right let's see where this is gonna take us guys come on it's gonna be a water chunk so it is a redo let's go Oh savage lady sorting us out with your nails so we now have the nightmare zone which let's be honest I can now sit the account in there if I want which is great we've got the Wizards guild which we're not really far off being able to enter which is amazing we've also got the the Chaos turrets down there which is not a bad way to get herbs and Bankim really really happy with that our only way over there is it to start with is gonna be using the fairy ring at hazel Mears running over unlocking the nightmare zone and then we'll be able to use the nightmare zone at teleport which would be really really nice I'm over the moon map absolutely over the moon at that chunk really really happy and they also means that the fight arena is now one away which would mean we could complete the fight arena I think everything can be done in there and we're just starting to creep into this side of the map now which would be really really nice to get us you know into the it's this of gnome areas would be really really great boom solid clip solid clip I'd [ __ ] happy with that that is sick mystic unlocks correct um the issue with that though is on the collection log obviously the Mystics of their I don't know how I'm gonna deal with this we have like Slayer miscellaneous maybe where is it bosses minigames do we have celaya there we go slow okay no so you don't get any the blue mystic stuff the through Slayer say wait I I thought if I bought it it would show up here but the blue isn't even a it's not even on there so that's cool that's absolutely fine so yeah we can't get we can get full mystics as well what is it to get in there's at sixty-one in the Wizards guild Wizards guild it's definitely opps flat-six is it 66 but we can use a boost with a mind bomb for a three I think I think the wizard mind Bob concern it's either a two or three so we're not that far off at all to be honest and I need to go an afk some dragons anyway to get the 43 prayer so I guess we can we can probably just mage you can just mage and do that all right cool let's see if we do the second of our clues Spade grab that let's grab the brooms [ __ ] King Haakon drops blue but doesn't come up in collection yeah cool don't you get a chunk for unlocking a guild yes so also you know when we get into there we will get it but we need 66 magic before I can it's what I walk in the guild not like if i unlock a chunk with it so I have to still walk inside the guild to to get the chunk unlock let's go back that that that thank you thingy and thank you oh oh free checkups let's grab the click Reiter's easy clue get a clip of this as well cord okay we're gonna move on to the easy clue now we have think in the middle of the Wheatfield by lumbridge bill equipped a blue gnome robe top a turquoise gnome robe top and an oak short bay I don't think we can do that unless you can buy them in cannafest but I don't think they're known ones are they No yeah we're not gonna be able to see that one okay so gonna have to drop that one unfortunately that is so far away with nowhere near getting the with nowhere near getting the Nome stronghold unlocked so let's go ahead and have a look blue clue at the medium and open this check read it Shiloh Village oh do we have that unlock that's the question north of Shiloh village so if we quickly have a look on the map just there I don't know if are chunks allow that let's have a look I'm really not sure here haha we can do it I'm sure the wrong one sure the wrong one we shared a buddy close that that was nice they decided to [ __ ] up appreciate it preciate it boom no guy smashed it and I guys smashed it that should be there we go cool gonna have to fake that clip now actually now I can use the audio that was there before I can use the audio when I actually saw it but I yeah that I can turn this off now [ __ ] I've already [ __ ] that whole clip up honestly that was painful but yeah so we can't go ahead and do that so let's do it let's grab our dream and start out the dreamin and let's grab a little bit of food as well just in case we get into any trouble and we got emergency telephones that cool let's do this guy's live scene you guys can see me again boom that was nice and scarf but we're back we're back wicked okay cool keep that in the video the thing is like you guys find that funny cuz you know me but like someone who's never watched the series before would be like what the [ __ ] is this guy doing free so you don't but I've gotta be careful with what I chuck into videos so that people just understand it is a serious video Southern Miss point awesome how'd you get that don't think you can use Shiloh I can use the dkp make the dkp up here but ya know I can't use the Charlotte one it is just out unfortunately [ __ ] off that is stream exclusive exactly exact Amal use this cross a wooden log [ __ ] off Jagger this manners reputation to uphold not sure about that they have to bring anything although we're just digging OD KP yeah the old dkp mate nice we go that's a long walk for already here I know already here it wasn't too bad imagine we get Rangers all the clothes are doable and we get ranges how in the kebab cellar pole of each palm of each is unlocked as well let's see if we can home tele nine minutes okay we're just Lummi it then ah now I can I can use the fairy ring I can use a fairy ring to get to the desert we'll do that first met an eye man turned up Rangers for you chance you've got Rangers on your first one I don't know about the reputation I've got a reputation to uphold as a [ __ ] [ __ ] so [ __ ] off I hate those little shits I hate this [ __ ] even more the amount of times I have to run past these [ __ ] and they just throw a severed into me annoying annoying right so we're gonna go over to the cow fights does anyone know the cow fight log I don't think I've used it now I haven't anyone know the cow fight one another annoying thing is I haven't unlocked the quest to be able to use the the actual grant ones so I'm still still struggling Stephen thank you very much top fish Warren preciate guys Nikki be IEQ be I count five thank you I'm gonna take a bit of a hike here cuz I didn't bring any money so we're just gonna have to run it but we've got a bit of food on us so we should be okay [ __ ] off if not we're telling it out cuz I'd rather not die to desert heat it's not a great way to die on the on the hardcore [Music] yes sir second hard was Robin Hood are you taking the piss that's ridiculous orangey mate that's actually a joke do you want to do you want to walk like a normal person thank you that is messed up RNG chance I can't believe that now that you have nightmares then you can get redirection Scrolls can i mmm by then I guess they can I don't know why they would stop I'm and behind them because I know a few things in the in the shop are disallowed aren't they disallowed unviable Twyman i think like the herb boxes maybe etc etc which I don't really understand why like if a main account can get and why the [ __ ] can't and I might get them they have an interesting choice from Jay gates there but you have enough bosses for a nightmare same though ah we've got 66 quest points so I don't know we'd have to look into it we'd have to look into it I don't know completely possibly possibly if not I could probably bang something out I would do it right Ally you go $3.99 spot-on ah we managed to do two steps guys but unfortunately the next one is import pisco ileus which we don't have unlocked I don't know whether to drop this or not so I'm not gonna choose right now I'm currently live streaming so I'll probably talk to the chat about it but I'm not sure I'm gonna drop a lot because I have done two steps in it and but then again you know that's so far off I'm knocking that it's just gonna be so long until we'd be able to do it we will see probably will drop it but not gonna just not gonna decide right now painful painful that's very far yeah like if we get the if we get the chunks up here guys light porpoise let's import pisco it's poured pisco ileus wasn't it it wasn't [ __ ] piss couturiers might I'm [ __ ] poor pisco Ilyas yeah yeah pick this goodness yeah like like I'd have to get all of this then all the water chunks and this that it's just not gonna happen is it it's just not gonna happen like that's so far off thing you're gonna have to drop it that's a bit painful that's the painful one to take are we polling we can poll it but I think everyone's gonna be in agreement here straw poll I'm gonna get a straw poll in the chat guys should we drop the needy inclu Yes No there you go I'll put the link in the and the chat and everyone can go and vote on this Resul shot [Music] while you go vote on that guys I'm gonna grab another coke because this one's got a bit warm I mean there's only a little bit left but [Music] go biotic guys and see let's see what you think but I think I think dropping it's probably gonna be the way here isn't it let's be honest we do have another clue to do though we do have a hard clue so we can go and you guys see that see what you guys voted 90% of you voting that we should drop it so yeah see ya later medium clue we do have another one to open that's a probably probably gonna have to tell you out this one did we have a home telling two minutes yeah [ __ ] it let's just tell me out let's go to bear up the pole the pole killed it like absolutely nobody had any doubts there we do have a hard we do have a hard to to do but it's not gonna happen is it if we get a weirdly close step I'm definitely not doing it like the R&G would have to be ridiculous absolutely ridiculous hard clay check are they broken dwarf that [Music] that [ __ ] sake keep miss clicking that I think straight away can't be done yeah we're one-off though so I'm not gonna drop that one we are one square off being able to do that so we're not gonna be able to do that we're gonna use the pole c'mon I've never learned how to use it I don't know what it is right now I don't want to learn what it is it looks so much more complicated it would take me longer to do we do have a heart we do have a heart for [ __ ] sake Corey for [ __ ] sake I have a question why are we not showing anything upper anus unless you delete it yourself about that and mainly because there just hasn't been anything to shop our paralysis we haven't gotten a D plate body for a while so appreciate it j-rod secure with 3:34 saying i think that when you unlock a transport oxygen like a charter ship that's where you should unlock the trunk it connects to you're never gonna get to they are unlocked at this rate I don't know we'll do a few episodes and if we like a mental amount of chunks in there still haven't got anywhere close then maybe but for now I'm more like well we'll chill will show and see what happens but yeah I can totally see your point 100% but I think for now I need to just I needed to see how it goes because I can't change too much up too quickly I think that's going to cause a lot of a lot of problemos if we do problem this socket shocking I met guys that's where I'm gonna finish a string we've been streaming for three hours and we are obviously streaming tomorrow this is more just because I felt like streaming I'm so appreciate you all coming appreciate you joining in and if give a go if you want to watch a bit I'll link content and appreciate you all coming des camp man link that med clue could have been your range of votes I know I know des thank you very much may appreciate it the joy stream appreciate you coming and we'll see that
