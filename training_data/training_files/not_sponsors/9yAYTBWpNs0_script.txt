hello everybody and welcome back to another episode of my one gp2 twisted bow flipping series on this account I'm attempting to earn myself a twisted bow from scratch or to be more specific 1gp I'm giving myself exactly one year to do this if I haven't completed this challenge in time I'm gonna be giving away all of the money that I have earned on this account as well as Bonnie in the spiciest pepper and eating it for you guys on livestream this week was absolute insanity as Tom can't really believe it I found an item at that I'm not even kidding I think made me over 50 mil maybe even close to a hundred mil on a single item and it was only 2 mil so after this episode I'm gonna say things are looking pretty good but Before we start your journey and thanks to raid for sponsoring today's video so we are starting today's episode off at around 245 mill so we're pretty close to a quarter of the way to a twisted boat I mean assuming the price doesn't ever change but I gotta say that twisted bow is going somewhere just not really sure where all right so we're gonna start off with a few flips we did the last week we're gonna do Guardian boots once again and at the Bandos godsword ornament kit and we're also gonna throw in these saradomin dots or ornament kit we should already know the margin for the ornament kit and the Guardian boots as this is technically only a few minutes after the last episode ended we're also gonna do the event Oh potion with around I think of 40 GP margin we're gonna go for a cheeky ring of stone flip after the last episode it's still really cheap at 1.4 mil now someone actually told me that that could be because of a another content creator mitt mad cow who is using the rings of stone with a clan not really sure gonna still try to buy them for 1.4 mil because that's still almost half with there's no more prices we're also gonna do 16 odium wards as the margin is over 100k and the items come through pretty quickly and the very last item I'm gonna do is the ring of gods which we're gonna use the rest of our money for we're gonna go ahead and do I guess just three of them and that's gonna be it we'll check back in a few hours and see how these slips go [Music] I think our best flip this time is actually the avantco potion which we got around 1.21 and Milan not bad and we have more rings of stone but I don't know we can't sell them off so I think we're gonna quit with this item because it's just taking up too many offer spots for too long wait around thigh Manor can't profit on the band those gods over to ornament kit around 400 on the Guardian boots 530 K on the rings of God and 180 K in the OD award for a total profit of around 2 points at 7 mil ok first of all we're gonna buy some of the from the kilt and we're gonna go for 8 of them once again next year the Hydra leather has a pretty decent margin never around 100 K and the limit on it is a bit higher which I like thanks a pair we're gonna try the Quorum potion that pretty decent margin and we're gonna go ahead and buy a twenty thousand of them for around 12 of my 5 we're gonna go and do the Guardian boots again still has around a 70 km margin which isn't too bad and in our very last offer slot here we're gonna go for the dragon play body ornament kit for around 21 mill we're gonna go ahead and do two of them that is going to be it for now we'll hopefully come back with some successful flips all right today is August 24th and nothing too exciting here none of these flips really worked overnight but I did end up getting around a mill and profit or something like that we're gonna try the flip the enhanced teleport crystal once again that the emergent is way less than when it was initially released but still good for its price point it has around a 200 K margin which is really good we should be getting some new items released and this Thursday I believe there should be at least one treatable item which i think is the true very parchment with a trouve parchment we're gonna put an offer in for an anguish ornament kit flip rangers tunic as well as the brimstone ring has a pretty nice margin and that that will spend most of our money there and that'll be it for now so why is it up getting a very surprising but amazing flip on the ancient wyvern shield I just popped it in the self around 17.7 mill and I think we sold them for like eighteen point five there was just a freak kind of dip in the market or the opposite actually sold for eighteen point seven which means we got over a million profit per shield given this 3.5 million a wyvern shield as well as were primed to make around 1.2 mil on the teleport crystals which means we have the easy 4.7 mil with barely any work with a few items we're trying to sell off the master wand at the opal dragon bolts and the ring of stone that being said we're gonna try for another three ancient wyvern shields and they hope is if that happens again somehow and we're just gonna put a few more offers in to make sure our offers are full but that's probably gonna be it for today and we'll come back tomorrow okay it is the evening of August 25th and we have a few successful flips but still a bit of lackluster overall we did end up flipping more of the wyvern shields and we got around 6 under km profit I'm not terrible at infinity gloves we got third in a DK on and the a dragon plate we got 441 K which gives us around a 1.4 mil profit not amazing but it is something that we're gonna be gone for the next day or two so I'm not gonna be able to update my offers honestly just so much has happened this week we're gonna be going at a higher pace so anyway I should be back on August 28th with hopefully a substantial update alright we are back and we've been doing a bunch of flips over the last couple of days pretty consistent and hopefully we'll actually be able to successfully sell everything off for once and we'll be able to actually get a temperature check on how we're doing our best flip by far this time was the ring of nature around an 840 K profit everything else was kinda just peanuts but we still got around 1.6 million total we're also in the process of doing a item set combination flip I believe on the Carroll's armor set taking a while for that one to sell off we also have another four rings of nature we're selling off again for around a 120 or hundred thirty game profit on each one I which is pretty good so we're just gonna go ahead and buy another 8 of them next up here we're gonna put an offer in for the third age of BAM braces we're gonna go for eight of them investing around 40 mil ish in that once again we're gonna do the brimstone ring and we're gonna go ahead and do 12 of them and last we're gonna invest in the amla's crystal and we're gonna go and do 28,000 of them investing around 20 mil yes day 100 and that means we're almost 1/3 of the way through this challenge what we're gonna have to see how on track we are at the end of today's episode keeping in mind that we spent quite a bit in the first month at tiling with very little money so things should be a little more exponential from here so for today we ended up getting a few successful flips and we got a pretty decent one on the ring of nature and we're continuing to do more I get around 130 kh1 or ran 840 game profit from the ones we did buy the brimstone rings got tanked it unfortunately but we still made around 270 K the analyze crystal we got around 420 K on givin us a total profit of around 1.5 mil and still a little lackluster but that is okay we still have a few things left over here we can sell off the ring of nature as well as the third age vambrace I'm really interested to see how much money we have but when things just aren't working out that way so I'm gonna go ahead and do it just to see your armor flip and we're actually able to manually check it now we have the funds to do that and because we can actually afford two at a time as well which means we can go ahead and do a bunch of these ideally it does appear to have around a 400 or 500 k margin which is pretty good we're gonna go ahead and do two of each of them again we're just buying the individual and just fish your armor pieces combining them together and selling the completed set for a bit of a profit along with that we're gonna put in for a few more rings of nature and next up here we just price check the a in the odium org which has a margin of 50k which isn't bad considering that's only a two mil item and we'll go ahead and do seven of those and the last step here we're gonna put in for a fury ornament kit and we're gonna invest the rest of our money there and that looks pretty nice we'll come back hopefully a bit later today all right it finally happened everything is sold off we can actually see how much money we have and we ended up flipping the justice your armor set a few times today I think we did at five times in total for an average a 300 K profit on each combination which means we earned a 1.5 mil in total which means we earned around 1.5 mil in total for 67 mil invested at a time that's not too bad we also ended up getting around 350 K in profit on the OD board so let's go ahead and collect everything here we're up to 264 mill and which means we're 20 mil up from where we started today that that is a little better than I expected but we can do better than that so I went ahead and checked the emergent for the vial of blood and is actually to a GP margin so we're gonna go and do 26,000 of them which is double the buy-in limit I don't think the margin won't stay that big for that long I'm what we're still gonna give it a try now we just price checked at the gilded plate legs 50 candless isn't that good but we're gonna do seven of them next up we're going to do the malediction ward which has a pretty good margin still once again and give you seven we're gonna do the Atlanta dine potion we're gonna try to mix it up a bit with a few high volume items as well now I'm kind of thinking trying to bite the blade of salad or I'm gonna try for around 112 mil which is definitely a undercut I really don't want to over pay for it so we're just gonna keep that offer in there for maybe a couple hours and let's see if we can flip it and next appear we're gonna do these okay no chard now it's very cheap down to 380 km probably gonna continue to drop more as it's just a cosmetic item and a very common one at that but still has a 30k margin which at first price is really good and last supper we're gonna put in for a few barrows teleports they volume for this really isn't that much but sometimes big offers come through for them as we're gonna go ahead and do the annacarl one and the cemetery teleport and we'll be back a bit later so we had some amazing flips at the tail end of August 28th and the main one being the vial of blood getting the almost a 200 GP margin on a fairly inexpensive high-volume item is amazing we got around two million profit off of that we also got around 350 K on the yielded plate legs and a really nice margin on the just this year chest guard have around 1450 K we've sold one so far and were primed to sell another four of them so just there we made about 3mm profit around 2.8 milk and put in a few different offers overnight but it's kind of the calm before the storm because tomorrow I have the new items come out and I got to tell you something incredible happens let's skip ahead to tomorrow and start flipping that the brand new items so with the new content update at this Thursday there were two new items added to the game the true verb parchment or the trouver parchment and the Swift sword now the Swift sword is too expensive as far as LMS points to go and to actually be in the game yet but the true verb parchment is and our first margin check is 1 million GP I'm not quite sure the volume of this yet but we can go ahead and start buying them for hopefully around 1 mil ok so we did have a few things over night time as well just go ahead and recap on they just cease your armor set we're getting a 400 K profit and so that's 1.2 mil on me just this year chest guard and with the other items were looking to sell off including the Serb helm and the dwarf weed and the infinity gloves as well as the enhanced teleport crystal so we're gonna go ahead and put a few more offers in but the main focus is on the new items ok we got our very first parchment and we're gonna try selling it off for 1.9 mil and which is still around a 800 to 900 K profit because 890 would be the exact amount and if we sell this off we'll get our money back a there we go we sold off her very first at revere parchment for one to 0.99 mil amazing we got another one also so we're gonna hopefully finally get a profit from this item we've so far just broken even there we go we got six of the travail parchment hopefully we can sell these off because that is an amazing margin how we aren't doing a few other things at the same time here including some armor though crossbows some high-volume items but they're not that important everything seems kind of inadequate compared to the margin working on this new item there we go guys we sold off six of them that is so good actually we did eight and now that I think about it or eight eight hundred ninety came margin on each one which means that is over seven million profit just on that single flip that is really exciting we're gonna continue with this item as long as humanly possible as long as the margin stays relatively good we're gonna do it just to keep track of things I'm gonna put a counter in the top right of the screen because it gets pretty confusing as I'm doing this in a very hectic manner trying to get the best margin possible and not worrying about the recording too much ok the margin has shifted slightly up to 1990 into 1260 still a really good margin I think we got another two of the parchments man these items are coming through really quickly I think we've flipped another four of them after around a three mil profit I worked about like ten point five mil or something already on a single item in under an hour like I said the emergent has changed again we've sold another two for a slightly different margin I think we got one point four mil on these two right now hopefully it settles down a little bit okay another at trooper of parchment flip but coming in for a round a 700k not bad oh my goodness we bought one four five mil I wanted to do a price check on the item again and oh boy I don't know about that one we may lose a bit of money on this although it didn't even sell for three mil which means we most likely can maybe get a insane margin on these right now I'm gonna try sell him for forty nine hundred but we may have to undercut that a bit this is really dicey well look at that we ended up selling three of them for forty four hundred that is so good that was actually closer to around 400 improvi considering the very first one we lost about 400 K on as we price checked it at 5 mil I've never seen a margin and item be that large and this cheap Sierra I'm four point five million profit off of what we got so far and we have it two more attempting to sell for forty three hundred and more buying all the time okay unfortunately that margin disappeared fairly quickly we've two more recently around twenty seven hundred or twenty six hundred each which means I think we made another 1.4 mil and so far and we're selling off even more for 2,700 okay so they're selling off fairly quickly I think we have another 600 K profit or something like that it is pretty hard to keep track of all of this as the prices are changing all the time I'm doing a price check occasionally and we are flipping other items at the same time here but there's just so much going on I don't think it's worth tracking that but we actually are doing pretty well on some of these other items ok first appear we had a nether of five of the parchments sold and I think we actually made about three mil improvin off of those getting around a 600 k margin we must be above twenty melon profit and again it's only been about three hours since I started doing this there we go another four to report when sold for an 2.4 million profit it just keeps going we are flipping some other things like ancestral were investing like a hundred the amount of money okay we just sold another five parchments for another 2.4 million profit I believe and we have more coming through hopefully soon we'll be able to do an actual check on how much money we have I think next time we'll be able to sell everything off hopefully my god were up to 274 mil cash that is so amazing okay there we go we have sold everything off I believe we made around three mil on the parchment but we can actually go ahead and see much money we're at I have no idea because I've just been focused on flipping the Trouper parchment all day but let's go ahead and claim everything I think we actually been doing pretty well on some of the other items as well I got a 1 mil margin on a just is your face guard but oh look at that we're above 300 mil or up to 307 mil that we just shot up there that is legitimately weeks worth of progress done in hours look at this we just bought 10 of the parchments per 1,500 and sold them for 2200 we just made 6.9 mil on this single item we sold 10 more afraid a lower margin but that's still 3 mil there at 10 mil in profit off of the parchments and everything is sold off so we directly see how much money right now this is a bit later in the day but the margin is still wild extremely uncertain but really I'm taking advantage of that and we're up did 317 mill we just made another 10 mil this has been by far the best flippin opportunity I have had on this account and we're gonna continue on with that we're doing that price checks more frequently now we're buying them for twenty six seven eight and selling them for 2200 that's still a really good margin of around 450 K it still does not appear that there are any Swift swords in the game right now otherwise I may have actually tried one of them next up here we have a 7 point 2 mil profit on more of the pages just an absolutely amazing margin and we have bought and sold a lot of them and may not leave them in overnight as that will be a bit risky but and I'm feeling kind of risky now everything's just been working out famous last words I guess but you know what screw it let's go ahead and put an offer in at low-balling the pages overnight at around 1100 so before bed we're gonna fill up our offer slots and what an amazing day I think that's probably the most profitable day of Philippian I've had ever or lease on this account as we're gonna leave again the trooper parchments in overnight as well as a few other flips but again all seems like peanuts compared to our main boy the parchment okay this is the morning and we didn't end up buying any overnight but we woke up pretty early and we've already flipped another 6.1 mil worth of the parchments as well as we're getting some pretty good margins on the elder maul and the cape of skulls the other models going a little crazy because of the potential update that might get to it we're gonna do a price check on the item down to two mil into 1613 still good considering it's been out for a day and a half now it's not that bad well look at that a ton more money was made we did so many of the parchments and the merchant is less like maybe 300 400 K is what I was getting I just flipped so many of them I think we got a flip of 4.6 mill another flip of 5.8 mill and another one at 1.7 which in total I think we got twelve point two million profit which I still can't believe that it's just so much money for so little work look at all those parchments in error look at all those parchments in our GE history along with a ton of other items which honestly is probably making this a fair bit of money as well okay so it's the end of the night and I actually did buy Swift sword or at least a swift blade I should say oh my god have you been saying Swift sword this entire time yeah well anyway it's a 1 mil margin and I'm gonna leave it in overnight it's such a bad idea like I don't know why I'm doing this but I'm just on such a good luck streak even if I lost like 10 mil it's that it still would not matter and who knows maybe that will do one of those crazy movements where it'll drop and then go wildly up I don't know where you can take a risk on it that being said I should drop it down to just one sword and we also have around 18 of the parchments but we're gonna hopefully sell those overnight a little worried about that but anyway guys let's wake up tomorrow and it's gonna be the last day let's see how much money we make on this and we'll see our total profit for today's episode okay it is the morning of August 31st the last day of the month and well I want to show you guys something look at that oh my god that was such a mistake it was for 15 min I could have sold it for but somebody put it in for 1500 and I literally just lost 17 milk on the swift blade plus probably little bit more on the trooper parchment that being said I still think we made a ton of money but anyway let's go ahead and collect everything that is what I'm really interested in let's see how much money we ended to make um in the episode keep in mind we just lost 17 mil oh my god 350 militarily made a hundred mil this week probably eighty of it in the last day or two and we would have been 17 mil higher but we [ __ ] up anyway guys that's gonna be it for today's episode I really hope you enjoyed it was a crazy week I don't think we're gonna have anything like this in the near future but really getting on these new items early can be so profitable and it worked out quite well for me anyway guys that thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed and I will see you next time
