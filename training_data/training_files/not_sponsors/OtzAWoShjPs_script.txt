[Music] no we missed it by one second and i forgot my book of the dead but i don't need to know that do they [Music] yes boys we did it the five-man speedrun task not because of me let's be honest now i'm no longer deadweight in a team there's a task for a nightmare solo of 16 minutes that's a grandmaster alongside another grandmaster of terrible parents where you're not allowed to let the parasites heal 100. i feel like this is a two-for-one deal if i can get one done i'll automatically have the other one i feel like that went okay but i mean how are you supposed to keep track of 16 minutes of just hitting the bus hey i got both nice terrible parent and the speed challenge i'm a nightmare grandmaster boys and girls finishing off with the perfect nightmare bit of a contradiction but yeah and that is a nightmare boss completed well apart from the kill count but kill counts don't count let's be honest i have not been to hydra in a very long time and i'm pleased to see that task because there are two grand masters here all right knocked out all the masters while relearning the boss that's a 15 kill trip completed so for the grandmaster tasks i have to kill the alchemical hydra in less than one minute 20 and also under 10 hit points using full darroch's fold directs first i have to stay under 10 hit points the entire time so no food required we're just gonna send it technically all damage is avoidable at the hydra so in theory this isn't too difficult [Music] it might be a bit difficult [Music] i'm not letting that acid hit me come on we're doing laps no pressure yeah definitely didn't crack under the pressure whatsoever the hydra speed task requires me to get under one minute 20. so we're going to be on two spellbooks vengeancing up and then switching to the artia spell book to summon a thrall one of the most important things with the alchemical hydra speedrun is to kill it at the right time i need to kill it just before the vents activate so it spawns at the perfect time [Music] see how some of my thrall it comes across activate straight away we get a bow hit for full damage that's how it's done oh my god we're hitting huge 80 into an 82 let's go okay i need to prepare and i'm gonna use my dragon claws on this one big specks let's go vengeance this phase come on hit me hit me please big hits come on i think that's the one and do we get it such a long wait for the death animation and we do 164 seconds quicker than needed we're a speedy boy out here and that is the alchemical hydra completed gary goyles yes please the grow test guardians have a bunch of tasks associated including one grandmaster this is another boss that i've barely done in my entire runescape career so you're gonna have to get to grips with it at the start 149 is my pb but i need a 120 for the grand master task all right done my 15 kill trip training camp let's go for this speed run once again i'm using luna and arceus spell books upon entry to the fight i'm summoning a thrall but then switching back to arceus so i can cast a death charge when dawn is about to go down and then switch into my melee vengeance up let the avengers proc underneath the gargoyle and dds spec huge so i can skip an entire special phase when dawn dies that death charge kicks in as i switch into my melee gear go on to the rcs spell book summon a thrall my 85 becomes 100 spec get the melee thrall out then i can declaw spec and vengeance it is all going on in this speed run yo please don't noodle come on zythe yes 119. hey we did it the grand master task wait have i already done that or did i just not get the pop-up i've done it grotesque guardians speed runner so that's all the grotesque guardians done except for the kill count that doesn't count baby [Music] i'm literally doing storyboard tv of my own accounts because i got no friends sad story made all done though kill count don't count well it kind of does and i am doing the kill count tasks i'm just doing them slowly behind the scenes because they're just a bit boring not that interesting just a massive 400 hour time sink unfortunately i've decided to venture back to the reset arena and i'm gonna go for the four-minute grand master gauntlet speedrunner to complete it upv i'm 11 seconds off if i can match that hun left with my best prep time we will be in business [Music] kick him ah i'm just gonna use the stuff please say that's killed it no come on yes i think that was fast and we did it grand master speed run task seven seconds under perfect that is the gauntlet completed so let's have a little look what we've got left for the medium and the heart a medium there's one task left what could it possibly be oh would you look at that my favorite combat boss hi and welcome to my maximum efficiency combat achievements temporos guide first up you want to get yourself the minimum points possible to count for a kill count secondly you're gonna run all the way to this square this is really important you don't want any noobs interrupting you as you're trying to afk your way to the end of the game don't forget to subscribe for some more quality guides coming soon the hardest task in combat achievements completed and i'm happy to say farming mission is over the combat achievements farming extravaganza get in now that i've completed the hard tier of combat achievements that's huge because i can access private instances in god wars and that means i can start getting to work on the grand master god wars tasks there are nine god wars grandmaster tasks and we're going to catch them all as every single god wars boss there is an endurance task general grad or is to kill him 15 times without leaving there's also tasks for taking absolutely no damage during a kill and no damage from the minions in back to back kills i've got no idea how you do the melee flicking [ __ ] so i'm a wizard let's go come on please finish it we're actually on for the no damage taking ground master here i did it i left the minions alive from the last kill so they're off tick at the start perfect the minions haven't hit me yet so i can go for the back to back no damage kills off the bodyguards catch this oh no wait that was the boss not the minions i haven't failed it yet oh come on catch i'm missing all the flicks no not good the rangers got me that's annoying i had it all set off and everything that is a 15 kill trip at bandors completed never actually done the mage method before but it seemed pretty calm to be honest for my last bandos task i must kill graudor without taking any damage from the minions twice in a row but it doesn't say anything about damage from gradle okay time for my stupid plan i'm not gonna learn to flick this properly i'm just gonna flick between the minions and let bandos hit me and what will be will be hopefully he doesn't hit too hard [Music] [Music] that has to be it i don't think i miss a single flick there although i didn't get crushed by bandos yes the fence does matter grad all completed hello and welcome to the try not to pee challenge we're doing 50s iliana casey in one trip also known as smashing purple sweets during this i'm going to go for animal whisperer which is to do a kill of xiliana without taking any damage shouldn't be too hard with flicking yo i own [ __ ] flow sick but you know this bring it back like my old kicks all my files from 99.06 oh [ __ ] come on that's gonna be the final kill there we go grandmaster's done peach conjurer without conjuring a single peach let's go ziliano is probably the easiest godwars dungeon boss greater demons a trip to zamarak god wars there are two grandmaster tasks for krill one is an endurance one of 20 kills and the other is to flick between all the minions for one kill well my clients crashed again right at the end of this krill kill so hopefully none of these minions hit me the moment of truth did it work yes it did grand master while logged out the game nice that just leaves the ash collector task which is a 20 kill trip so for this task i had to learn a brand new method tebow zami all you have to do run around the room a bit the minions hit you and the boss never lays a finger on you took a few kills to get the hand off but it's definitely the way to go for the 20 kill trip that was a lot easier than i thought it'd be actually 20 kills in one zombie trip very nice the real grand master task is getting a [ __ ] slayer task of a fancies i've already killed criara with a salamander so the only task to do is the 30 kill trip yay an armadillo hilt but it's six mil how tragic what i got an armadillo helm as well my look here is insane for criara i was using chins on the minion a pretty standard method and then when i ran out of chins i just decided to pre-flick using a t-bow try and conserve some prayer because i wasn't sure what i was gonna run out of first and that is the final kill of the trip feather hunter i am officially a grand master of god wars dungeon all tasks done so for criara i've completed it oh wait kill count but that doesn't count my grandmaster log is starting to become filled in the only things i have left are the raiding dungeons and you guessed it [Music]
