obvious one russia but only sweden was able to form an empire and tightly control the entire region for almost a century this raises the question how was Sweden able to consolidate its hold in Scandinavia and triumph against its neighbors namely Denmark which at one point loosely controlled Sweden Norway and parts of Finland in order to understand Sweden's assent to Empire status we need to travel back to the end of the 14th century when Sweden along with Norway were ruled by the king of Denmark and what was known as the Kalmar Union it would take more than a century for the Swedes under King Gustav the first Vasa to successfully break away from Danish rule in 1523 approximately three years later who solved the first embraced Protestantism but it's not because he wanted to get rid of his wife rather he needed funding for his emergent Kingdom after waging one costly war after the next in opposition to Denmark Gustav needed an answer to the question of mounting debt Lutheranism provided a convenient and somewhat Viking solution as it precipitated the confiscation of church properties and gave him access to an unprecedented source of funds with his economic situation improving Gustav would need to likewise improve his military if he wanted to fulfill his grand ambition to control the Baltic Rim and taking money from Swedish churches proved to be an unsustainable source of income these problems were solved by the development of the merchant class and the capture of Russian ports by the middle of the sixteenth century the Swedish military and the Swedish population as a whole needed a leader that would inspire and provide the military with a vision to fulfill as you may have guessed from the thumbnail of our video this leader was none other than Gustavus Adolphus degre who had near single-handedly transformed Sweden into an empire born in 1594 Gustavus or as he was known in Swedish King Gustav ii Adolphe in herre the Swedish throne at only 16 at an age when most of us are concerned about getting a driver's license Gustavus had to worry about three ongoing Wars he inherited against Denmark Poland and Russia there was no limit to Gustavus courage he often directed his troops on the front line disregarding his own safety and thanks to the example he set and his emphasis on instilling discipline in his troops Gustavus found success in two of the three wars he inherited even before the after mention conflicts were over he had involved Sweden in one of the bloodiest Wars in European history the 30 Years War this massive conflict was the result of religious disputes in the Holy Roman Empire between Protestants and Catholics and in 1630 Sweden joined the side of the Protestants inflating what was originally a widespread religious revolt into a complete European total war before we examine Sweden's success in the 30 Years War we must first understand Gustavus military innovations as we described in our video why did soldiers fight in lines European armies during the early modern era were deployed in squares of pikemen and Musketeers until the widespread adoption of linear tactics a system developed by Maurice of Nassau while maurices linear system was more effective than the pike square which preceded it it was not perfect Gustavus would fine-tune this method and his model would remain in use until the French Revolution almost entirely unchanged Gustavus reforms did not stop there he improved logistics systems developing the General Staff reorganizing cavalry units and professionalizing artillerymen these reforms along with his martial ability would bring him repeated victories in the 30 Years War so many in fact that Napoleon considered him one of the greatest generals in history Gustavus himself commanded the Swedes successfully at several battles during the war most notably at Brighton felled in 1631 and l√ºtzen in 1632 the latter of which resulted in his death even with Gustavus gone however this sharmee continued to be successful on the battlefield and in 1655 when the 30 Years War ended the kingdom of Sweden controlled several small German states after the death of Gustavus Sweden was in a precarious position due to the incompetence of Gustavus successors Christina and Charles the 10th Gustav despite their ineffectiveness the Swedish military was still effective and in the 1650s Sweden would again go on to win victories against its rivals Poland Denmark and Russia but as the 18th century drew nearer Sweden's military dominance in northern Europe and Eastern Europe would begin to decline just as many European nations adopted Swedish military tactics this ultimately eliminated Sweden's long-standing martial advantage although Sweden did participate in more limited conflicts during the reign of charles xi who held the throne during the later parts of the 17th century most of the king's energy during this time was spent on reforming the bureaucracy and nobility of the country charles the 11th most notable accomplishment was his conversion of the swedish government from a semi parliamentary state to a near absolute monarchy which allowed him to reform the country's budgetary process and thus provide more funds for future Wars charles xi died at the age of 41 leaving his 15 year old son charles the 12th as king and it was at this point where sweden would never fully recover a mere three years after charles the 12th was crowned the enemies of sweden including russia and poland decided to take advantage of the king's inexperience and declared war this conflict which would be known as the great northern war would last over 20 years sweden was initially successful in war but the tide turned quickly after the disasters Battle of Poltava which resulted in the capture of almost the entire swedish army to add insult to injury the danish decided to make several incursions into swedish territory it was while fighting the danes that charles himself was killed in battle in 1718 approximately a decade after Poltava the great northern war continued until 1721 but the Swedes saw no further successes when the war ended Sweden had lost ingria Estonia and Livonia to the Russians and several small Scandinavian territories to the Danes and it was in that year 1721 that marked the end of the Swedish Empire Sweden would continue to play a role in European affairs throughout the 18th and 19th centuries but its role would remain a minor one due to continued defeat at the hands of its neighbors by the end of the Napoleonic Wars Sweden took a stance of neutrality which persisted during both of the world wars armchair for a 10% discount on your first website or domain purchase thanks for watching I'd like to thank the arms
