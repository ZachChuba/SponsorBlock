hi I just wanted to say two things first this video is full of spoilers for the movie Joker which should not be a huge surprise since this video is about the movie Joker but still a figured it was worth saying second at the end of this video I'm gonna talk about a couple things that are important to me so even if you don't usually watch the entire video I'd really appreciate it if you did this time okay before we get started I've got to give Joker some credit Joaquin Phoenix did a phenomenal job with Arthur from the voice to the mannerisms to the laugh he completely sold the character and deserves all the praise he's getting Hildur guna thought their score was also amazing and finally the production design and cinematography did that thing that all good Batman movies need to do they made Gotham City into a character seems like a cliche but it is legitimately very important especially in this movie and I think Joker handled Gotham City very well with all that being said I had quite a few problems with Joker almost all of which stemmed from what I would argue was a pretty shallow script Joker takes swings at some complicated topics but I think it misses almost all of them from mental health to corruption to society I think Joker raises many issues that it is not prepared to adequately address and maybe my biggest individual issue with Joker concerns Arthur himself he holds extreme views which he uses to justify his actions which would usually be a good thing I want two protagonists with strong beliefs like Batman and especially if the protagonist is an antihero like how Han believes you gotta look out for yourself or even a villain like how Thanos hold some pretty strong beliefs about the universe and balance it is not a problem that Arthur believes that the rich and powerful are making life worse for the rest of us and it is not a problem that he takes that belief to the extreme and uses that belief to justify murder and inciting a riot that's good like it isn't a good way for a real person to act but it's good that Arthur has that reaction because it raises interesting questions however I believe Joker fails when it comes - doing anything interesting with those questions it feels content with saying that people are bad and Arthur is bad and maybe he's right who knows who cares Joker doesn't spend much time examining Arthur's beliefs critically outside of Murray at the very end of the movie very briefly no one stands up to Arthur challenges his beliefs and I'm not saying that every movie needs to be a debate where opposing views are presented and a winner is decided but it does make the story pretty flat if the protagonist does not meet with any real opposition no ideological foil it feels shallow like let's look at Murray's exchange with Arthur for one second the most complete attempt Joker makes it calling Arthur out Murray says are you finished I mean it's so much self-pity Arthur it sounds like you're making excuses for killing those young men not everybody and I'll tell you this not everybody is awful my dating ro is pretty great that's a good point and I wish one Joker spent more time with it could be said that Arthur is using self-pity as an excuse to act without consequences however Murray is the wrong messenger to deliver that message and this is where Joker's shallowness becomes an issue because in Joker everyone is awful like cartoonishly awful the woman on the bus is rude to Arthur even though he's just trying to make the kid laugh Arthur's social worker doesn't listen to him those kids steal Arthur's sign and beat him up for seemingly no reason Arthur's boss blames Arthur for what happened to the sign even though why would Arthur steal a going-out-of-business sign Arthur's co-worker lies about giving our third the gun Thomas Wayne is a jerk he hits Arthur and possibly lies about being Arthur's father Murray makes fun of Arthur an aspiring stand-up comedian at an open mic who clearly has some sort of mental health or neurological issues on national television and Arthur's mom may have lied to Arthur about his father and on top of all of that and I know had dumbness sounds but society seems to have left Arthur behind the mental health program is shut down there's a garbage strike super rats and out-of-touch plutocrat is running for mayor and the citizens of Gotham has become a violent mob everyone is awful and that gives Joker an excuse not to question Arthur's beliefs it's too simple an interesting movie would feature a more complex society and it's easy to compare Joker to the two movies that it's clearly borrowing a lot of its themes and visuals and actors from taxi driver and the King of Comedy both Scorsese masterpieces Vout and out of touch loner and society however I think both of those movies do something very specific the Joker does not something that helps to explore the beliefs of the protagonists their values and challenges them in an interesting way so that brings me to my one small change I believe Joker could easily introduce a character who is not awful doesn't have to be perfect just someone that can call him on his BS we can use that character to learn more about Arthur and society get a more nuanced view on all of the themes of the movie in taxi driver this character is Betsy played by civil Shepard the Palantine campaign worker who Travis quarts goes on a date with and then embarrasses himself in front of taxi driver is about this dirty disgusting version of New York that Travis hates and wants to clean up and that belief isn't necessarily held by Betsy but she is also working for a politician who wants to make changes so she represents the idea of change and her and Travis get along until she exposes the contradiction at the heart of Travis he thinks New York is a dirty disgusting mess that he also participates in he takes her to the pornographic movie theater on a date and that highlights the fact that Travis takes part in this system that he believes needs to be destroyed that's why he can't go on a date with and have a normal relationship with Betsy it's the internal contradiction of trash miss pickle and you can only get at that with a character like Betsy who exists outside of that world and can highlight Travis's contradiction the same can be said of Dianne Abbott's Rita Keene in the king of comedy in the king of comedy Robert DeNiro plays Rupert pumpkin an aspiring stand-up comedian who is obsessed with talk-show host Jerry Langford and wants to be on his show and Rupert both desperately wants to be a stand-up comedian but does not want to do the work necessary to be a stand-up comedian he's very determined when it comes to things like sitting in offices and making sure people get tapes that he's not determined when it comes to working in comedy clubs and getting there the way all the rest of the comedians do he instead likes to pretend he's already a part of that world and that's where Diane Abbott's Rita comes in an old friend from high school who Rupert goes on a date with and during the date he lies to her about being friends with Jerry where a character like Sandra Bernards masha exists within this deluded celebrity obsessed world Rita exists outside of it and when Rupert does something pretty bizarre like goes to Jerry Lankford's house unannounced Reid is able to call out how strange that is she is a necessary reality check who can call Rupert on his contradiction so if I could make one small change to Joker I would introduce the character into the movie well that's not exactly right I would not unintrusive der Sophie played by sassy beats would not spend most of the movie as a hallucination she would be actually dating Arthur for those who don't remember or people who haven't seen Joker but don't care sophie is a seemingly single mother who lives in Arthur's building after a brief friendly interaction Arthur follow Sophie to her job at the bank then she shows up unannounced at Arthur's apartment is remarkably cool with being stalked goes with Arthur to his open mic night goes on another date with Arthur meets Arthur at the hospital and even does other things but then Arthur goes to Sophie's apartment and it is revealed that Arthur was imagining their interaction the nice girl didn't actually like him cute dumb flashback then maybe he kills her who knows it's an incredibly dumb moment because Joker trades an interesting character who also happens to be one of two female main characters and the single main character of color for a lame reveal it is both not worth it and is not particularly effective so I'm gonna walk you through how making Sophie not a hallucination would address quite a few of Joker's issues and give you an idea of what this alternate version of Joker would look like so you have to start with the meet-cute first thing we need to slightly change the first encounter between Sophie and Arthur since they are actually going to be dating there needs to be some connection Arthur needs to demonstrate his value to Sophie show her that he can be a good guy give her a reason to like him besides just holding an elevator I think this one's easy Arthur can use his clown talents to cheer up Sophie's kid he's good with kids he does seem to be a genuinely good clown so Arthur makes the kids smile and brimming with confidence Arthur asks Sophie out to dinner she accepts first date Arthur takes Sophie to a comedy club but in this version he is not performing they are just there to see a comedian who is in this case Gary Gulman a comedian I love and have been following since the Last Comic Standing days his HBO special the Great Depression so funny end of non plug and it's a good date like in real life with the right comedian comedy club can be a great first date and especially for Arthur because this is where he spends a lot of his time people know him and Arthur shares his dream of being a comedian with Sophie and she's encouraging maybe he can do it someday now there is a balance Arthur's fired things around him are going poorly but Sophie's giving Arthur some hope now second date I like the idea of Sophie going to the open mic with Arthur maybe he bombs in the beginning but not quite as badly it goes fine and Sophie's supportive he just needs practice and Arthur kinda gets that he's doing okay but then we get the Thomas Wayne revelation and before Arthur confronts his mom he tells Sophie Sophie tells him to drop it take it from a single mother no good will come of this so if we brings perspective to Arthur he needs to move forward but Arthur realize he can't help himself he tells his mother she ends up in the hospital and while Arthur is in the hospital Arthur's video shows up on the Murray Franklin show and not to nitpick not unlike my podcast mostly nitpicking please subscribe this isn't a viral video kind of situation I don't think viral videos were thing in the early 80s I don't even kind of understand how that happens at all let's have Sophie have submitted the tape from the open mic maybe Murray has some sort of contest for aspiring stand-up comedians where if you send their video in and they do well Murray will have them on the show she sees Arthur set and she's like oh maybe this is good enough so she secretly sends this tape to Murray Franklin seems like a nice thing and it just seems more plausible but Arthur sees his video on the show and he's made a fool of so he blames Sophie they can get in a fight and she leaves and then Arthur goes and confronts Thomas Wayne he's spinning out of control Thomas tells Arthur there's mom was crazy this makes Arthur feel even worse also let's have some people recognize Arthur on the street from the Murray Franklin show and make fun of him show that there are some consequences to him being on TV but then Arthur gets a call from the Murray Franklin show and learns that Murray wants to have him on this is huge what an opportunity this will be the first kiss between Arthur and Sophie Sophie and Arthur worked together on new material it's good stuff Arthur's happy but then Arthur finds the picture with Thomas Wayne on it so Arthur continues to investigate his mom he learns that she was committed to the asylum but he blames Thomas Wayne Wayne must have institutionalized Arthur's mother to keep the secret and Arthur becomes even more obsessed with Thomas he writes jokes about killing Thomas and Arthur extrapolates that out and blames society for everything that happened to his mother and him then Arthur comes to Wayne Manor he acts weird around Bruce and Alfred and unser comes home and we get this big confrontation between Sophie and our Sir Arthur walks into the apartment find Sophie holding the joke book what the hell is this where'd you find that I had an idea I wanted to write down but what is Thomas Wayne get when he crosses a society full of people he treats like trash he gets what he deserves that's not knock-knock it's the police mrs. way and your husband Thomas was killed by a drunk driver Thomas Wayne took everything from my family and you have a chance to start over to be something and you're gonna throw it all away I will never be anything because of him blame Thomas Wayne blame society blame the rats blame me you don't understand what it's like to be abandoned to be on your own gets so much self-pity but it's just an excuse for you to do whatever you want so selfish and then Sophie leaves that's all we need Joker never examines this point of view Arthur definitely has problems he's alone he's broke has some sort of serious neurological general mental health issues but I mean like single mother in the 80s in the era of the welfare queen that's not easy Sophie is truly marginalized the kind of person that society really leaves behind but Sophie has a child to take care of so she can't just pity herself Joker's about a lot of things mental illness society guns like if Joker's about anything it's a movie about a desperate loner who was given a gun and immediately becomes a violent murderer it's too much to talk about now but look up the trigger pulls the finger gives Joker new meaning that I don't hear discussed nearly enough but at its core Joker is about a man who cannot move forward because he believes he is a victim taxi driver and king of calm and he worked where Joker didn't because they were able to take their protagonist to task call him on his contradiction because both characters are contradictions Travis Bickle hates the ugliness in New York City but he also participates in it Rupert wants to be famous without doing any of the work he's determined yet entitled Arthur is the same kind guy albeit a little more clumsily he wants to be popular in loved like Rupert as of an inspired the fantasy but he doesn't want to do stand-up Arthur just wants attention but he doesn't act we wanted because when Arthur gets the opportunity the chance to be on national TV he doesn't see it as an opportunity he sees it as a problem yeah Murray's a jerk to Arthur but Arthur is still a wannabe stand-up comedian who's about to go on a national talk show Arthur and the movie never consider the fact that this could be a huge win for Arthur Arthur immediately decides that this is a bad thing his life is over and yeah Arthur did murder those guys on the train but the police don't seem to have that much on him Arthur could either just ignore the police and hope he doesn't get convicted or he could explain a situation claimed self-defense which it's kind of true except for that third guy but hey maybe just say that you were fighting with them or something listen I'm not suggesting that Arthur should lie or anything like that to the police but he does have options this doesn't need to be the end of his life we need a character to give Arthur that perspective present him with a choice use his appearance to get revenge on someone who wronged him in the past or ignore that and use the appearance to get a better future Arthur chooses the past and that sends him down a self-destructive path that ends with him murdering a talk show host and maybe inciting a riot although it's unclear how much of a part of that Arthur actually played seems like the riots were gonna happen with or without him but there was an alternative an alternative that sophie was perfectly positioned to present an alternative that would call Joker out that would take a stand against his self-pity and the self-pity of that loner type character that taxi driver in King of Comedy and now Joker used to justify their actions unfortunately every single character in Joker was either mean to Arthur or lying to him there was no one to present this alternative and instead of using Sophie to present the opposing viewpoints and introduce grey area into an otherwise black-and-white story Joker wastes Sophie on a surface level Fight Club style twist that was honestly pretty transparent from the beginning oh really important to me here's the other one if you're watching this video before November 2nd 2019 on November 2nd 2019 I will be participating in an extra life charity stream if you're not familiar with extra life it's a gaming marathon where gamers video and board get together
