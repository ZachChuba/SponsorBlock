oh hello you know i've been thinking if there's one card type that's significantly less good in commander than other formats it's planeswalkers right with not just one but three players able to throw creatures in to attack them or even fire off removal spells they're a lot easier to keep under control that doesn't stop them from being great cards to run though some of the effects available on them are powerful and they can often tilt the balance of power and the pace of play in a completely different way to any other permanent type in the game but which are the best ones for commander what do i recommend well sit tight and i'll take you through my picks for the 10 planeswalkers that i think are the best for the commander format it's very different from the ones that you might say are the best for 1v1 60 card formats but first a noise blaring constantly raycons think of your now let me just get one thing out of the way i'm talking about the best planeswalkers for being in the 99 so sadly lord wind grace is not going to make my top 10. despite being a very powerful commander for land's matter strategies what makes wind grace so good is having him in the command zone available to be cast multiple times per game if you're building a wind grace deck then sure he's very very strong and can accelerate your game plan very quickly but in the 99 though i don't feel he makes this list and so what do i feel does well let's take a look coming in at number 10 is vivian reed vivian reed is always good in a game of commander artifacts and enchantments are some of the strongest game pieces and it's rare there won't be a target for her negative 3 ability if there aren't any at the time you play her then no worry take a survey of the battlefield flying creatures are the bane of many a plane's walker and more than that are at the heart of many popular voltron strategies being able to destroy a creature with flying is incredibly useful for a plane's walker and so vivian reed can usually come down and thin out the threats to her continued existence if you think you can get more than one turn out of her or you're comfortably ahead then her plus one is also pretty great being able to look through four cards to take a land or creature keeps the cards flowing and puts her at a respectable sixth loyalty her ultimate is gravy and probably won't come up that often pretty nice to get indestructible vigilant trampling creatures permanently though all in all vivian gets irrelevant removal ability plus card advantage and comes in at a pretty high five loyalty so go give her a go number nine is the collector of tails herself tamio just because one tamio didn't make it onto my list doesn't mean she didn't make it at all tamio collector of tales is the first war of the spark walker to make this list and well let me tell you she won't be the last okay they're all busted and anyway cameo is a four mana planeswalker that comes with five loyalty her static means that spells and abilities opponents control can't cause you to discard cards or sacrifice permanence while that does mean a torment of hail fire will always burn you out quicker than playing theros beyond death standard it's one of the only weaknesses of this card the static is a great way to get around aristocrats decks big on grave pact or the new tiny bones commander there are plenty of these effects in edh and having some immunity to them even for a turn or two can be a great thing her plus one ability will rarely draw you a card unless you can rearrange the top of your library but come on you're in simic you're telling me you're not playing cards like sylvan library murray's guile cavalier of gales and other brainstorm effects what it does do though is let you fill your graveyard to take advantage of the many recursion effects available to these colors and what do you know her negative three ability is regrowth it's not hard to keep walkers growing with proliferation and other effects when playing simic and chances are you can get value out of cameo before she eventually is taken down it's also possible to really take advantage of that repeatable recursion to rebuy powerful removal and bounce effects ensuring other planeswalkers can get to ultimate territory quickly scary all right let's just get this out of the way now number eight is to fairy time raveller that's right speaking of cards that can make the rest of your game plan better look who it is yes we all know this has been a grown inducing card in all formats that he's been playable in and as such commander is not immune from his powerful abilities the one to really get excited about an edh is his static which reads each opponent can cast spells only anytime they can cast a sorcery if you're a fan of grand abolisher title barracuda or dosan the falling leaf chances are you're wanting to pull off a sweet combo and have nobody interrupt you well to fairies throwing his hat into the ring is another way to make that happen there is some downside of course if another player tries to combo off your other opponents won't be able to stop them either but all in all this teferi is very strong in decks that want this effect his abilities aren't too shabby either his negative 3 bounces an artifact creature enchantment to its owner's hand and draws a card this can bounce something relevant or just reset your commander that has been stuck with dark steel mutation his plus one is on the surface pretty underwhelming but being able to use your seven mana to play to fairy and hold up wrath of god until the last possible moment is pretty sweet number seven is nissa who shakes the world when it comes to edh there's nothing better than doubling your mana whether you're a fan of mirari's wake doubling cube or just a good old-fashioned gauntlet of power there are plenty of decks that really enjoy this effect one of my favorites is actually regal behemoth actually and getting the monarch in commander is so sweet that said being able to get a mana doubler that also untaps one of the lands you use to pay for it that's a pretty good deal well that's what nissa who shakes the world can offer you this is a five mana five loyalty walker and her plus one untaps a non-creature land you control putting three plus one plus one counters on it it becomes a vigilant hasty creature that's still a land this is great for protecting nissa and making her effectively cost for mana however when you throw her static ability which adds additional green every time you tap a forest for mana that's potentially going to make her cost an effective 3 mana the turn she comes down and it's all upwards from there nissa requires you to either be in mono green or a green based two or three color deck that is playing all the basic typed dual lands think scattered groves stomping grounds canopy vista etc provided you can support her though she can take you from turn five to turn seven the turn you play her and when you untap you'll potentially be on turn 12 mana wise all the while she can keep animating your lands or if you'd rather she didn't she doesn't have to that ability is up to one up to you her ultimate shouldn't come up too often if your play group has enough answers but if it does being able to give your lands permanent indestructible while ramping out every last forest from your deck is game-winning to say the least coming in at number six is tezerette the seeker tesserath the seeker has been a powerful plane's walker from the day he was printed and it's safe to say that nothing will ever take that away from him his plus one ability is ramp in blue untapping two artifacts can really bump up your mana production especially if one of them is a basalt monolith or a soul ring the fact it's on a plus one is very good too as it'll mean he can stick around for longer his negative x is where the action's at though even if you're not going for a negative one to fetch out sensei's divining top in your elsha of the infinite storm deck you can still get a lot of value out of his tutor ability it puts the artifact into play for starters meaning it can't be countered what's more you can negative zero here and grab out an artifact land like dark steel citadel or seat of the synod that's ramp in blue tesuret is versatile and can help you get closer to winning the game he's good at most points of a game and for that reason i'm recommending him today number five is garrick plain simple wild speaker speaking of untapping two mana sources garrick wildspeaker is here and he's insisting that he can do this better than tezeret well not quite he can't tutor what he can do though is untap two target lands in commander untapping two lands can give you access to way more mana than tezeret could ever give you thanks to some of the more broken lands that are so often played in the format even if you can't afford a gaia's cradle and haven't figured out that you can just write gaia's cradle on a basic forest and say it's a guy's cradle because it's just card but anyway that's another video but garrick can still untap the likes of itlamoc cradle of the sun cabal coffers or nickthos shrine denix throw in deserted temple into the mix and you've got yourself more mana then you'll know what to do with garrick also shines in enchantress builds that want to stack mana doubling effects on lands through auras like fertile ground or dawn's reflection in a pinch he can target an opponent's lands for political leverage too if you're in an arch enemy situation it might come up his other abilities are pretty good too making a 3-3 beast is never bad and having overrun at a very achievable negative four is really not too shabby either coming in at number four is no no oh come on oco thief of crowns is everything wrong with magic the gathering game design no i'm sorry oko thief of crowns is the face of throne of el drain a face you've probably wanted to punch at some point but face nonetheless honestly it does pain me to add him to this list as i feel like the card was a mistake in many ways in all ways i hate this card and everything it represents still though i'm being honest and you came here to learn about the best planeswalkers in commander and you know what oco is one of the best better than everyone we've mentioned so far for commander oko is a four loyalty planeswalker for three mana his plus two creates a food token which can be sacrificed to gain some life his plus one turns an artifact or creature into a 3-3 elk with no abilities yep that's right oko just invalidates commanders leaving them stuck in play as a 3-3 elk he also takes away early game mana rocks and can leave a burnished heart looking decidedly in need of polishing this ability is insanely good unfun good especially because it leaves oco on 5 loyalty he can just keep ticking up like this for the rest of the game and provided you can protect him with blockers of your own those elk aren't going to be much of an issue it's dastardly and i don't like it but i have to admit it is powerful and it doesn't end there though oco also has a relevant negative 5 ability you can exchange control of target artifact or creature you control and target creature and opponent controls with power three or less this is another way to infuriate the rest of the table and oco even provides the artifact you can give an exchange a food token trade their manor crypt for food or their golos tireless pilgrim for food seedborne muse yup that's a food i hate this card so much i hate everything about it it makes me just just don't like it why am i even why is this here why did we do this how did this happen to this game that i once loved what is happening to commander my channel my life who am i anymore ashiok dream render is number three forget mass land destruction forget armageddon forget ruination what you need is ashiok dream render renderer people complain and rightly so that green ramp and value is forever edging away from the upgrades other colors get it can be frustrating to watch the green player drop azusa lust but seeking oracle of moldaya and cultivate one after the other many magic the gathering players feel this justifies running mass land destruction and honestly it does i run land destruction i run mass land destruction have you seen my zozo or felden decklists yeah i'm running ruination but honestly these green decks are the decks best able to bounce back from that play in the first place cutting them off of searching out lands is the play and ashiok dream render does this and more ashuk's static ability there we go with the static abilities again states that spells and abilities your opponents control can't cause their controller to search their library this is a very strong effect and it's made stronger by being asymmetrical this effect doesn't stop you from tutoring or ramping so knock yourself out this shuts down fetchlands this shuts down tudors this shuts down even the lowliest of low rampant growth ashiok can completely halt entire game plans when they come down on turn three and with five loyalty they're likely to be able to stick around at least a few turn cycles ashyak also has another relevant ability they mill an opponent or you if you like four cards and then they exile each opponent's graveyard exiling graveyards is always good and if you're playing against any decks with combos or cards you think you can't beat then spinning the wheel on this and hoping to hit something good before ashiak is removed from play isn't the worst odds alright what is the second best planeswalker for commander it's ugin the ineffable which is a rather bad name because if this resolves you're going to be hearing a lot of f's coming your way oogin the ineffable is perhaps one of the most underrated walkers of the last year or so the biggest thing to shout about when it comes to nugen do you get it nugent yeah you get it is the negative 3 ability being able to destroy a permanent that's one or more colors is a boon to black and red decks and his versatile removal for other colors too take that oubliette ugin also has a relevant plus one ability he creates a 2-2 blocker and when that creature token leaves the battlefield you'll get the card exiled from the top of your library under it to your hand let me just break that down he makes blockers effectively draws cards and has mostly unconditional removal isn't that everything you want on a planeswalker but available to every single deck no matter what colors you're in you can run ugin the ineffable what's that you're saying you want a mana ability too greedy who do you think you are play design well ugin's got you there too colorless spells you cast cost to less to cast not one but two less that's bonkers good the obvious synergy with morph creatures aside ugin can seriously enable any deck that likes to use artifacts dropping a signet or a thought vessel for free or a sword of the animist feels great and if you're dropping in mana rocks you can have turns where you can empty your entire hand onto the board ugin obviously enables combo decks that want to storm off with artifacts casting sensei's divining top for free is at the heart of many a combo after all where ugin really shines as in mardu and boris dex that love removal and want to play equipment for cheap but he's really good basically everywhere and i seriously think you can do a lot worse than this always easy to cast planeswalker alright so what's the number one pick for best planeswalker for commander as a part of the 99 well it's ugin again just a different ugen ugan's everywhere it's ugin the spirit dragon always has been boy oh boy was i glad for the reprint of this powerhouse in core 2021 because he deserves to be in way more commander decks than he's in and that's mainly due to price of admission he's now a much more reasonable 25 bucks or so so grab one in the next few months before it starts to rise once more which i assure you it shall do uging costs a hefty eight mana but it's colorless mana which means it's easy to get with artifact ramp and doesn't have any annoying color requirements like with our number 2 pick this ugen can go in any deck the real reason to run ugin is for his negative x ability you get to exile each permanent with converted mana cost x or less that's one or more colors considering ugin comes in at 7 loyalty this can basically wipe the board in most cases what makes this good is that you can pre-empt it and focus on playing out your artifacts which won't get hit you can also set it to be a number less than your best creature and keep it once the wipe happens ugin can very quickly get back to a position where he can threaten to wipe again thanks to being able to lightning bolt for plus two loyalty this can take out creatures that might want to attack ugin and is a great deterrent keep in mind that ugin has the ability to do a blanket exile effect which gets around hex proof gets around shroud and gets around indestructible ugin is a panic button and he works almost every time if we can get him to ultimate territory well it's pretty busted but good luck with that nobody is letting ugin stay and play let me know in the comments below and special thanks once again to sponsor of
