Hello, I'm TZUYU of TWICE. I'm here to check my MBTI. (Find TWICE's MBTI) I'll start the test. "You find it challenging
to introduce yourself to others." (Deliberating on the first question) "You try to answer
your e-mails as soon as possible, and you can't handle
a disorganized inbox." It used to be worse. If I receive a Kakaotalk message, there are times when
I should read it and reply quickly, but I was terrible at it. I think I've improved a little. Okay. Yeah. "You think you're better than others." Nuh-uh. "You rarely get angry at others." I get angry about
my work than other people... ...more often. "You generally set up
detailed travel plans." When I travel, I leave it to my friends
or someone I can trust... Making plans. I don't do it myself. But for a trip, rather than having
a tight agenda, I go freestyle. I'm the type to try
anything I want to do. I decide impulsively. "You often experiment mood swings." I don't, do I? When people see me... they describe me as a robot. I don't think I'm that volatile, either. It's not extreme. I don't think I'm erratic. "Daydreams and ideas
rarely make you agitated." I don't think so. I often think,
"I want to do that." "I want to try that."
I daydream a lot, actually. "You don't let others
influence your behavior." Hmm?
Nuh-uh. "You don't control
your emotions, but vice versa." Disagree. I try to control my emotions, so I always think a lot. "You enjoy going to
social meetings which require suits or role-playing activities." I've never been to one
in my personal life yet. But if there's such a meeting,
I'd like to go. It sounds fun. I might enjoy it. Agree? "You're introverted and quiet." Anyone can tell... Arenâ€™t I different
if we become friends? But even so, I don't speak up that much. Huh? Finished? "Personality: Curious artist." "Adventurers are easily motivated
by other people's compliments, thus making them susceptible
to irresponsible, reckless behavior. They acknowledge this, too." Oh. Really? I guess... Am I? "Rarely doubtful." Right. I rarely suspect others. (2. Usually quiet, but bold on stage)
Yes, I guess? I'm quiet but on stage,
I'm more expressive. "Can't say no." I may seem quiet, but I say no
when I don't approve. "Likes natural things."
Yes, I do. "Can't refuse others' favors." What if I don't want to help? Usually, if it's from
someone I like... I don't think I can refuse. "Artistically expressive." No. I think artistic expression
applies to CHAEYOUNG. Members like CHAEYOUNG. "Stubborn and proud." Proud... Can't say I'm not, but not that extreme. I don't think
I'm that stubborn, either. "Indecisive?"
What does "indecisive" mean? "Indecisive." Very! Yes, that's me. Whenever I choose... In fact, SANA's the same. She told me she can't... ...make decisions right away. I think I'm the same. I can't... Make decisions on the spot. I hesitate. CHAEYOUNG's really swift. It's interesting. The questions were direct,
so I felt sheepish. But some of them are right.
It's interesting. It's fun taking tests like these, since they're correct
in many ways. I heard my fans
wanted to see me take this test. How did you like my results? I don't know how it is,
but I hope you enjoy. ONCEs, try it yourself
when you have the time. Well... Thanks!
