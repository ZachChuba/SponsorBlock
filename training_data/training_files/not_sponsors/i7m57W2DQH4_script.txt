world where I love the basis for its accounting like you start with the most mundane boring concept yeah and then it just goes bananas from there and you have just in skree and KS yes street bananas and it and you have justin screaming at you the whole time yeah but she has asked to the delight of that experience I just a bunch of great voice talent in the game all just as favors because because

Vaseline next you know there's no there's no there's no like you know her bottle or anything like that it's just I wake up and I'm like what did we were what day is it do you guys eat jello when you

want to turn to blossom do the pulling of the pie here book i'll be Bill Cosby for a second you can talk to me his book so bill tell me how how did you get drugs and all drugs but the party to the drugs that was fucking wow that was yes can we get a round of applause guys and clap for the mac other one and although he's got training he was denying the allegations so like it was very true to me and then you hear that dude your hangout but the thing in the drink he's like you guys are hanging out he's like to I didn't rape anyone and then i just woke up next to a fucking Vaseline was crazy but he's a great guy we love Bill Cosby Show know why only 1h 3 on the big giant sign why not eh 380 that is waiting that's like a mouth too long but like it's just such as h three podcast why not h3 with a little too like you know h3 to the square to square up our podcast I hadn't thought about that but that's we could still squared up or gauge 3x2 podcast is 3x to that sounds like this industry sport yeah something that could be when this Empire really blossoms to cover is advanced that could be your extreme sport h3x to I am I am an extreme sportsman you could tell by looking at me yeah you just are an extreme sport you're like the embodiment of the extreme sport yeah I noticed Justin it's okay it's probably the coldest day in la of the year and Justin rolled up in shorts and short shirt and i have to say i'm not talking shit because you are man I mean I think we're built from the same block of wood I'm wear shorts every day if i hear ya I hear sure I'm i just happen to be wearing a jacket yeah yeah I got it I like I i was outside now it's like it's kinda cold out and then I come into the building and my okay that's a little better and then I get into your fucking pockets and i'm like for so what are we gonna fuck with you trying to keep bodies from decomposing to meet fridge i got the jello in the kitchen would you like jello by the way i would love a little jello well am I gonna fall asleep shot gonna get justice some jello yeah I'm on that well usually guess like a cold I my experience and my problem with the shorts and the t-shirt thing is that I'm psychologically still living in august or maybe sep tember of 2016 like i don't bloody I don't believe that it's you don't believe in winter I just don't believe it's the did it that time is past and that we're in this world right now like that was the date that we currently are in I don't believe it we can leave we're still in love amber of 20 as I working on it i mean i-i obviously I I understand we're not i'm not like you know I think I don't have a dementia I don't have access to wherein but it but like I'm every decision I make including the clothes i put on and then I get out in the real world my god fuck yeah it's actually not that's relatable I feel like when especially in Israel which is similar you know temperature to LA I just that I wearing jackets is a new ass thing for me and I relate to that because it's like it's socially get cold you're like no dude ya know it's gonna warm up yeah nope well yep your finger oh yeah speaking of you know Justin introducing this is bullshit on Thanksgiving I think I so yeah yeah I want to say we were funding that we over his house thanksgiving Justin you guys may not know he's not just a hip-hop fan he's into some dirty hip-hop he likes that weird yeah so he starts putting on this gym be 44 Joy's I got deeper cover-up it's a fellow top-40 choice right if I would you know III yeah you know it's hard to say that we played a little bit so anyway there's this snow is this song and they're pretty blasted that night and that was the song of the night yeah it's the song that decade I can't get out my hand was trying to like let me get on that and play some music I might just hold on fucking music yeah I was definitely like but why did you know you you and you like you would never heard that song oh you did you know you're like what

young inventor yeah you don't get hard you need a hard not to get to know ya dark no yeah that's my favorite yes well I my song for grocery carts and run out of like oh shit the best one is that star wars note Yoda yep yeah that would confuse me a lot of guys you're getting all the love ya like what is star wars well it's also just like yo does not even I mean yes well I gonna get to Europe from

looking at yoga with those rose-colored goggles and you just saw a yoga for the first time today maybe he'd still be up using yeah and for me my but not the fucking cg final version yeah why the puppet the fucking Frank Oz puppet well i'll tell you when i first watched those Star Wars movies I'll never forget when you go to stole those sausages from Luke Skywalker when they were on that planet he was cooking up softly wait what I'm gonna straight snag them out of the pan that's really knows you don't remember the I haven't seen that he's like this little fucking Graham limb yeah and look at my stir fry sausages how's school here's what's amazing about Yoda is like back when they're making those movies they were on a budget they're on a schedule is like you know they were like you watch documentaries are talking about like you know they had to throw together alien costumes for the cantina scene they're like okay I don't give a fuck just put on that fucking wolf mask fine put that you know those all became action figures of course but at the time it was just like we just got to get this fucking shit and then I i guarantee you if they had all the time and money in the world it would look you know would have gone through a fucking so many rounds of redesigns and carbon would be like look what okay hold on first of all I've got a couple of that he's gonna end up being like a jacket like 12-foot tall frog that ya handle rapes people and uses the force lot about jello don't know about that you think do you think it's jello I think Yoda probably was only eat jello if it was given to him by his very good friend your left Julia you yoda yo-yo-yo-yo it you got it you got to eat jello Yoda that's the families in my held up and go to take the jello wake up with the Vasiliev it's all part of you recognize a cross between like I'm a chunky from rugrats and is this name Chuckie yeah yeah i just remembered her line that we forgot to mention starving no dinner up back to the e-40 because that's that's the great thing about the song this will continue to come up throughout this whole show well I gotta get his I gotta get the sleep out of my eyes that's what my that's what my Nana used to call it that's what biggie smalls calls it because I just walked up y'all I didn't know that was actually i'm so sleepy today with a sleepy demeanor now you're great you're full life you're always full life just wanted to shut my eyes and they go wow you're full life and I'm like no because I yes and I try to yes and you know wow I think you have cancer no thank you so much that's what a doctor tried to tell me once and then I just ran out of it i just ran away wait how long ago was that that guy was like a month ago he's like he had results he's like wow I think you have cancer and I'm like I know and I just fucking bolted and ran down the street and left my car the market garage just ran all the way on give me fine yeah I was like I'm not hearing that yes I think that's on the cancer website this is this is waiting on cancer right everyone run never can just getting that not that didn't happen also fucking no more cancer jokes you to that fucking dark answer sorry it's not fun let's not talk about cancer yeah unless we're talking about like horoscopes that's fine i'm a cancer actually are you june i'm a junior boy oh that's right you know I knew that but I don't do you believe in all that schmutz all that fucking i don't know like sometimes its its its yearly oh well first of all I need to say yeah that Justin's girlfriend Abby was here to my are you very much she is fucking obsessed with astrology specifically mercury in retro yeah let me let me let me explain really quick the mercury in retrograde ok so mercury if you buy something while mercury is in retrograde it is going to break or it won't work right some territories always in retrograde though it was with her it seems like it's like it's like you know over the course of a month and a half or two whatever it is it's always yeah it's like finding she said and written it sound like april may it's different everywhere it's like has to do with like you know alcohol astrology like where's this seems like every time I show up you guys house she's going i'm certain whenever anything goes wrong in my life I'm like oh man I fucking stub my toe yesterday was mercury was in retrograde yeah yeah yeahs I kind but here's the thing is particularly interact and by the way it applies mainly to like you know you don't wanna sign the contracts you don't want to buy any electronics or any equipment with a bunch of moving parts and and stuff are you gonna buy this DVD player nope is mercury in retrograde yup scared of the dark hope that always found there's just one lesson is on target with that oh that's the one I love the best because that's not much of a brag he's like a grown-ass man yeah yeah it's like yeah are you scared of the dark nope he says it's so proudly to it's like God your kind of yeah it's not like look tone it down that's not something to be shouting from the rooftops Sean are you scared of the dark yup it's not very hard you kinda get did the wrong one yeah yeah you know no we're not scared I yeah well I don't know are you or not is that a real you know what if he 4340 cloudy what if he is scared of the dark and that was sort of a thing where great fronting what was it was more of like a like he's like fucking terrified of the dark so it's on his mind but then he's like you could never admit that yeah and so it made its way into the song well the truth that's drunk depressed doth protest too much dot depressed too much that's what I was originally gonna take some beer and wings melody and in the same thought can you do when I started to say that Ron can you like cut in tight on me and like fucking to you know look at the chyron admin of my broken yeah well we'll definitely look at you up to patch up my watch every video well our videos no I was gonna I wanted a curious mm thank you by the way that's really not the shake just think wow just the best i fucking love this guy I know he's the best mother fucker entertainment although what I was gonna say on one of these things i want to achieve with this podcast was pretty lofty goal but there's I feel like on YouTube your youtuber in popular media you're popular media person in psych your well most youtubers just it's so hard to break out of that that circle and for people over the series break out of the youtube so yeah because nobody wants to fuck you just gotta sit out somebody you gotta stab someone in the neck no no you on the bad fatal no just like you're talking about physical violence or like their arm like a deep it will you gotta do harm it'll be like to this fucking youtuber is hard so I need to prove myself my street cred don't get come get a knife in here on my step just step up here just stabbed me go for it dude so one of the things i want to attempt to do is you know bridge the gap a little bit between new and in traditional media yeah which is why i love that your first guess you're so special to me and thank you so much you're welcome a real place i really thank you I really real place just i would i would touch my dick to your dick I don't know if I want to do that and we can get eat jello and have a total bastard it's very romantic you can tell you you got me with the jello but the first time we spoke I was sitting with sac AK psychicpebbles and we were in New York and it was funny because you're like hey have you heard of this guy h3h3 production oh I Texas yeah yeah yeah I guess you just watched our finebros video or some shit yeah i was i'd watch a bunch of shit i went down i was like watching a ton of shit and I was like it was great i was like this is fucking amazing so yeah it's a bitch I'm not just say I'm glad I'm not honestly I don't want my steak yeah but anyway so he says do you know h3 and Zach was sitting next to me and the time because we were working on a show with Jan transitive to get all Jan trade shows that is that what he's gonna change his name to Jan train just like the name so he goes so just that you think he's heard is that nobody has oh my god says uh keep the fans are great yeah they're great but Jan tran I like all entrants heads so yeah so he says do you know h3 and acts like I'm sitting right next time I was like oh so we so he gave Justin my number and then we start testing a little bit like hey how do you do god bless your kind of things and then this and then I we talked a little bit this weekend were in New York and we had in mind what my people was one of the most awkward texting conversations ever anyone aware of it no I was completely rework Olivia so we're talking about something like gum well that that's shocking to me because I thought I was like dead to you know I was my I just I'd like I don't even remember what it was about that's I'm so the dashes testament to all you guys and you remember what it was about yes Caleb can you yeah okay everybody I think it's so funny because it happened so many times right you think you were so awkward and like people are going to hate you and they don't even remember it I swings and say a testament to everyone listening or watching at home that if you do something really horribly embarrassing there's a good chance the other people even fucking notice yeah i'm i'm like you where I'm like did I just ruin my life yeah and then it's i wish i could shake that a little bit better but yeah it's usually no one gives a shit everyone's to worry about this one seems really bad i was like we were talking about um kinda can't even know how we got into this conversation and thank you were saying out we're going to move to LA soon and we didn't like our neighborhood in New York I don't like the upper west side because you're like it's a weird thing they're like it's all only white people live there but everyone who works in the stores are all black yeah they all come in from like Brooklyn and Queens yeah yeah and harlem so there's just like so much like white and yeah sure yeah it's really weird and I was and I was just saying how I thought it was really bizarre and I kept going on about ingesting Justin didn't and so you get that man he didn't have a breakdown and you kept I kept trying to explain this i thought i was coming up really racist and weird and the night and then I said your motor the smiley face with a gun to his head because i was i was trying to express my awkwardness to myself but then I was like oh shit he thinks I want to kill myself because i can't i can't handle dis us you know racism or whatever you want memories so no I'm glad you remember that so anyway there was like a cold silence for a long time cycle 2 i'm never gonna ever fucking meet Justin answer yeah and then you change your number and I was texting you for like like that you know every every couple of weeks Billy hey are you know yet no response like and then finally I I who did i ask i was like i finally although i messaged you on on Twitter you change your number and then again like oh course that was so funny because we got hacked yeah we had to change our numbers twice oh yeah we got have got to get hacked Sony we got to get hacked I was wondering how did you find our channel or what do you think about youtube in general okay uh about watching down so well when I haven't I did exercise today on my lip to go but like I was exercising on my elliptical a lot and like I used to watch like walking dead or shit like I would try to like watch a whole episode of a show back when I was really good about it and I look at fucking disgusting fat I am right now god you're in good shape no you're fine you want to compare food no I'm like going down the pool boy I gotta keep your shirts on but uh but uh but like yeah i was i was you know I like i watch all of madmen like the whole fucking series on the elliptical every episode or or i did a bunch of shows so it's like you could go like damn like that's that's it you can quantify how many how many hours you exercise but I'm but I started watching youtube videos and i think it was Starrcade it was John trial RKO you know what's not what's interesting but I decide yeah is that John always he didn't like Starrcade yeah I thought it was great yeah it was great meeting you know everyone's every episode fucking perfect no but like they were all super entertaining and the production and i love that show I love like just going in to like just all the games and took him playing them and just enough right way but like he had like yoda yo-yo-yo-yo funny / Yoda oh yeah I didn't know yeah dude that shit was fucking hilarious so that's what John was one of the first channels i fell in love with as well yeah and I love him because he elevates youtube it's just not a you know it's no longer just shitty fucking Disney Prince and Princess bloggers you got some real motherfucker out here grindin yeah yeah or or prank invasion fucking no good job morning can we please get some blooms of the shot go get some blowjobs you blow jobs during the blowjobs out hey can you were here I'll tell you what I'm gonna do a secret handshake you can follow it i'm a sucker did you suck my dick ok ok and then like up come here you don't know what's going on what prank relations with herpes around herpes all over my mouth I don't want to talk to guy because you can oh God look at your beef with anybody Chris doesn't actually prank relation chris is one of the he sort of is cool he's been like some people get really but her yeah he does some people sue you for example that's happened to me by the way let's just not get to run to that but some people are really like hey you know what i understand that there's a First Amendment called fucking protection of free speech and when I put myself out there in the public then i may get criticized was called America that kind of absurd shit yeah it's like yeah he better have had something on her about I think I I gave him credit for you're not fucking with us too badly and fact we recently had a strike from one of his acolytes and and he cleared it up he told the guy to drop it so I appreciated that huh my prank invasion is definitely one of the most fucking absurd things on youtube I mean it's just it's have you got for those of you who listen you don't know what it is regulation is this i don't want to he can use myself as handsome he wears two he's a very bad man he's mentioned it's easier to be a metrosexual gent who goes out and and just look it up he keep fucking goes up to girls and goes if I can guess your weight if I can't get or whatever it is I'm like it's amazingly yes he fakes you create this is the actors and he faces making out girls exactly its soft core porn for you to essentially if you want to make out with girls just fucking do it he does just go on craigslist a.m. and filming or 10 like it's a good girl the public dollars give her reverie pays on right i mean you can even you can even have sex that way believe it or not I'm sure sure he's probably boned a bunch of those girls and maybe what was your life before Rick and Morty because right now just just hustling what were you working huh I how far back before while you are in yours working on season three now mmm and wasn't it up turn it up yeah what does that happen by the way any any P can say Kiki you might say I can't thanks for my sins next five months next six months I can't say within six within two months I don't believe it twice no links is absolutely no I can't because I don't know but then also because because I shouldn't say but I'm I just blink twice within three months I'd get in trouble why do you think so i don't know why they're so tight about that everyone type they just they just want to know no I mean here's what i can say is that it's it's we just why well I can't even see that we all i can say that's coming together it's coming really far feeling good yeah is juicy yes I'm excited it's really exciting so like you know it's been a long wait and hopefully hopefully all the fans of the show don't like just forget about us or doing did you know what forget about Ricky more and that's kind of something else I want to talk about yeah is that we have like a somewhat popular subreddit on on reddit are our community but Rick and Morty's is even crazier yeah you know it's funny i started that subreddit argued that are you creating mod i am a creative but but i had no interest in like I started it only because i was waiting to read as of yet me just upset to the point was a problem i have you have curbed the addiction how deep have you gone to read because I've I used to work as job and I would go so deep into reddit that there would be no pages left like that you get a life yeah just had the bombs get off of ya got there and this was probably around that time yeah i was going on 4chan the cartoon board every time a new episode of brick and mortar we're on for season one and then I did it for some of them on season two and then I just got that out of my system like like going into season 3 i'm just not so when you post new episodes of Rick Marty do you go to celebrate you go to 4chan do you listen to people's feedback are you just like I don't want having i did because like I think your first season you know it's like the dream it's like oh my god i have a fucking show on the air like this actually like yeah of course like that the night air is your just glued yeah what are people saying you know like so so addictive to do that and the thing i did and I've said this before and other other interviews and stuff is that like on 4chan i found that was the only place where i was finding like like every other place was like just all positive positive in like like and I wanted and I wanted to fucking you like surely there's some critical elements yeah so on 4chan I was like five of course I found it there because the a place you're going to find it and it's good it's like I was like okay okay good so did you did you find constructive criticism there no I mean it's all just like just like a hate the tumor voices or yeah I could / position to make you feel bad yeah butBut like but then what I did was huntin season 1i there was a couple didn't really cut it like I don't give a shit didn't cut deeper anything but there's a couple things were said I was like oh shit and then I started posting you know because it's all anonymous like the worst shit about the show and me you were going anybody don't about you get our own show and it was an interesting strategy psychologically because i was like i just said your viewership about me that anyone else could say you wear your vulnerabilities like a shield and because it's because I said it now if someone else has it all or like it was like so bad that was like no one else could ever what do you say anything where you remember what you wrote it was something like I did a few of them i want to know like like this show fucking socks you know they're fighting with people who like the show my god imagine if they do they're arguing with the pretty yeah and then trying to convince and well then it became a meme we're looking at night because like because I you know I would I kept going you know again every time an episode premier i would check all those places yeah and then like that night you know and the following day for a little bit but then you know I gotta get back to work but i want to i want one juicy I want some de Basque deep cutting shit you said about yourself remember it was probably like I don't know like the the whoever does the voices of all the characters fucking hack kind of martial no nothing like that nothing like nothing like but just more just like I hate the voices hate that I hate the guy who knows yeah and then whenever someone would shit talk they would like the mean was like or a good or you're just it wasn't me anymore it's just so weird to like you make something you send it out into the world and its got like complete you know it's reaching across the country and then just see the diverse all the diversity of people and like the comments that they're saying and all the stuff is just fucking trippy so we relate so much because the comments is such a big part of you two and one of the things i guess one of the good and bad things of you to work on one hand you're so directly connected with your audience and on the other hand it's like you're getting way too much connection like the comments the good the bad at all surfers up you see everything people on the line here yet people get fucking nasty yeah because I think when they're talking to online personality they think they don't really on realize that they're gonna read yeah so they'll be like fucking fucking Jew ass fat talk or whatever like I mean they say huh transsexuals kind of you they call ya know I i mean i love the way you guys handle it which is the same way I handle it as it's just like you just it's hilarious well there's bench points were when we underwent major changes in our content and then felt like our whole like everybody looks like turned against yeah i read it and on the on the comments of our YouTube and it's like for us we just need to kind of we had to stop braiding the car yeah you have to tune out because you have to just be confident that you know what's best for for for us and our channel so in a way I feel like yeah that's an interesting difference between popular media and YouTube were you can't more I mean the feedbacks there but there's not a fucking chat section underneath the video exactly alright let's take a quick break god bless you and will be back shortly with you boy Justin don't go away you will not want to miss this before we move on to the second
