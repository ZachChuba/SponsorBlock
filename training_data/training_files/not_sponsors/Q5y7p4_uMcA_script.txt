We all know what it's like to be rejected by a crush. And we all know what it's like to play second fiddle. I can't even read music and I know that. I'm really sorry, I just don't like you that way. It's times like these when you ask yourself, "What's so wrong with me?" Why doesn't my crush like me? (CHUCKLES) I mean, I'm a pretty cool person, (ECHOING) right? Well, clearly, my crush enjoys spending time with me and getting to know me, but why is that it? Well, there's a few potential reasons why your crush is not reciprocating what you're putting out there. So let's explore some of these right now, shall we? Reason number one: there is someone else. Sometimes your crush straight-up can't like you because they can't even see you. Jordan, you are such a good friend. - Just a friend?
- (PHONE RINGING) Oh, hold on, I'm getting a call. Oh, hey Steve! Reason number two: lack of chemistry. Look, I know it's hard to look at the situation objectively, but sometimes, you guys ... you just ... you don't have chemistry, okay? You're just physically attracted to your crush and not factoring in the fact that you guys just don't ... they don't—you don't have anything. There's nothing there. They might be hot, okay? But they're not—there's nothing there. Hey, remember that time that we went to the movies? That movie was just so hilarious. - Yeah, that was pretty funny.
- Yeah. We always have such a fun time together, don't we? We laugh, and have fun, and—but we can also be real and serious when it's appropriate. Reason number three: the time is not right. Sometimes the timing just—it ... it's not there. Renée, I need to tell you something. Okay? I really, really have a crush on you and I wanna date you. Oh, well ... I'm getting married tomorrow. Is that tomorrow? I forgot. You do not have anything in common. When you're crushing so hard on someone, sometimes it's easy to forget that most relationships start with a few common interests. Not "Oh, she's got a pretty smile." That's not a common interest. You might both like pretty smiles, but ... So that would be. Maybe you don't have a pretty smile. (LAUGHING) I'm confusing myself. Wow, I cannot believe that you agreed to date me! I'm hyperventilating on the inside! - Yeah, what do you wanna do?
- Oh. Uh, I didn't think that far ahead. - Um, do you like video games?
- Not really. - Bowling!
- No. - Ice cream? You gotta ...
- I'm lactose-intolerant? Okay! You seemed a lot more fun back when I had a crush on you. And finally, reason number five: they just don't like you. Look, sometimes, for just no rhyme or reason, your crush just doesn't like you. And, you know what? That's okay. It really is. It doesn't mean that you're dumb or unattractive or anything like that. It just means that of all of the billions of people in this world, this one specific person doesn't wanna date you. It's okay to be single, all right? You don't need to be in a relationship to be happy. - Wow, that is really good advice.
- Uh, thanks. I was ... I was gonna ask you out, but now I know we can just be happy being friends! That wasn't supposed to apply to this situ— Why does this always ha— We always have so much fun together, like, don't we? When we talk and we have an exciting time - and we laugh and sometimes we can be serious.
- (AMY LAUGHING) - "We have such exciting times."
- Sorry, sorry, I was just rambling at that point. - JOSH: All right.
- All right, here we go.
