previously on God's on set from scratch start our DK's grind off by pulling a berserkering and an archers ring and something a little bit more unexpected did some more berries and managed to pull a tank plate body and we wrap off the episode with two tridents and a call and a cracking turn so sit back relax and enjoy episode 4 [Music] right to start said number four Dave we're putting a head over to decays and do a little bit more of those try and get ourselves another berserkering and another arch ring because it's not missing noses all right all right that's correct also we still need to do a tiny bit of slayer because we are after one more occult wanna call I am very close to broad bolts on lock I'm need about 70 points are finished a lot yeah perfect also probably needs to be a bit more barrows one because we need chaos runes eventually for the Fiore and also because I've got about 17 K bangs at the minute also need tank legs and then we could probably finish off doing a bitters or hopefully our ons and like a blowpipe or some ignore it like that I'd take a blowpipe champ plan David you can fight me for these giants don't don't don't really sly comment just say thank
