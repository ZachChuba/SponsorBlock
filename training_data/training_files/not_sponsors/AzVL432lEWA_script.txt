this is candy it's called candy because it was originally from India where sugarcane was first processed into sugar crystals and around the 4th century AD with a piece of sugar referred to as Kanda in sanskrit now as the knowledge of the cultivation and processing of sugar spread westwards into what was then Persia sometime in the 6th century the word used to refer to the process of coating something in sugar syrup became undie in arabic and then as that knowledge made its way westwards to europe eventually we get the english word candy sometime in the 13th century etymology or the study of the origin of words can reveal a story how we got to an object or an ideas importance in the world where it came from but unlike candy sine and cos as words don't really mean anything and their story tells us why to go back to the beginning the concept of sine originates in India in the Gupta period and the 4th or 5th century AD previously ancient Greek mathematicians had considered the relationship between the length of a chord that's any line that connects two points on the perimeter of a circle and the angle subtended at the center of the circle by back court but the writers of the sedan toss one of the most important texts in ancient Indian mats instead considered the relationship between half the length of a chord and half the angle subtended at the center and this is directly related to the modern concept of sine if a circle has radius one then it's half chord has length sine X if X is half the angle subtended at the center in sanskrit which was the liturgical language of India at that time the chord is referred to as Gia meaning bowstring it's kind of obvious to see why the chord looks like a bowstring if the rest of the circle forms the bow and a common synonym of Gia at the time was Jeeva which is the word that ended up sticking to refer to both the chord and the idea we now know as sine mathematicians working in Gupta era India defines two huge concepts that we use all the time in maths today sign as we've already seen and literally how we write numbers around the same time that sign was invented modern decimal notation was also invented where each column of a number is 10 times larger than the previous column not replaced earlier systems which are a bit more unwieldy like sexagesimal where each column was 60 times larger than the previous one it's no exaggeration to say that mathematicians working in Gupta era India redefined a lot of how we currently think about maths but those ideas had to get from India to Europe where it was eventually standardized into the notation that we use today and the journey it took to get there is where we get the names sine and cos exactly as with candy as the idea of sine spread from India to what was then Persia the word used to refer to it was transliterated from sanskrit into arabic because there was no direct equivalent that already existed so Jeeva became giba now this next bit is important because something's about to go wrong because in arabic words can be abbreviated by omitting short vowels and as such for convenience when written down giba became jib but this only works if you know what the abbreviation was in full in the first place because there could be any short vowels between the remaining consonants normally of course that's not a problem if you speak Arabic and you're familiar with the conventions you can substitute in the original vowels but when Western Europeans started translating our of mathematical documents in the 12th century what would the increased contact between the two cultures there was a problem Europe hadn't been thinking much about maths for the past well nearly thousand years instead focusing on salvation and who the successors the Roman Empire was so when they gained access to Arabic texts which brilliantly extended the works of ancient Greek and Indian mathematicians and scientists they began fervently translating them and they translated them into medieval Latin which was the language of maths at the time a translator and it's not universally agreed on who this was but it was probably Robert of Chester who incidentally was the first person to translate the Koran into Latin or Gerard of Cremona got their hands on a book in Arabic called the compendium of calculation by completion and balancing and within this book were tables of the values of the sine of an angle referred to as jib but the translator whoever it was didn't realize that that was short for giba and instead interpreted it as being short for Jeb the Arabic word for bosom or pouch therefore he translated Jim in Arabic into sinus in Latin which is the word meaning bosom or fold or cavity incidentally why your sinuses in your head are called that they're literally air cavities in your skull and this name stuck in Latin which remained the language of maths for centuries right up until mathematicians and in particular boiler standardized notation sign being short for sinus and cos for trigonometric functions cusp incidentally is short for cosine or more completely in Latin complimenti sinus meaning the thing which varies with sine but the word we use today sine was an English corruption of the Latin word sinus so as a word it only has a mathematical meaning it simply didn't exist until English mathematicians started using the Latin function sinus sometime in the 16th century so perhaps it's fitting them that after centuries of history and a dodgy translation into Latin that the first person recorded to use the word sine in English was called Thomas fail so the next time that you're stuck in a trigonometry test and you're staring blankly at the questions take some comfort in the fact that the person who named sine and cos didn't really know what they were doing either if you subscription and it helps me grow this channel thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video please do pop it alike if you're not already
