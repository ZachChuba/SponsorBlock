hello everybody and welcome back to another weekly recap in the weekly recap i'd like to go over any news related to the old school runescape community this week now last week i was gone for the update day and so i thought i'd do it today because we got some really hot off the press news concerning the revenant cave finally determined what they're going to do with the revenant cave which i'm really excited to get into that on top of that we're going to be going over today's game update as well as there is a really interesting blog post about mini games this week and there were a few other things posted as well anyway guys hope you enjoyed the video if you do i always appreciate it if you leave the video like always helps out with the youtube algorithm thank you so much and let's get started all right let's start off with today's game update a very small quality of life update again called blow pipe ammo changes and small fixes now the only change this week is to the toxic blowpipe you are now able to swap between different types of darts in the blowpipe without having to remove ammo all you have to do is simply use your new ammunition on the blowpipe and it will swap it out a very minor quality of life change but helpful additionally if the toxic blowpipe is the only item in your inventory that uses solar scales any scales that you pick up will automatically be added to the blowpipe that is pretty nice i like that one uh so as you kill zollroy you really won't have to ever refill it with scales so apparently that was the only update they got to this week i'm a little surprised that there's been such little content the last month but hopefully they're working on something big and then next up here they talk about the recent teletab update now when they added in the craftable teletabs for ancient magics and lunars for some reason they removed the wilderness warning on the ancient magic teleports before you click on it however decided they would make this toggleable now this can be toggled on and off using the right-click configure option and now because of this the left click option is now break the next beer they talk about the remnant caves and they finally have come to a decision on what they want to do which is exciting now over the last couple of months a lot of different ideas have been tossed around now the two most popular ideas that jagex highlights here are roaming revenants as well as just modifying the current revenant cave well they're going to be going with the second option so no roaming revenants the reason for that is that roaming revenants would quickly become annoying and in the end it wouldn't really solve the problem it would just move it somewhere else so what are they going to modify about the revenant cave now the idea behind most of these changes is to make it harder for clans to lock down the revenant caves now to start off they're going to distribute the revenants all throughout the cave so they're not going to be in predictable locations and so now that they are roaming around it'll be a bit harder for players to block off certain revenants they also may consider adding in more spawns to the location as well but that is not certain now the next change is the most important and kind of unprecedented they are going to be removing multi-way combat from the revenant cave and replacing it with something called singles plus now essentially the way that this is going to work is pvp is always going to take priority as if you're currently killing an npc you can be pj'ed off that immediately by ap care with that said though the entire revenant cave is going to be singles which means you can only be attacked by one person so this is going to prevent boxing from players in the cave but will also give them a fighting chance because they can't be piled on by a hundred clan members at once that said though any other aspect of single way combat is going to be the same and will apply now furthermore they're going to be looking at the drop table for revenants themselves along with the mechanic that gives you a higher rate of getting the unique weapons when you are skulled those are most likely going to change although they don't highlight how and when now furthermore they're going to be moving all of these slayer monsters in the remnant cave and they're now going to occupy a separate dungeon south of the lauren's chest this dungeon is going to be multi-way combat but is going to be a lot bigger and will leave room to expand wilderness layer in the future and all of the creatures in that dungeon will also have a higher chance of dropping a laron's key okay so that is their proposed changes for the straight-up mechanics of the remnant cave i think the single plus mechanic does seem promising to me although i'm not a pkr obviously as if any of you guys are in the pvp community let me know what you think about it with a comment down below i'm interested to read your thoughts now moving on to other pvp issues they have a couple other ones here now once again they're mentioning the vestas longsword they want to propose making the vestas long sword usable in all pvp worlds because currently you just can't use it it was a bounty hunter exclusive item previously and now that bounty underworlds are gone it's useless that said they're not going to be enabling it in pvm combat as it could significantly affect the existing meta and the final thing they wanted to talk about today is blighted items now just like the vestas long sword they'd like to make them usable on pvp worlds now they might appear in limited areas everywhere at once or in stages now the different stages they could introduce them in as only in designated pvp hot spots and then if that works out they could release them to the rest of pvp and finally this will also include a rebalancing of the last man standing store to ensure that they cost an appropriate amount all right so that is a bunch of pvp changes kind of exciting to see that they are eventually doing something with the revenant cave let me know what you think about that down below i do think the changes are promising uh dealing with clans is obviously the main issue i don't know why they needed months and months of data to summarize that but you know what i'm happy to get into it eventually now about five days ago now uh jagex released a really big blog about minigames uh primarily to do with soul wars which is going to be one of the major updates next year however they also mention a bunch of different mini games and changes they'd be looking to make to them now this is truly a massive blog so we're going to be highlighting some of the more important information but as always i would recommend reading through the entire thing on your own if you want every single detail now soul wars is an update that is going to be coming in early 2021 and by and large is going to be a port of the original game mode from rs3 or perhaps an earlier version now obviously there is going to be a significant amount of changes to make it suitable for old school now the requirements to play soul wars in old school runescape is going to be a bit different uh you're going to require 500 total level 40 combat and of course membership this is entirely to help combat bots but won't actually be really required to play the game now if you've played star wars before the mechanics are going to be fairly similar to what they were one of the biggest changes obviously though is going to be to the reward system as the rs3 rewards are not going to be very suitable now essentially the way you're going to get rewards is by accruing zeal you can get this in a variety of different ways by killing your opponent healing fellow team members burying bones sacrificing soul fragments dealing damage or capturing graveyards now you can spend your zeal at the reward shop and it has a few different things now first appear you can straight up by experience this is going to be kind of similar to pest control you can buy experience for any of your combat stats assuming that they are over level 30. now next up here they are proposing putting the nightmare zone in views here that said they are not going to be removing them from nightmare zone just putting an alternative way to get it next appear they are proposing the soul cape it will require 70 prayer to equip and will provide a plus 8 prayer bonus next up here we have the ectoplasmatter when this item is carried in the inventory it will give you prayer experience whenever you kill a ghostly creature the xp given will be based on the amount of hit points that the creature has very similar to a slayer experience next up here you can purchase a lucky dip which will give you a random item from a new loot table however whenever you buy a lucky dip there's also a rare chance that you were given the avatar pet which is going to be a brand new pet for soul wars obviously there's a lot more to talk about soul wars but there's a lot in this blog so let's move on now the first change to exist in minigames is to last man standing now essentially they would like to add in new maps and new loadouts now right now they're proposing the wilderness of rock map which was particularly popular and they'd also like to add a zerker and pure style fight to the mini-game okay they're actually proposing a very minor change to the grand exchange they'd like to add in a new area in the southwestern corner called the game zone here you'll be able to play a games table offering each of the four games room mini games we also like to add these to various pubs around gilanor i really like that last idea i think that makes a lot of sense now to make trouble brewing a bit more accessible they like to reduce the requirements to participate in it so they're removing the level 40 cooking requirement and cabin fever now there are quite a few minor bug fixes to barbarian assault castle wars and even puro piro however the shades of morton is actually one of the mini games they're looking to rework the most now beyond reworking the actual map for the shades of morton mini game they're also going to be adding in additional rewards now first up here there'd be a wearable coffin this item would go in the cape slot and would allow you to store a range of different shade remains and would be intended for inventory management the next appear they'd like to add in a new set of prayer robes they don't really have a concrete idea on what these robes would do yet but a couple options is to have a bone saving effect weaker than the wilderness alter or it could offer bonus experience when burning shade remains straight up just offer bonus prayer experience have an installed head saving effect that's kind of interesting or it could just have a really high prayer bonus as a completed set so on top of that they were looking to add in a couple other armor pieces such as swamp bark and blood bark now swamp bark armor would be a mid-tier level of magic equipment that has a set effect that when the entire set is equipped it would reduce the time that buying spells would affect you by two ticks per piece and finally here we have blood bark armor now the set effect for blood bark would be to increase the heal effect from blood spells by 1.5 per armor piece equipped which would mean a full set bonus of 32.5 hit points restored per attack so yeah that's pretty much it surprisingly they're looking to add in a lot of rewards to the shades of morton minigame but it is exciting to see that some of these mini games are going to be changed for the first time in quite a while now before i go here i anyway thanks again guys and i'll see you next time
