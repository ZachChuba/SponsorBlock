Garth Brooks there is absolute and let's get physical playing music like I was a ghost in my own home over the weekend I was not present because I was waiting through a four-hour Garth Brooks documentary on Netflix called the road I'm on or something like that and it was first of all was very interesting to watch something on Netflix that was it was made for the biographer ane or for like the for you know remember the biography should show yeah shut up there's enough we know where total lives my dream so it actually has these like built-in commercial breaks like they're not commercials but things like dip to black right but it's fascinating first of all I love any documentary about music I can watch a documentary about anybody who's had a successful career especially people that I don't know because it's all kind of like I didn't really paid attention to Garth Brooks I never cared for his music and I still don't hey guys Jeremy Renner no no disrespect no disrespect I just don't care for it I love country music in general but his music never never worked for me but anyways he was a massive star but this documentary is it's on Netflix it's unbelievable he is in tears the whole time and I don't have an issue with men getting Jonah I think it's kind of beautiful and I love seeing guys leave I love seeing guys get in touch with their emotions I really do and I think we should be I should cry more I I should cry over a lot I should cry a lot about a lot of things I don't I'm very you know I'm German I'm stoic and I don't have access to that I don't cry a lot but when I do I do but this Garth Brooks is on the verge of tears tearing up he's on he's he's tyr he's full crying or or on the verge of crying the whole time and he's talking directly in the camera a lot of the time and he's talking about [ __ ] that he shouldn't cry over I'm talking about like the time he met his business manager and he's not so you could seize like he was like cuckooing he's like real intense and he's sitting there he's like sitting on a chair like a backwards chair you know there's arms up on the back of the chair I went up to him I said this is your opportunity this is your chance to make a difference and it's like that's the whole time but you know he's talking about his mother and he's crying I get that but boy he's just like it's really fascinating watch I love this thank you for my life god bless you guys and Vic you've been on to this for a while you've been depressed with him well yeah like he made that famous sort of I'm joining Facebook and this is not me to connect that is like you know the beautiful art piece like yeah accidental art piece like it's unreal is it like like it's like his manager said all right the show's over just go back in the hotel room talk to this camera and we'll put it up online you know just talk to your fans and he dims the lights real low and it's just him him talking on a like hotel bed you don't have you don't have I can pull it out of it pull it but it's a sort of a famous internet thing anyways I gotta bring Chris Gaines back you know I get into the games the other thing is is great in is like Billy Joel is in it and he's on the verge of tears he's all teared up and like everyone's like oh yes it's official we're now on Facebook I really wasn't sure about this at the start but then a friend of mine said something they just made all kinds of sense she said think of it more as a conversation I like that but I'm already finding out on my own so it's wiping the walls out between you and me and I really like that it allows us into each others worlds right Oh tell room I think about things I want to post I want to post cool stuff but most stuff I'm gonna post is gonna be raw stuff like this [ __ ] anal sex with wife I just feel bad sometimes because I just think everything that's what it is okay he's just being it like trying to be a good guide see just alright anyways that's my recommendation I think it's it's funny it's interesting they can't find the interesting thing is they can't find any country singers to talk about him it's Billy Joel and James Taylor that they have sitting down it'd be interviewed about the Clinton black wasn't available really quite country Vince Gill around Travis Tritt Travis Tritt wasn't around maybe his contemporaries don't do they might do uh his wife yes missus Jesus your wood he's missus he's mister your wood and she's pretty interesting it's an interesting story my dream he does all these things where he's like us he makes these profound statements but they're [ __ ] like he could have gone down to the Hallmark star store and looked through the cards for about twenty minutes you know he looks at he's like there's this thing my daddy used to say and now I've been saying he said with every blessing there's a curse with every curse there's a blessing I'm like oh man my mind god bless him yeah if he ever did go into the card store just be bawling smell the roses that's my [ __ ] stop and smell the roses Oh Tim that's what he reads at night when he's reading a book he just has a stack of Hallmark cards just goes through one by one tissues crying hey Matt I want to connect with my audience I want to be I won't have a one-on-one relationship with the good people that listen to the show is there anybody out there that wants to communicate with me and be real for once I know order this is out there I know Orvis is out there eating a salad I want to connect with Orvis you know they're excited to share some music with you Orvis what is going on in your neck of the woods man what has happened in Orvis what's that I'm sure I just proposed to my partner was how'd that go well he said we're business we don't we're not love

there we set as a country as a nation we set around the the virtual fireplace and we listened to Robin Williams pretend to be an alien from ork remember when they had that son they had merged they had mirth his mirth merthin mirth yes Jonathan winters and it was like a Benjamin buttons routine where I thought that was Orson no Orson was [ __ ] mork's box - oh right his son was old like everything was opposite he sits upside down is yeah where was more where was Mark from his work ork that's where all those bad guys from the Lord of the Rings are from right that worked there the orcs but Mork is from ork and he reports to Orson he's in love with Mindy I wanted to do us I wrote that I don't know where I wrote this I wrote it for something it was a pretend pitch for an ABC show called I think it's called after Mindy or something mark after it knows more after many it's like checking Mindy had died of cancer or something she had passed away and it was Mork it's real like you know like a there's an opportunity for it was like maybe right after Dead Poets Society and people said you know Robin is a really talented dramatic actor I think there's something what if we took the Mork & Mindy universe and made it a little more sincere and serious and we do Mork and we don't want to deal with Pam Dawber we don't need to bring Pam back because she's gonna ask for a ton of money but we could do we could do more after Mindy I don't mean mean to miss you as it's been you know 20/20 it's been two years since you've gone not calling awesome not calling awesome what is it what is it Mork what is it Marc I just don't know if I can go on I don't I don't know if I can go on Orson I miss Mindy so much I was there when she passed away and now I have mirth not to raise my mirth on my own Jonathan winters all right what are we doing someone's on the phone I think who's there Jeff thank you Vic what's going on man oh not much just procrastinating at work oh yeah it looks like you're at home are you at home working from home working from home I'm trying to help a farmer his fritters from [ __ ] in the creek well what's her name though what where are you calling he's a bladder you guys from is that Vladimir Putin on your head oh it's karl Pilkington okay why would you get why'd you wear a hat like that of all places on my show where are you calling from Hamilton Ontario Hamilton Ontario idiots were playing country music back there this country everywhere Tim what do you think I imagined that you have like a map of the United States up there on your screen press buttons that generally I'd be cool like an implication you got anything for me today Jeff or should I move along because I can't like I was gonna ask you mentioned last week that your house is my house my house is a hot box every tree screw in there or is it just barren what's it like in Glendale oh well it this is what this is the this is the confounding thing about living here is it's been absolutely Pleasant the past few days its pleasant today right it's an overcast I apologize I should have started with the weather I shouldn't have gone in my Mork and Garth rants I should have started with the weather which means we should get to the [Music] Thank You Sydney the day is speaking of Glendale our neighboring City Burbank California Burbank California City the day is sponsored by we have a new sponsor today sponsored by seed seed protein spray it's kind of an interesting product for all you health nuts out there so the supplement I guess seed protein spray few nutrients are as important as protein if you don't get enough through your diet your health and your body composition will suffer average consumption of about is about 50 grams through a normal diet so if you just your regular guy or a gal you're eating your regular food you're gonna get about 15 percent that's the bare minimum and experts say you need a lot more so seed protein spray adds an additional 18 to 20 percent it's great for increased energy weight loss and general health and immunities seed is an organic blend of animal protein largely consisting of a blend of semen from Bowles and Buffalo there's is it easy to use nasal spray dispenser two quick pumps of seed into your mason is the easiest way to boost your daily protein intake so you just I guess I don't know I don't know what the consistency of it is but I guess they extract protein from the bowl sperm semen whatever it is what is the difference between sperm and semen semen is the seamen's inside the sperm seeming sperms in the sperms the worm big dog so maybe it's not semen maybe it's the sperm I don't know whatever whatever they get however they get the seed product they extract it from the testicles of the bowl and the buffalos or the animals but I don't smell them but and Doug you're vegetarian correct that's correct you're correct so this is exciting now there's a vegan option that's entirely plant-based so you can get the same protein boost without using animal products at all so how do they do that it's made from animal proteins I guess they just extract the proteins from the kale or whatever and they say it's the same exact product same results same price go to SPP dot tim i would like the same n slash office out do it go to F go to s PP dot semen slash office hours and get a 10% discount on seed proteins right that the semen from the bull could be vegetarian it could be ethical if the cow isn't if the bull was into it well that's it so that that's why this is vegan because it's a similar situation people are vegetarian but they they they have milk so I don't think that they're slaughtering the Bulls to get to come I think they're extracting them through masturbating machine or something [Music] okay anyway all right speaking of what's your name though speaking how could I possibly transition thank you that's the end of the city of the day Burbank California weather is weather is beautiful today partly cloudy in the morning clearing up in the afternoon high of 75 that's we don't want it if you're gonna pick a temperature for the day you want I think you went 75 to

why don't these guys mover to twitch things are much it's a rosier situation over there but I took inspiration from you because I set up like a calling situation okay and how do you like that do you like hearing from people or is it a big waste like it is for me I'm trying to be like Tim styling you know not suffer fools you know that's the key folks do not suffer fool I do not suffer fools keep it moving I want to be respectful and I I do think that some things happen on our show where because of the zoom it's gotten a little smaller and the old days I used to have Skype open and I didn't have anybody I mean I still don't have anybody screening really but I'm dying but I do like the randos and the people that are calling to yell at me I miss getting kind of yelled at but thank you I don't have an opportunity because everybody's so nice so even if you have to make something up let's create some false Christ's and false problems but maybe maybe it's good maybe people don't want to because you get so much acrimony and so much people yelling at you online and you get so much on the cable news programs maybe this is a you know a respite positive happy hashtag or anyways that's the way to be right there so you got some new music out or what [Laughter] listen if you want whatever I just want to say I'm so excited to be on office hours because I love Stour there's another Bauer

this great idea yesterday because - we add we put up the eye jammer itself the poop tube that has to be you on that edit this funny idea because Eric got a message from somebody that did the eye that was in the eye jammer commercial because we're putting the eye jammer up for auction for charity as adults now the innocence project that today's charity Matt is the Innocence Project okay so everyone donate to that we're not doing a matching thing oh is that what you guys get criminals back on the streets no it's where we get fair trials for people that have been wrongly accused I don't know but

the show so Tom there's some music with you all right where's my special guest Andrew Callaghan I'm officially hey there is your you're alive you're not full of mud where are you calling in from I'm calling in from the Seattle oh my god good work so weapons didn't they change the name oh yes Capitol Hill occupied I think it's it's chop now Chuck I still think did you get that last test did you get that classic all right well you're our eyes on the eyes on the prize eyes on the scene our man on the scene what's the vibe what's the vibe there is it as bad as Tucker Carlson says it is that's sort of the joke I'm trying to make no but it's it's kind of more like a party than it is like a protest yeah so I'm not you know so it's definitely something interesting going on there it's fun like I've I saw everyone I've ever met ever known in Seattle and like a one-day period it's pretty much like the whole city's out and park where is it in the real in the relation to the city so Alex Jones says in downtown Seattle which is in downtown Seattle now if you go down downtown soda then we go to the Pike Street Market you just just like the magic word that causes just full explosion on the [Laughter] Capitol Hill is it lights the top of the hill above downtown okay it's like my own neighborhood it's like the hipsters sort of like really recently gentrified Amazon employee neighborhood now right yeah but is it this is it like it's nuts is it City Hall there's no random-ass part of town hey Hilda cly berry done down its cap rows like the coolest [ __ ] in Seattle and they just took it over this yeah Kylie they took over like four square blocks of it so like Marcus code yeah it's called Cal Anderson Park it's like the biggest park in the city it's like the Dolores and San Francisco's like same idea they took it over and then the couple blocks adjacent including the police precinct that's the craziest part thinking is cop shop in the city so the precinct like when things were really getting kind of crazy with the with the the first few days of the protest and there and there was some looting and stuff the cops just said we're out of here yeah they won't even say they won't say who made the call they're just like the mayor's like it wasn't me the chief of police was like it wasn't me either but somebody wasn't going hey look out of here I'm going home this is too much they didn't give me my egg mcmuffin they've been feeding out of the the houseless folks right they've been kind of taking care of them right yeah over there everything that's there's a premium on that so yeah Andrew I saw you you've been all over the place you have not stopped this has not slowed you down this definitely not it's no greater for me because there's less people out here yeah so you've been going out pretty much so you you first started going out talking to all the people that were protesting the masks those are amazing but what was this thing you were doing the other day where those that Joker gang in Florida that is that has a strange little subculture of our of our country what is sundown there it's like I don't know it's just Florida it's weird I hit one thing this is like Central Florida influence or like culture like people trying to go viral but like making funny faces and getting body modifications right like yelling at the camera all Florida men we just like wind up with all these people or like semi viral in Florida and we're like yeah let's do something crazy I was it's funny would you guys chill out when I'm talking and these guys are out of control they're so hopped up on something to the coffee burn the hell out of my mouth like coffee there is this maybe you have something to say about this but I was this morning my wife was looking on Facebook and she saw this compilation of people doing this prank where they were smacking their husbands in the head with their handbag as they got in the car have you seen this thing and it was like no it was like it was kind of funny because he's like it was this thing where a woman would get in the car and they have the dash cam on and she would like go to put her bag in the backseat and hit her husband in the head and then come back and hit him again and it's all about the reaction this guy be like what the [ __ ] like in some guys but I was like how do it was clearly like an internet thing that people got the the message to do and it spread and it became like a compilation thing but there is this and I was like how did they know to do this and she was like you don't you live in a totally different world than a lot of people these people and so like you find these little subcultures and sub things that are that exist online and and you say like Florida Central Florida influence do body modifications to get famous on the internet it's just like it's so strange and it's so out of our my world that it's just it's fascinating to see what you did this thanks man yeah Lorna man okay so have you ever have you felt when you were in the in the middle of it in Minneapolis stood and and now you're up there in Seattle do you ever do you do you ever like feel or even with these Joker guys do you ever feel like scared for your sake no I only really feel scared and like super like right-wing environments yeah I mean the protestors were awesome everyone I met in Minneapolis when she was on fire was super cool yeah it's mostly just like these yeah like the lockdown protests in California was kind of scary well get in your face but because you're not very confrontational with anybody at all but just like people people like that especially like the coronavirus conspiracy crowd like they demand to be taken super seriously remember they don't say so it's like after we made that first video in California we tried to cover a second rally which was reopened Colorado rally in Denver at the Capitol and people were like beefing with us harder like these guys are liberals they don't [ __ ] believe in the truth right they're trying to like snatch the mic out of our hands and stuff [ __ ] yeah I saw that in Philly serious in Philly those guys were going after this reports that unicorn riot is that yeah yeah they're doing good work great yeah there they were just filming these guys protecting the Christopher Columbus thing and this these guys were [ __ ] you guys were hitting this guy I mean they were smacking him you could see it and then they took his bike and cut his tires it's pretty savory those guys get away with that [ __ ] I don't know yeah Philly's a weird one because you still have like Irish Italian urban racist white population yeah you don't see that most people move to the suburbs I thought a long time ago of it are you uh does the work you do make you depressed or up or or optimistic about our future honestly I don't know probably more so not optimistic about the future but I don't know but I don't know what the world's really like because I only seek out the craziest things yeah in a sense my fingers on the pulse but I mean I think most people are just living day to day pretty regularly yeah if you put your finger randomly on a population center in the United States and walked around that neighborhood and spent three days probably talking to people you'd probably be bored your mind right exactly I'm that's the next that's when we do your show if hopefully we do your show somebody does our show we have to go out and sell it somewhere that's it that should be there should always be a segment where we just create the most boring longest boring content where you're just talking to somebody about their Costco shopping list or something like that in like Salt Lake City yeah all right man well listen thank you for calling in be safe and what are you gonna do today I'm just gonna set up my tent at the chop and I'm gonna live in the tent for the next few days I'm just interview people there

they know about you because I started watching you when I was I think like seven and it traumatized the hell no see you get killed by by Eric so I'm wondering if your kids have have seen any of this content what do they think about it has anything scarred them like it did me I don't know it's too early to say they could be terribly speed they could be being terribly scarred right now I don't really show that much they've picked like I think Amelia who's almost seven now is very aware and she's seen something she it was very very much around when we were doing Decker so she was I knew about Decker and knows you know has seen stuff on on my screen when I'm watching stuff for whatever she knows about this show and she's always impressed because like John does the record Ralph and Jack does the Kung Fu Panda and all that stuff like my friends that are in her kinds of shows she's more excited about your kids and your work thank you and your life as a whole it's something that people can appreciate I think you know it's just a terrific experience to be able to be somebody like you to watch me well thank you neat all right all the best to you be have a great day I have one we've got someone else from the chop that we had set up earlier okay Marisol's Barry hello I'm fantastic I'm actually right here in the chop one block out less than one block from the east precinct where these guys have the chopped residents now call like town square Wow so but you're inside there's no I just gotta take your word for it that's all I got to do I have to take a leap of faith that you are not putting me on you're not in are you are you but I'm on the road and we're on the road you see there right there behind us about a 200 feet that's the East precinct right there and if we turn down right over here got a little choppy there it's getting choppy in the chop no I want this I want the eyes on this eyes in the sky what about the this is so our Andrew Khalid you know call gas no brakes by any chance do you know those guys do you know that guy and all again you got to check it out terrific he was just calling in and he was saying that that area is kind is like it's like hipster Ville or it was or whatever it's like it's not the way it's being presented by tonight it's been here from day one well before chap or chop or or Chaz when it was just protest I could say that this neighborhood is actually a very see ya know capital I mean although it is the arch district you got a lot of first responders to live here and also a lot of tech rose from Amazon Google and Facebook who actually gentrified the neighborhood and so that's the that's the the heart and soul of actually who's pushing this right on top of that you have all these other people who come in so the people that are living in that square that four block square area are supportive of what's happening whoa so here's here's the story and I'm glad that you asked so we'll just wait right there Bobby I'm glad I'm glad that you asked because see really what happened is is how they started is people wanted a peaceful march past the East precinct the police refused to let them do that and then like not this Monday like this last Monday but the Monday before is when they got funky and I'm the one who filmed that actual pink umbrella footage too when the police starting the riot over there and the the police put so much tear gas and pepper spray and rubber bullets into the mix that the residents just got pissed man I mean they live in the neighborhood and that's why this has been sustained this isn't like a destination protest where you got to go down the Wall Street or down to downtown these are the people live in the neighborhood who are like yo this is unbelievable that their Police Department would have such a disproportional response so a lot of people who didn't even care about police didn't know who George Floyd was you know tear gas got in their house made their kids sick and they came out on the streets that's beautiful I mean do you feel like there's a complete insane I mean it's just this an insane disconnect between what's happening in front of your eyes and the way that Trump talks about it or Tucker Carlson or they're gonna bring in the National Guard I mean it's it's you must be feeling like you guys got to come down here and see what's happening for an hour yesterday cuz they did their their fact-checking or myth-busting and everything else and some of the questions they asked me I was like men are you serious right like one of the questions was are we here that people neighbors and chance are going door to door looking for Russians and I'm like dude there's a Trader Joe's three blocks away and a Kroger two blocks away and they were very serious they were like no these the reports were here and then it was like that they're checking people's IDs and everything they're be honest which you has become such a tourist destination they might need to add a visa fee around here yeah just say you're opening up the barricades to let the oat milk delivery come in right mean you gotta let me make sure the oat milk is getting to people so it's been real interesting out here and it was also what's been interesting is it has been sensationalized man you know I mean and it's not perfect as a journalist you know I see both sides of it and I see that there's people that are out here that are you know I mean they're they're making it up on the fly to be honest with sure it's messy it's gonna be messy it's gonna be it's not gonna be a perfect situation it's gonna there's going to be people that take advantage of a situation but the spirit of it seems very true and very you know positive to do was peacefully walk past the precinct they never asked for a precinct man they don't expect the police to just I mean with the police were like she knows the one expected that really meant that they were gonna board it up and leave they just thought they were gonna remove the barricades out the streets and so the protesters went for some guys who were just protesting so now they have like a 200 million dollar building in their asset in their hands they never ask yeah well I gotta get up there and come in and you know hang out I don't know why not I love tell you we got a very big production loft here man you know what I'm saying yeah that's right here literally right next to the east precinct you come up here to Seattle man we love to host you as we should do it do a remote show from the top like over the summer what's gonna happen when it gets cuz it gets it could get nasty there and see I know weather believe me I've been up there when it gets there you gotta get in so you can't be outside what's gonna happen you know you're our guys but if you weren't our guy and I'll tell you that people can also rent a tent on Airbnb all right all right Omari well thank you for your on the ground first-person perspective I

get pretty severe and Seattle and Washington was one of the early outbreak zones but they've seemed to have gotten it under control up there I believe but I don't know Doug and I were talking about this we need an expert on Corona kovat we need somebody that knows what the hell's going on I don't think anyone does somebody a friend of mine made a good point that it is it's winter in Australia and New Zealand and and and cases have dropped there so looks like it's on the rise in Seattle okay cool well in New Zealand there's no cases anymore right no new cases they cleared it out the truth and then I heard it was getting weak that the virus itself was getting weaker but who know this right here's what's happened in our country under the regime of Donald Trump that all all credibility all like trust in institutions which you know has been eroding for a long time now has just completely been wiped off the map the germ has gotten so brilliant all right the house the technologies that Linksys is blinking over there whatever very packed house really what's our numbers son of a [ __ ] come on listen well the reason that happens is the tech works when when we start lagging and things drop people split I'd split I wouldn't stick around I'm out of there but now that we've got things running and we put a lot of work and do it now I want to thank patreon.com slash office hours live

I got the name of that show drying because you called my Shore there one be sure but it's let me sure sorry sorry so what are you glass co yep he and Glasgow and Glasgow as a cola and what's your life my belief am I really going to talk a bit the way along it's basically a weather related show on it I love talking about the word it's actually quite nice Asajj the quay on each day today perfect weather is the is Scotland going to like divorce itself from the UK what's going on up there I'm 40 to leave I've wanted to leave the UK authorities for independence and but obviously then the law the Unionists law one and see without harm that was it I just didn't understand really talk about her I don't know I just I'm that sort - its dealt with once its voters say if I just I just can I show up if any break my heart you know I just thought the other way I talk about any meal and incense breaks lots of people are seeing ring that said that's it because Scotland forty the games breaks people were saying Scotland forty to stay sore rate Luba needs and dependents and I've said no we voted to stay in the Union and go with whatever the UK as a whole this thing I don't wonder right but that's were heartened so I can't like seeing up a second myself really you know it cannot place not but I swore tooth ok nothing right like Miranda but there's no there'll always be another opportunity I'm sure if it comes up again right you could they said once in a lifetime oh man the part of the how forty from the party that brought the whole day for in them and they made a mistake because they said this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and because they said that once the what happened they must they start talking about great west have another referendum because I break sir everybody else's save or loss other people say no no no no no no no you said once-in-a-lifetime road but if it paints a longer life thing is it's getting longer and there's only five years twenty five twenty five years it used to be as a wave don't like Saudi yeah sort it no life thing generation generationally once in a generation right hi generation so it was thought that's that technically could be sex sixteen or something I could be sixteen years technically biologically depends on you know but there's a that's okay but it's a heels I just what I feel like I getting it up there and just be in Scotland for a while like no no there's no reason you think there's not room for me and you up there oh no no no no coming by all means yeah no coming and holiday but I thought you were meaning like you need to get away hey what's happening America you know here anybody who I remember people here was saying or I'm second us country it's telling other or late when or whatever and any luck a bit something like see Denmark and then Denmark ends up getting ready their left-wing lot and putting it in a right-wing what write something anywhere you go yeah any country flare-ups and similarly and it swings to the right and in all swing it or left so nothing everything else got well your right is I should just stay put but it's so it's so unbelievably hot here I got to get to somewhere with

you and it's like a sedation it's just always good as John Horner and I thought what if they bring that done I mean anybody like 200 years ago up a lil as they're all done it's like about Pearson very much so well if they take that then that's think you know it's not so much for the statue but for the column gonna put the coin I was a little disappointed in John Cleese because John Cleese got into this saying like well if they're going to take their these statues down what about the Romans - I see a mr. fight but he's been talking [ __ ] yeah it's like dude nobody's [ __ ] talking about that but it doesn't seem like something that they would have made fun of is somebody giving a [ __ ] about statues like Monty Python would have been like we represent these old statues who cannot will be taken down committee I Aissa he's been his birthday he said some sort of a Scottish vocalizes we just um tenement dwelling scum or something around it but I think he meant in a jokey rosanna way but if every feels also he he comes up with some trained and appears in oh when I saw he was trend and I had hoped he was dead it does it seems like like were you in on the joke back then when you're doing those those shows and movies like maybe you were like you didn't get the point of view of the of this your own work but why you like bike when he was what John Cleese yeah yeah I like what he's like Python was so much like making fun of Authority and making fun of like establishment and and sort of the norms of like how silly the British kind of the institutions were you know just where anything like that always just Peck there's a group of people and you don't like one of the other people just see the talent Brazil they see what their Morrissey and Johnny Marr yeah yeah everything that Morrissey has said he's tumblr but can I bring it over then you can just see like Johnny Marr yeah I'll say Michael Palin Michael Palin's gotta be I you can't it's it's Michael Palin I see it we who have us died simulating turn Chapman was the one who saw the guy who just recently Terry Jones Katie George said to him yeah okay okay no sorry I'm going I'm Noah and still getting the pay one sorry no no no and everybody can chill out nobody cares everybody shut the [ __ ] up can it will take a joke I'm John Cleese let's take a joke or something that's right and then people yell at me cuz I gave [ __ ] and they're like how dare you speak against the view you wouldn't have a career if it weren't for Monty Python you have no right to pick what right what I'm not allowed as I'm not allowed to goof on John Cleese and not allowed to make fun of other comedians yes I'm sorry I might once we're done a bet may I go and I see if they might want me somebody's gonna be [ __ ] deeds today anyway yeah know that I'm going it there I'm just saying by natural causes of course he's all bloated he's got this massive his I mean I'm not one to talk I'm not in great shape but it's just I seen you you look great by the way I'm gonna tell you very much I'm really good we're like the same age high seven up a few days ago I think it was like I don't know I was some there was some reason

let's me Liverpool you know a little bit so I let me I gotta go because I want to let some of the audience chimed in today and well thank you very much thanks for having me one it's a pleasure to meet you I hope we develop a natural friendship over this because I did the right thing I'm reached out to you thank you very much Safina Beckham on I'm like doing all right take care Celia the best all right we didn't you and made it happen that would be neat we'll talk to the weirdest thing about doing the show is there's this residual like Lemmy stays up on the screen for like an additional like five seconds after we're done talking so I'm always like curious like what's the face what's happening is he is he like gonna go [Laughter] how about talk to Chad withers got excited when I said Chad Chad what's going on man you need to unmute okay why because for yesterday I'm in the Dallas area steven crowder was out here and evidently dick is going hard on him on Twitter posting stuff like messages between images oh yeah Vic with the burger burger published are posted some just some DMS yeah oh is it I sent you guys a great clip from the movie Casper wait what thank you in crowder know between me and Greg Gutfeld from Fox yeah it was on the majority yesterday but I have Vic on my show so I'm going to talk to him about then you just play the clip from the majority or no we don't need to do that Nick burger you um the question is my question to you is first of all talk me through that what did Crowder do or say or what did gut Phil do or say the other day that that triggered you to oh yeah published yeah I mean a private message because like you know he was you know before Trump and everything he was like this libertarian guy and suppose he was like you know wasn't trying to hurt people I guess he was just trying to do his thing and just huh give us a painting of him but he had a massive shift after at the Trump came in and now I saw him like railing against the protesters and and just smearing a lot of people that are just trying to do good just helping this he's awful agenda yeah so and you always hate Crowder yeah Crowder's a horrible human being but he but he's not even American - he's Canadian so he's weighing in on these you know right American issues stirring [ __ ] up and and he his audience is very young they're like middle schoolers and he's just like he's you know just getting people middle school they really are the majority are like middle schoolers and and young high school he likes to debate and he has like children try to change his mind yeah and he goes - yeah only shows up but college campuses right and and gets in people's faces and stuff but I yeah so I I had all these guys block but then people send me stuff all the time then it triggers me and I get angry and so I saw and I have this stupid history with weird Mike Tsarevich and I and somebody showed me gut filled sharing Serna vich video promoting him so that's a three row that's a three-hour yeah three alarm and I've only I talked the Gutfeld a few times like heat and it was always him coming to me because I guess he liked my videos I met gutfeld like five or six years ago after a stand-up show he was yeah he was like I'm the voice of reason on Fox News yeah but he's just like yeah but he's really not and drank the kool-aid yeah and he's hurting people pushing these false narratives so I saw that and then and I normally would never do this I would never release I know I know do not worry unless you go on Fox News but I so then I just pulled up these chats that I had with him about Sarah vich and him bashing her - how pathetic he is and how awful he is and how Crowder makes certain which makes Crowder look talented and everything so I released that next to the screenshot of him sharing services just to show him how far he's you know sold out for this for this hey so who's on the line right now again I can't see him my favorite what yeah just so you saw Crowder in the front he was well he was outside of Dallas my buddy's posted a picture of him out there he was evidently out there for like 15 minutes nobody talked to me list sounds like a big waste of time yeah died Vic you said somebody Skylar a friend of ours yes guy Lafayette what was there and asked him about what guilt get Feld said about him you can just check out my Twitter and if you want to read the whole thing we don't have to go down that dark road but you know just this just I know these people just terrible and then yeah yeah like and like yesterday Crowder was yeah he was in Dallas saying he has a sign out that says the Cova death count is inflated changed my mind just putting out these false narratives and and he and also I saw this video of him that I posted today of him just there's a in in Dallas again there's a an artist painting over plywood that's up to protect the store oh yeah you don't like it looked like it was gonna be this beautiful silhouette like painting nice thing in his newer hole is to bring the community together and he's painting inspirational art on plywood that people put up and he's they're harassing this guy and just made him look bad and then he's bashing them afterwards so that just I don't I just don't know what else to do how to get these people you know around it's just pushing such negative I mean yeah you just hope that it I mean I don't know you just gotta so some dis some so some discord between people like gut filled in Crowder so they kind of like right right yeah cuz it for years everybody you know you know there's rational and and are there on the left or just like you know sees what they're doing that hasn't gotten through them and that hasn't stopped them it seems like a total mess over there cuz then like Ann Coulter she's like all anti Trump now and like three years ago she put a book out called like you know in Trump We Trust or a truck now yeah I think she's pretty like this guy's a [ __ ] right listen to anything you have to say who's that laughs I feel like it's I don't know all right listen it's already 11:30 and we have to go if you want to listen to what Chad you seem upset what oh it has something yeah come on I'm a manager of a music video and I was just wondering some of your friends there's my wife hearing musicians I was just wondering like kind of what the climate is amongst people from my perspective that somebody put stuff it's like there's not good live music for who knows how long I was just wondering like if that's kind of starting to resonate in your musical friend circles um yeah I mean I haven't talked to deeply with anybody I think people are just hoping that that this will be a lost year that dr. Bauer well yeah Bauer's at home living with his parents I mean I think that's the reality right there same MO I think you know life goes on will life will go on I think and it'll it'll be a long time I guess relative you know but it's all relative like in three years will we I mean three years is a long time when it comes to like how am I going to pay the bills but you know I feel like people it's still too early to know how what's gonna happen next year I think there's an optimism that there'll be a vaccine and that you know this will magically go away but yeah I mean certainly the more we learn I guess about the how the virus spreads is like endure we all grow like indoor bars and clubs and music venues seem like a good place to be you know so I've said this before and it's a bit it's a bit grim but you know the period of time that we were in the 20th century where popular music has become this polite thing where I think Mick Jagger said like that we have [ __ ] private planes and weird way of like we're treated as kings is a very very small little chunk of history for entertainers you know historically entertainers were very low on the totem pole when it comes to you know their value and that seems to be resetting a quite a bit so because I mean it's because this perfect storm happened where a certain demographic had the buying power and their only way to get things were through you know buying a record and that's all changed in the past 10-15 years so I don't know what's gonna happen I mean a lot of people I didn't like people have fans who are buying their music or supporting their merch and continue to do that if you're if your favorite if you have ten fifty what is going on back there playing me out if you're a fan of the Eagles try to get to the my mom's your Bob Dylan and your and your fan of the Eagles Bob Dylan should be buying all the Eagles Mirchi ken is actually doing it dry then performance show a different driving theatres as we broadcast live that's $100 so what's the problem everything got so out of whack you have [ __ ] Fleetwood Mac going out there playing for $300 and you know Built to Spill or whoever is like you know it's all out of whack so maybe there needs to be some kind of big resetting in the way yes you know how music is paid for how music is how art is served compensated you know it seems like it's gonna be I don't know what the answer is but it is totally out of whack that you have an insane exorbitant costs for some things but I'll tell you the guy that goes on the road and does shows that with a high production value they're not cheap to do I mean traveling is expensive you know so and it's if you're a band if you're like [ __ ] Vampire Weekend or something who I love you're traveling with like 2030 people [Music] all right listen if you want to hear more about my thoughts on this and we'll talk about there's a war brewing in in two parts of the world we're gonna talk about we could talk about this overnight chris d'elia stuff I don't know we can talk about anything you want call us I get on with kids Paul and join the discussion at office hours after hours at the patreon.com slash office hours live thank you so much to my guests Andrew Callaghan lemmie Omari from the chop power up there in saddle and boo-boo-boo-boo-boo bower make that Boyd Bauer calling in it all right everybody peace to you we have a show next week on Thursday morning okay back to Thursday and then we're going to take a week off or a little summer vacation summer Buster's gonna take a little road trip okay I love you talk to you soon are the best east year [Music] [Music] [Music] are the seasons they do change [Music] what
