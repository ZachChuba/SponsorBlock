[Music] [Music] [Music] good afternoon it is Wednesday April 22nd and you are looking at a live view of Falcon 9 as it awaits it's the 331 p.m. Eastern Time launched from pad 39a at Kennedy Space Center in Florida hello from SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne California my name is Lauren Lyons and I'm an engineer on the Starling team here at SpaceX and you are watching a live webcast for our seventh StarLink mission and our seventh mission this year to date we've launched over 360 StarLink satellites to orbit and as a reminder StarLink is a constellation of satellites that can provide high speed low latency internet across the globe particularly in remote areas where connectivity is limited or completely unavailable the Falcon 9 booster that you see on your screen will be plot flying today for the fourth time it previously supported crew dragons first demonstration mission to the International Space Station back in March of 2019 the launch of the radar set constellation mission in June 2019 and the January 2021 launch of the Starlight mission just like our first stages we are also starting to reuse our pharynx today we are flying a reuse fairing which previously flew on the a most seventeen mission last year I mentioned that this booster flew on crew dragons first demonstration mission to the space station and if you follow SpaceX you know the date for our second demo mission is May 27th it'll be a historic mission launching American astronauts from US soil to the International Space Station for the first time since 2011 and we'll touch on that more later on in the broadcast if for any reason there is a hold on the countdown today we do have a backup launch window opportunity tomorrow at 3:16 p.m. East so with that all systems are go for an on-time liftoff this evening now you may recall during our last StarLink mission there was an early engine shutdown on Falcon nines first stage during ascent the Falcon 9 booster safely completed its mission as it was designed to in the event of an engine shutdown and delivered the satellites to their intended orbit since then our engineers determined that the issue stemmed from a small amount of isopropyl alcohol which is a cleaning fluid that became trapped inside of a sensor dead leg or an area where it couldn't flow through and then ignited we did not perform that cleaning process on the rocket supporting today's mission and all nine Merlin engines which were test fired on the pad just last week are looking healthy ahead of flight prior to today's launch the vehicle was housed in our hangar at launch complex 39a until about 24 hours ago when the rocket along with the Starling payload was rolled out to the pad and raised vertical the bottom two-thirds of the vehicle that you can see there that is the first stage you can actually see the suit markings left over from its last flight the first stage is what accelerates the vehicle through the Earth's atmosphere to the edge of space with the help of nine Merlin engines at the base of the rocket today we'll be attempting to recover the first stage for the fourth time on our drone ship of course I still love you which you can see there and it's currently stationed about 350 nautical miles northeast off the cape above the first stage is the second stage which has a single single Merlin vacuum or in vac engine which ignites after the first stage separates the second stage is what will carry the Starling satellites into an elliptical orbit above the Earth's surface from there they'll use their propulsion systems to move up to their operational altitude of 550 kilometers Falcon 9 began loading propellants at t-minus 35 minutes and as a reminder you use a rocket grade kerosene or our p1 as our fuel and super chilled liquid oxygen or lux as our oxidizer to fat power the Falcon 9 currently our p1 and lox are nearly fully loaded on both stages and LOX will continue to be right up until the last minute of the countdown the stack of 60 StarLink satellites is safely enclosed inside of the 17 foot diameter payload fairing which you can see there that pointed cone at the very top of the rocket this protects the satellites from Aero thermal heating aerodynamic loads and contamination during ascent once we reach the vacuum of space we will jettison the fairing as the second stage continues on its journey to orbit we won't be attempting to catch the fairing hats and our Nets today as our boat and fairing software are undergoing upgrades but weather permitting we will try to recover them from the water using our recovery ships in this tree and this chief and there's a live view from one of those ships so as you can see the water is looking a little rough so stay tuned now if you've been tracking the lead up to today's launch you know that the weather has been a watch item for the last several days with tornado warnings moving through the area our rocket and payload however were in the hangar as the storm passed so we didn't see any adverse impacts as a result of that weather and today it's looking like a beautiful day for a launch so with that the vehicles satellites weather and range are all looking good for an on-time liftoff just a few minutes from now [Music] as I mentioned at the top of the webcast SpaceX and NASA are now targeting May 27 for Falcon 9 launch of crew dragons second demonstration mission or demo two as we like to call it this will be the first time that a commercially built spacecraft will launch people to the space station and the first time in nearly ten years that the US has launched astronauts into space from US soil demo two is an end-to-end flight test from launch to docking to splashdown and it is the final major milestone for SpaceX is human space flight system to be certified for NASA for operational crewed missions to and from the International Space Station Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will be the first two NASA astronauts to fly aboard crew dragon after completing countless hours of training both at SpaceX and at NASA's training facilities both the spacecraft and the launch vehicle are at the Cape and undergoing preparations and as you may have seen on social Falcon 9 is getting a special paint job for the demo2 mission that's right nASA has brought back the famous worm logo as you can see the logo painted on the demo2 Falcon 9 booster in this picture the worm was brought back to mark the return of human spaceflight on American Rockets from American soil with the demo2 mission once demo 2 is complete and the SpaceX and NASA teams have reviewed all the data for certification NASA astronauts Victor Glover Mike Hopkins Hopkins Shannon Walker and Jackson astronauts amici Noguchi have been assigned to fly on dragons first six-month operational mission which we are calling three one and are targeting for later this year so we are just currently just over four minutes away from liftoff and Falcon 9 is moving into the final stages of the countdown the first and second stages are nearly fully loaded with 1 million pal kerosene fuel and liquid oxygen it's a clear beautiful gorgeous day out there the first it's a clear beautiful gorgeous day out there the first stage should finish prop loading at t-minus three minutes and the second stage at t-minus two minutes and as I mentioned earlier liquid oxygen is going to continue to top off up until the just before liftoff at t-minus 60 seconds be sure to listen for the call out that Falcon 9 is in startup that means that the Rockets autonomous internal flight computers have taken over the launch countdown the StarLink payload continues to be healthy the Falcon 9 team is tracking no issues on the rocket weather is looking really good and the range is green for launch so with all that let's just sit back and listen into the last few minutes of the countdown [Applause] Stage two locks what is closed out [Music] [Applause] oh please go for launch [Applause] t-minus 30 seconds [Applause] [Music] t-minus 15 seconds 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 because she ripped off okay now it's pushing down right stage-1 propulsion is nominal [Applause] [Music] oranga literature no Middleton see Falcon 9 has had a successful look up on pad 39a moments ago we draw that the engines down second for preparation for pax cute max Q stands for maximum aerodynamic pressure which is the highest stresses that the vehicle will see during ascent maximum aerodynamic pressure now coming up in about a minute we will have three events happening back to back first is main engine cutoff or Miko this is where all nine and 1d engines will shut off to slow the vehicle down in preparation for the second event which is stage separation this is where the second stage will separate from the first stage with stage one making its way back down to earth for landing and stage two kicking off that third event that I mentioned which is SCS 1 or second start 1 this is where the M vac engine will light up and propel the second stage along with the StarLink satellites to orbit expecting me go to occur in about 30 seconds Mikko stage separation confirm successful D'Amico successful stage step and it appears we have reignited or ignited that second stage engine for SES one now we're just a few seconds from fairing deployed again this fairing has flown before on a previous mission screwed fans are opening up their inspiration Kermit and we have fairing separation we have successfully reuse this fairing and now those halves and making their way back down to the sea where hopefully we can scoop them up so on the left side of your screen you have stage 1 which it's making its way down to the drone ship and on the right you have stage 2 that in vac engine burning with 250,000 pounds of thrust the grid fins appear to be fully deployed at this point now while stage 2 continues on with the primary mission stage one's got its own plants it's going to execute to burns prior to landing the first is the entry burn that's where we will reignite three of the m1d engines which will help slow the stage down as it re-enters the upper part of the Earth's atmosphere shortly thereafter we'll have a second burn which we call the landing burn this is a single engine burn that brings the vehicle's velocity down rapidly in order to land safely on the drone ship at the same time during that burn you'll see the landing legs will better currently fold it up along the side of the rocket are going to deploy in fact is looking good right now it looks a little overexposed on that image there but we can still see the pollutant coming out and we're still hearing good data so while we're two minutes away from entry burned just a note on these StarLink satellites these 60 will be join in a constellation that's already on orbit as we mentioned we've launched more than 360 satellites and again these are to provide high speed low latency internet to people down on that globe that you see on the right side of your screen the EM vac engine on stage 2 is that pool full power and on a nominal trajectory now as stage 1 is making its way down again there are no engines burning while it's doing this it's basically coasting using the grid fins to steer and you can see those white puffs occasionally that's cold nitrogen gas that is being used for attitude control part of our ACS system or attitude control system [Music] okay that entry burn should be coming up here in about 15 seconds meanwhile stage two continues on as planned Stage one entry burn start up old enough to see this burn goes for about 20 seconds for engines burning it once register continues to follow a nominal trajectory Stage one entry burn shutdown all right successful shutdown of that entry burn meanwhile stage two is looking great all right full-screen shine here there we go now this burn on stage 2 is going to continue up until you hear the call out of Seco one or second engine cutoff one you're going to hear that pretty quickly after landing page one entry transonic right in fact he is beginning to throttle down getting ready for that second engine cutoff Stage one landing burn startup entering terminal guidance alright that landing burn is started let's see if we can see the plume in the view from the drone ship Stage one landing leg deploy if qfd ssafe there it is let's see we have cheers we have a rocket awesome this is the fourth landing for this priestess and as you can hear everybody here is you see it they're great for just a gorgeous racket alright and we have second engine cutoff on stage two and we are in a good orbit as well nominal overall answers all right so now stage two is going to coast in this orbit for a few minutes and during this time the stage will actually start to around a central axis which gives the Starling satellites the momentum that they need in order to space themselves out over time after they deploy we're going to take a quick break and come back here at t plus 14 minute or circle [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome back to the web tour darling wicked so far we have had a successful mission thus far we've had it at stage one ascent and landing and stage two got the Starling satellites into a good orbit and is now coasting and getting ready for deployment of those Starling satellites so we're gonna listen in for the call-out it should come in about 30 seconds or so we won't be able to see that right at that moment we'll cut to the shot of the satellites deploying a little bit later but about 20 seconds we should hear the call-out they'll deploy confirmed okay we just heard the call out for payload deploy now as the satellites begin to separate over time they're going to open up their solar array and over the next oh there they go all right that's those 60 Starling satellites okay now shortly after as I was saying after just coming up in the next you know a few hours or so we're gonna see the solar arrays deploy and over the next days and weeks the satellites will begin to distance themselves away from one another and use their on-board ion thrusters to make their way to their operational orbit of 550 kilometers sorry that image dis is always so beautiful and catches on each time now with that it brings our webcast to a close we'd like to thank the 45th Space Wing for providing Range Safety today and the FAA for licensing today's launch you can follow our website and social media platforms for updates on our next missions and milestones so until next time be well and we'll see you next launch [Music] [Music] [Music]
