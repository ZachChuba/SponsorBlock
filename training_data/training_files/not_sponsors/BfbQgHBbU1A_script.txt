hi it's matt this is the game boy camera from 1998 and this is the box i've just made to drag it into the 21st century by letting me share its tiny pixelated photos onto my phone in just a matter of minutes yes you heard that right it's a game boy accessory made by nintendo it was my first ever digital camera i've had it ever since and i bloody love it it can take and store 30 wonderfully tiny greyscale photos but nintendo never made a way of getting the photos off the camera other than using the gameboy printer or deleting them entirely that's 90s technology for you but then again even my camera phone in the mid-noughties that was incredibly difficult to get photos off that it's taken me two decades of trying but i've finally made a way to take photos off it quickly while out and about i'll show you how it works how i got here and what's inside this magic white box using it's really straightforward first plug in the game boy camera turn it on and wait a minute when it appears connect to the gameboy camera wi-fi network go to gameboy.local on your web browser and all your photos will be visible on the webpage and can be downloaded and if you scroll through you can see the photos you previously downloaded too here's how i got to this point around 2013 i found a really long-winded and unreliable way of getting photos off my gameboy camera it used an old third-party backup cartridge and a usb flash card which was designed for playing homebrew games on real hardware this meant i could finally back up and transfer off the time-lapse video i filmed of a rocket launch in 2001 that i really didn't want to delete and then start using it again to take photos a few years later i started looking for what i'd call the holy grail of the gameboy camera world a way of taking photos off it while i'm out and about so i'm not limited to just the 30 that it can store on its own i'd seen a couple of portable devices but they relied on emulating the game boy printer and you'd have to print each photo to transfer them one by one and that would take longer than the long-winded process i was already using in 2018 it got better i found the gbx cart rw a usb game boy cart reader which made transferring photos off only a two-step process but then i had a brainwave i could make the whole thing portable using a raspberry pi zero tiny computer and a portable battery bank and then do it while i was out and about game boy plugged into board board plugged into raspberry pi zero battery let's turn on turn on the power bank we should turn on the raspberry pi so that's on [Music] that's now i'm gonna take the photos off this and then turn on a wi-fi network there we go see when that dudes just got it there but here's a photo i just took now yay which brings me to the beginning of this year 2021 when i got a 3d printer this meant i now have the ability to design and print a case so the raspberry pi the cart reader and the battery were all in one box let's have a look inside there's a raspberry pi zero w which i programmed to automatically act as a wi-fi hotspot and download photos via the gameboy cart reader whenever it's turned on they're connected together using a usb micro otg cable which i shortened and shaved down the plastic around the connectors to fit in the box and then for power an adafruit micro lipo battery charger a battery and a switch i'm still very new to 3d design and printing but i managed to make the case in fusion 360. i also saved some time in the design process by only printing small sections of the case every time i changed it that way i didn't have to wait for the whole thing to print to realize that i'd done it wrong and then design it again the button is a top hat shaped print that sits on top of the switch and poked through a hole in the case and finally it needed labeling so i did that with what i had to hand i printed the text on an ohp transparency sheet cut a hole for the button and super glued it onto the case as you can probably tell this is a passion project i've made it for me and i don't intend to make them to sell but the details of how i made it are available the code and setup information for the raspberry pi are on github which i've linked below along with a list of the parts where you can get them and the 3d files for the case if you want to print your own that's all for now but if you make one of your own please tag me i'm at matt grays on all the socials i really want to see how you get on oh it got dark while i was filming this
