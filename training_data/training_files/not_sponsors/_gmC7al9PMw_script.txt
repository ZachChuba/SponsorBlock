Bbomi's Diary
(Bbomi's Diary#05) (The second day of  filming
'Dumhdurum' music video) It's 9:13, it's been 2 days since
we started filming I put on the most comfortable clothes for the day of shooting I've just arrived I eat Gimbap as soon as I arrive Gimbap tastes always good I drink water, too Ha young is shooting a video next to me She looks so cute Ha young, what are you doing? I apply a mask pack after eating Gimbap This is my routine before makeup I apply the mask pack carefully And compete my questionnaire
to show to my fans I fill out the questionnaire one by one But even I don't know
about myself sometimes Then I ask for help from the
management staff and members who know me better than I do What is my habit? You always look for your cell phone Looking for your cell phone Oh, that's right Where do I go often? Atelier? It's been almost 3 years
since I was there (LOL) I'm curious where you are at mostly I don't go out often I finish my routine with a facial mist
after filling out the questionnaire Spraying My makeup artist applies makeup base It's good to use a mask pack
before applying makeup base because it makes flawless, moist skin Now she applies concealer to cover my pimples She covers the pimple
on my left face, too Now she starts applying makeup She curls up my lashes And dabs powder The touch of a professional
is different She applies eye shadow on my right eye Eye liner, too The basic makeup is done I look totally different now, wow Surprised at my different appearance,
I'm going to change clothes I write some comments
that will be included in the album It's 11:44 I like dogs, but I'm cautious
about having a dog Because I know that the loss
of a pet is extremely painful I want to have a dog, but
I suppress myself I'd like to consider
carefully having a dog Everyone, adopt a dog instead of
buying one in pet shops After looking at cute dogs pictures, I have a discussion with my hair stylist about the hair style I like
and start styling my hair It's 12:20, I take a rest eating chicken breast jerky
that Cho rong gave me in my van I check my outfit once again
before the shooting begins Finally, the shooting has started I drink coffee, which is
one of the stage props It tastes better than I thought I stare at the camera Filming the scene in the train is done Now I'm going to film a motion teaser I'm excited because the weather is nice Where am I? Am I in Namyangju-Si? (Oops) It's an important teaser because it's going to be
released just before our come back I strike poses I like I become hungry
after shooting the teaser Me and Eun ji are going to have lunch Having lunch at the filming site
tastes the best First of all, I serve rice and add a lot of broccoli I get low calorie Bossam, too And finally, my favourite pollack stew Thank you for the food I eat the pollack stew first
after sitting myself It feels like it relieves my hangover
even though I didn't drink at all I eat today's hero, Bossam as well as
other side dishes The meal after hard work
tastes always good It looks tasty, doesn't it? I thought I was the one
enjoying the food the most, but Nam joo was enjoying more than I was She eats Ramen at the same time,
how clever! Slurping Nam joo, why don't you shoot
a Ramen commercial? Wow!
She eats an half-boiled egg with Ramen She knows something Nam joo is a person who knows
how to enjoy food to the fullest It's 17:38, I change my outfit, hair
style and makeup for the group scene Look at me I play with myself looking at the camera Why do I laugh so much like that? I play with a bird that was used
for Ha young's scene I almost peed in my pants
because the bird was scary I just stay calm because I'm worried that the bird would fly or get hurt (LOL) The bird gets on my manager's back It's so funny Looks like she thinks that my head
is her nest or something The bird is taking a rest on my head She's so cute After the break, we start
filming the group dance scene Dumhdurum We dance hard and monitor carefully I need a portable fan
desperately after dancing Because it's so hot in there I try singing with the director's mike It's 18:21,
Ha young finds my camera Hey, you should pay me I didn't want, but I think I have to Come on, Ha young Our youngest member asks me to pay her I'll help you when you
start your own channel Now the hardest part has begun Bang We get exhausted and
fall to the floor after dancing hard I make a bad joke
because I'm so tired Do you see my lips?
They're stuck on my teeth Because they're so dry Please give me some water It's 18:39,
the group dance scene is still going on I dance hard till my pelvis hurts I do my best dancing Finally, 3~4-hour group dance
scene filming is over Cut Thank you so much Thank you Some members should stay and
film more scenes But my scenes are done
with the group dance scene This is the best time of the day I'd like to go home as soon as possible
and take a rest I'll show highlight moves
for my fans before I go Now I'm going home This is the happiest face of the day I remove my hair extensions My hair stylists help me because
I can't do it myself Removing hair extensions is one of the happiest moments It feels so good when I comb my hair
after removing the hair extensions I talk with our
management staff briefly about our showcase
and comeback promotions while I remove my makeup Now it's 20:41,
it's time to go home I'm getting off As soon as I arrive home,
I take shower Because I dyed my hair recently, the hair dye stains the towel like this As my skin has been stressed out
for the last 2 days, I don't apply even a mask pack I just apply lotion and Vaseline I monitor the scenes I filmed today Finally, I lie down on my bed,
take a deep breath and stretch myself I turn off the light and think I'm so sad that I can't meet
my fans in person because of COVID-19 crisis
going on around the world Many people gathered together and worked hard to
produce our new album I hope this album
gives strength and courage to all the people having a hard time
because of the crisis and our fans waiting for us I will do the best I can
for the promotion of this album Hope all people can get their life back
as soon as possible and be happy,
you did a good job, Bo mi Bo mi, sleep tight
