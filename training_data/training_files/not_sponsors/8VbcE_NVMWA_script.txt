thanks - Lang for supporting this video I want to start today's video explaining the demographics of China this is a very important context in understanding why Shanghai was such a critical city if one draw a line from hey-ho to Tong Tong two cities on two extreme ends of China one would find Chinese populations extremely imbalanced on two sides ninety four percent of China's 1.4 billion population live in forty two point nine percent of land mass east of the line Shanghai being the estuary of the Yangtze River naturally became the center of commerce and trade centuries ago that's why we're here discussing taslitz Shanghai Factory in the first place not a Tanjung factory not a Beijing factory recently Tesla was approved by the Chinese government to go ahead and produce its model threes in Shanghai Tesla said it could produce one thousand cars per week by the end of the year and three thousand per week sometimes next year this was pretty impressive considering that the factory's construction only started in January however we have just learned that a final manufacturing certificate is still required for Tesla to start official production this is likely to push Tesla's production to the end of 2019 yet this is not the most critical news that came out of Tesla China it is the partnership with CA TL that excited me as I've explained before Tesla's new battery strategy is one of independence vertical integration and self-reliance reportedly working with algae to produce batteries for Shanghai gigafactory algae will now split that capacity with Chinese battery giant CA TL this move is highly welcomed as CA TL has an extensive Ridge in China both with the government and with local supply chain this will save Tesla a lot of time and a lot of trouble but here is the problem CA TL is famous for its prismatic batteries instead of the cylindrical ones made by Panasonic we will see interesting adaptations in that regard either by CA TL or by Tesla the result will be an inevitable change in battery pack efficiency albeit a small one furthermore as Tesla goes on to acquire several battery startups including Maxwell technology and high bar systems having more players in the supply chain could spread a white net there reach out more resources giving Tesla more power to independently make batteries this also comes at a time where Tesla's US domestic sales dropped for the first time in two years the fall is quite dramatic from five point one three billion a year to three point one three billion a 39% Rabia over year the good news once again come from China was sixty four percent in sales to six hundred and sixty nine million sales elsewhere rose for more than a billion to one point eight three billion dollars when production begins in China I can only expect Tesla's Chinese sales to rise to about half that of the United States to 1.5 billion dollars but regardless the major question still remains can Tesla succeed in China like Apple and avoid traps other American companies have fallen into it is no secret that there are industries in China that are protected because of its developing country status but it is also wildly inaccurate to say that all foreign companies are treated unfavorably in China positive examples like Apple cocom Boeing are extremely promising where they have dominated the Chinese market to the extent that the Chinese people and corporations use their products every day procom chips are a big part of Chinese networks because their chips are superior to the Chinese locally produced ones but they're also ample bad examples like Amazon and eBay where they came to China in the early 2000s with high-handed approach knowing they have better technologies the result was devastating for them missing growth opportunities and the Chinese market perhaps better example for Tesla is the American auto giants and their success in China General Motors now manufactures and sells more cars in China than in the United States 3.6 million in 2018 in China compared to a close 2.9 million in the United States they are allowed in China and are making billions of dollars in the Chinese market since Tesla is in the same industry I have no doubt that it will be subjected to the same rules that helped GM succeed if not more favorable we have already seen the Chinese government making a few exceptions for Tesla exempting its tariffs and allowing Tesla to be the first wholly owned for an auto company so Tesla had a good start but what else must has to do to succeed the first thing is to maintain Tesla's superior brand image among the Chinese audiences a Tesla must start its advertisement in China right away although Tesla is a small auto company in terms of sales it is unique in that it spends zero in advertisements where bigger auto companies spends billions of dollars a year this is possible because Tesla has strong followers like us who know the cars quality and are willing to refer Tassler to our friends word to mouth have been a strong methods of growth same thing goes to Tesla China for the first few years but going forward in order for Tesla to continue its high growth in China it has to start doing advertisement campaigns like Apple to tap into the vast market of audiences who have not learned about Tesla advertisements together with words mouth should be a better approach for the Chinese audiences the second important strategy for Tesla to take is to never yield to the pressure to make last premium cars what Apple did write in China was that is sticked with the premium product while its competitors like Samsung rapidly launched a variety of products for different user segments and the results were pretty clear samsung diluted its premium brand and a dramatic drop in sales followed this is a crucial lesson for Tesla to not to diversify and make more cars than it can handle the current pot value of model asks ax + 3 + y is optimal catering to most segments of the Chinese population lastly Tesla must act early to attract premium local suppliers this is important in two aspects raw material security and production cost to be completely Frank here I was confused to have heard that Tesla decided to work with LG for battery that was understandable since LG has worked with Tesla in making its solar batteries but it was best working with the Chinese manufacturer instead of LG since they have better connections with the government and the suppliers through CIT au Tesla can't get introductions to critical partners to advanced Tesla's businesses in China while Tesla is elephant and definitely try it out today at the end of the day I think the right thing for us to take note is the situation of the industry we all are aware of the 2008 and 2009 financial crisis and how that affected the alter mobile industry in such a huge scale and we all remember how General Motors filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and if you are aware of what general motor is right now you be pretty surprised because jano motor as of last year has made over a hundred and forty seven billion dollars and among that ten billion I think eight eight eleven billion is net income and that's a tremendous change of the complexion of the company and I think the the chief lesson that we can learn is that the automotive industry this is the nature of the automotive in three and you have to be Fugo during the time of financial downturn so that you can turn around ten years later when people started buying cars and the good lesson I think we can learn from the GM lesson is that GM made a lot of money I think after the financial crisis in China because the strong growth in the Chinese market and people's desire for buying a car that could be a plus for Tesla because Tesla right now is venturing into the Chinese market but the negative lesson we also have to learn is that during financial downturn like 2008 and 2009 automotive companies need to spend wisely especially for Tesla because Tesla has been very broad Elon Musk has always been extremely tenacious in trying to achieve what he wanted to achieve in the shortest time possible right now with the Shanghai Giga factory and with opening the announcement of the Germany Giga factory a very exciting announcement in the past few weeks Tesla must learn to be frugal and spend wisely in order to be the company that we all want Tesla to be alright thanks so much for watching as always follow me on a creatives on Twitter and Instagram I love interacting with you guys over there so I'll see you there [Music]
