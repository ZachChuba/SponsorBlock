only play with friends tomorrow if you have walked us down this dark alley of a game only to steal our money this is going to be cool yes oh okay okay i'm down with this it's got a tentacle you have any control over it like does the right stick do anything cool that'd be neat that would be cool no but that that's that's really cool little title screen in it that's pretty [ __ ] metal new game okay new game so this is carrying huh whoa yeah break out of your little container oh you're the [ __ ] yeah you're the thing that's the point yo okay so physics see this rocks no way dude okay well and i'm leaving blood everywhere panicking awesome [Music] damn this really just got gets into it didn't it that's so cool around at all and i've got left trigger does [ __ ] oh you can some sort of sonic sonic thing i think it might just be a roar break glass with it no no can you jump down from that and like shatter the glass i don't know actually let's see or are you two i think right now all you can really do is climb through these tunnels oh okay oh [ __ ] did they make you did they make this or did they just like get it capture it i think i don't know it seems like they made me i don't know i guess you guys know exactly as much as i know yeah i haven't i know nothing about the background i can grab objects and then do that oh this rocks this is the best what is this it's so freaking cool wow what can i go in there no okay you wish but maybe someday i [ __ ] love that okay little bastard can i oh you probably grabbed that grate off too oh my yeah grab him i killed him with the thing can you eat them oh yeah fresh flesh of prey can i eat his bum bum it says it says release right stick to pull them towards you and consume them oh okay so let's see well i think that's just legs oh you could eat the legs though look at green parts came out there oh dude that probably kills you or you over you're bigger that do look bigger you look that little green thing is filling up when you eat a part of someone i think oh so maybe you get bigger and smaller depending on how much health you have could be give me these god i'm so gross what the [ __ ] am i tomorrow you're the [ __ ] thing come here you [ __ ] yeah rip that door i wanna [ __ ] you up here that's [ __ ] sad oh my god oh i'm sure it won't be quite as fun once guys start shooting back but wait so consume them all i'm still kind of figuring out let's so that grabs oh do i have to drag them towards my mouth yeah and then release i see okay oh i'm a big man look at that oh you got all five things what does that mean does this mean maximum size i guess god i'm so gross you're so stringy what a nasty little man can i go up you can squeeze in i think i missed something over here let me see real quick okay i guess i didn't miss [ __ ] no okay you can stick to the ceilings or okay that's how you hunt are you proud of me yeah why is it called carry on carrion's just a word for like an animal carcass really i think so i didn't know that so is that what you are like a carcass i mean you turn things into carcasses that's true oh oh you opened something in the other room asking the hard-hitting questions here all right what is the actual definition of carrion in the dictionary this please look it up please i will [ __ ] absolutely scream if i don't know the word for word definition is defined by some [ __ ] in albany yeah maybe i won't look today spread biomass and save this is a save point yeah carrion is the decaying flesh of dead animals whoa look at that whoa so that becomes holy [ __ ] dude you're horrifying are you opening like portals to the void yeah what the [ __ ] squeeze into the void okay okay here we go it's alive wait did you just go to your home dimension oh oh no you're just leaving that was just a regular door it looked like it had teeth i wanted to eat ball paper see look it's got little little alveoli things in it uh yeah i think you put that there though oh i see is this just uh you're you're [ __ ] evil it's just a billboard okay so i can go left what's over here to the right holy [ __ ] i like how you're shaped like a big like weird hot dog what the [ __ ] is that that's your ultimate form the hot dog oh i guess it's probably supposed to look like a centipede or something you can rip those off oh i can't go back out that way you're committed oh spinning my favorite what's down here can i get down there be careful if you try to go down there what if that thing slices you up i don't think i can go down there oh this is easily the most relatable character in video games i do think about doing this stuff quite a bit there you go there's another lever to pull you know me tell me i love weavers come on [ __ ] you know there we go grabbing stuff can be kind of tricky i wonder is this more of a mouse game i was just about to say that could be except i was about to i was about to say it and then um i was gonna say something really cool after it but then now i don't i don't want to say it anymore what were you gonna do no i was gonna say something do something really cool but that would that would have been predicated on me being the first person to say that so now i'm not going to say it [ __ ] okay i'm sorry i didn't mean to ruin your day no you didn't ruin anything in fact i'm glad you said it first because it took the pressure off of me you know thanks law yeah you're welcome see how i did that oh i see caution unprotected yeah just bleed through you can grab grab through it and grab that uh lever oh yeah you can grab down at the lever can't you no i can't go that far no i i think you can get your hand through yeah there you go oh what the [ __ ] did can i you shot your hand through that and it went pretty far i think you could probably hit that lever if you really really gave it your dangest i don't think that's gonna happen you just touched the floor that's its uh grabby tentacles oh okay that's not the oh yeah those are the moving tentacles those aren't the grab mechanic i see all right never mind you probably can extend your range later or something wait can you rip that off to the left though yeah okay i am the big red i wonder what you're gonna fight i know we're gonna go in that little hole oh it's another save i guess can you travel between the two oh yeah it probably gave you a fast travel point whoa oh this is getting so weird i say just go with it what a great [ __ ] idea for a game it's definitely interesting it's kind of like you know remember that game inside yeah yeah when you want to be like that being that thing was like the coolest part they're like let's just make a game out of that could be this thing does move like [ __ ] nothing else like whoa does it feel like anything to control this thing like is there another game that you can think of that like the movement and actions feel similar to um not really i mean it's uh it looks intuitive all you do is you move the analog stick and he goes all over the place you don't really have to do anything okay it's got a bit of a physics feel to it careful with this guy he's got an actual gun oh my god a gun oh [ __ ] yeah rip them to shirts give me that do you ever feel like sometimes with video games that they are constrained sometimes by like reality or by like what we what we are and know what kind of a [ __ ] okay that sounds really stupid right but no no i know exactly what you mean right now you're controlling a thing that like doesn't resemble a person at all yeah and it looks like the mechanics of this game are totally different from any game where you would be controlling a person yeah you know what i mean like in a first person shooter game i feel like a first person shooter game is always going to have to balance some like shitty [ __ ] sniper rifle weapon because those things exist in real life but like why why would you design a game with that in it you know yeah if you just make something completely unique you don't have to do that are you able to even go down that tube at your current size i think so i just there you go okay oh this [ __ ] thing oh you can't hit me oh [ __ ] i feel like i'm overpowered like i mean i think the game wants to start you off that way and they're probably going to make the enemies tougher and tougher as you go and i want to eat every little bit but also it's really hard to aim with an analog stick like this whoa give me that let me eat you there we go i'm gonna try this mouse one sec okay rip that grate off the ceiling yeah that one does it feel better with a mouse kind of now how do you get down through these i feel like that's a power up i'm going to get there probably is power ups to increase your reach yeah it's probably just going to be both times i've seen that there's been a switch on the other side of them so i assume that you just need a longer reach let's go down here and rip that off ripping things off doesn't feel as good with the mouse because it's slower okay but doing that's definitely way easier oh you [ __ ] [ __ ] see the way my little part slithered away yeah that was cool that oh full size yeah i need to get back oh should i go down there let's see mm-hmm dude biomass spread your bayou man speed by thinking about you dude blob monsters i think are always like the [ __ ] sickest [ __ ] have you seen the blob the blob like the movie i've seen one of them i know that they've actually never seen in the blob i've just seen some scenes that you showed me chris the one from the 80s is really cool i'm pretty sure that's the one that i've seen it's like actually scary yeah it's i don't know there's there is something that's like really [ __ ] unnerving about like a giant amoeba or something like that yeah it doesn't discriminate against who [ __ ] kills also can you do anything with that that resembles the container you were born out of wait where was it just like that oh yeah is that oh that's a that's a power up i think yeah break it oh [ __ ] was that a friend oh squeeze in it's gonna give me a power up there we go shoot a cobweb to trap your victims or oh you might be able to use that to pull the lever up top there i can't believe i [ __ ] missed that yeah there you go cool wow i guess that's what power-ups are going to look like in this game do you ever see that that [ __ ] ryan reynolds movie where there's a blob in space and it's strong or something no what are you talking about is that life yeah life yeah i think the game's yeah i think that movie is just called life yeah they find a blob in space and then they're like it's a buff blob and then they're scared of it oh yeah because it's little but it's like super strong and then it keeps growing as it like kills and absorbs crew members that does does it do that i didn't even know that i honestly don't remember oh did you see it yeah i i've seen at least a good chunk of it while yeah i think it was jaxy watching are they dead no no they're fine it just traps them and freaks them out definitely kill them holy [ __ ] that's cool now their body's just screaming on the ground did i cut their head off no okay this is awesome who's screaming man this piece of [ __ ] yum yum yum oh my god what happened to this poor little oh my [ __ ] maybe i shouldn't be eating them until i need them yeah that's they got a lot of nice like convincing screams in this game too yeah that sounds truly horrified i feel like uh have you noticed that like rampage games have kind of disappeared a little bit oh yeah like there used to be like a lot of open world games where you could just like kill npcs even if that wasn't the purpose of the game like hulk ultimate rampage i think a lot of that is thanks to like [ __ ] people getting pissed off about it and saying it like influences kids to kill [ __ ] when they have the option to just kill [ __ ] i guess but like i don't know it's like all we've got now is like rockstar stuff yeah i i i'm not even saying like gta clones specifically i'm just saying there were a lot of games where like like assassin's creed is not necessarily about murdering people on the street but the first few assassins creed you you could just [ __ ] kill people that was just something you could [ __ ] around with and now it's like the last one i played was the pirate one and you you [ __ ] you straight up cannot murder people as a pirate wait what does that say about echo locate nearby nearby hive crevices oh that's what that is if you hit left shift oh i don't want to eat you babe oh like that this thing this will probably unlock that door finally my point is now i feel like killing games like they're they're games like this or are like man eaters one that i played recently where you're just a shark is that fun by the way i was thinking about getting it during their summer sale if you see it for really cheap it's like if you pay like maybe like 10 or 15 bucks or something for it it's probably worth it okay it's one of those games where you're definitely bored of it by the time it's over but it was fun it seems like a game like that can only have so much depth of play yeah but it it it was it was fun here la would you like to try this with the controller or the mouse sure i'll i'll give it a shot with the controller or tomorrow for a while before me sorry you never played you wanna play you play i wanna i never meant to skip over you baby just saying lyle played flat no you're right lyle is a [ __ ] hog you're so right i just wanted to get first dip tomorrow this wasn't even about wanting to play it was about power it was just about literal just like i am superior i wanted to play something it's beneath me he's gotta squeeze into that who's into that imagine like you're squeezing into your [ __ ] short shorts but your [ __ ] is so up in the middle you get in you just passed it again that's that's fine yeah squeeze into it finally he listens jesus oh so you're like are you like an akira monster like are you some kind of [ __ ] merge between technology what did this cause oh that's a nice little effect you're watching them you're remembering oh i'm a human you're controlling that guy yeah this is cool wait how are you controlling that guy i think this is like a flashback oh i think something like that yeah i don't know you're accessing the the database and you're probably this is just information you're learning okay heat the wool into budge this is really cool hey guys who made this game uh this this kicks ass do you think that they're gonna try to morally justify this creature at all i don't know like do you think we're gonna get some dialogue about somebody like we're going to bring this back to earth and do bad stuff with it they're definitely going to do [ __ ] up [ __ ] to it oh that'll make it angry yeah i would assume they're going to put like their pencils in this right behind every hideous monster is some some hubris filled man moss okay i don't know what the f that even means i mean the human controls definitely don't quite compare to the monster controls oh i have a dash that's that's what i always say when i go to the gym i have a dash no the the yeah actually that too you walk it i have a dash the treadmills are over there sir i have a target yearning for dash plant c4 watch out well what what the [ __ ] is that person doing do you plan c4 in another place yeah why are they being so stupid why'd they strap themselves to the c4 what is this [ __ ] nut job doing what's going on oh maybe maybe it's like a dynamite i think that's the detonator table all right we made fun of this person i never meant to do that you guys kind of lulled me into that peer pressure is like the coolest word ever yeah it sounds pretty cool it was a derelict so i needed to watch that story segment to open the next door well now you know now what are you going to call this thing how do you reach out your oh i guess it is just your right stick huh i'm actually kind of invested in this i want to know what the [ __ ] this thing is he is what he's called the slippy one ooh looks like i'm back to a place i've been yeah that that's a loopback should i save you should eat yourself god it sucks to be this thing what are you talking about i mean in a video game it's nice but oh yeah in real life it might actually oh yeah yeah how do you use your webbies yeah there you go that's so [ __ ] cool man video games can be pretty nifty yeah this is pretty neat i don't know how long this game is gonna end up it's probably gonna be like too much to keep going but i read in a deep web forum it's 70 hours so oh can you stop doing that please see i hate grabbing things with the analog stick i'm getting the hang of it he says he [ __ ] up horribly hmm your little your little guy no i gotta eat no damn dude the game's getting hard oh [ __ ] you [ __ ] [ __ ] you
