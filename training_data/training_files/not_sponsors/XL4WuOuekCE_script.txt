this Niners team is fully healthy which I think they didn't always have on that defense side of the ball and some of the games that they didn't play well they didn't have all of their weapons on the defense's out of the ball Robert Solow has been able to piece together this defense to play in a manner that is very disruptive to the other team I mean it was displayed in the first 10 weeks of the NFL season that Niners defense was just winning games on a very regular occasion I mean it was awesome in the offense the question was can his Niners offense keep up with the Niners defense to win games for them in the long haul and then all of a sudden in New Orleans after that multiple Ravens lost on the road they went down to New Orleans and that offense became this buzzsaw out of nowhere they have George kiddo they have all these weapons and they have cows Shanahan's big old brain but for me the thing that keeps the Packers in this game is Aaron Rodgers and I'm saying that strictly because we were friends with him but also he's made a lot of comments this year that have alluded to the fact that he's playing with a massive chip on his shoulder and very petty and I think that has kind of radiated through the entire locker room he said he can see hole 18 he's already talked about how he's probably not many years of this left he's talked about hi everybody he's kind of wiped them off and that mindset of bringing a team together especially going on the road together against a team that is favored by more than a touchdown against you is something that can really motivate you look at the Titans with the Baltimore Ravens I think the Packers with the opportunistic defense that they have with Aaron Rodgers and Aaron Jones and Davante Adams also running routes that are just disgusting right now now he's gonna be locked down probably by Sherman I'll be excited to watch that battle but I think it is all on Aaron Rodgers not only his arm and his playmaking ability but his motivational and leadership skills it doesn't get talked about enough in the locker room willing a team to win I think that's really what's gonna come down to ya well hello there seeking now back to the magic I need to scheme things up so we can get the ball out quick cuz that's what happened last time that all the routes were you know 15 to 20 yards down the field he just got eaten up by the Niners d-line and Aaron Jones they largely minimized him he didn't do anything so I mean we'll see obviously the Niners are probably the better team but like you said I just it's tough to bet against Rodgers when you know there's one game one game playoff Sharon Rogers dude I know people say Bryant and he was better than him right yeah does it help that they got blown out in the first game I don't I don't think that game matters now every game is its own season I think that's what people that are fans of the sport don't understand every game is its own season literally you have no idea what's gonna happen each week preparation wise scheme wise strategy wise I think the Patriots have exploited that the most every game is its own season you don't know what's gonna happen in the game you don't have you're gonna be a run first offense and pass first offense you don't know what's gonna happen in the game you don't know what justments you're gonna have to make which I think early in the season Lafleur was not great at right but I think he's gotten better at I think every game is its own season so although they did get blown out I think that's something they can rely on a little bit maybe the offensive line can be like okay these are some stunts that they did against us this is how they took advantage of us but in each game is its own season not just in the playoffs but in the regular season as well and if you have that mindset nothing that you've done in the past or in the future really matters
