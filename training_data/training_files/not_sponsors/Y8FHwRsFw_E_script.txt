hey what's up guys my name is Thomas Park welcome back to another video today we're gonna be talking about surf shark and tour guard hey guys if you haven't well anyways guys back to the video alright guys so let's go ahead and compare the price between surf shark and tor card which one is the better price let's go ahead and find you out one thing I do want to talk about surf shark is that they used to have an annoying countdown clock on their timer in fact if you look at some my previous surf shock reviews you can find that countdown clock timer just like Nord VPN now sure shark probably has one of the weirdest pricing schemes I've ever seen from a VPN provider and do you want to know why I think it is so weird well it's because it's almost like surf shark itself has some kind of typo in your two-year plan and they just haven't fixed it for like a year if I look back at my review of surfs rocky in January 22 2019 you'll find that search dogs $12 a month for one year at $72 and for two years it's 83 dollars now it's strangely forty three dollars for two months and the one month one year plan hasn't changed what the heck so weird in fact that it makes me suspicious you know when things are said to be too good to be true well that's how it is for sure shark however it's not too good to be true for one month because it's $12 you could get tore guard with my discount code including access to everything including access to BitTorrent proxy everything here 8:17 these connections for only $5 you can also get the early package for $30 half year for 15 two years for around $50 and four years for around I guess a hundred dollars so tor tor parties $50 for two years and I guess Cerf shark is 47 dollars for two years so they're around the same price for two years the weight thing is is that surf shark is also 70 taught two dollars for one year that's right I didn't make a mistake it's cheaper to buy two years of surf shark than one year why would that be well honestly I have no idea maybe sure shark is trying to inflate their users maybe they're trying to get everyone to sign up for long term commitment and be stuck with it I'm not really sure I really don't get it of course with that you also get unlimited devices which pretty means means you could share surf sharks all your friends all your family and you can all just use one account of course they're not going to tell you that but seemingly what you can do and it's honestly too good to be true why would they be offering that it just doesn't make sense so who wins for pricing overall well I'm gonna have to keep it to tour guard it's cheaper for one month at only $5 being half the price one year is much much much cheaper than $72 almost by a factor of 1/2 and towards two year also matches to surf sharks two year for being $50 so overall torque are definitely has better pricing plan in most ones than equal for two years and also how somehow manages to make sense whereas this one doesn't I don't know what to make of this let me know what in the comments down below what you think of a VPN provider who gives you more time for less money and why you think they could be doing that I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on that okay guys now which has a better application surf shark or tor guard well target has more green which means it has more things that I'm looking for than surf shark you look at the full details here surf shark is missing out on some stuff like an application kill switch was coming in handy when you want to set kills too based on application it doesn't have streaming IPs you could integrate within the application no wire guard support yet it doesn't have encryption customization availability to change your cypher DNS customization port customization no support for scripts and you can't really see that good of stats about servers it does show this little tiny bar or little circle right here based I think on how many people are using it but honestly that doesn't really count I don't think it's you can't really get that much information from reading that however it does have some cool things that tor guarde is missing like the ability to favorite servers the ability to connect to a server and disconnect while you're using it it also has some stuff like split tunneling based on specific websites you can find that it's the whitelist ur another thing guys just talking about that I'll finish up this first it does have IP to support which is nice as well decent amount of protocols to actually choose from but in terms of connectivity notes and advanced so you can change it there and when you do see stuff like your normal kill switch so I mean it's not the worst application in the world in terms of you know the pure amount of features eight is not bad but guys that thing I don't like about search Forks application is that I find it just kind of clunky to use um the settings is really confusingly navigated so it's like connectivity and advanced you aren't really sure what's in connectivity what's in advance the the menus and size of the application itself or the overall look and feel of the application is not very good it's very amateurish I have it I have it in dark mode right now so this is what the basic application looks like I'm just not a huge fan of though it looks really basic I know a lot of people criticize pull guard first saying oh it doesn't look good Bob Loblaw and you know I've always kind of had the counter argument war it's not really about the looks but I think specifically in this case with surf shark I don't think it looks good but I also don't think it feels good when you're using it and that I think does make a difference with tor guard VPN everything is here you could customize it really simply and easily it's just there and you can select servers very easy go to more settings that's organized very properly or a network scripts application kill general I'm just kind of generalized settings it's just organized so much better and then you have something like surf shark where it's like okay let's go to another tab just locate locations you have to go to features what is features what is the different things going to settings okay now we have to go down to the connectivity advanced it's not that in the world I just don't like this interface and application not only that but going to servers it's on its own tab it's kind of confusing sometimes you think you'll bring it up here but it doesn't so that's just my opinion guys not a huge fan of the interface the look and feel not only that I do think the application does get pretty laggy semi often and you know if you have a lot of things opening in your computer it seems to get laggy or more than other applications but you know eight against ten Torborg i think wins here just for having more features more pure futures and customization especially coming up soon they're gonna have ike peaches or and wire guard coming in any update any update soon it should be coming any day now two weeks ago they set out it couldn't be here so i think it's gonna be coming soon this month might be a little late but then when these two things are added tor guard will have twelve green against eight so it'd be vastly better so I do think tor guard wins here so regard you know search toric like I said has some interesting features but overall not a huge fan of the interface and it is lacking some stuff that I look for alright guys now we are connected to surf shark let's go ahead and do a download test and see what we could get so in my pasty speeds like kind of testing around the last year so I've been getting pretty good speed test results with surf shark download speeds are a little bit more disappointing which is not very good compared to some other other VPN providers like tor guard especially in this comparison we're gonna see better speeds right now this download rate is pretty good the ping is a little bit higher than normal almost double of what I get with the Sayed Tour card about thirty seven being is by all means so pretty acceptable without VPN of course I get around one gig around fifteen m/s and I get for upload around forty so surprisingly this is actually hurting my upload quite a bit by reducing it by half which is disappointing now finishing out this speed test kind of comparison we're going to do a test here see what kind of beam we can get so as expected I did get lower ping and we are getting a much better download rate quite a bit much better this is actually one of the fastest speed test results I've gotten what sort guard lately 350 is killer really really good and so as you can see it's much better upload well as well okay we have it up and running now for the torn download ideally for my VPN providers to get Tier one or five out of five four speeds I like to look for around 30 to 40 range in this area right now with surf shark we're getting around 10 to 15 which is definitely on the slower side I would say 15 to 20 is okay 20 to 30 is getting better pretty good 30 to 40 very good so surf shark definitely seems to be on the slower and a VPN provider so you know you saw that decent speed test but right now we're not really cracking even 20 and we're getting right around 10 to 15 kind of hovering around 16 right now so not that impressive especially considering you know without VPN I get 40-plus sometimes here um so yeah let's go ahead and compare tor guard now alright guys so we are connected to tor guard right now let's go ahead and do this test first since you already have it open so just as a reminder for surf shark we are getting around 10 to 15 in this area ideally we like to see 30 to 40 kind of more in that space for you know faster VPN providers so as we're starting up for seeing a little bit increase of speeds already from a surf shark going up to 22 right now 23 I'm already getting faster speeds of course these speeds can kind of change depending on time of day time of night etc right now it's kind of late so I'm expecting speeds to be maybe a little bit better than average but actually right now speeds are not super super good we're going up to 25 or so right there 25 point seven so surf shark was around 14 kind of 14 15 this one's around 2025 I'm going in that range sometimes to tor guard I could get around 30 to 40 I'm right in this range make bytes a second so it kind of depends on time of day of course you just kind of kind of had to keep these things in mind when comparing the VPNs at the same time but this is kind of consistent when my passwords old store guard is definitely a win in the speed test especially during certain times you know it's gonna be way faster sir short seems to be consistently kind of slower I'm Tour guard not getting as fast right now as usual I just did a comparison with a tour guard and we VPN and tour guide was getting 30 to 40 megabytes right now I'm kind of in the middle of the day I'm you can check out that video if you want to see more speed test or see more speed test of course and the other tour card reviews having a more extended kind of speed test results alright guys so which one has a better reputation surf shark or Tour guard well surf shark is pretty much just an anonymously owned company no one really knows anything about it it's based in the British Virgin Islands which is most likely a shell company location they're probably working somewhere else it could be a company that has remote offices around the world remote workers it could be headquartered somewhere else it could actually be owned by another VPN company there's no really way to tell I've tried talking to their live chat before and trying to find out what like the real company is called and they just keep telling me it's called like sir shark Ltd which is not really that much informative you can't really find any information about sir shark Ltd of course if you try to look at some of the legal documents available to see who owns it it's just been filed by a lawyer so whoever made this company whatever company made does company it does not want you to know the company behind it so I don't really like that compared to Surf shark tour guard is actually the exact opposite they're not using some shell company based in the British Virgin Islands they're just based in the United States of America that company itself is pretty transparent you could find some of the higher level management on LinkedIn which is much different than surf shark you could actually find who owns the company but what about huge security vulnerabilities and stuff like that well it was only around a year ago that when Skye found that surf shark was mistakenly modifying the routing table to make IP info bypassed the VPN tunnels so these rules remained on your computer even after you moved to their software and switch to a different VPN provider and what was the result of this well IP dot info would expose pretty much your real IP even if you're connected to a VPN so this was a terrible practice and pretty much made their VPN obsolete they have since fixed this issue and they even had a snarky reply here saying that they were gonna look into it but honestly this was a really bad thing and I haven't seen any review talking about this at all so that's not good so I think in terms of transparency and reputation I think tor guard is a clear winner here so one problem I have with surf shark as a streaming provider or a VPN that unblocked streaming is that the websites that can work for example take something like Hulu just kind of get stuck a lot and this is what I kind of meant by Surf's Up bar speeds just kind of like in a general sense things like this seem to just happen I'm not sure if it's really it's an app or the servers or just their faulty method for unblocking services but would you rather watch Hulu on tour guard where you could just buy a streaming IP and it works understand a time or would you rather deal stuff like this where I'm connected and it just does not work I had some kind of error before now I'm trying to reload the page it finally works let's go ahead and click Play we still have an open mind you and this is what I'm getting yes sir shark it's so good for streaming yeah so Wasser site does have problems with Hulu not working for some reason it does seem to work fine with Netflix and prime video I tested both so far so just like with Hulu I've been having a lot of difficulty with BBC iPlayer seems like surf shark doesn't really work that well with it whether because it's too slow or just doesn't work as you could see I'm clicking on it I had to click on it like five times it now seems to be maybe working it's very slow very slow some spark is waiting for surf shark to unblock BBC iplayer but it barely works and I've been waiting forever let's see how long it takes before it actually loads alright I give up so doesn't seem to be working with BBC iPlayer so it seems to maybe work to unlock it but the services of the speeds are just not up to par to actually get it working which is disappointing now tor guard on the other hand is a different story entirely you're not gonna get any of that inconsistency with tor Garda at all and now why is that well that's because you're probably gonna want to buy the streaming bundle then the streaming bundle is very expensive no questions asked but if you put in my promo code it's on Netflix actually and Netflix you're gonna get 50% off so it's gonna be actually cheaper than shark still it's gonna be $11 a month which is still cheaper than I think sir shark is 12 and Sir shark is about 83 dollars a year it's pretty expensive for a year cheaper for two years surprisingly but tour guards streaming bundle $60 a year is still cheaper than surf shark you're gonna get to streaming IPS which you can pick from these regions so the little bit of a con is that you can't just pick any region you want and have that kind of flexibility intuitive nature if you do kind of want that I wouldn't recommend surf shark either I would recommend something like we VPN or more specifically expressvpn although expressvpn has been having some problems lately with some of these servers actually they're actually getting blocked as well so I do think tor guard is the best solution if you just want to pick a select number of locations let's say USA in Japan or maybe one of these other ones like UK personally if you're in the USA I would recommend getting the UK in Japan one so you can watch the Japanese content on Netflix and you can watch BBC iPlayer then you could just not use a VPN for a regular content like Netflix Hulu and stuff like that that will work great these are never gonna have any problems since they're uniquely sold to you and no one else is gonna be sharing them they're not gonna be laggy like surf shark couldn't barely even work with half the stuff so it's gonna work really good just remember to use this promo code and Netflix so I do think that tour guard wins here they have more compatibility overall more consistent performance whereas what surf shark I could even get it work with Hulu and BBC iplayer at all so Torg are definitely wins your hands down so guys which VPN is better in terms of customer support well that one's gonna probably go to a tour guard as well sir sir our keys are pretty new company so they're still trying to probably work out a lot of issues I seen a ton of people so many people in fact one guy comment on my channel like why do people on Facebook hate search like so much Facebook has a page for surf shark or surf lark has a page on Facebook I guess which is more accurate to say and it's just filled with so many complaints people saying don't waste your money support doesn't get back to me I'm so many different people have so many different problems on at the page and it's all like pretty recent within the last month or so so I think these services like surf shark and noir VPN they get too many people using them and the support never can keep up that's the problem with getting these VPNs that are overhyped and overrated on these websites because too many people use them and the touch support can't keep up this guy says in my opinion this is not touch support nor what I expected on this guy bought it from CNET and he said he doesn't want other people to fall for it to buy it so I don't think surf truck has good customer support and my experience testing you know hasn't really been that good either at or guard on the other hand has set an industry standard for support tickets in fact they have exceedingly quick ones let me show you in fact towards customer support is so good I even made a video talking exclusively about how it's their secret sauce per se people this I made a ticket and you could see here that when I bought the ticket or when I bought the service the guy replied two minutes later and this was around a year ago and the support hasn't slowed down since so if you want to minotaur small times two to four even five minutes sometimes response times to your tickets go fort or guard I guess if you want surf shark it's gonna be kind of a toss in the bag you've seen the complaints and yeah alright guys now we're here at the end of the comparison so who wins between surf shark and tor guard well it looks pretty green here and you know we've looked gone over each category surf Sark does have some merit in some ways you know I guess if you want to buy two years for like 50 bucks although tor guard can match that sella and every other category we saw the application to our guard has more features it's gonna have more features even soon including wire guard and Nike to support so it's gonna have 12 green against 8 green and in terms of the selected features that do well on that analysis of the application speeds we saw a tour guard smokey in the speed test and it was faster in the download tests although not quite as fast as usual maybe the time miles torrenting or whatever reputation tour guard is better as well there's never been any instances of messing up in terms of security and privacy like sir shark did with those IP tables being rerouted for some reason not only that but reputation wise customer the reputation that or car just has a better one it's more transparent you know who owns it it's not using some remote shelcha and a company location like surf shark does chef Stark County came out of blue no one knows anything about it start hopping review sites no one knows how and it's just kind of really overhyped in my opinion and in terms of customer support you've seen the complaints that people have with it whereas with tour guard it's they respond within four to five minutes there's no customer complaints either on Facebook pages or anything like that streaming tour guard wins again simply because they work with other services you saw how laggy tour guard was with Hulu you saw how laggy it was with BBC iplayer it might have a little bit more flexibility with some Netflix locations however so regards streaming IPs are more reliable and cheaper per year overall guys the winner no questions asked is Tora guard if you want to support the channel go ahead and click on a link down scription down below or use code tom spark or code netflix for the streaming bundle and you know here we go guys this is just results you've seen the detailed analysis let me know down the comments down below why you don't like one of these VPNs and i'll see you again in the next video very soon
