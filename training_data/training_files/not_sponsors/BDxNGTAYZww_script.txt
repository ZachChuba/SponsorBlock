[Music] he's finally here guys you know when he first asked me for a haircut I told him to suck my dick but now he's here getting a haircut what's that tell you so what took you so long to get you in here you never called my least favorite thing is to get haircuts Liza tried a haircut video with me once and I just panicked and I got like really sweaty do you want to explain the Liza is because a lot of the viewers here don't know who you are or your past relationships Liza is my ex-girlfriend she did a video where she was cutting my hair and we didn't get very far in ended up just being a portion of a blooper video it's so tense in here it feels like a mix between a talk show and interrogation yeah that's what it is yeah I hate it I hate it so what are you gonna do your hair should I give you my haircut no I have pictures this is my favorite one it's just a picture of you like a month ago well no they're all pictures of me something like this for Halloween bro that's Deen sick maybe you do something like this to your eyebrow what does that mean it's a Versace eyebrow oh you made everyone wait six months for this episode you can do the same stupid haircut there's a video on YouTube of this guy like cutting like a doll to match my hair and the only comment on the video is why the [ __ ] this haircut the truth is I don't even know how to do this haircut I only know how to give my own haircut to people I learned to cut hair on the streets and when I was growing up on the streets this haircut was kind of like the lame haircut and these kids that had this would get bullied and stuff so I tried to stay away from doing this haircut but I have to be respectful to you so I will give you your same stupid haircut [ __ ] no you have a serious knot in your hair I know bro I don't know what to tell you I fall asleep with gum in my mouth a lot there's gonna be terrible for your image it hurts she made me wait a long time for this man all my comments who should I give a haircut to next David David do David do David next what do you think I'm gonna do just wait and be embarrassed we all where's Marika what are you doing porfavor NOLA attacking puta puta okay look kill me how much you want Natalie just don't hurt him Reggie just take him outside give him the money please all right I didn't know he's gonna have bullets in there [ __ ] should we get into some interview questions yeah go hit it I lost my notes I had a whole bunch of notes for you but I lost them there's no way your you've lost everything that was supposed to be for this interview yeah I mean I can make some up I'm sure I could just freestyle it go hit it you're extremely hard-working how do you still find the motivation to keep up your work ethic and have you ever kissed another girl since you broke up with Liza could get through all the questions quick and get out of here I just love doing it there's not a job that I would like more than this you got all your friends cars so far every single one but me is there a reason for that or no you've never wanted anything well you know what I'm just extremely grateful for everything you've done for me so far so it's fine I don't need a car I don't know my weakness is like when someone says they want something and I always try to get it but you've never brought anything up that you want R than me on the show and I was actually ignoring it now yeah this is really all I wanted oh yeah by the first purchase she met you once at a Coachella before we even started hanging out did we I met you like for a second yeah and then I went on your Instagram and you went on mine and we both got the wrong impression of each other I think oh yeah yeah cuz I thought you were like a tick-tock or like a little teeny bopper yeah I thought you're a douchebag well you rubbed off on me and I rubbed off on you now and we kind of leave out our douche Magnus now I have a little bit more boyish cuteness and you got a little more do sheet tough kindness thank you no I don't think you're a douchebag I just didn't I just didn't think that you would be so funny I don't know with you for a bit you're hilarious you know what it was it was cuz we got pulled over that really helped you first vlog appearance we notice the stars and I was like guys look outside there's so many stars I've got those my father promised were none drill why it was so perfect for you to make a first spread in all of us is because you went to jail and then you have a perfect situation where you're possibly going back to jail yeah you were the first one to put my mug shot out there publicly two million people and I thought that was a bad idea first because it would affect my sponsors and endorsements but luckily we have people like see geek who don't care yeah I've done felonies in the past but yeah that was our first first time we have a vlog together I saw a video the other day that had a Natalie's first time in the blogs - is there something between you and Natalie yeah we're dating okay Natalie and I know each other for a long time we went to prom together that's is that real yeah it's real I went in the real dance let me tell you it's not as fun as that looks you ever try cigarettes yeah I've tried cigarettes yeah yeah are you gonna say that in the video yeah that's fine I don't have cigarettes for any other reason other than it looks cool I feel like I'm in the movie cigarettes are cool that's on what I'm saying yeah you know how to get in the vlog squad just show up smoking where do you want to come in here and help me out oh yeah Reggie used to work on Mario choco si help help out a little bit while I regroup and plan my next stunt what was your guide my guide I'm just kind of winging it so you cut the vlogs down super short and you film all the time what is some stuff that doesn't make it in the vlogs you just kiss it Natalie Jason where do you see yourself in ten years and where do you see me in ten years wow that's a crazy question in 10 years yeah I don't know where I'm gonna be next week I was thinking that I would maybe be on a Marvel set and you would be coming to visit me vlog in with me on like a green screen and I have like a fancy superhero outfit on if I'm still vlogging in ten years that means something has either gone really really wrong or extremely right if I can keep it up for 10 years that means I figured out some kind of secret like source of life to keep me going or I've just like hit rock bottom and I can't do anything else like I imagine everyone gets like new jobs and it's just like me and my I have I have three cats now I live by myself why don't you like animals I'm allergic like all of them okay for like baby or allergy get that dog over here let's see if he has an allergic reaction yeah rub it rub his butt on his face oh definitely it doesn't get pinkeye after that look at that seems fine to me what do you want to be when you grow up I don't know what have a show you don't have a talk show I don't know what the show is but some sort of show where I can I come in and there's like a bunch of people and we have a bunch of ideas you're gonna do like wacky pranks on them know something like a talk show like an Allen DeGeneres type of show it'd be great if I think I'm not really like a late-night show I guess would be the best I don't really know I don't know if late-night is still like still it's poppin it needs to be something new chefs barber shop maybe I'll be the host of this show one day don't say that because help can get me kicked right off of

that I'm an innovative creator and I have a lot of potential it's weird it's like we're like grabbing his head I've done this my whole life I would do this and then I would go eat a sandwich after with hair all over it and the hair would go into my body I've grown to not be disgusted by it over the years you had the best hair line thank you are you seeing this yeah on that oh wow it looks just
