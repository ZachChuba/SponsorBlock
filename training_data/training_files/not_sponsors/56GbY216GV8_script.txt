hello everyone and welcome back to the waiter today we're gonna take a quick look at the two optional mini bosses that have so far been added to the game as well as on the completely hidden fast travel system that should be in the next public version it's currently in the beta at the time of this recording this first boss is accessed in two different ways depending on if you're playing the public version or the beta version I'll obviously be covering the public version first so this giant skull in the middle of the desert does it serve a purpose yes of course it does all you have to do is create an opening into the eye socket and then fill the eye socket with about two and three quarters flasks of liquid I always use water since the fish pond is fairly close by and eventually the screen will shake signaling the arrival of this cute little spider boss right here this boss is pom totally intended a little bit buggy when you fight it out here in the desert it tends to move up and to the left and fly away if you let it which is probably the reason why the devs are moving it in the next update but I found that fire works really well against it otherwise you have to wait until it opens up and exposes its weak point so you can shoot it in its juicy Center for massive damage or you can just get hit by one of these fireballs and get needed to halfway across the world like me but it's alright the fire tends to make quick work of it for defeating this mini boss you're treated to both a max health increase as well as a usually pretty decent wand however it drops the wand in the exact spot in which it dies so it's usually up in the air and you're gonna have to fly up to grab it which is why I always keep some poly morphine on me and yeah it's a pretty decent wand of course this wand with all these earthquakes pretty much wants me to kill myself so if the mini boss is being moved in the next update does that mean that there's nothing to be done at the skull anymore no it does not you still want to fill it with the same amount of liquid and I have a water trail on my teleport wand to make this quick and easy and now when the screen shakes suddenly above the skull we see a blue portal to a faraway land which leads us that's right to the lake all the way on the other side of the world fast travel across the world but how do we get back I mean other than just walking all the way back is there a return portal yes there is and that's exactly why I'm carrying all of these flasks of blood with me the return portal is a little bit more difficult to trigger and that's because we have to fill this Hollow where the essence of fire is underneath the wicker man with 2 and 3/4 flasks of blood only blood will work right now at least and you don't to worry about draining the water because blood is more dense than water so just as long as the blood goes to the bottom you'll be fine eventually the screen will shake here and above the wicker man there will be another mysterious blue portal to a faraway land which yes does in fact teleport you all the way back to the desert so this is actually really really cool that we now are going to have the ability using the tower we can get from the bottom of the world back up to the surface and then using these to fast travel points we can get from the extreme east of the world to the extreme west of the world and back and so if the desert mini-boss has been moved in the beta and is being moved in the next public version of the game where's have been moved to well the pyramid those three really nice wands that you can get early aim they've actually been removed from the pyramid which I gotta be honest I'm not too excited about because the wand that you get now currently from this mini boss isn't really the best anymore at the moment they'll probably patch it and make it a little bit better for the release version I hope but here we go it's right here on this altar and I mean it's still a really good fight it's cool that there are mini bosses in the game I hope that they end up adding a lot more because it does it adds that that element to the game that it really needs these more challenges in the form of longer fights and I think that the final boss needs to be buffed actually but anyway using fire still makes short work of this mini boss and it still drops extra max HP as well as wand this wand has four spells per cast and it no shuffle but I mean it doesn't have anything on it that's an actual spell I guess it's pretty decent except for the recharge time needless to say I didn't even bother picking it up when I fought the boss this time so hopefully this gets rebalanced a little bit for the release version this is still the beta this footage is coming from right now anyway now it's time for the second and final current mini boss now this one isn't exactly very well hidden the game even tells you that you've entered a new area when you're working your way down on the right hand side of the underground jungle biome you'll start to see dense rock walls and then the game will prompt you that you've entered the dragon cave the entrance of which is being blocked by a large boulder of course at this point in the game getting rid of this Boulder shouldn't be a big deal for you anyway now I'm gonna switch to live commentary because I actually recorded this part right here during my first encounter ever with this mini boss I knew it was there but the fight itself and everything is going to be completely blind reaction let's go I guess I'm just gonna use this to open it up perhaps oh there we go oh my god it's a big worm nice Oh fire-breathing worm excellent good thing I'm totally immune to fire and lightning look at that nice you could soak me probably that this would be insanely difficult if he didn't have fire assistance come back here please good I'm just zapped yeah he went goodbye come on please where'd he go oh here he is hey buddy I need you to get Zach please and zapped again keep zapping you actually I need to not get eaten - I have no good method of flight wow this thing is just destroying the area that's fine it's just fine I just need it to come back please I'm just gonna wait well oh here we are I see it's health bar whew ow that did like a hundred damage or more it's gonna keep zapping it there we go Wow and we get extra max health 487 max health I have now and then we also get a wand that always casts reduce recharge time dropper bolts we got freeze charge critical plus we got a damage plus it's fine it's just fine anyway guys there we go the two current optional mini bosses and two totally hidden best travel portals hopefully the developers end up adding a lot more of both of these things well especially the mini bosses maybe by the time you're watching this video they're like 25 mini bosses scattered around the world that would be great I would love to see a lot more mini bosses in this anyway I hope you enjoyed the video and I hope you're having a really great day and I'll see you next time
