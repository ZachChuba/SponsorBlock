hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with stuffed pasta wheels that's right if i'd known these were gonna come
out as good as they did I would use much more impressive ingredients for the
filling then frozen spinach and can beans but despite the fact that I went
full quarantine cuisine on these it's actually the technique for how to make
these that I want to focus on which really did work out incredibly well so
with that let's go ahead and get started with a very simple pasta like dough and
that'll begin with some all-purpose flour plus some salt and then into the
middle of that we will crack one large egg plus a small splash of cold fresh
water and then what we'll do once we have everything in the bowls go ahead
and take a spoon and we will stir this until it comes together to form a shaggy
dough oh yeah heard me a Shaggy dough and as usual once we do
have a shaggy dough formed we will switch to our hands and press everything
together and then once that's almost happened
we'll go ahead and dump everything onto the table where we will need it for just
about a minute or so and yes most pasta dough's are made with all eggs but I was
attempting to make the exact amount of dough I needed and one egg was not gonna
be quite enough moisture but two eggs was gonna be too much so I simply solved
that problem by adding a little bit of water and of course if it feels a little
bit sticky go ahead and sprinkle some more flour on and like I said we will
give that a quick kneading until it kind of smoothes out and we're left with a
relatively firm but still pliable disc of dough and then once that set we'll go
ahead and wrap it in plastic and we'll pop that in the fridge to rest for at
least an hour before we try to roll it out okay we never want to rush a dough
always give it time to rest and that will always make it easier to work with
and while that's resting we can go ahead and make our filling which I pretty much
did with zero fresh ingredients including one can of wild pink salmon
which isn't pretty but it's pretty good for in pretty good tasting and what
we'll do is break that up with a fork before very quickly how do knit with
breadcrumbs oh yeah that's better and then to that we will add a whole
bunch of freshly grated Parmesan cheese at which point we'll take a fork and
give this a very thorough mixing before we add our wet ingredients and by the
way regarding the cheese I normally implore to use the real
stuff the parmigiano-reggiano but I did this time I actually used a primer Jean
from Wisconsin which I'm happy to report was pretty nice but anyway we will give
that a very good mix before adding one package of frozen chopped spinach that
we thought first then squeezed out all the water
I also tossed in a large egg as well as a couple of crushed garlic cloves and
then we'll want to season that up with some freshly ground black pepper a few
shakes of cayenne and of course some salt at which point it was ready to stir
together and I wasn't really sure if I was gonna need one or two eggs and
whenever we're not sure of that we always wanted to start with one and then
if it seems too dry we can always add the other one which this did so I tossed
that in and kept stirring eventually ending up with this soft and spreadable
filling I was hoping for which reminds me to remind this really is just a
technique video and get to make any filling want I mean guys are
after all the Daniel Steel's of your pasta wheels and speaking of trashy
content well they can't salmon have frozen spinach did come out pretty nice
any and all of your favorite ravioli fillings would work perfectly here and
that's it once our filling is set we'll just wrap that up and pop it in the
fridge until we're ready to use it and then assuming our dough's rested long
enough we'll go ahead and pull that out and we'll unwrap it and transfer it onto
a well floured surface and then before we start rolling we'll use our hands
that kind of form this into a rectangular shape and then once that
happens we'll go ahead and switch to the rolling pin and then using just enough
flour so it doesn't stick we will attempt to roll this out into a fairly
squarish rectangle about an eighth of an inch thick and if I have to give a
measurement it's probably something close to 14 by 12 but as I'm doing a
fine job demonstrating it does not have to be perfectly shaped so this is what I
ended up with and I was pretty happy with it or at least that's what I told
it and then one little trick here once that's rolled out is to take our rolling
pin and sort of flatten out that far edge a little more okay that's going to
be the edge that we roll towards and I think this is going to seal
a little better if that's a little thinner along that edge and then once
that said we'll go ahead and transfer on our filling pretty much going all the
way to the edges except for about three or four inches long in that edge we just
spoke of and we'll attempt to distribute that and spread it out as evenly as
possible and then before we roll this up we should probably take a pastry brush
or better yet a couple clean fingertips and we will slightly dampen that exposed
dough before very carefully and very confidently rolling this up and we
definitely want to roll it fairly tight so we don't have any big air pockets but
we also don't want to smash and press that filling too much either so take
your time and try to roll this up as uniformly as possible okay we really do
want to try to end up with a very consistent girth and once we have that
almost all the way rolled up because we didn't have a perfect rectangle it's
always a good idea to kind of stretch out those corners a little bit before we
finish the roll and because our dough along that edge was damp this should
seal very nicely and then what we'll do once we have that rolled up and sealed
with of course the seam on the bottom and we've done a little bit of
fine-tuning if needed as it will dust the table with a little more flour since
we're gonna move to the trimming cutting and shaping stage and this part is
optional but if do have a little bit of extra dough at the ends that you
don't think has any filling in it can go ahead and trim a little bit off
which I did and yes in case you're wondering I'm using a very cheap and
dull knife but anyway whether we trim down or not we're gonna want to cut this
into eight equal pieces oh and see how I just cut that by
pressing down that's probably not the best way okay it's probably better if
use a little bit of a sawing motion as go through to get a little bit of
a cleaner cut without smashing everything and then what we'll do once
we have that successfully section is give these a little light pressing with
some floured fingers to sort of flatten them out a little bit and to make that a
little bit easier I'm going to go ahead and spread these out so we have a little
more room to work with and that's it once we have those cut and flattened
down a little bit we'll go ahead and brown those up in a non-stick pan set
over medium heat in a little bit of olive oil which is probably only gonna
take a couple minutes per side but you'll know because both sides will look
golden brown oh and if you're into multitasking while those are browning up
we can go ahead and prep our big dish or pan which I've done by adding
about an inch of a very thick marinara sauce to the bottom and then to that I
decided to add some cumin and some smoked paprika along with a splash of
water and I went with those ingredients because I thought they would pair nicely
with my spinach and salmon and they did but of course like the filling go
ahead and use whatever kind of sauce want and then what we'll do once that
set and our stuffed pasta wheels have been beautifully browned is go ahead and
transfer those in using the old two one two one two positioning method oh and
definitely feel free to add more liquid if want all right I intentionally
wanted this to be sort of thick after it roasted so that I would end up with
almost like a tomato chutney but if wanted could make this a lot sauce
here and these will be fine even if cover them completely
and speaking of covering well great a little more parmesan over the top and
that's a once cheesed these are ready to transfer into the center of a 375 degree
oven for about a half-hour or so or until they look like this and I've made
a lot of stuff pasta recipes in my day baked and otherwise but I've never seen
anything that comes out looking quite like this so these really are truly
unique in appearance but anyway I'm gonna let these rest for about five
minutes before serving them up and in the meantime if want to clean up
some of the splatters from the edge can do that very carefully with a damp
rag but don't press too hard or will burn yourself and I'll get blamed so I
did a little bit of cleanup and then went ahead and serve these up and I'm
gonna go with two wheels per order along with of course my cumin and smoked
paprika scented tomato sauce or as I'm calling it on the menu
roast tomato chutney and in a perfect world I would have finished up with some
freshly chopped to tell parsley but we are far from being in a perfect world
and I didn't have any but I did have some beautiful extra-virgin olive oil so
I drizzled some of that over the top and I actually thought this dish liqueur
giuse in its own unique provocative way so I grabbed a fork and knife and dug in
and I was absolutely thrilled with how these came out and not only with how
they tasted which was fine especially considering the unremarkable ingredients
I used but what I really enjoyed about this technique the most was the
tremendously enjoyable texture of the pasta okay know how when make
lasagna there are those parts of the pasta and
the edges and corners that get all crusty this had a lot of that going on
and then to contrast that on the inside we had wonderfully tender perfectly
cooked pasta so texturally speaking I thought this was an absolute triumph and
if I'd known it was gonna come out this well I would have thrown on a mask and
got out and got some fresh meat and vegetables and cheese and pretty much
any filling enjoy and a ravioli or tortellini or cannelloni would be
absolutely perfect used with this technique which is why no matter what
use I really do hope give these a try soon so please follow the links
