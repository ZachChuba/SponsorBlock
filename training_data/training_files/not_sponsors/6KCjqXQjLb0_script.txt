hi beautiful humans my name is Terrell amore and thank you so much for watching this video today I'm gonna be reacting to my advanced selfies that I've taken this year oh I found this actually not long ago on my facebook I'm literally farewelling the selfie year I thought fast forward four years and now this is my job this is the kind of photography that I do which is just freakin hilarious I don't know why but taking photos of myself self-portraits on this level being able to experiment with different shadows and lighting in locations has been one of the greatest experiences of my life just being able to express myself that way and also I'm believing when I was young that I was ugly and now being able to really reflect and see that I could take a good photo so I'm not so bad it helped me to increase my self-esteem helped me to travel the world it's helped me to do a lot this we had a dream selfie thing so I want to give thanks to the advanced healthy and review some of my favorites from this year till guess out with you and tell you stories behind them in my thought process behind it and what was going on and why I love them so much okay if I scroll a puli all the way down to the beginning of the year on my Instagram because all my favorites are definitely 100% on my Instagram this has been a crazy yeah Wow January 1 okay this is one of my favorites because this is when I started allowing myself to bring art and advance selfies photography together I don't laugh every time I save in somebody's good sounds ridiculous but this is when I started to combine the two and also I'm very feminine in a lot of ways and also very much a tomboy like I have these two wells pulling either side for me all the time and this is when I'm finally allowing myself to be a little bit more delicate putting the hand on the boob which for the longest time I was really nervous to even push this because I was like is this rude and then this the photo I posted today on Instagram time to change and I'm very proud of my actually for it embracing all the sides of myself which is fun because I won the best job on the planet I was more boxed into like the travel scene so I always try to take photos outside with you know beautiful backgrounds of nature and style houses but this was the first time where that wasn't really the case it was beautiful paintings but it wasn't Travel influences stuff so I started to break out of my mold here this was a very important photograph for me really interesting to watch this whole timing section of my Instagram is they're not advanced selfies and now I purely post almost 99% of the time is advanced selfies because that's what you guys know me for but back then it was still like a such a big mix which is so interesting a lot more nature shots which I kind of scratched this is my job right so I'm driven by engagement if I have low engagement on a lot of photos it's gonna drop my algorithm so it sucks but I have to do this constant thing and so many other Instagram as and youtubers have to post photos of themselves because that's what gets the most engagement from you guys your and helps you can do whatever you want but but if there is a chance that I'm gonna kill my career with constantly having low engagement and an Instagram being a butthole and pushing me down further it's not a risk that I can take and a lot of people struggle with this in the industry so just as FYI i'm miss taking photos of nature and posting them but this is the reason why a lot of us don't do that if you guys liked all the photos we ever put out would it be a problem oh again i love this photograph around the time when i went to Bali and this was a life-changing time for me as well because this is what I met Riya and she stopped me from moving back to Australia and continuing this travel influenced a journey and the YouTuber journey I think helped me to get to the point where I am right now but this photograph was soo is so beautiful it's mixing that feminine energy again which may be because I'm such a dude quite often in real life like I'm such a trekker when I see myself in this kind of light it's like oh wow like that's beautiful and I love how muscly I am in this show as well like my back is super solid but I'm so vulnerable I love this shot and the lighting here or this I think was when I really realized the potential of these advanced selfies because previously I wouldn't allow myself to really get into character and pose like crazy but this photograph it was like kind of a mistake I was like oh my god self time I could see guys know I work with a two-second self timer so I was like I'm gonna take the photo and I just like threw my hands up and I'm holding my food behind my back and like seus NIC up I was like oh like this is hot I was like oh damn I get it I get it now I understand I can push this advanced selfie thing a lot further and get some amazing shots out of this that previously were reserved for high fashion magazines I was like this gave me a glimpse into seeing that possibility which I was so happy about oh mama if I may I'm just going to thank Sorrell to save 10% off your first purchase of a domain or website so many people ask me how on as I mounted the camera to the ceiling it's cold boyfriend holding it to a ceiling this is still an advanced Sophie to a degree I set up the entire shot I just didn't have something to be able to mount the camera so it's Sammy cheating but I still pressed the shutter button my friend is on the side and I took that photograph this was a very important photo for me as well I was in a tourism job with three other girls in Palm Springs this was the very first time I was brave enough to take the advanced selfies in front of someone else and I didn't still ask our Yahoo's somewhere in the distance so the girls couldn't see me they were taking their photos of each other but when someone takes photos of me I freaked out completely trips my top off because I just think the bride looks badass sometimes these Adria selfie topics they really drain my soul but they are fun and they allow for so much expression I have to stop making excuses for it this isn't this year but this is still one of my favourite advance health he's that I have ever taken one of the first ones this is when I started calling it advance selfie a piece of artwork this one is where I kind of lost it I am so in love with this photograph forever one of my most favorite photos that oh it's so professional out of that series I took a lot of photographs as well and all of them just turn out so beautiful change everything for me I think this this series I was like holy Sh I'm good at this I'm really good at I'm gonna I'm gonna pursue this more and this is when I started considering maybe doing an advanced selfie University this is when I started getting recognized for the advanced selfie because I started doing a lot more videos about the advanced selfie love that I mean trucks and flowers together my tomboy effeminate combined the fact that I actually brought props into an image was this is the first time that happened and I was like ah right when professional photographers take photos of models they generally have props so I can do that too and this is when I started getting more into character as well in photographs I'm really pushing it well think one of people's most favorite photographs I've ever taken I'm wrapped in curtains and a bathroom a mess bowl it was it was part of my tiny room challenge for the advance selfie and same with this one coming up with this concept put him a little red glass in front of the camera so genius oh there's a lot of selfies of changing this year and I love them babe like taking a background that normally wouldn't be beautiful a box of tires a box yes this series one of the best things I've done as well in my career the dark heartbreak series holy crap emotions are very powerful things to help you create this one was one of the greatest posts that I did for myself on my instagram but to allow myself to also not put a beautiful photo up I think Instagram as most people just go like really beautiful smile smile smile smile that's not true reflection of what it is to be human there are dark emotions that you feel as well and they should be celebrated because you learn so much from dark emotions so I posting a photo that I don't look beautiful was such a treat oh my god again Germany I did a load of great work in Germany crap small country town advanced selfie I'm wearing a pillowcase on my head and a bedsheet around me and it looks like a babushka I was like damn girl that's good playing with shadows like a boss taking the advanced selfie to Iceland I love Iceland it is home it was always going to be home looking at getting a house there hopefully to be able to incorporate my favorite landscape with my favorite form of photography was really fun for me and the photographs from Iceland just turned out so beautiful this one just because pure babe alert again when I take photos on myself and I look so good I'm like yeah this was cool so I went on tour with these amazing humans there was a whole bunch of them behind where I was standing and I was like I set up my tripod I was like we have to do an advanced Sophie and some people you know jumped in for one of the shots and was like oh yeah that's fun but no one really loved it so I was like you guys I'm gonna do it myself so in front of everyone I was like kneeling down and posing like a boss I took one photo two photos with the dogs and that was and it turned out so good that was proud that I could do it in front of more people especially my colleagues which was very nerve-wracking because there's always the concern to be judged the couple's advance selfie to be able to capture moments with your boyfriend or someone you love I love it it make me very happy congratulations beyond for overcoming like his fear of photography and posing here he just slayed we did well squishy we did well this one just because damn beautiful around here is where I started running out of steam for my advanced selfies and I was like I just don't know what to do and I was like I don't want to do this advanced selfie thing anymore and then I went to Bali I took this intense photo because remember to second timer I was like press drop the phone lie down curl up okay did that work check my friend quick do it again I mean can't we just appreciate this one so sexy I also never really allowed myself to be very sexy on photos and I was like that's hot I'm posting that one but I love the brand new editing style that I did here I see this as magazine quality stuff really beautiful artwork and I did that by myself and then to finish off the year I took my but nudity has always been something that I loved exploring my photographs I love my body I think it's beautiful it carries my soul it might have imperfections but I I don't concentrate on them I have no time for that because it carries my stop I can do this because my body lets me to I can breathe because my body is doing that for me so it's at only 8 a.m. and I did this video very proud of myself I'm about to go into therapy for an hour and cry my eyes out no doubt here's my Instagram and Twitter if you would like to see more and until next time guys
