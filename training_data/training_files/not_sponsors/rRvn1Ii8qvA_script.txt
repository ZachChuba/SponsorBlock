everyone seems to be talking about Lilly Singh at the moment and not for the right reasons if you don't know who Lilly Singh is she's a youtuber with around 14 million subscribers who makes pretty cringy comedy videos she recently landed her own late-night show on NBC called a little late with Lilly Singh and although she tries her guts out to be really funny it's just not funny at all and I know comedies a subjective thing so usually that statement doesn't really mean much at all but this is probably the closest thing I've ever seen to something that's objectively not funny at all I understand that for some people white people seeing someone like me host the show is terrifying hashtag not my Carson Daly I mean did you hear that patch teen laughter after she said hashtag not my Carson Daly I mean it was so [ __ ] obvious oh yeah Lilly's also a woman of color which is neither here nor there I mean it only comes up like 42 times an episode alongside [ __ ] white people and [ __ ] men but nowhere were these things more prevalent than in the cheesy rap video Lilly made to promote a new show I actually did a critique of this rap video a few weeks ago but it was blocked worldwide on copyright grounds I mean when you've got 14 million YouTube subscribers and your own late-night show you can't be having some obscure cartoon bear from Australia slinging [ __ ] at your stupid [ __ ] rap video but don't worry I think I can show you pretty much how it went while avoiding Lilly's ban hamma [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so why am I making this video about Lilly Singh well I'm making it because Lilly Singh has recently proven that she is an unoriginal thin-skinned joke stealing hypocrite of the highest order and we'll talk about all that right after I plug this video sponsor the all the hype is about you've got nothing to lose okay so as I was saying Lilly Singh has recently proven that she is an unoriginal thin-skinned joke stealing hypocrite of the highest order now because it's a pretty specific accusation let's cover the joke stealing bit first I had a boyfriend once who was constantly on his phone just swiping swiping and swiping and I was like oh interesting so you do know how to use your fingers because she wants to get fingered wait what's this comedian Mary Beth Barone charms in with great joke feel like I've heard it before I remember now it's from when I set it on Comedy Central and I've been doing comedy for a few years now I will say that it has definitely changed who I am willing to have sex with because for years I was sleeping with hot dudes and now I sleep with comedians so it's just different I definitely don't recommend so you know the comedian unless after sex you enjoy lying next to someone watching them scroll through their own tweets because that's happened to me with more than one person we're just like scrolling scrolling scrolling and I'm like oh your index finger does work post off changing it from being about comedians to being a better boyfriend just seems like an unnecessary flex and now I just pinched it from other kids it's much easier Jimmy or [ __ ] Seth or whatever the [ __ ] your name is no that's unfair let's hear the girl app for eight years and now I have a writers room which is fantastic I just need to humble brag for a sec nice is I think it's very important oh yeah of course you've got a writers room now you're a big late-night TV star so how the [ __ ] did that whole thing happen with the joke stealing and you know the horrendous jokes I I want I was very adamant on having an inclusive writers room that's very important to me so it was over 50% women people of color well maybe you should have been very adamant on them being good writers instead of having brown skin and their vagina alright so I think that's the unoriginal joke stealing bed covered so now let's move on to the thin-skinned hypocrite part the youtuber Jo Aubry recently put out a brilliant video critiquing Lily's news show and a generally dull an unoriginal form of comedy now it wasn't that harsh in fact it was pretty fair and balanced as far as YouTube bro stings go [ __ ] some parts were even pretty damn complimentary on one hand it is junior impressive for not just a youtuber but a woman of color to obtain her very own program on mainstream television most youtubers who are lucky enough to make it on TV only last a couple months and most late-night talk-show hosts are crackly old straight white men as much as I dislike Lilly as an entertainer it's counterproductive to ignore the cultural significance of what she's doing now he obviously did include some pretty significant criticism of Lilly as well you should watch the video there's a link in the description but what was Lilly's reaction to this I mean what would a reasonable reaction be from someone with over 14 million YouTube subscribers and their own late-night show I mean I'd imagine a reasonable reaction would be not to react at all when your audience is that big and your reach is that wide you're gonna get criticism Lilly doesn't seem to agree with me though Lilly decided to go full on Barbra Streisand imagine making a living by posting mean videos to YouTube the downward spiral the bad energy the Karma the entitlement the lack of creativity the waste of potential young kids don't follow this example it's not good for the soul all the longevity of your career so there's the thin skinned hypocrite part I mean just because someone criticizes you doesn't make them mean or hateful and imagine stealing someone else's jugs for your late-night show then lashing out at those who criticize you citing their lack of creativity grow up Lilly anyway thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
