everyone wants something for nothing don't they instant knowledge instant physique well you got to put the work in except sometimes in magic the gathering while lessons on strategy and gameplay are vital knowing the spells just as important and today i'm going to cover some of the free spells in commander you probably didn't know exist and probably didn't understand to give you the upper hand and speaking know it also comes in new fun colors with the release of aquaria commander product many magic the gathering players had an opinion on the cycle of free spells included in these decks whether you're strongly against the perceived power creep of such spells and the fact that they're in a product partially to push the sale of that product or not doesn't really have much bearing on the fact that these are some seriously powerful spells what makes these spells so powerful is that you are able to cast them without paying their mana cost if you're in control of your commander when it comes to hoops to jump through that's a pretty big hoop you can't miss it even if you don't have control of your commander these cards aren't prohibitively expensive to cast on their own making them an auto include in many decks going forward they're all playable and offer something that each of these colors wants to do free spells weren't always this powerful though let's look back at how we got to this place the very first iteration of free spells in a cycle was way back in alliances scars of the veteran force of will contagion pyrokinesis and bounty of the hunt could all be cast for free but on one condition you had to exile a card of the same color in your hand it's no surprise that the only one of these cards to have made a lasting impact is force of will as the other effects are well they're kind of bad for what they cost force of will known usually for legacy is also a great commander card and one that is exceedingly useful for any decks wanting to play intricate combos or play on the stack it's more commonly used in the competitive side of edh where games can end very quickly having free spells to cast in that format can be a huge benefit it's still worth trying out in regular commander if you have a copy though but can be expensive to get a hold of one of the next notable free cycles of cards is the cycle from cold snap which includes allosaurus rider commandeer fury of the horde soul spike and sun scour allosaurus rider is a card you'll instantly recognize if you follow modern where it's used in the neoform combo but it really doesn't cut the mustard and commander soul spike isn't at all worth it either and if you think you have two white cards to spare to exile under a sun scour and mono white i'd love to hear from you the other two are actually a lot more playable despite these cards costing seven mana at base cost commandeer is a super fun spell it's actually been a personal favorite of mine and one many commander players have no doubt fantasized about casting in response to something like a cyclonic rift in blue based decks it's not unreasonable to have enough card draw to not miss the two blue cards from your hand and if you're also in green you likely have enough mana to just hard cast this fury of the horde is a great way to top a curve in an aggressive deck especially if you just need that one more opportunity to attack to close the game and with generals like neheb the eternal or grand warlord radha you can potentially generate the seven mana to hard cast the spell by attacking anyways the next notable cycle i'd like to cover is the pact cycle pacts are powerful cards that let you cast them for free on one condition if you don't meet their cost at the beginning of the next upkeep you lose the game it's a steep cost and you're unlikely to even think about casting one of these spells unless you have a surefire way to pay the cost next turn it also helps that mass land destruction tends to be frowned upon again the white card in this cycle kinda sucks who would have guessed that red pact isn't great for commander either the other three though decidedly playable pactive negation is a free counter spell and one that doesn't care about what you're countering with it so no worrying about non-creature vs creature or what have you it's an absurdly powerful card that sees play in cedh2 and one that is likely to win you many games slaughter pact is similarly powerful in competitive commander and offers a way to remove a problem creature that might be at the heart of a game-winning combo before things can get going both of these cards are strong because they offer reactive answers without having to hold mana up which is what makes some of these free spells so very very strong summoner's pact isn't quite as hot as the other two but it is still an attractive prospect for creature-based decks with a lot of ramp being able to grab an answer in someone's end step is particularly good and gets better if you're playing with flash through cards like eva nature's herald or vidalkin orry you can essentially get an advance and pay on your upkeep even better with a seedborne muse in play but that goes without saying with summoners packed you can always just grab a crater hoof behemoth or n-rey's forerunners and win with it before you need to pay back that loan too hey it's free money i mean mana the most recent free spell we've seen aside from the one in this year's commander product was the cycle from modern horizons force of virtue force of negation force of despair force of rage and force of vigor take their inspiration from the classic force of will and have a similar alternative cost exiling a card of the same color from your hand as this set was designed for constructed formats we don't get the across the board playability of commander aquarius cycle but we do get a cycle of cards that are a lot more playable across the colors of these the two i like for commander are unsurprisingly blue and green ones there's a shock blue and green powerful huh yeah glad they're giving attention to those colors force of negation is a budget alternative if you can call it that to force of will it's currently about half the price but still not exactly a budget card this one only hits non-creature spells true but it does exile them which can get rid of recurable combo pieces for good that makes it a great auto include in decks that play at stronger power levels force of vigor is a fantastic removal spell getting to hit two artifacts and enchantments for four mana is a good rate by itself but the flexibility of this card is what makes it attractive you have the opportunity to remove two early game mana rocks with this effect and honestly sometimes it's worth pitching a card to get rid of some setup pieces sniping out your opponent's soul ring and manicrypt for the cost of a late game spell is sometimes just a value play so we just covered the most notable cycles of free spells that impact commander it's true that there are other free cycles such as the plethora of alternate costs on cards in sets like mercadian masks or the shoals cycle from betrayers of kamigawa but really not many of these are very playable in commander at all there are a couple of cards though that merit a mention and once you start to stretch the definition of free there are a lot of powerful and interesting cards that you can include in your decks let's dig deeper into the welding jar shall we perhaps the only cards on this list that truly fulfill the definition of free are zero cost artifacts artifacts are generally pretty good in commander to say the least and they can help to contribute to different strategies and sometimes provide strong answers such as with tormod's crypt a great answer to graveyard-based strategies but the obvious free spells here are the mana rocks save for lotus petal and manicrypt the rest of the legal rocks have a condition to enable them whether it's controlling a legendary creature or plane's walker from mox amber waiting for the suspend on a mock's tantalite achieving metal craft with max opal or pitching a card from your hand for chrome mocks and mox diamond these aren't exactly free in the strictest sense of the word i mean lion's eye diamond discards your entire hand is that free that's a cost i mean sure you want to use it as a combo card so that cost is rarely a disadvantage but still that aside a lot of these cards are expensive to acquire and you're unlikely to see them played outside of enfranchised play groups or competitive edh let's instead look at some of the more affordable options the aforementioned welding jar is a great option for artifact decks and storm decks too providing free protection for a more important artifact claws of gixx and zurin orb are powerful enablers for sacrifice based decks especially ones that like to sacrifice lands they're a great option for the likes of the get rogue monster or corvold fey cursed king i've covered some ways to use free artifacts in my recent deck texts focusing on two fan favorite dominarian characters baron talarian archmage and joyro weatherlike captain if you want to check out some combos involving those cards you can find those videos here and here in short look at cards like dark steel relic ornithopter and memnite to enable storm-based strategies ornithopter is also a key card in the new winota joiner of forces deck giving an evasive flyer to trigger winoda's powerful effect for free before we move on paradise mantle can turn any creature into a mana dork and is more importantly used to tap creatures you'd like tapped but would rather not send into combat commanders like amara soul of the accord really benefit from this effect and heck there are plenty of merfolk that care about being tapped too like surge spanner and fallow sage who are both in my commander deck unfortunately there is still not a banned legendary merfolk so paradise mantle cannot go on them yet let's see what commander legends has in store probably disappointment one of the biggest level ups that beginner magic players learn is that life total is a resource as long as you're not dead it doesn't really matter what your life total is in the spirit of things let's look at some ways to spend those life points instead of mana mental misstep is a card you'll be familiar with if you follow competitive commander it's pretty nice but in a faster and more powerful style of game actually has myriad applications from hitting soul ring and manifold to stopping swan's song and swords to plowshares this thing can do a lot in fact it handily counters the next card on the list noxious revival is a way to dig something out of your graveyard that you really need to cast again whether it's been milled by an opponent destroyed earlier in the game or just countered noxious revival can get it back to the top of your library for the low cost of two life or a green mana if you have one to spare which if you're in green you probably do whilst it's not as powerful as simply casting regrowth the flexibility of having it be free gives it a lot of legs don't underestimate the ability to replace an opponent's draw with something suboptimal too it's a great solution to an opponent casting a tudor like enlightened tudor vampiric tudor or mystical tudor the last chance a player has to cast one of these tutors is in their upkeep as drawing a card at the beginning of the draw step is an action that cannot be responded to so after the spell resolves ensure you retain priority before passing to the draw step in order to stifle their plans snuff out is a removal spell that you'll be glad to run in mono black decks and really any deck that likes to focus on an urborg tomb of yagmoth gameplan controlling a swamp is a low requirement much like paying for life if you do have to hard cast this four mana isn't the end of the world for a removal spell either and another black card i think is still playable in certain decks is fairy macabre this choo-choo flyer that fits right into both tribal decks and those that like to play in the graveyard can offer a free way that isn't telegraphed onto the table to interact with graveyards mogs salvage and submerge are two cards with more complex conditions but conditions that are nearly always going to be met in a game of commander it's rare that a pod sets up without anyone playing forests or islands and the effects on these two cards can be really strong especially when you're tapped out and an opponent doesn't suspect a thing artifacts are always good targets for mogs salvage and submerge is a great way to fog an opponent or stop a combo next up are some blue spells that can help leave mana open for other things if you have activated abilities you'd like to put mana into or simply other spells that you can cast at instant speed then consider running snap unwind and rewind they're not as universally great as cards like swan's song and counter spell but in the right decks they can provide big tempo swings at effectively the cost of one card provided the spell itself isn't countered one of the strongest untap effects in this design space is treachery which lets you steal a creature and then immediately untap five lands it's devilishly delightfully powerful even if it isn't at instant speed blue is probably the color with the most ways to cheat on mana in order to play a strong effect while not free the following cards are incredibly well costed and efficient for the effect they're setting out to achieve thada adele acquisitor is a legendary merfolk with island walk like you do by dealing combat damage she can steal an artifact from an opponent's deck by dealing combat damage she can steal an artifact from an opponent's deck into exile and if you have the mana to cast it you can cast it that turn the most common targets for this are free or close to free cards especially early in the game think of the free mana rocks we looked at earlier or soul ring later in the game though you might try exiling their combo piece either to remove it or use it yourself also imagine how hilarious it would be to take and then cast your opponent's worm coil engine if they remove it you still get the tokens if they destroy it in response you still get the tokens this kind of finder's keeper's effect is seen in other blue cards from the counter spell desertion which actually lets you take the spell you counter to bribery which essentially lets you tutor for a creature in an opponent's library and put it into play knowledge exploitation is one card i think should see more play there are a lot of playable rogue creatures with more being printed every set core 2021 has five alone with ghostly pilferer being ideal to earn the cost reduction on this card some of the more popular rogues are very hard to block anyway cold eyed selkie true name nemesis and tetsuko umazawa fugitive come to mind knowledge exploitation can let you dig out a game-winning spell from an opponent's deck without paying the mana cost when you've run out of answers and the card overall has many applications from just saving you to enabling your own strategies outside of blue the aether revolt cycle of expertise cards are often close to being free casting a brawl's expertise to bounce three key targets before casting your own four cmc spell is a big tempo swing and rishkar's expertise more or less costs one mana for the card draw component it's often going to be drawn at a higher rate than ancestral recall when uninterrupted which is definitely in the upper echelons of value the definition of free has been stretched a little with some of these cards but in many ways being able to cheat mana or pay a comparatively small amount for a big effect is often as powerful as and impactful as some of the more literally free cards on offer if we do circle back to cards that can be free to play then my final shout outs are going to be to ley lines and lands yeah that's right lans you heard me but first ley lines ley line of anticipation ley line of the void and ley line of punishment are perhaps the most impactful lane lines in a game of commander starting the game with any of these on the table can provide you with a powerful asymmetrical advantage the blue ley line is the strongest here with the ability to play at flash speed in a multiplayer game probably being one of the bigger advantages you can have the other two highlighted are still very powerful depending on your deck's build alright but let's talk lance gemstone caverns asks you is it better to be lucky than good and i'll take lucky any day beginning the game with the land in play already is a huge advantage and provided your mana base can afford to be playing a wastes the rest of the time it's worth a look i like this in high power decks or even justin cice whether like captain at worst you can ramp for wuburg the hideaway land cycle was introduced in lorwin and some of them are pretty easy to trigger in a game of commander moss work bridge spine rock null and wind brisk heights all fit into decks easily enough and the fact you can activate these cards to circumvent timing restrictions should not be ignored dropping a coat of arms out from underneath a windbrisk heights in a tribal deck like vampires after attackers and blockers have been declared can be devastating for example watcher for tomorrow from modern horizons was an example of trying this technology on creatures and is also worth considering once you start to relax the definition of free to consider value plays the card pool opens right up and you'll be sure to see many of commander's staple cards from ways to cheat out creatures like defense of the heart and natural order to engine cards like sneak attack and even commanders like joyra of the ghetto a favorite of mine and yidris maelstrom wielder it's clear to see how in demand circumventing mana restrictions is in commander winning commander games has and always will be about who makes the most efficient use of their mana and increasingly the power creep in the format has meant that playing tap lands and missing plays on the first few turns of the game can seriously impact your chances of winning a game i
