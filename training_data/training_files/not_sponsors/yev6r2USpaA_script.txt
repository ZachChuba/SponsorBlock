victoria is back in lockdown that's right the part of australia i live the people are not allowed to leave their house which is a big deal it's a huge problem for anybody that doesn't sit inside and play runescape all day so for the next 50 days i'm gonna be gaming and gaming hard and i said to myself why don't you just kill five thousand zoras whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa jake nope nope i'm gonna stop you right there five thousand that's a massive time investment what if the viewers don't even like it that's a great point me i'm gonna kill a thousand zoras and if you guys want to see me kill five thousand zora's total let's get 3 000 likes on this video and i'll do it alrighty boys before we jump into the kills we're just going to quickly check the log we're starting on 1263 kills here on the alt account we currently have had one uncut onyx two serpentine vintages one magic fang zero tanzanite fangs no pet no mutagens and no jars of swamp were obviously already capped out on zola scales and four hundred and forty eight as on android teleports nothing in the loot tab in the bank not going to be keeping track of supplies because it's just too hard to keep track of and i will keep a count of how many times i die i feel as though i should also mention at the start of this my pb time is 46 seconds that was gained with twisted bow amethyst arrows this exact same gear i'm wearing right now i got the 46 second pb with i've got a funny feeling we're going to get a faster pb over the course of these kills well you can't argue with that start boys that's a pretty [ __ ] good one i think that's what eight kills since i've made the intro uh we've just picked up the serb fizzy so i'll take it that's one in the bag all right well i guess we figured out the direction that this video is gonna go uh that is the second unique drop in 18 kills to start the video which means we're now gonna go 500 drive bro what the [ __ ] is going on legit three uniques in that's 40kc now what the [ __ ] man this is going to be a good video dude another sir vici i've done set 69 zola kills since the start of this video and we've had two services and two tans fangs in 69 kills what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] dude yeah i mean five uniques in 83 kills no that might be 73 kills it is 73 kills five uniques and we got our last unique on 69 kills as well the double meme the 69-73 oh i don't think i have ever or will ever again see this drop what the [ __ ] that's a sick drop that's cool i'm a big fan oh my god no way another [ __ ] unique i just had to hold that reaction in because i hadn't got the recorder up 212 kills we have received three serb this is two tans fangs and an uncut onyx what the f boys that's another one ticked off the collection log that's a jar of swamp what it's been like 200 kills and we've had [ __ ] six uniques in a jar of swamp don't forget to do that too let's get back to the zorro dude so for those watching this on youtube right now i have a rule in my live stream that if we get two uniques in one day i'll get drunk yesterday we got two uniques in one day so i'm currently drinking which means tomorrow i have to double that up i got a back-to-back drink on live stream oh my god i didn't even notice there was an elite clue with this as well what the [ __ ] man let's go boys three in a day what the [ __ ] i can't believe it you can't make this [ __ ] off at this point man bro how much more [ __ ] up can i get honestly look at this [ __ ] i started tracking this about 20 kills late i just got 99 mage boys that's another one boys that's the big tani fang coming in my god the amount of [ __ ] uniques we've gotten here i don't know how many it's been since the last one it's been a few but uh that's pretty saucy there we go boys been a while since we've had one of these drops another tanzanite thanks to the collection i think that takes us up to four or five i think it's four there we go boys 2 000 kill count on the old account man oh man oh man 500 no 856 kills in we get our sixth tanzanite fang i mean i feel as though if i was an iron man i would be [ __ ] furious at this point and we've managed to crack 200 000 zora scales that last time i checked was a lot of zoro scales kill count 901 another serpentine visage this would have to be the luckiest 1 000 kills anyone has ever done how many uniques is that that's 13 unique drops and a jar of swamp and a thousand kills we're [ __ ] gaming we are [ __ ] gaming yo have a look at that we are 70 63 kills away from 1000 and we pick up another tani fang how's that save the reaction for when i start the recording that you know what i mean all right yeah 974 kills we get another 10 tonight fang that is eight tens fangs in 900 kills i've almost got one every single [ __ ] hundred still no magic fang though ridiculous but we've made a little drop already for a tan fang for any specific unique mason it's a one in five twelve so we should have received two of them and we've received eight eight 991 kills it took me to die at the same time as zoro which means i don't get to pick up these 155 scales 30 dwarf weeds and 1500 pure essence that means they're going to be missing from the final price check and there we go ladies and gentlemen that is 1 000 zora kills oh we got a dragon stone for the last kill that's kind of juicy all right the part that everyone's been waiting for we all know this is why you clicked on the video and you most likely skipped to this part over the course of the 1000s all requires managed to hit the rare drop table 68 times we hit the rare drop table for a grand total of 820k loot not the best so for the first inventory of actual loot it managed to pick up 36.5 mil and just in regular loot as well as the extra 15 mil there so that takes us up to about 50 mil in total loon then four uniques we managed to pick up three onyxes four serpentine vintages eight tanzanite fangs and a jar of swamp for another 54 mil total on top of that 223 000 scales that are worth 45 mil almost taking that up to 99 mil as for the teleports my roonlight tracker is saying 436 we got in drops but if we check the collection log as we checked at the start we're up to 896 teleports and we started with 448 which means in this 1 000 kills we got 448 zoro teleports i've got less than that because i used them to teleport around but that'll be another three mil or so and the grand total loot for the entire tab 153 mil now just having a look on the wiki here on the killing zoro section we can see that killing 1 000 zorus was supposed to net us 128 mil and we managed to get 153. so we got extremely extremely lucky with our drops here and managed to pick up like an extra 30 mil like i said at the start of the video guys i'm not going to sell this tab off if you want to see me continue and do 5 000 zora's we need to get 3 000 likes on this video just so i know you guys are interested and we will kick on with that video and i'll get it out within the next 40 days or so that being said guys that's gonna wrap it up for this video don't forget to check out the golden gnome nominations link in the description if you do
