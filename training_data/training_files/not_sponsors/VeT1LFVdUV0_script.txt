now whether it's whiskey orange juice or Mountain Dew I guarantee you if it's in fluid form somebody somewhere has filled up a loop with it cooled their computer and posted their results online so given how done to death this concept is I really never thought that we'd end up exploring the whole like weird or wacky exotic coolants concept that is until I read a comment from one of our viewers your leg oerstadt who suggested that we try using concrete now hold on I know what you guys are thinking but based on some of our preliminary testing I have reason to believe that this may actually work over the last couple of days alex has put together all the materials that we're going to need to build what I believe is going to be the world's first concrete cooled gaming PC and this video over to join honeycomb slash LTT and get it now [Music] all right so the first thing we're gonna need is some hardware so we gathered up the parts for a pretty sweet modern gaming PC here we've got ourselves a core i7 9700 K 16 gigs of memory we've got our TX 2080 not too shabby I mean the thing is if we're gonna be doing a test like this we want to use something that's representative of a high performance gaming machine because if you use all low power stuff and then you end up with really great thermal results then all you've managed to demonstrate is that low powered hardware produces less heat and doesn't run as hot as high performance stuff so like what's the point of that right zactly which ones us the master case something earlier yeah oh the maker 5t oh this is an older one they did a bunch of sponsored stuff with it oh no it's not actually locked is it can we unlock it from the inside and okay my left arm is a little skinnier than my right for no reason at all well problem solved thermaltake wins by default power for the motherboard there we go man if this works I'm going to be just it really shouldn't put them like you can't deny the initial testing yeah you really can't we weren't even gonna do this video now people might be surprised how many things we try and just never makes it to video now normally these days we use a triple 120 millimeter radiator but again if Alex's calculations are correct we should be able to get away with just a double and get similar or even better results so this is it for our build you know it's actually got kind of like an old-school charm to it I like it oh that isn't there that is the heaviest bag of coolant I have ever seen before oh wow 34 kgs one part quikrete mortar cement two and a quarter to three parts masonry said yeah we're not a button sand in there well yeah I'm obvious reasons yeah that'd be stupid okay I'll bring this guy oh I'll get a bucket of water did you need my help I don't know if for whatever reason I thought we need to people want to like sort of hold it and make sure but this is actually working pretty well do we even need such a big mixer we need like a liter of concrete well um have you ever made concrete before yes actually been a while though now that I think about it okay I mean if we want to take advantage of the cooling potential of it then we have to make sure we actually have enough concrete in there okay that's starting to look kind of closer look we're at a channel how the pros do you want concrete tips you watch a concrete Channel good look at this yeah this will be great alright so yes let's get a baseline reading with water first oh great I was just gonna start putting the concrete in no right yeah good call good call and that way we can make sure the system actually even works - you know it's funny you seem to be expressing a fair bit of skepticism about this whole idea but need I remind you that you were the one who did the initial testing like look at this hey it posted nice okay so we've got working hardware now let's just see if we can boot into Windows so we're at about 35 to 40 degrees idle let's go ahead and start our stress test here okay pretty good about what I'd expect so 55 to 60 degrees so everything seems to be working normally so it seems like it's basically leveled off like we could run up for a while longer but we're just at 62 degrees maximum yeah this is exactly what we'd expect yeah alright let's drain it we want to blow it as much of the water as we can so that we don't have I mean obviously the concrete is just concrete and water so a little bit of extra water isn't gonna kill it but we don't want to get our ratio off think you know I'm beginning to have some second thoughts need to be a bit water here hold on a second look at this as it moves you can actually see it turn more liquid that's what you were saying was supposed to help us right see like you can see it's really solid but as it moves it actually turns to a liquid so you can see the reservoir is actually filling up a lot better than we expected well than I expected anything I don't know what your expectations were so I am more than halfway done check this out and what's crazy is you can actually see that even though it's clearly a liquid cuz it's flowing in there it's kind of solid right now how's that gonna affect things when you get the pump okay uh we might need to power cycle it a couple times but it also might just work for those wondering this is why we use half inch tubing because you're gonna need a pretty thick with two c's to in order to get concrete through it so how do we do this without making a mess all the tubes yeah oh that's not a problem spray it down with some water and then just give it a wipe down with this I mean it's not gonna be perfect but yeah for sure oh this is exciting so we've got two pieces of tubing filled so we can go ahead and attach the pump so Alex this is great I've got two of the tubes on already mm-hmm and I can actually attach the other one to the res right now oh nice okay I guess this is the the moment of truth so when we do get the the heat and the pump going it should like make it more liquidy and just kind of get her on through but uh these are like the heaviest tubes I think I've ever felt and that that looks really thick in there oh that sound do you hear the palm wait oh it's moving it it sounds questionable but uh I think you already don't know I've already posted you have got to be kidding me this shouldn't work okay so I want a second I was pretty scared up to now but why does this work can you are you seeing this no though the tubes like are you seeing this it is her idling it's moving I don't think at 24 we really 4000 check this check the step 28 maximum no way art we jumped like rate up to like 50 to 4 wait what do you mean 52 you mean on the other one yeah on the last one we jumps like Oh even though the coolant is moving like you can clearly see there's flecks that aren't it's almost like there's an inner channel of movement but around the outsides of the tubes it doesn't move at all right you're not maximum 48 degrees so like we can leave this for a bit the thing about water cooling is that normally you only get heat being transferred at the block and at the rad yeah because like the great thing about waters that has such a high heat capacity right yeah well that's exactly why water is supposed to be the best thing for liquid cooling well what the thing is is that concrete is sort of like a ceramic of sorts but a ceramic that you can like have sort of flowing around right so it not only is like heating up there and there but it's also like getting into the concrete that can deposit the heat into the water all along here and then like all along here it will be just taking that heat away so much sense that's why nobody likes having like a concrete floor in their bedroom like when you get out of bed and you step onto a concrete floor immediately it draws all the heat away from your feet and like same thing with like a basement then that's why your basement never gets hot in the summer so why has nobody ever explored this before we are sitting right now at anywhere from 49 to 50 degrees Celsius that is a significant improvement and if you look at this the CPU temp is actually at 28 degrees that's a 10 degree Delta from just water so this is incredible I mean it doesn't look great I mean we could we can clean it up a fair bit yeah everything but you know it doesn't look amazing but the results totally speak for themselves I mean is it high-five time I think so just my hands are kind of cold for working which makes sense again that's why your hands get cold when you work with it like it's so obvious now - you have to come see this what's up just just come along it's a kind of bad things oh no it's not the concrete PC is it you know how we just kind of left it last night yeah cause like you know my god it's not running yeah I think we had like a brownout or something last night oh no yeah oh crap this like doesn't Bend but like I don't know if you can see in there but this is clearly problematic yeah like we we could maybe try turning it on seeing if it'll go but oh I don't think that's a very good shoot okay so we've definitely identified the downside to concrete cooling but that kind of comes with the territory with any sort of enthusiast grade solution and I don't think it's unreasonable to expect people to have a UPS so given that we got a 10 degree improvement in our CPU temps I'm still comfortable recommending it we have certainly seen computer hardware aficionados do more crazy things for less benefit than that speaking of more gonna have that linked below so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video description actually hold on what was it commercial-grade quikrete type mcs that's the one we make sure we have that linked below also linked in the video description is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which is totally worth a joint
