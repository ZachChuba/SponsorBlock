[Music] hey kids animal test subjects have always been an important facet of science since they allow us to study physiology in more destructive ways than we could get away with on humans so she come as no surprise that over the years there's been a lot of creatures haphazardly thrown at the Kosmos against their will here's a bunch of smelly animals that achieved more in their short lives than you ever will quick disclaimer this is by no means a comprehensive list not even close we'd be here all day if it was more so just a highlight reel the ones I found the most interesting so the great zoo in the sky was first founded in 1947 when the u.s. launched a craft containing a bunch of fruit fly 68 miles into the air in order to see what kind of horrible mutants would get made from all the cosmic radiation up there unfortunately they are totally fine so the earth was like a living things can go into space and not die instantly supple and the next year they decided to send up a rhesus macaque named Albert which it seems kind of like jumping the gun to go from barely alive specs to basically a person in one step if it were me I would have thrown like a frog or a gerbil in between there but whatever I'm no cosmopolitan anyway Albert died of suffocation on the way up and never really made it to space alive fun fact this rocket was actually a v2 missile stolen from the Germans after World War two so just in case any of you have any sympathy for those Nazi characters they're technically responsible for the death of a poor innocent space monkey pretty condemning if he asked me but I guess the u.s. felt pretty bad about it so they decided to deal with their grief by naming the next monkey Albert - pretty unhealthy coping mechanism according to my shrink but she also thinks punk is dead so was she now this Albert actually made it into space alive through a grand effort incorporating all the incredible cutting-edge technology that the atomic era had to offer and after all that they goofed on the parachute so Albert too turned into a fine red mist on impact which just goes to prove the age-old adage you can lead a monkey to space but you can't make him land there are a few more Albert's after this Albert three [ __ ] exploded Albert 4 made it up but he had another tissue-paper parachute what don't work for heck so he's out albert 5 yet again bad chute liquefied on impact until finally in 1951 on albert number they figured out how to make a big blanket that consistently makes you not immediately die when you fall from the sky and the monkey was recovering alive from the capsule alongside his eleven mouse roommates of course he died two hours later but a still counts earlier that same year Russia launched two little pup NYX named Siegen and dizzy both of whom came back unharmed these two were the first vertebrates to ever leave Earth and come back alive then in 57 the red snagged another achievement by putting the first living thing into orbit besides the bacteria clinging to Sputnik one but their losers we don't talk about them specifically they launched one brave and daring dog from the streets of Moscow probably the most famous animal that ever go into space you know its name well that dog is of course Air Bud unlike those other guys we talked about like it was never planned to be recovered intact since we barely knew how to put something into orbit by this time let alone bring it back but they still wanted to make sure she stayed alive long enough to at least reach space so before the mission they put her through the most rigorous k9 space camp that Russia had to offer throwing her in a centrifuge for a while to get her used to g-force making her cage progressively smaller to get her used to cramped spaces which made her just not [ __ ] anymore at all but that's a different story they also switched her diet to a special high nutrition gel that she would have eaten after takeoff you know had her brain not crapped out from overheating within the first few hours in 59 the u.s. strapped two monkeys to the nose cone of a Jupiter missile and actually got him back alive afterwards which is crazy mostly because these things withstood thirty-eight G's of acceleration for context that's the force that makes even trained pilots lose consciousness times four or this thing times 12 or roughly the same forced experience when you realize that's not a normal speed bump but one of those evil tiny ones that ruin your life you know the ones well that's what you get for do with 25 neuro Hospital Sam well hey good thing I'm already here considering the ballistics test that just went down between the roof of my car my fricking skull Jesus so in 61 we graduated from monkeys to great apes sending up a chimpanzee named ham remember space chimps yeah it was that frame for frame andy samberg and all what's special about ham is that he was actually trained to pull levers and slap buttons while up in the ship being rewarded banana pellets for completing tasks and getting his feet tased whenever he messed up sounds like a cartoon I know I promises for real meanwhile the Soviets were busy putting a big bald smart ape in orbit no big deal France saw the US and Russia is sending up monkeys and dogs that felt left out so in 63 they launched a cat into space and were like yeah that's cool and unique I'm one of the popular kids now in 68 the Soviets saw the rabbit making rice cakes on the moon and said hmm how about a tortoise for that hare launching two of them into deep space all the way around the moon and back to earth where they were covered alive after their capsule landed in the ocean kind of cheating when you are your own crash suit but an impressive feat regardless and 73 would put mummy chocks in space what's the mummy chog it's one of these things like a fish but real rough-and-tumble tolerates low oxygen weird pressure high salinity dishwasher-safe Energy Star rated you name it sister at first they could only swim in circles but after a couple weeks they actually adapted to zero-g and figured out how to maneuver properly even more interesting we also brought mummy chog eggs and when these hatched though a little mummy chocolates knew how to swim in zero-g immediately kind of spooky honestly that same mission also sent up some spiders who managed to spend some webs trash webs mind you but hey they managed and 78 The Muppet Show aired pigs in space for the first time in 85 we cut off the arms of a bunch of newts and sent them up to see if they grow back the same way the reasoning behind this being if a new can't grow stuff back then an astronaut with a paper cut probably can't either fortunately they rearm themselves at the normal race all it's good on that front around the same time NASA actually had talks with Sesame Street about sending Big Bird up on the space shuttle as a publicity stunt this is real the plan ultimately fell through after they realized Big Bird is [ __ ] giant and unwieldly at all times literally the worst possible choice for a celebrity cameo on a space shuttle so instead they sent a schoolteacher in his place and then the Challenger [ __ ] exploded let me reiterate there is a timeline not too far from this one where her Big Bird is a casualty in the single worst astronautical disaster in history a tiny evil part of me almost wishes that happen like that's just so indescribably absurd in the early 90s we set up some baby jellyfish to grow up in space just for last they figured out how to maneuver just fine but when we brought him back down they literally didn't have a concept of gravity and couldn't orient themselves properly in their new environment which being a jellyfish is the easiest thing there is you just kind of exist - maybe squirm a little now and then so when you manage to somehow mess that up you know things have gone seriously wrong in 2003 the u.s. sent up a bunch of invertebrates including silkworm spiders carpenter bees and harvester ants whoops they exploded and as seven some tardigrades went up totally exposed to the vacuum of space for ten days which surprise surprise they were fine on that same mission a cockroach gave birth creating the first organism that we know of to ever have been conceived outside of Earth and finally in 2018 Elon Musk sent a big basket of mice to the International Space Station just you know because he can so those are just a handful of God's creatures who got to experience the majesty of not knowing up from down if you're like me you're probably a little jealous why does an ugly ape get to go into space but I don't I wish to bear witness to the music of the spheres firsthand in a way that a lower creature could never appreciate you know why you feel like that because you're a nerd and what Salmonella during the signup process anyway that's all for today until next time I have Salmonella and I still don't know it lick my is you
