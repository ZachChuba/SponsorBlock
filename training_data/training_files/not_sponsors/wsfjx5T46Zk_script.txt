yeah I understand well the orders are in we're back at HQ and it's time for us to review the most challenging portion of $1,500 si PC secret shopper projects secret agent Magnum I know this is how all of our competitors responded to a fairly rudimentary technical support request I know I just was setting up to the computer I bought for my brother and I noticed that in the system it says there's only 8 gigabytes of memory but in the order it's supposed to be 16 I get yours today [Music] so first it's our favorite alien work thank you for calling alien where the quickest way to get you to the right support agent is to get your products Express service code this is different from your service tag or asset ID I don't know what my service card would be is this five minutes already I've just peered about are we just sitting here in silence again hello is it me you're looking forward oh you know you're not doing on hold right when you have to come back and say hello are we 15 minutes into this call and they haven't even gotten as far as who are you and what do you have are we being asked for the order number again okay man just take an agenda and transfer your call to technical department we're known as a technical department yet thank you for calling your basic hardware warranty support yeah have your piston service tag or the Express a with food you just ask for all our information again oh my god we're explaining the problem again oh I'm extremely sorry to hear that should happen but you should not have happened yes okay thank you astounding observe a shooting transferred again we have had nearly half a dozen people that we've talked to and alienware in pre sales and after sales support just put us on hold for am i are you able to guide me through it I don't actually know that much about computers then and then she goes through YouTube and shows us the video about how to access the memory okay all right well I'm okay with that on this video we'll teach you how to replace your brown modules on the Aurora r5 nothing beats off billing plastic covers after you Neal Aurora again to alien where's credit this system is pretty straightforward to get at sorry is this the right video are you looking for a different one do I need to unplug it first no it's oh yeah there you go Genesis first first Ram swap everyone ladies and gentlemen so in summary do I understand this correctly it took just shy of a full hour with five separate departmental transfers to diagnose a ram stick that came loose during shipping hopefully the next one can do better here we go all right Origen show me your leadership before BC I do need to verify the information I have once you kill did you provide me with the address so we have a problem okay so it took four minutes to get to the point where we verified the order and everything that's not terrible okay well yeah I definitely definitely see that the invoice says to 8-gigabyte sticks of Origin PC ddr4 three thousands of megahertz Ram it's possible that maybe one of the sticks got loose during transit possible given the vibrations that the Machine Co undergoes during transit you know very possible that one of the modules came slightly loose enough you know to not be recognized this would require you having to essentially open up your machine so that you can double check on this are you familiar with PC hardware to any extent like would you be able to identify memory modules on a motherboard probably not would you be able to help me out with that kind of problem absolutely you got the email with the link to the Dropbox video that's kind of weird why wouldn't they just host it on youtube I gotta say alien where's production values were a little nicer that's probably not the way that I would show most users how to do that ideally putting using both your thumbs to put equal force on each end of the stick and you'll feel a very noticeable click his video 3 out of 10 his instructions solid 9 out of 10 I gotta say Janice for someone who doesn't seem to have been doing this before you you've you've done this a lot faster than some of the most of the customers I'm on the phone with so haha smooth operator ah interesting so we've actually thrown an extra curve ball at origin PC here plugging the HDMI connector into the motherboard rather than our dedicated graphics card oh that big card has a ribbon cable that goes from the card itself to the motherboard and if that came loose slightly then you're probably not gonna get a picture this is a good explanation but he's got the wrong diagnosis let's see how long it takes him and to clarify when you initially got picture do you know whether or not you were coming out of the graphics card or the over the onboard video on a motherboard he's done this before 19 minutes including a detailed explanation and walkthrough of the petcock with plugging the monitor into the on-board IO versus the GPU directly competent great job thank you for calling main gear manufacturer of a would winning pcs and workstation now this is the real test if they can manage to turn an order number into like really the order number would be five or six digit and start with an eight or nine okay at least that's clear instructions all right let me let me remotely connect to your p2p and I would look at a couple of things all right pops up device manager I don't know what he's expecting to find in device manager he's probably just kind of like oh I haven't done this in a little bit hold on there it is slots used one of two immediately nails the diagnosis if you look inside your machine so ten minutes to diagnosis you should see a let me go look at your one as well if I could be more specific Wow okay nice there should be four or it could be four or eight but usually it's for vertical flight oops it's two and it said that in task manager I guess they don't sell a lot of low-end stuff I would usually assume a main gear system probably has four or eight computer shut down the computer I'm gonna have you open up the machine and we're gonna make sure those things are in there properly does he mentioned unplug it though okay so with the computer shut down I want you to unplug all the connections from the back all right rock on main gear guy looks like that's all it was just a loose Ram stick but you're you're all set if um running any other issues feel free to give me a call back sure thank you so much that's it so excluding some random nonsense with our monitor not properly waking from an HDMI signal etc about 15 minutes start to finish dang one quarter of the time and so much less frustration like it was just friendly the voice on the other end of the line is crystal clear I mean you can't take that kind of thing for granted honestly like you could understand the guy for tech support press 3 straight to tech support like why doesn't del have that feature those thing that complicated if you feel comfortable looking inside of the PC remove the left side panel of the computer pull out the sticks of RAM and simply repeat them to see if in case one of them is not data properly got the diagnosis is that excuse me mother did I even just hear you correctly the motherboard I advise you either you know from so many family member has a little more experience or have someone help you remove that stick around Madrid not everybody has a family member that can help them that's why they bought a prebuilt Ammar guy ok I don't really know who to ask so you you're not able to like tell me what I'm looking for six of em are on the motherboard itself [Music] so is it Those to vertical [Music] he's a brand corner yes Oh you promised that would be pullin odd and play it back in but again be careful with that because if you're on what you're doing you break something you're gonna put all your warranty on them thanks buddy so I just should find someone else to help me if you have a family member or friend who's tech savvy yes it is I by power employing her friend or family member to provide their tech support he's just waiting for her to hang out like hey yeah not a not a problem to not be very helpful with anything unreal in Dells defense they got the problem solved an hour's investment in getting your new computer setup or whatever is not the end of the world given you're gonna run it for eight or nine years but to just treat the customer like an idiot and outright refuse to help them okay and you're not able to help me through that not my ability to manage your ability to look inside Experian I'm familiar with the part it's gonna be very difficult to do anything inside of this requires it's not my ability it's your ability completely unacceptable I'm ready it can't be worse than a lien here oh so they don't even have an easy way to get in touch with them I actually don't even mind this form on one condition it gets best on when someone picks up the phone they have read and understood it hold on I'm transferring you to someone who can help you now do I have the pleasure of speaking with today hi my name is Janice [Music] and electing toll camp so he doesn't have the form what is the purpose of the farm holy Sh he's asking for her phone number alright so what we're gonna do is we're gonna get a hold of the sales department why to get solutions for your HP product please hang up and go to WWF port hp.com where you can troubleshoot or get software and drivers when your phone support that you can only call by finding the number by navigating the  website tells you to go to the website your done goofed sorry I still didn't get that just tell me what kind of product you're calling about desktop PC okay we make many types of desktop PCs you might say something like pavillion Spectre presario omni TouchSmart or envy go ahead and tell me what kind you have omen have your product model and serial number ready for your agent hold on I'm transferring you now okay Janice oh yeah it looks like they did ship go like the configuration that shipyard does actually you have to eat I don't see issuing 16 like the one they ordered we personally removed half the memory so unfortunately all I do tech support I'm unable to access like a the sales offer --two look it up but I can't provide you the number if you'd like so here's the issue right now every company we talked to where the rep had an ounce of experience with PC hardware immediately identified the problem I'm not imagining that this is common okay I know that we were trying to get you over to like the Canada sales department today send you back over to us yes okay what did they end up saying exactly well they did confirm that like the order was for 16 gigabytes and then I got transferred a bunch of times and I ended up here somehow interesting let me let me see here [Applause] you should have 16 gigabyte right yeah that's what I thought as well probably there's the there's a setting that you need to check or verify that ma'am if it's acuity I can connect you to Darwin technical support what setting makes RAM up here Oh cut the download URL is he actually gonna start trying to troubleshoot for us now is this is this the magic moment 20 minutes in or whatever let me put you on a brief hold what I do a little bit more research here it shouldn't be any more about probably five to seven minutes or something we'll be right back with you okay Dennis thank you for that okay how long were we on hold for ten minutes [Music] 14 twice as long the amount of time we spend on hold without nothing happening is the amount of time it took like mania in order to resolve the whole problem and the amount of time that Dell spent in complete and utter silence I don't know why they ended up actually transferring you back over to us that should have been handled on their set of things in order to get that fixed because you just stopped the computer is well before the 30 day mark and everything like that they should have been able to get that going to rectify the issue for you you had mentioned like looking in the case and checking or like seeing if I had the two sticks which I haven't done I don't know much about computers so I didn't dare do that should I should I do that first again Janus helping out tech support here what can happen while computers are being shipped and everything they do get to moved around and everything so it could end up being that it just needs to be unplugged and plug right back in on both of them because we don't know which one could be unseated and then it might actually fix your issue right there as being able to detect that it has 16 gigabytes after that okay he knows so here's my issue with this guy because he has mostly come across as though he pretty much knows what he's talking about the issue though is seems to be a policy one if I had to guess within 30 days its sales problem after 30 days tech supports problem he just was trying really hard not to have to do troubleshooting instead opting to send free product or push us back to sales like it's not like they weren't willing to solve the problem they just didn't want to diagnose it isn't that weird like 8 gigs of RAM that's not insignificant that's like 80 bucks they were just gonna send it HP managed to be worse 72 minutes to get a stick of RAM unseated and reseeded and HP had the advantage of Janice already actually knowing how to pull out and replace memory by this point are you ready to declare a tie origin and main gear with shockingly Dell with that performance taking the bronze medal here followed by HP who ultimately did at least solve the problem with iBUYPOWER in dead friggin lasts they're not even the best they're like well they just didn't
