Trans and subs by: Mary Tuan Why aren't I waking up? I always woke up around here I can't talk, I don't like it To be honest, I hadn't realized before Why are you softly holding my hand and whispering to me? I don't know, I can't hear anything You're too close It makes the whole world spin, I'm dizzy! Now, you, me and everything seems like a lie Every second with you seems like a lie Is it a dream? Maybe not? I'm confused You said you like me What should I do? I think it's for real! We're walking under the light Round and round, my eyes are following you I'm lightly trying to match our steps It's real, I think we're going to be a couple I feel a little breathless Don't say this awkwardness is bad That lovely look looks like when I'm looking at you I lightly opened my eyes and I saw you pass my street You're only one meter away maybe even closer and it makes the whole world spin, I'm dizzy! Now, you, me and everything seems like a lie Every second with you seems like a lie Is it a dream? Maybe not? I'm confused You said you like me What should I do? I think it's for real! We're walking under the light Round and round, my eyes are following you I'm lightly trying to match our steps It's real, I think we're going to be a couple This melody I'm listening which I imagined countless times You trembling, I fluttering and we dancing in a soft pink lightt You and I being this close seems a lie Your heart ringing like crazy seems a lie Is it a dream? Maybe not? I'm confused You said you love me What should I do? I think it's for real! We're walking under the light Round and round, my eyes are following you I'm lightly trying to match our steps It's real, I think we're going to be a couple
