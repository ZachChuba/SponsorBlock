that defense is just an absolute weapon for the San Francisco 49ers Aaron Rodgers was under siege the entire game Aaron Rodgers made a bad throw for that guy to undercut it there in the first half whenever they were down 17 already or whatever was they had a quarter center back Center quarterback exchange issue obviously it gave the ball back to the 49ers and at the end he is just throwing it up because they're down three scores have to make a big play he let that thingy but that San Francisco 49ers team the defense is hungry that front line can cause absolute chaos for an offense or yeah for an offense in the San Francisco 49ers offense on the other hand can run the ball all over the place cow Moos check in cash in hand the - Kyle's they got over there yes the whitish names in history yes very Caucasian but Kyle Shanahan schemes up these plays George kid oh by the way one of the most electric and explosive football players on the offensive side of the ball yesterday realize all you need me to do is just pancake people I can do that for you debo Samuel the wide receiver rookie wide receiver not only his stud when he catches the ball blocking people downfield it was a full team effort and a commit to that run and Moses saw and reap the benefit of that he had a hundred and eighty-six yards rushing yesterday before he was even contacted before he was even touched those holes were bigger than the ones ron jeremy used to hit he was running all over the place and that's because that Niners team has great design they have great grit they have great plays and most importantly they have a team that has bought in completely - walked out Shane hands pitching good defense the offense can win in a multitude of ways they can throw if maybe they did that with the Saints yesterday they ran it coughs Shanahan was asked by Terry Bradshaw by the way Terry Bradshaw did a lot better with interviews and I thought he was gonna do I mean I'm a big Terry Bradshaw fan big Terry Bradshaw fan he into those interviews a lot better than I thought yeah I mean because everybody knows Terry Bradshaw has a chance to kind of well scatter Brad go wherever he wants he handlers interviews well he asked how shamian about why they ran the ball so much he said cuz it was working what do you want me to do that's an in-game adjustment by the way he probably planned on Jimmy G thrown about more than eight times he probably planned on utilizing Emanuel Sanders and George kiddo and all this debo salmon down the field but then wherever he that Green Bay Packers couldn't stop a damn thing on the ground he's like hey listen boys let's just hammer this home and the rest are over 300 yards or something my god absolute insanity and if there's a team that can maybe possibly keep up with the Chiefs it's the Niners we got it right I'm excited for the Chiefs and the Niners I'm sad for the Packers I think they had a hell of a run ugly winning 13 games or 13 game win season this year got a win the playoffs against Russell Wilson good for them they're a very young team though well seeking now back to the magic-like the fifth youngest roster in the NFL 26 years old is the average age Aaron Rodgers says he sees the 18th hole but he's also a happy playing football game which he wasn't for a long time under McCarthy I think he comes back maybe he digests the LeFleur offense during the offseason gives a little bit more critique I think we should do this more this year this more this year get them a couple more weapons on the offense side of the ball sure up that defense they obviously found a weakness in a run game you have to do that come back more prepared for next year but I think in a rebuild which is what happens when you get a new head coach to get to the entry championship as a Packer fan you got to be happy now for the Titans they have 28 free agents this year 28 free agents this year I'm no mathematician but that's over half the roster future is in limbo nobody knows what's gonna happen some of those players some of the key players might never see each other ever again and that's just a fact that's how the NFL is that Titans team understood what they had in that locker room they understood the momentum that they had in that locker room they understood that what the business that is ahead that this is probably the last chance at this group of guys this team is gonna be able to make this run that's why you saw so many dudes distraught after that game I think on both sides but for me the Titans chance position now they gotta take care of Tannehill they got to take care of Derrick Henry they got to take care of the other 26 free agents which is not going to be an easy task hell of a run by the Titans hell of a run by the Packers very very excited for the Niners Chiefs Super Bowl championship
