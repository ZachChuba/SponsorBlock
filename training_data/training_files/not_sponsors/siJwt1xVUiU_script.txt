welcome to my kitchen I'm Claire a 91 years old today we are making meals from the Depression [Music] good morning we're gonna make egg drop soup today of course we can't we have to have our potato and eggs and onion to start so I'm gonna peel the potato during the Depression everything had potato now you could see why we would buy a whole bag of potatoes but I didn't remember exactly how it's done so I called my brother and he told me about the potato I I didn't think this had forgiven but I guess he was right my brother was a different type altogether than I am small easygoing it's not easy going tell you that much I think it's better like I am i flare up and then get it over with people that don't get mad when they get mad do beware say that they're all guys now I'm gonna put the onion you notice all the meals I made have the same ingredients onions potatoes now after your onion and the potatoes are dice and I put olive oil now after you cubed these vegetables put the olive oil and then you put them on the stove to brown them next I get the eggs ready but we won't put them in until later now it's just brown these put some Bailey's salt and pepper you can make these at home now variety that's not ready yet they're getting there yeah my brother later the real bad trick on me one time he put a little garden snake in the envelope put it in the mailbox with my name and Andres so I thought I was getting some male and when I picked up the Ember and start wiggling and I thought I'd die I was so scared he got a good whipping that time okay now that the things are browning so I'm gonna put water it but I have four pots full okay put it back on the stove to make the broth you put water then you put salt and pepper in the water and cook it with the potatoes that's it nothing to it that's that simmer for a while I'm gonna taste this if there's enough salt in there a little more soft more pepper now we let this boil the potatoes have to cook so we have to wait a while before we put the eggs in that's that's as far as I could do now potatoes are cooked already now we got to put the egg and have to scramble some then the others will leave hole wait these are really brown that's just the next one I'm gonna be cold well I put enough water for I put 6 things first before you scramble in the pot stir it so they scrimp and then the other two or how many people you have to eat you leave the eggs cool when you service you have the person that's gonna eat it heaven holy hope it tastes okay oh you gotta put the cheese in at the end just before you put this cheese in at the end you put the cheese you stir it and that's this turn it off and ready to eat class for a special surprise you put the bread and pour the soup over it and 1/8 on top I prefer toast so we're going to toast the bread this is how you made egg soup which was very inexpensive and very nutritious and very good after you make the soup you sit down because you're tired you
