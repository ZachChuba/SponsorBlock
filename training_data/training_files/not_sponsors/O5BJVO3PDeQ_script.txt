ditty uncocking an increasing aspect ratio now punch it there it is life on another world and to think we owe it all to one indie development studio hello games let's start at the beginning yeah it's rewind time okay the year is 2009 Guilford England there's a man named Sean Murray and he's just founded a company called hello games Sean and the boys are working hard on a brand new IP called Joe danger 2010 ad the game just came out it's a success their small team but they are ambitious let's do something bigger let's reach for the stars how about Joe danger - brilliant it's 2012 Gerry danger - has just come out but that one doesn't perform as well we need to do something even bigger than Joe danger to show danger 3 no no even more out of this world something no man has done before Joe danger the mobile game yes and that came out in 2014 seriously guys biggest thing you can think of no I'm just a stock image dude why don't you think of something Shaun pondered for a moment then turned and looked wistfully into the mirror reflected back was the visit of Neil deGrasse Tyson but if you're gonna make a space game first person I've never been done before how about death I'm throwing up in orbit to repair the Hubble telescope hey that's not a knife we didn't have sex with how much microwaves are coursing through your body now the planet Sid Mary hmm space gang procedural generation planet ok that sounds good yes yes we all agree so they said to work coupled together a prototype and by vgx 2013 they are ready to announce another new IP no man's sky check it out check it out [Music] this is special [Music] [Music] it's 2014 and it's III hype time no man's sky has promised to be a game like Noah a practically boundless experience vibrant with life and color and things to explore what's over there you'll have to be the one to discover it and then wow look at that big pink dinosaur holy [ __ ] and a moment later we're in space having a battle amongst a giant fleet claim a planet as your own explore the galaxy with your friends okay that's it this is gonna be the best game ever you guys it even won awards for a title and it will release in June 2016 the hype train was officially loading up and ready to chug out of the station fusion at every stop of the journey there would be pressed Rockets talking about the amazing scale of the day spread across 18 quintillion planets it's so vast that by the time you finish exploring it all I would have to new video is published Sean himself was doing the interviews because who is better to talk about the game than the lead guy himself he went from interview to interview and with each question the answers he gave raised people's expectations of the game's scope can you land on a comment yeah at the moment you can land on asteroid you could encounter other players can you grief other players clearly building your own like massively multiplayer world that's rarely generated sand planets like in June rivets walking sentinels hacker so sophisticated that light diffracts through the atoms they had to redevelop the whole periodic table to make it work what even Elon Musk was hyped for it [Music] two years go by it's early 2016 and that hype train is really moving now perhaps one of the biggest in video game history reddit was troubling most of the gamer fuel skeptics and naysayers are treated as ballast have thrown from the carriage doors pre-war desertion and they are doing very well the date is booked in some are even taking the day off work so much hype there is that uh Jason Trier of the soon-to-be defunct Kotaku is about to spoil at the party he announces a delay from June 2016 - August oh my god liar the incensed audience cries please be quiet they said and death threats - but he was 100% right a week later the delay is officially announced ooh sorry lads we need more polish CID Sean in his usual accent - that Sean received some death threats - by the way although he didn't take them as seriously or go to the police yet sometimes foreshadowing is relatively obvious but the impatient crowd relaxed a bit and said fine we will wait but we expect a level of Polish no man has ever seen mums did braid shadow legends add over so let's talk about the team in charge of all their polishing it's small tiny in fact I haven't been able to find a smaller team behind a triple a release all of these expectations are on the shoulders of just six people expanding to a team of 15 by the end of production July it's just a couple of weeks until the release date whatever the state of the game by now however much it's finished that's what's going out the hello games team celebrates with this iconic image the quintessential soy thing they're exhausted look at what video game production does to a man nonetheless they continue working on the day one patch and uh-oh Shawn if your game isn't coming out for another two weeks then why is there a box copy on eBay that's right it's a leak someone broke the embargo and is selling early access to the highest bidder and the bids start rolling in it reaches $1,300 u.s. sold to some guy with the reddit handle Damian he gets his hands on it and starts uploading footage to YouTube and dailymotion what did Shawn and Sony Damian finished it a lot quicker than expected but he gave it a decent review there are things I don't like there are things I like but at the end of the day when I say to myself what is this game supposed to be this what I'm looking at right here this is what the game is supposed to be he noted a few problems but said he was optimistic that they would be ironed out with the day one catch Shawn it's another leak some retailers broke the official release date journalists - and they started streaming playthroughs of the game [Music] certainly tried to DMCA all these videos but their aim was terrible round of applause everyone we have officially become no man's censored by Sony our news story from earlier this week about no man's sky leaks has been hit with a copyright strike on YouTube they win bumbling around from platform to platform just taking down any video that even talked about the leak or showed the trailer footage but it was too late the footage had people talking more skeptically about the game especially because there were no early review copies at fair and it was looking like the weight of all these expectations had become too much and the whole thing was about to give oh no it's August everyone's here we've all bought the game and we have [ __ ] hype shall we go let's oh dear Lord it isn't finished gah hello Sean it is me the auditor of games I used to work at an astronomy lab don't worry about that it seems like you've made a lot of promises promises that you have not kept let's go through the checklist have you got any large scale join of all space battles nobody would want that are ringed plan and now no fight well at least let me play as a trader some may call this junk no those sand planets from June look nice think I might huh please Jordan there must be river now no no it's not animals interacts with each other in the environment and now no packs of walking sentinels Sean now I'm literally crying right now should I even ask whether I can play as a space pirate no factions with different attributes fly between star systems manually but nobody's actually done it yet if I can maneuver like in the trailer I'll still be happy now well day/night cycles determined by the orbit of the Sun yeah really no land on an asteroid radio chatter name you share packing portals all that stuff about the elements sure this is not good Sean very not good and ironically the only plugs this game doesn't have other butterflies in the demo buried buildings aggressive emojis tractor beam malfunctions animal husbandry oil slick world raining grass [ __ ] animals doing [ __ ] things ships interiors disappear first-person mode as a gun let's not help flying works let's my only means of transportation leaving the planet take off really take up holes in the map pulls in my graphics card whole lotta nothing from down here textures buggin out animals buggin out animals breakdance look at these busy hands hello there and a couple of unrequested ejector seats [Music] okay that's a lot of stuff I get the picture no wait for graphics rendering some can't even stop the game framerate issues constant crashes major publications are having trouble playing the game on their machines even the best na GTI is a stuttering alt tab it that's a guaranteed crash disc top notifications that's a crash playing the game that's our plan changing options in the game without restarting you'll get this and if you've got the pre-order version with the bonus spaceship you might have a problem your special ship already comes with a hyperdrive inside it great right no because you have to craft it in order to finish the tutorial missions and if you haven't finished the tutorial missions you can't leave the stars so whoops until they patch it you're stranded that's why I gave my kids snowman sky [Music] ah my ships and bits thank you just a quick note about how high expectations were for this game and just how many people bought it on release myself included over three-quarters of a million purchases on Steam at launch it's the single best selling game on the PlayStation Store that month and the large proportion of people who bought it in the hopes of playing with their friends well you're in for a surprise this one is a literal game changer is it even possible to meet up with your friends in no man's sky the answer is absolutely yes it's possible on multiple occasions Shaun said it was definitely in the game will you be able to play with your friends yes can you run into other people other players on the game yes but then just before the release Shaun posted this cryptic tweet to be super clear no man sky is not a multiplayer game please don't go in looking for that experience oh so there's no multiplayer function but then the next line contradicts that because the chances of two players ever crossing paths in the universe this big is pretty much zero oh so it is multiplayer just have to overcome this finding each other huh so you're telling me there's a chance yeah right no it's more confusing than that because the Box doesn't mention online play just network features and the collector's edition had its online play icon stick it over so customers are going which one is it Shawn just tell us if it has multiplayer or it doesn't have multiplayer Shawn wouldn't give any answers but after hundreds of thousands of purchases people soon took it upon themselves to find out despite the claims that it would be so improbable on the very first day two people noticed they were only four star systems from one another and they met up on the same planet in a live stream oh dear a black pillow alright yeah our streams are exactly lined up if you go look at my stream we're looking at the exact same interior right now if you don't yep that's the same spot and they can't see each other that settles it it's not not multiplayer because it's so big it's not multiplayer because it's just not [ __ ] multiplayer and this live declare robot what did Sean have to say about all this so amazing two people found each other on the first day that has blown my mind so why can't we see other players in game wow so many of you playing yeah Sean amazing my mind is blown so what's the game actually like is it any good that is a difficult thing to say well it certainly is stylish and pretty and there are a lot of places to explore but that doesn't mean there's much to find in fact the game boils down to a very simple loop hold down the trigger to pick up resources deal with a full inventory get an upgrade leave the planet go to another planet hold down the trigger deal with a full inventory get an upgrade leave the planet go to another planet hold down the trigger deal with a full inventory leave the planet go to another planet deal with a whole new 60 dollars ladies and gentlemen refuel your multi-tool refuel your life-support refuel a separate part of your multi-tool that shoots bullets instead of the mining beam refuel your launch thrusters it's a busy work that makes it look like you have something to do it's not real what followed was one of the most traumatic crashes and player numbers in gaming history sales in the UK fell by 81% in the second week concurrent players on Steam dropped from two hundred and twelve thousand in August to just over 2,000 by September and fewer than 1000 by October and what followed that was perhaps the biggest pile on in gaming history reviewers on YouTube hand the game [ __ ] it up I had no hype and I can tell you that even without that disappointment this game is hot garbage it has anyone coined Sean Murray news numerous times within the first two hours of the game I kept saying this is it [ __ ] this [ __ ] review is in the media will all missus hawk devastating realization that most of the crafting combat and other activities you do on and between those planets ranges between bemusing and outright ban the criticism was deafening and a lot of it really funny and creative Kirby can't made a video that captured the sentiment of that day and if you haven't seen it yet you missing out so people are furious the game is boring and soon people discover the complaining about the game is actually more fun than playing it well I'm now three to half hours into the tutorial pretty much so they started complaining about it like they were grinding for an achievement this sauce many people made compilations of all the unfulfilled promises one guy on the subreddit compiled a big list of all the missing features front page got a defense for no man sky enjoy your down vert in fact the entire no man's sky subreddit was in such disarray it had to be locked so by the end of the month mere credit is like scrolling through a bottle of Cheerios by October it was one of the worst rated games on Steam with an aggregate of mostly negative from more than 70,000 reviews the outrage of the game was headline news for weeks on dozens of games news publications and the price on eBay and Amazon and second hand at Game Stop was crashing through the floor oh please no more but the beatings had only just begun the demo planet was data mined and found to be of course totally scripted and not randomly generated at all I just got to pick one of these at random if anything horrible goes wrong just keep in mind that I've not been here before it wasn't some level that we built or something like that even though I think it looks quite nice in places people watching this would wonder why you're showing this area again like what's so special about demoing the game on this planet oh no no it's just a place that looks nice not bad Marie I could have ended the demo with you know pre-scripted crazy thing that would happen you know to mean the normal thing of like and then a monster emerges from behind the mountains you don't [Music] people see what's going on with the game and feel lied to this is false advertising they say and angry customers start scoping out a lawsuit on September 28th the aasa' bust through the door goes yep too many complaints we're going to investigate but then soon after the aasa' cleared them of any legal wrongdoing technically the only thing they're interested in is what's on the back of the box what's on the store page and what's on the steam page so it's technically not false advertising but of course technically not illegal doesn't mean much to an angry audience October 28th hello games twitter is hacked the hacker posts no man's sky was a mistake and is [ __ ] on the game in the replies turns out Shawn didn't use two-factor authentication on his LinkedIn and that's how they got in they also sent us credit in emails to journalists which they knew would rile people up if published some people even show up to their offices to take photos and knock on the door even at night and on the weekend they posted empty pictures of the office so naturally out of context this started rumors that hello games simply took the money and ran this in addition to numerous bomb and death threats during that period those ones Shawn did have to take seriously regular intervention from police and Scotland Yard and things like that and while Sony didn't quite throw them under the bus it was more like a gentle push under a minivan when Sony president Shuhei Yoshida admitted that hello games did not have a great PR strategy for no man's sky the press took the ball with that one and ran but despite all of this all of the negative press they were actually nominated for a couple of awards but by this point Murray and the other members of hello games were so downtrodden and so sure they weren't going to win there they opted to go elsewhere for dinner and the Innovation Award goes to no man's sky this lovely trophy going once oops I'm gonna set this other behalf of hello games and congratulations to them and I'm gonna walk out stage like I planned that whole thing by this point you've got to feel just a little bit sorry for them and then what followed that was the final straw for meaning no particular incident but a lack of incidents silence over three months of not a damn word from no man sky where are they where is my refund where is Murray shout into the void the game was over and it was dead the year is 2080 Shawn has just graduated from university and is headed into the big wide world he rises up the ranks at a number of studios eventually working as a technical lead for black and technical director for burnout three when burnouts developer is bought by EA he is in his late twenties and he and three of his buddies decide to leave and start their own studio hello games this was a risky venture so we'd done this incredibly foolish thing of like quitting our jobs and then we had to sit down and try and decide what the game was gonna be together they create their first title Joe danger they work on this game day and night in fact even once they were arrested in their own office because the police thought they were there to rob the place because who would be working at 11:00 p.m. on a Sunday night but they had to work that hard like any startup it was a huge financial and professional risk they had no income they were working in a tiny room above an old tile floor living off savings and to keep the project running Shawn even sold his house so he made a really tough and probably at the time seemed really foolish decision it's got of almost embarrassing for me to talk about I sell my house and just basically went all-in and funded what we were doing which is not something I would recommend anyone else do but by June 8th 2010 they had done it the game was good and they could breathe the sigh of relief because on the very first day it hit the PlayStation Store they made their money back two years later Joe danger too was released it was not the commercial success they had hoped for and they didn't want to just keep pumping out sequels that was a trap big players in the industry had fallen into in his spare time Sean started working on a prototype for a procedurally generated game they took another gamble and scrambled to get a trailer out in time to present at vgx 2013 so the project is official now and the pressure is on around this time Sean is also looking to start a family concurrent all this development he would go on to have three kids so the weight of responsibility is really piling on but their hard work will pay off as they're finally going to have a chance for some R&R around Christmas they woke up to find their homes flooded their cars submerged and their plans for Christmas Day very much ruined bad news rain rain and flooding in the South of England right around the hello games office they are completely inundated and they return from their holidays to find laptops floating around at waist height but some good news they hadn't lost any data so they pulled together soldier on development continues so there they are working in a damp office and then dingdong who who's at the door it's Danish mathematician dr. Johann Gilles he's seen the game and he says they are using my super formula in perfect English and there is a potential for a lawsuit Shawn says they didn't and he could prove it so they have a meeting and the claim is eventually dropped lawsuit evaded so her back to work guys ding dong it's Sky Television they've seen the game you were infringing on our sky trademark they said in perfect text-to-speech they had succeeded in gaining Microsoft changed SkyDrive to onedrive and now we're about to give gamers no man's one under threat of lawsuit but this lawsuit didn't just go away the threat loomed over them for the next three years right up until the month before release so they get back to work and ding dong its Sony with some good news for what we like a game kid we want to feed her at front and center and make you a big star this could mean millions of dollars in additional revenue they said yeah but along with it a lot of press for this game would need to be done being a small team they didn't have anyone for PR they had their designers they had their developers and that was about it so it's up tomorrow Shawn's in his early 30s now not super young but relatively young and inexperienced for this type of media circuit this deal with Sony put extra pressure on it set deadlines it's not that it's Sony's fault but they're locked in now with much less flexibility so when May rolls around and they have no option but to delay even if they wanted to ask for an extra six to twelve months of development which they really need it's probably too much to ask for so they extend from late June to August only six weeks from here you can predict what's gonna happen to multiplayer and a bunch of other promised features so here's how the hype happened scope of game time and here's the line which shows the reality of development progress is steady and ends in August 2016 now here is the line of player expectations it should start out here and follow along the purple but the overhyping trailer comes out and puts us way up here in this trailer it features a bunch of things that hello games thinks they're capable of having in the game by 2016 that's the first big mistake then it's announced for PlayStation and it costs $60 and there's a collector's edition second even bigger mistake that puts us all the way up here and I think this is the main problem because price tags set expectations for a $60 game this was seriously barren and disappointing now if they have put it out for $20 an indie game or an Elfa no problem but when they gave it the triple-a treatment people rightfully aligned to their expectations with other games in that category that is the main reason customers expectations with so skewed then Murray Winter interviews exacerbating the problem every time you mentioned a feature in the game even in passing fancy their expectations to triple-a Heights for that feature now some people think the interviews are the main problem in my humble opinion not so much most people never saw these interviews it's not that rickety 12 foot ladder Shawn standing on that's the main problem is to the 900 foot building he's perched it on in the first place so the obvious solution here would be in official statement hey guys look don't expect a 10 out of 10 expect more of a 5 out of 10 no the publisher just sank an enormous investment of marketing and opportunity into the game and that would be a huge middle finger to them the publisher isn't gonna make you hype the [ __ ] out of your game but you can't talk it down either so it's kind of stuck up there in some ways during the interview he tries to temper expectations but it's limited can you build a space station no but let's not gloss over the interviews Shawn is a technical guy he's a developer he's also the introverted type and the big lights and the stuff on camera does not come naturally to him is it super nerve-wracking to talk on stage 83 yes I personally find going on stage 83 like the hardest thing I've ever done that's something that I would have had in a nightmare before you know what I mean it's a thing you've ever done yeah yeah still he stepped up and took interviews for his game from 2013 to 2016 and the main thing people wanted to hear about we're the features can you have more than so every planet really be wormholes or at what point do you get you get points or anything from these interviews people took Shawn to be a liar a Peter Molyneux or a chess club member out to sell his game at whatever reputational cost but I think the truth is more complicated than that Shawn in the team our indie developers working on a new IP their project and plans are constantly in flux they have no idea how large chunks of the game are going to look especially not a couple of years out from release and crucially Shawn doesn't understand that something mentioned in 2013 even sidon parsing is going to be seen as a promise in the year 2016 even if by then you've decided to cut it from the game for example orbiting around the Sun days turned it out because the planet has actually rotated on its axis this originally was in the game but it caused the player too much confusion it kept being reported as a bug in the beta as people left the planet and then returned to find everything different but nonetheless into the lying compilation it goes so while they're still essentially formulating the game the media all want a piece of Shawn enter a report on features first conversely Shawn thinks the reporters might help them to temper down things by emphasizing that hella games is an indie studio but that is not how journalism is done this is how journalism is done can you customize the look of your character the sort of full customisation confirmed in no man's sky [Music] periodic table to create atmospheric particles that would diffract light adjust the right wave told you that press kind of operates downstream from the community because things are clicked driven as to what stories you get served and things like that for the rumor would surface from reddit straight to the front page is all this hype and the project has increased in scope dramatically and keeps increasing as the months go by until a point they are close to the deadline and have to delay and the reality of what they can achieve and the little time remaining is steering them in the face they know they're not going to be putting out a finished game they are worried there's nothing more they can do and the fear that they will disappoint the audience is growing on Shawn in the team and I I worry about like disappointing people upon release all of these clips are seen as proof that Shawn is a liar and what doesn't help is his body language I mean it's kind of the body language of someone who was lying and this is why I mentioned he's an introvert remember he's a technical lead actually a really good one but not a Salesman cut him just a little bit of slack because this is simply how he talks here are some innocuous questions and he answers them honestly the producers on no man sky yeah I guess I'm a I'm a developer honest I suppose the yeah creator or sup they like that though I I really like making games I don't necessarily love talking about the same body language and Jesus Christ they have him up on stage and in front of cameras and bright lights and on the goddamn Colbert Report try keeping your nerve on that nonetheless three of that context the clips haven't cemented in the community as a liar so the graph plays out right to release and that graph it's actually a track and that track is what the high train runs on so it comes barreling up the hill instead of neatly pulling into the station it comes crashing right through the room the disaster unfolds they are absolutely [ __ ] on so there were Shawn in hello games surrounded by the rubble of their former reputation punished Ron was at his lowest point hated by the majority of the gaming community but they were still alive and they had made tens of millions of dollars they were left with two choices take the money start a new project and be a pariah a cautionary tale of the industry and hated by the gaming community forever or pick themselves up get back to work and with potentially no profit motive finish the game it allowed me to do something that I've always done in difficult times where there is crappy bosses that I've dealt with before or crappy situations at school growing up I got my head down and I sat in front of a computer and I made games which is what I enjoy they pick number two so here's the plan the team is assigned to fixing bugs and the most obvious problems go Shawn tells the team to stop reading all the overwhelmingly negative feedback on the game and he reroutes all of it to his personal devices emails forum posts Google News Alerts player feedback it's all going directly to him now then he starts breaking that down into data sets people who haven't bought the game people who have bought it and played it for a hundred hours people who have returned it etc then he starts compiling those complaints into useable data focusing on the people with the most sincere experience of the game then we start making a big laundry of all the things that need adding and prioritize first thing to fix is that full inventory then community mod support now third thing etc etc this is going to take an enormous amount of work to pull off and they're not going to make the same mistake twice so they would need to sharply adjust the PR strategy anything they said right now an admission of guilt I've made a severe would be met with criticism denial it's not that bad would be met with criticism corporate speak well we endeavoured to make the best game we could and we are proud of what we have would be met with criticism ha the problems have been caused by speaking too much so they were going to do a complete 180 instead of adding more fuel to the fire instead of accidentally promising fixes that might also not be delivered they wouldn't speak to the press again it female traits you're talking about I'd say that's a generalization they were going to speak to the community directly from now on so they told the audience they were working on it and went completely silent pointed one day past no word two days a week have you heard from hello games they just had this disastrous release no haven't seen them I hope they're working on the game two weeks dude are you working on this thing just ignore them just work three weeks okay what the [ __ ] is going WTF it's locked a month they took the money and ran didn't they didn't say anything it's not gonna help two months the real by now most people were convinced that the game was abandoned they had made their money it's all over then after over a hundred days of absolute silence a tweet foundation the first fig - it is me sure but I bring you gifts it's exit signs it brought base-building new gamemodes farming cats and freighters as well as a lot of bug fixes you will have to try harder than that Sean to win my love back it still fell well shy of the promise game too little too late social and Lee returned to his team and got better to work a few more months went by and then another tweak Pathfinder here [Music] but the [ __ ] oh it's usual I bring you online based sharing own multiple starships starship special is a multi-tool specialization and classes permadeath modes vehicles you can drive around and create racetracks for you to with time trials look at this okay that's pretty good but I'm still bad a bit still a ton promise but isn't in the game yet so fun went away once more a few more months went by or not not what you sure what is it down I bring you an overhaul to the storyline new worlds crashed freighters a space comic terrain editing portals procedural mission system interstellar trading and joint exploration why now people were really starting to warm to no man's sky again and to hello games the game has in many ways exceeded what was promised it's a substantially better game now is back baby people saw this was an honest effort to fix the game and the number of employees working on it was growing from a studio of 15 to 25 Sean Murray and hella game social media also started becoming more active and engaging with the audience the subreddit was flourishing once more the price of the game second hand on Amazon eBay and Game Stop was going up did a few more months went by next a really big to be super clear no man sky is not but that here's the full and proper multiplayer experience ringed planets third-person mode character customization a galactic Atlas on an external website for the community vast overhauls to base building and crafting and resources and it also brought the game to Xbox in fact with the release of next in July 2018 no man sky was the sixth top-selling console game for the month it climbed its way back into steams top ten it reached nearly 100,000 concurrent players it brought another twenty four million dollars across all platforms this steam rating went from mixed to very positive people were getting back on board in a big way but they weren't onion bitter creatures weird underwater [ __ ] discoveries and bases and environments and equipment in a keep scope new biomes more diversity archeology more things to discover by now Shaun in the gaming inspector personification of the gaming community had literally patched things up and were making out on the couch which was when he released his biggest patch tonight for this video free the earth support not a whole other game you have to pay for like some titles overhauls to NPCs tech trees base buildings streamlined multiplayer ride animals around all sorts of stuff that was never promised in the first place and mister wedding mister someone at valve who is a fan of the game said to me what you do now is more important than what you say there is only one thing that's credible and that's your actions in fact I was so slow to get this video out that they put out another patch the other day with ship salvage ship upgrade more advanced terrain is in the first person X across improved VR improved base building an inventory metric and quality of life stuff it goes on is it perfect technically there are still things on this spreadsheet missing but come on now we're starting to nitpick especially when you compare them to relationships with other games companies they could have gone the route of fallout 76 paywall mods with fallout first charging a monthly fee a downward spiral more and more into pay to win scraps released without QA testing but instead they never added pay to win they never added microtransactions will paid DLC they never made VR as a second game they didn't give up on the game or scale their resources back to do it they didn't come out and call gamers entitled they didn't have loot boxes they didn't start work on the next big project or sequel they didn't do much of anything except get back to work and just like that the game once panned by critics now had Awards rolling in [Music] no man sky and to cap it all off the subreddit are no man's sky the game even got together and pulled money for a GoFundMe to have a billboard installed near the hello games offices it must have been a harrowing moment for Sean in the team they took a huge risk to start a small studio they clawed their way up to create one of the most notable games of the console generation disappointed pretty much everyone with the release and took one of the biggest online beatings in videogame history for it the family post release we faced some really difficult challenges everything that you can imagine from like the worst of the internet we hit but then over the course of the next three years completely turned it around and came out the other side with a win it's the underdog story and after doing all of this research I couldn't help but come to the conclusion that they were the good guys so what is the future for hello games in 2017 they announced hello labs a support program focused on original titles and games using procedural generation two of the team also brushed off to work on a small title called the last campfire but for the foreseeable future they're just working on no man's sky [Music] all right I didn't want to finish the video on like a big sappy note so this is the end of the story but there's still another few minutes don't leave it's not an ad okay in 2015 when the hype was at its peak someone wrote a Sean Murray erotic fan fiction and naturally I assumed that you lot would want to see it so here it is my evening interview at hello games I arrived at the hello games office in the early evening as the Sun was approaching the horizon taking a deep breath I nervously pressed the doorbell the door opened and Sean poked his expressive face out to greet me hey you he exclaimed in his adorable British Australian accent I'm so happy you could make it and spend the evening with us I was so happy when I heard you agreed to let me come in for an interview I said oh yeah the interview I forgot he replied with his usual brilliant humour I laughed he's so funny Sean let me show you my office I have a surprise for you Sean said he lived into the room where we sat down on a soft vinyl couch so let me show you the surprise he said softly it's the newest build of the game we just added some new features he booted up the game on a ps4 in his office I stared at his face I like your beard it's sexy I've pretended to say to him in my head to myself I have a secret crush on him there was something about his humble demeanor and feeble yet handsome bone structure that was so alluring so here's the game he said eagerly it opened on an alien world just calling out to be explored I began to sweat here it finally was in front of me and all of its glory and it was being played by Sean in front of me and all of his glory I nervously spoke could I try playing I said oh I suppose of course he said chuckling but another few minutes passed without him handing me the controls Sean I said more confidently I put my hands on his hand as he crypt the controller he looked me straight in the eyes I stared deep into his beautiful glistening eyes utterly transfixed sure he said he liquor of the PlayStation controller still sweaty from his firm grip but I have another surprise to show you he stood up Mike redacted humor yes please I said blushing is ready it blushing as red as the treetops of Oriya 5 he grabbed my shoulders guiding me confidently towards the coffee table like he confidently guides the hello games team to once the camp's release the one true Shaun Murray not that baby-faced loser [ __ ] poseur from NCIS made sweet sweet love to me I wasn't sure what I was Borak sided about in late dawn-marie all finally playing no man's sky after exploring the planet's surface I ended my spaceship and took off just as I left the atmosphere and Burson to the the breathtaking expanse of space it was an out of world experience [Music] a oculus rift support he uttered sensually as I turned I saw Sean Devin are standing before me in a beautiful procedurally generated spacesuit like what you see he said it's time everybody he shouted I heard footsteps slowly enter from the cramped office I soon saw many spacesuits appear before me in game but as they took off their helmets I realized that they were all the same Sean Murray avatar I was about to be redacted by a group of Sean Murray's but they all had one difference redacted less different they were wide ones thin ones long ones curved ones it was medical as the hello games team began to redacted from somewhere in the room I heard shoo and whisper every redacted procedure also I did thing on the
