understanding lil pump is brought to you by curiosity stream consumption waste violence it's the 21st century and humanity is at risk of collapsing from within suicide is a global health epidemic where governments are getting dangerously unstable and the rich are getting richer while the poor are staying poor but even worse our very habitat is in danger as we continue to pollute the earth at critical levels and waste valuable resources faster than they can be replenished feels like we may any day cross the point of no return on our race towards the end of civilization as we know it so where are we to turn in our post-modern era of moral relativism and consumerism there's little hope that a modernist figure inspired by religious ideals such as gandhi or martin luther king jr will appear lead us towards world peace and environmental harmony i think a new chapter of human history will soon be upon us though its exact details remain as of yet unrevealed perhaps science will usher in the new era with the creation of superhumans altered by genetic editing perhaps we're going to merge with computers to become more reliant on information and communications than ever before but the most likely path in my opinion will come from the mind of our century's most intelligent young academic a genius orator how do you pronounce order a genius order and thinker inspired by the likes of thomas aquinas and frank lloyd wright alike polymath artist economist and speaker known as lil pump wait what what am i reading is this the guy they joke about going to harvard okay he might not actually be from harvard but he is a soundcloud rapper and for a lot of us that's basically the same thing you're watching volksgeist and this is understanding [Music] lil pump is a rapper from florida he came up around late 2016 early 2017 along with a lot of other florida rappers like xxxtentacion denzel curry smoke perp ski mask the slump god and more the south florida rap scene as a whole in 2017 and early 2018 was growing into something reminiscent of punk rock decades ago in the mid 70s instead of getting their start in basement venues they got popular on soundcloud but the musical similarities were outstanding both punk rock and soundcloud rap use short songs abrasive lyrical content and shock value to get their point across like many punk rockers rappers in the soundcloud movement came from bleak underprivileged backgrounds and used shock value to wow fans and gain social media notoriety the distortion that young rappers have become known for is there because they couldn't afford high quality recording or producing equipment outside of some [ __ ] we just like expected my first song he ordered um the stuff off of ebay it was like a snowball mic it was like the cheapest mic you could get it set on like three prongs or four prongs one of those and it was like just a basic um audacity and like a laptop so but that's how we got distorted music with the story we actually started making the distortion like to the best of our advantage so we use distortion in our music now it didn't take long for the young south florida scene to receive international recognition many of the rappers started touring around the world and collaborating with massive figures in the industry but like the punk rockers before them miami's young rappers and the soundcloud rap scene as a whole burned out quickly lil peep overdosed on xanax xxxtentacion was murdered just a few months after releasing a number one album lil xan went into rehab and six nine was arrested by the fbi the soundcloud wave died after just a year in the spotlight with such abrasive personalities and music it seemed bound to happen from the day they broke out into the scene but back to lil pump despite his notoriety he's one of the few miami rappers without a distinct identity or to put it another way a cult of personality people worship xxx tentacion they've been doing it since the very beginning of his career his story his personality his music it all came together to create a kind of hero for his listeners and the same is true to a degree for most of the soundcloud scene all of the rappers i mentioned earlier they're not just rappers they're ideas and stories that are sold to the listener denzel curry is a thoughtful older figure in the community having at one point lived with and mentored x ski mask is ex's best friend left alone in the wake of his death lil peep was a tortured artist who succumbed to his vices even lil xan has his place albeit as the court jester but where does lil pump stand he's kind of just a meme lil pump's music doesn't reveal much about himself if anything at first glance his rapping isn't much different from what his peers are doing but it seems that most if not all of them have something that he lacks emotional depth most of lil pump's peers rap about depression and heartbreak as well as partying flexing as well as the poverty they escaped from but lil pump's emotional range is very very limited he's permanently stuck in party mode he permanently is hooking up with every girl he's permanently high his distorted beats don't really feel like they're complimenting his mental state as much as they sound like they're just there to match his loudness where other rappers would use instrumentals or melodies to accompany their lyrics lil pump's music is trendy it sounds cool now but it's not going to age very well rappers have a long and complicated relationship with money flexing is something that's become a huge part of mainstream culture but that's not what it originally was traditionally in much of hip-hop culture designer products were a measure of success they represent a rapper's escape from poverty for flexing to be meaningful you have to back it up with something a rapper like asap rocky who was raised homeless and had to sell drugs to get by his passion for the finer things in life is understandable he paints a picture of a rags to rich's journey and something we can relate to but without that character development lil pump's flexing is empty the way lil pump screams about gucci balmain and mercedes seems to actually be a sort of reflection of what he sees on social media it doesn't tell a story it doesn't tell us anything about his past struggles or current success his identity is the sum of what he owns and if you ask me that's pretty dark to quote the music writer alex error the game is full of kids whose identity starts and finishes with the things that they own many fashion influencers seem to fit the mold only remarkable for showing off the clothes that they wear it's what earns them followers and by extension influence gucci gang is the musical equivalent of this new form of aesthetic driven career the song isn't just a portal inside lil pub's head it's a mirror that reflects the current state of pop culture to put it shortly lil pump's music reflects what he sees he's flexing because it's what he's been exposed to not because it really means anything to him it's something i never noticed until i started making this video and actually looking at his lyrics but what if it isn't him i mean lil pump undoubtedly does the things that we see him do and enthusiastically but what if the idea of lil pump was meticulously managed by industry executives and managers looking to make money off the rap game i've already talked about how there's no spirit or creativity in his music he doesn't produce his beats and i bet my curiosity stream money he has ghost writers and most of all he comes off like a different person in interviews in lil pump's interview with j cole from early 2018 he came off as a completely different kid than in his music the older rapper pushed him to talk about his family and upbringing little pump revealed himself to be a pretty quiet guy and it was completely contradictory to the behavior he is typically known for i think it's entirely possible that lil pump's public persona is faked for the sake of marketing in a culture dominated by consumerism and social media if you're a music executive and you hand a kid millions of dollars he's probably going to do whatever you want him to do of course it takes a certain kind of kid lil pump has to be a good performer a good celebrity and he definitely seems to enjoy his lifestyle but at the end of the day i'll take little pumps world of egalitarian degeneracy over a segregated culture of classist and racial discrimination any day of the week and the words of modern artist andy warhol what's great about this country is america started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest you can be watching tv and see coca-cola and you know that the president drinks coke liz taylor drinks coke and just think you can drink coke too a coke is a coke and no amount of money can get you a better coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking all the cokes are the same and all the cokes are good throughout human history culture has divided the rich from the poor in very profoundly limiting ways and at the end of the day the 15 year olds listening to little pump rap about drugs aren't in any more danger than any other 15 year olds listening to grunge in the 90s punk in the 70s and rock in the 60s the song ends life goes on there's homework to do in friends to see but these listeners are in a much better position than the teenagers living in feudal kingdoms hundreds of years ago who had no chance at ever escaping the poverty they were born into because when all is said and done in all of his ridiculous absurdity lil pump is part of us and we are part of him and hey his music kind of goes hard too
