welcome everybody to another episode of the brain food podcast ah today part two and for the live crew we are just just we just off the back of recording our last one new cup of coffee has been made yep what's on the agenda today we are talking about more fascinating origin of everyday things this is part two there's gonna be a lot in this series I'm not sure how many I could go like I added it up but I could go like 20 episodes but I think that would be overdoing it so I think we might cut it off at some point like it five or six probably and move on to something completely different but yes so we're do we're gonna start with the best thing since sliced bread and talk about some bread things inventions and then the shopping cart which is you know more interesting than you might think yes that we were talking in between the episodes how you're saying you've got an episode on the cardboard box coming up right now and I need you to spruce it up a little bit find a story in there somewhere or more of a story I should say there's a little bit of a story but you know more of a story level yeah how we start saying quick fact yeah did you did you actually I wasn't paying attention did you actually open this episode like we did I was I'm sorry I was very distracted in the first two minutes because I was in someone said the video wasn't working but then someone said the videos working refresh your page and then I realize I should just listen to one person is complaining in the video stream while I try to fix the exact runs like now it's fine yeah sorry you can uh a little that if you are listening to this or watching this live on youtube we also do this in a podcast version which is a great way to listen to the show if you're a busy person on the go like we all are these days I'm sure um or if you're not and it's 3:00 a.m. wherever you're watching this then yeah and if you want to leave us a review wherever you listen to your podcasts we are giving away a $1,000 Amazon gift card to one lucky winner when we get a thousand reviews on we decided we'd look at iTunes us and when there got to a thousand reviews would go through and look at all the reviews unlike the major platforms if you're like and on the other iTunes as well like you know okay yeah all the other major countries they're all the major countries if you're like listening from Timbuktu on guinea-bissau just and then for people use then you probably we're probably not gonna see your review and see you but if guinea-bissau yeah iTunes but like I check although although you know main ones yeah yeah cool we will so do that leave us a review it would be awesome of you it doesn't need to be good all my probably seen that would be perfect yeah so son with a quick fact we are starting with quick back so 1943 clawed our Wickard he is the head of the war foods administration as well as the Secretary of Agriculture he gets the bright idea to ban pre sliced bread in America which he did on January 18th 1943 so he might hit this point be wondering why on earth would you ban pre sliced bread I am wondering and it turns out no good reason but they gave reasons because you know it's a government office so to conserve wax-paper wheat and steel is kind of the the reasons push but the problems this is wax paper so the idea here was the wax paper if you on bread they would wrap it but the FDA regulations say that if you pre slice the bread you had to at the time had to do thick or wax paper and so by branding banning the pre sliced bread you get the you don't have the thicker wax paper so this is the idea but the progress there wasn't as shorter a shortage of wax paper at the time like even even the war production board showed that the most of the manufacturers had like supplies on hands the last many many months like without buying anymore and beyond that there was no shortage of wax or wax paper or any of the materials needed for the war effort there so it's not really clear what what what benefit this is gonna do um so that's a secondary goal conserve wheat and you can see this one maybe right this could be good so so it turns out the office of the price Administration around World War two had authorized a 10% increase in the wheat and so that also made flour and bread and everything more expensive and so thought this maybe if you ban pre sliced bread less people will buy it they'll be kind of so you save wheat but then it'll also the prices will drop make things cheaper for people so this is kind of the idea maybe but the problem is at the time there was no shortage of wheat at all like the US had stockpiled over 1 billion bushels of wheat which was enough even if the US the entire country had zero wheat harvested or imported for two years the the wheat on hand there was just stockpiled was good enough to cover the u.s. is entire needs and the u.s. makes a lot of wheat so it's like and no it's not like Germany's you know flying over either us or anything so yeah it's not not probably gonna lose our fields or whatever so it's not really clear why this was gonna be a good thing either but it was you know save wheat I guess so then the steel so the bread making machines themselves they actually are huge and they used a lot of steel but like you know you don't buy them again they last forever it wasn't like the bread makers of the time already had their machines it's not like people were actively buying tons of them well so you weren't gonna I mean you're not gonna get enough to actually measure anything towards the war effort at all so there was really no real benefit there either and on top of that as you might imagine I mean the best thing since sliced bread is an expression for a reason people didn't like it when Navy and pre sliced bread so the New York Times actually has a little quote from one woman who happily put in a letter to them I should like to let you know how excuse me how important sliced bread is to the morale and sameness of a household my husband and four children are all in a rush during ins after breakfast without ready sliced bread I must do the slicing for toast two pieces for each one that's ten for their lunches I must cut by hands at least 20 slices for two sandwiches of beasts afterwards I make my own toast twenty two slices of bread to be cut in a hurry yeah so I see as it was the first recorded instance of a first-world problem and and you know not evenly slice you can make him even like the pre slice stuff is so bay yeah three months later the band after the band was introduced so in March 8 1943 it was rescinded with Wickard stating our experience with the order leads us to believe that the savings are not as much as we expected it was pointless it just probably you can imagine like his Wickard just like a bureaucrat you know like I does seem like doing something an expression of bureaucracy he's just doing something to make it look like he's doing something like I'm on the war food administration so I'm gonna I'm gonna do something either you're a Kratz gonna you're right basically so moving on time hey guys before you get into the is grands and let's get back to it the best thing since sliced bread how did this where'd this you know who actually invented the thing that everyone says is the best thing you know before whatever next thing comes so to begin with we have I mean obviously flat breads of various types have been around for about 15,000 years and maybe even as much as thirty thousand years so it's not clear exactly so um at a certain point people didn't realize if you leave the dough out eventually you get the little spores from the air they come on and then it leavens it and then a few some of the old eleven you know you can put it in the new flour and then you know great you can you can make leaven bread and so this actually about four thousand years ago ish you know give or take a millennia was in ancient Egypt they did they definitely had like really refined leavened bread that they were they're making all sorts of breads so this was now a popular thing and it kind of just grew and expanded there and so you know it's the bread has been a staple of human diet ever since and so so but through most the vast majority of bread making history like thousands of years humans have had to do everything like you gotta grind the flour you gotta do it all by hand and a lot of times I mean for quite a bit of that history to you mostly had to do it at home or most people did but I mean there was bakers and stuff but even the bakers they had to do all this you know from start to finish you do this and so this remained until the 19th century is when things started to change there so so we have so Oliver Evans of Philadelphia created the first fully automated flour mill so they did have flour mills of course before this to produce but it was quite labor-intensive you needed a lot of people on hand to you know load the you load the bags and you know get the flour out the other maghen so he created the first automated one in Philadelphia and so interesting a site on this guy also in 1805 he was the first person to create a vehicle that was self powered that could go at land and water in 1805 it was a steam engine because he was a steam engine was kind of one of his things he was an expert in so he named it the orator and amphiboles sure yeah and so that yeah can you just yeah you can imagine it had that like that um you know like those you know people those steam boats going on like the Mississippi or whatever you know that iconic like the wheels the big old oh yeah back yeah so that's what he had in the back of this car you can you can google that name of the Eruptor and they both fibulas but and then otherwise it was a wagon and then it had like a steam engine and so you go on land and water so anyways that's an aside on this guy but he also created the the first automated fully automated flour mill where you can just it kind of like had these conveyor and buckets and stuff that kind of district moved everything long grounded up on the other end you know dumping it into bags and all that sort of business so this I just looked up an image of this boat thing it's pretty cool now it is pretty cool of 1805 self-propelled that's that's cool and just you know get in the water boat around come on out so yeah so as in an old-school duck-tor yeah yeah yeah exactly so they have those in Seattle by the way that you can go in this I've never done it they've him in London I saw him wonder who is the first person to come up with that we did the rubber duckie like how that became a thing I've never really different I you know but so at this point Industrial Revolution everything with the bad bread production becomes industrialized people start you know more commonly going to like a store and just picking up their bread but there's one thing that is not automated yet is the slicing itself the actual and the final slicing and so we did have so parallel steel blades they did someone did like the 1860s there was an American patent for this but like it wasn't actually a thing like commercial you know you you bought your loaf of bread and it was always unsliced so who actually invented it 1928 is when one auto Frederick row and row I knew I was gonna mess up his name didn't row wetter of Davenport Iowa I guess yeah so he was either have you been there no no disappointed no yeah but so things didn't go smoothly with his invention at first so this Edmond I said 1928 is when he actually debuted but all the way back in 1912 is when he actually invented it so he created a prototype of this and he took it around and nobody wanted it because Baker's were like nobody wants pre-sliced bread that's not a thing because that level of convenience yeah I mean the idea that they're thinking is it's gonna go stale faster right but hang on I wonder why doesn't it go stale faster cuz if I slice like bread you know the end bit always gets to a crusty and weird but then when I have pre sliced bread it doesn't go to a crusty and weird way it's just cuz the bags they they back I mean you know to make it so it's you know really seal like my slice life is sitting out on the side I put it back in the bag well I mean Dan's still super exposed I suppose you're not are you folding the bag like nicely so he's not getting that trapped air in there is it I'll use one of those are you using a paper bag or a because paper bag is it breathe you know it's not like air tight yeah well I used to use plastic and then someone at the bakery was like you should use a paper bag and I'm like well seems yeah but okay yep the paper will make it go stale really because it's not it does breathe a little bit which is why you know you make like fresh-baked bread and stuff you don't wanna you don't I'm just put in a plastic bag because it's gonna get all that moisture and it's gonna get makes it really wet instead of like that hard crust which you kind of like when you make fresh baked bread and if you put it like in something more airtight it ends up being really soft and it's not I mean that's I don't want to show off or anything but really you know I'll slice the end bit off and I'll just throw it away like that crusty edge bit that's the kind of life I leave yeah I'm like I can just do that away you know I cut it really thick so nobody wanted it though the point there's is just whatever but sir-- four-row matter the problem was is in 1917 so this is five years he's gone five years no one no one wants this thing that he's invented which by the way he did come up with a way around this problem which he also invented which was to have his machine then right after it cuts it it automatically would wrap the bread in wax paper to keep it from going stale and so he invented the way around this problem and it worked perfectly but no one wanted it still because who won who wants the free slice bread you know so but unfortunately in 1917 so five years later his blueprints and his machine were destroyed in the fire so he needs to probably would never figure this out it's it's like I've invented a perpetual motion machine I lost in a fire that would be you know maybe this thing complicated though giving you credit for yeah well he doubles down so you know you could say or did it really work you know no one used it but no he designed he did it again he built it once he got some funding he did start to get funding for awhile but once he got it he built it again and this time this time he was able to show it off in 1927 he was able to rebuild the machine and then shortly thereafter he sells it he finally finds a baker who will take it it's the Chilika Baking Company in Chillicothe Missouri and so it's about that's about that's kind of east of north east of Kansas City so you know when they get it so it's already it's in the bakery to actually like it's a it's not just a prototype this is you know gonna be used and so the front page of the town's newspaper when it when it the headline of it was sliced bread is made here yeah it's like quite a good ad so and a back page ad of July 6 1928 of that same newspaper said it was greatest step forward in the baking industry since bread was wrapped and see that's kind of fascinating because now it's like the best thing since sliced bread but here it was like it since bread was wrapped yes gonna stop saying that that's the best thing since bread was wrapped that is an improvement and then you think before that was it like since you had to like hand make the bread you know like since since you know they came up with machines that actually do it so in any event so because I love this how to make breads over sourcils i yeah you've done this as well I do that I'm actually just I got a sourdough starter right going right now I had I was just using the yeast for a while but um making a you know I gotta bake I got the wheat myself from a field I'm not joking when I was a kid yeah yeah there was a big wheel down the back of my my the house where I grew up and and you know there's the kids I think a friend of mine came round like from school and we went out in the garden and we picked like a bunch of wheat off this hello from the edge of this farmer's field and sure probably wasn't worried you know it was like a really small amount and then we hit we took all the little things inside out we like cheated it or whatever you call it you know and remove the things then we'd rounded all up with a coffee grinder and then we baked bread from it and it was delicious awesome yeah that's good that would be that's cool yeah no you know I've never I've never gone that that hipster and ever done but I do enjoy the you know makes your house smell like fresh baked bread it's not really that I was mostly just setting something on a counter forever and then popping him in the oven dude I want some salad are so bad right now yeah that's what I was saying I was in this house since I moved I didn't have a sourdough and I finally I was just using like yeast it's not as good you know if you just use like the yeast were they because it used to be actually that all the yeast even this even the kind you got in the store I mean I used to be I mean like in the 17th 18th century yeah the type that people would get still had the thing that made it sour the lactobacillus or whatever it is it still had that in it and it wasn't until around that point I can't remember who did it they actually figured out I think it might have even been pastor or Lewis Bester I can't remember but either way somebody figured out how to what what was making the sour taste and they figured out how to had to separate it from the east and then so yeah that's been a thing ever since but like you know the sour is way better he made it significantly worse we've worked out how to not you know how to eat your beef without it getting old it's so much better but no it's much better when it's off yeah oldie let it get a funk yeah this which is kind of weird to think about up until that point in history all bread ever made by humans with sourdough you know well I should say not flatbread they suppose but all leavened bread you know how often we bring up on the podcast like because we talk about things that happened in the past and usually they're very horrific and we often come around to wow it's great to live now I'm like mmm maybe the boss wouldn't be so bad at least they had glad they had all fresh baked bread all the time but thank me not at the same time if you're poor like that was all you ate it was like a little you know if you were lucky you could throw some cheese and with another wise you had your hunk of bread you know no butter it's probably like hard and stale because and that's what french toast that's our french toast case people didn't want to waste anything so you have this hard stale bread and so if you couldn't add access to milk and eggs then you make you - it's lunchtime over here you're killing me we have everyday origin of fascinating origin of everyday things coming up just there's total food related yeah French french toast is gonna be one of them so I won't spoil it too much no but um yeah that's a good one French so going back to the where we at here so yes he's yes the back page added July 6 1928 had that best thing since bread was wrapped so yeah customers loved it and you know everyone loved it basically so this caught on and this is the guy who admitted it and then so where did the actual expression like who who actually coined the expression the best thing since sliced bread the first known documented instance of this is thought to be in a 1952 interview by the famous comedian Red Skelton and so he's talking to these Salsbury the Maryland Times and he quotes them because they're worrying I guess about TV or something so he advises them not to worry about television it's the greatest thing since sliced bread you know and that's the first known you know I mean maybe this was an expression he just started you from somewhere because that happens a lot in eat'em ologies but that's the first known documented instance of someone saying that exact thing but we did have the best thing since wrapped bread so presumably like other people were saying this before then but a 1952 interview was the first known one so stop bringing it back like I say this this podcast best thing things ask rap since bread was wrapped it is you know without the rap it is like you know you're talking today and it's always like do you want your bread wrapped or sliced which is more important I could slice it at home but unless you're like that lady who's using 20 slices of bread a day and then you know she doesn't care about my bread if it was just because she's using it like every day she's using like a whole loaf you know either way so we're moving on I'm still I'm still on the bags I still think wrapping is more important than slicing yeah well though you do go to the store and this loose bread that you kind of grab with a tongue and put it in like a bag right so yeah yeah it does last like a little bit like if it's not cut or anything which is which was the argument of the bakers who clearly know but I suppose Baker's a conflict of interest there a little bit because if he did come up with a way to keep it from getting stale and then you got this pretty slice thing you know you what you want the you don't want you kind of want to go stale I would think like their their bread they could sell you the loaf not wrapped you know someone watching and someone watching this live commented in the chat that about the paper bag and the plastic bag the bread shops just found a way to get me to more buy more bread it's like what's the best way to keep the bread fresh well keep it in a really damp environment if you want to like sneeze on it a little that also helps yeah sorry I was so steep let's move on to the shopping cart so you think so we have before it's surprising because you think about the shopping cart like it's obvious like of course like design is obvious how did someone not think of this just like immediately as the Fez the way to design this and how is this not a thing going way way back but it turns out is this is like a 20th century thing because it took the home refrigeration it took the automobile to then create the supermarket instead of just like a little market that you go down and you buy your you know your one day supply of maybe stuff either you didn't have on hand because you you know grow all your own stuff so supermarket comes around though in the 20th century and the retailers they realize they have a problem because they have this a lot of wares on the shelves but people are literally like at first they didn't even have baskets people are just carrying around stuff in their hands whether it's a supermarket so this didn't work out and so um yeah people are just carry around they need it so then someone did come up with the basket so this was the early 1930s when carrying around baskets was kind of the thing it still wasn't ideal because um where's the quote perhaps I'm fast-forwarding head too far one moment getting ahead of yourself it's too excites I am I am I would just mention it but I know there's actually like a quote I wrote so I don't want to do that it's better be amazing it's not it's not but it's still a problem today so anyway so numerous shopping cart like devices came around in the 1930s and so we had like the 1937 folding chair cart design and this was by American business and Sylvan Goldman and this this was kind of the one that started the actual shopping cart thing as we know it today and again like look at this 1937 this was like a long gap of years where no one was coming up with the design better than just like a basket that you carry around in a supermarket so the Goldman family though they integral to the whole history of it so we'll talk a little bit about them so they're retailing family Alfred Goldman Brothers wholesale fruits and produce was their first shop and they also named again yeah Breckinridge Texas there was an oil boom going on there and so they did great business but then the oil business kind of died in that that town turned into a ghost town so they left for Tulsa Oklahoma which is an awful place in 1920 and son also a climber isn't that where uh isn't that what I was like nice to work and friends oh it's I knew my fourth grade teacher in Tulsa Oklahoma maybe wait you know you you you're from Tulsa Oklahoma no I just lived there for a couple years I had like the heaviest drawl accent for a couple years no particular reason I don't I didn't know so I actually have a video of it recording it's like it's like a drawl of drawls I thought I got rid of Finkley but so yeah I had this teacher fourth-grade never been outside of Oklahoma her entire life she was in her 40s I can tell you Oklahoma is not it's not a good place like it's not the worst place on the planet but it's not like sure it's not like in the heart of a volcano but it's like not much better you know it's not a good place and never been outside of Oklahoma her whole life it blew me away even then I was only never been outside you don't you know yeah I grew up in a North Korean prison camp or whatever you believe this is it yeah no exactly its perspective I guess but no anyways so son grocery company Tulsa Oklahoma 1920 so within three years they're doing quite well they have a chain of fifty five locations and they sold the chain to Skaggs Safeway stores in 1929 now this could have been great here's a few months before the stock market crash right they sell 55 so I'm sure they got like retirement money going on here the problem was is they invested it immediately instead if they just held on to it for a few months this would have worked out great see of the stock market crash and you have all this money on hand in best then you know they're like ludicrously wealthy but now they invested immediately but it makes it you can't time the markets and he makes Noi maybe they didn't know this this stock market crash so they just invested me I mean II lost it but how talk about it's like almost perfect timing but just slightly on in the reverses yeah so they lost everything so they they head out they head out to californee way you know like everyone else and so they go and they did actually get jobs so that you know they get experience in businessman and grocery grocery so they were able to get jobs as grocery wholesalers think you know over again but just you know working for the man again you know not working from themselves so eventually though they did have wealthy uncles still and so they were able to get in Oklahoma the Oklahoma City actually some of their wealthy uncles go to go ahead and finance you know that give him some money with some pretty favorable turns terms to then they started standard grocery and then they that worked out well you know I think they know the grocery business they they were able to very quickly buy another grocery chain that was actually struggling and turned it around so 1934 they do all this and so then they do notice so this is newly supermarket concept you know that's really popular but they're seeing mothers and kids everywhere are just like you know their hands are full the kids are running around they can't you know so this is like a problem shopping and say would they would like people to be able to carry lots of stuff so with small baskets just weren't cutting it so the Goldman he's first you know his first idea his first go at it is alright I'll just hire some extra employees real cheap you know still the Great Depression I'll hire them to just go and when a basket is full the employee will go grab the basket take the person's name pick it up front it's waiting for you you can get no hand you a new basket so you can that up coming this this yeah I mean oh it's kind of it's not really ideal solution it sort of works but then you know I forget what you already got or whatever so wasn't awesome so he's sitting there trying to come up with a new way and so so they there is the official story from the Goldman which I mean they're kind of the winners so they kind of paint a picture of like he came up with it on his own like no one had ever thought of anything like this before and that's just not actually what was happening at all there was actually tons of similar decide Edison yeah yeah there's tons of designs of course similar out there maybe some of them he knew about I'm sure he knew some of them cuz it's as industry but you know maybe not all of them so we have like in 1920s Hank and pilot of Houston Texas had they em so they hit this is what I just put this one there was a tons of them this one just thought was funny because it again shows like to us it seems so obvious what you should do right but at the time they were just coming out with this weird thing so 1920s Hank and pilot Houston Texas puts attracts like train track tight things throughout this whole store and then you put the carts it on the train tracks and you push them around but they have to stay on the tracks you just uh follow the tracks and I guess that kind of makes people walk through your whole store maybe like an Ikea thing going on there where they design it so you have to walk through like the entire store just yeah if someone stops you just stuff you know I don't need Miller today because away from getting know exactly this wasn't an ideal solution it didn't it didn't catch on Hank goodbye he didn't know the state's you don't know if the tracks going around all of them in Europe yeah so 1930s saw some improvement so he had some wheeled baskets designed so Joe Weingarten was one that had one oh and he actually no John Wagner and was the one he had that like a you think of like a wagon like a little toy wagon you pull around so this is like one of the better designs that someone came up with certainly superior door a basket so it's just like a little wagon you pull around but you see the problem with all of these is they don't store like if you're a store and you wanna have like hundreds of these where you gonna put them like you know big none of them stack together so you just can't have a lot of you just need like a lot of space or you know and they're just all gonna be cluttered somewhere so this these are all a problem so he's Goldman sitting around and supposedly he's sit in his office and then he's looking at this thing and there's a folding chair they're leaning up against the wall and he thinks I'll all right well what if I took the baskets and made like a folding chair design so like it folds up you take the baskets out it folds up leaning against the wall you can stack the baskets this is real compact it's super easy just unfold and then and there's the thing you're talking about because it doesn't hold yeah yeah and for people it looks a lot like if you see so you have the full-size cart and then you have the like the little ones like if you're just going like that like a little yeah like a little basket on top and a little basket on a lot on this exactly what it looks like only it's not telescoping like the modern ones this one is just it's a fold like a folding chair thing that you've stacked two baskets on basically and so this you know it took a little while to to get the design out and he hired so he had a handyman Fred young he hired to help him with the design and everything make sure it didn't tip over and you know sturdy even when you loaded the baskets up and reliable and all that and so they they did come up with this thing and it was so patent number two one nine six nine one four it was patented in 1940 yeah and he also enlisted the aid of another handyman Arthur costed to invent it and this was huge worked out really well and so he did do an ad campaign starting he actually actually before he got the patent he actually did an ad campaign and started debuting it anyway so June 4th 1937 he had a thing an ad quite prominent that just said its new its sensational no more baskets to carry but he did not show it like it's just like all like teasing it you know like baskets yeah and I don't not baskets anymore so what is revolution in the basket industry yeah now again you look at be like the official story from from this company Goldman's company and it's like yeah totally independent but then if you actually dig a little deeper so like a few weeks earlier like a few weeks roller basket company actually advertised with a picture their product which looked exactly like his product Goldman's a witch also is that is that is that this picture it looks exactly like it and is we're gonna get into shortly Goldman wasn't adverse to just ripping off someone else's idea as and so this was just like a few weeks apart so you know had he heard of this other thing and he just kind of whipped out his own or did you know who knows really but the official is that Goldman invented it anyway but it was whether he did or not it was his design that ended up catching on and popularizing the shopping cart so it was super popular but actually oh this is funny it wasn't immediately popular though when he first debuted he had significant resistance because humans hate change and this was male customers hated it because it was like an affront to their manhood like literally people would complain I could carry I can carry my bone basket I don't need to know and plus the other problem is it looked like a baby carrier like this was a baby buggy design kind of time so yeah I'm pushing around a baby buggy around my baby I carry it in a basket by hat yeah exactly some male milk customers I should say non-elderly elderly loved it this was it did catch on with the elderly right away but women hated it too and he actually had like a quote from one one woman who claimed I've pushed my last baby buggy so she doesn't want it she's done with children and this was like this is a complaint a lot of the women were like no I'm not gonna it's just a baby buggy I'm not gonna push that around there mister I'll just carry my basket thank you so elderly I really wish they had a survey of the lazy and the lazy it's just like another example of like you see that's over and over again all the time humans just hate change like it doesn't matter if it's like Vasiliy still yeah no I hate it it's not doing that so yeah so it was a tough sell for them but then the fellow brochures too were like now I don't know they've their chief complaint was the children would run amuck on the stores like pushing and racing and you know pushing each other around the cart and stuff which is the thing that happens but you know it's not like a major problem or anything so this goldman he solves this issue by he hires people manly looking men to walk around his stores pushing the cart steps and then he hires yeah he also hires women to do the same thing and they just walk around the you know acted like they're shopping all day long and then he heard some greeters to show people how to unfold the bath the things but the basket in and and all that and then they could help him you know fold it back up at the end so and then he did the for his fellows businessman he also he hired some people to do this and he filmed it and so they could show a demo of like all these happy customers were really people you were paying but he acted like it was just like happy customers you know to it when you shown at the trade show look they love this love this thing and so then this gets the grocer's on board and he quickly had orders that were just like mash like he was years ahead of what he could actually produce for his new cart design so because he couldn't produce it all he did license out the design so other manufacturers get on board and so now it's like it's just like a ubiquitous all over the place everybody wants this all over so but there was room for improvement because you're still you're folding the thing up you're having to put the baskets in you know you're not you're not just walking and grabbing it and going right to to save your space so this brings us to 1946 and so a 50 year old vassman and freelance and mentor Orla e watson he devises the first telescoping nested shopping carton if you go look up his design just like or let you watson google that first telescoping nesting shopping cart you can see it looks almost exactly like what we use today it is basically what we use so he does he ends up he ends up creating this and so you can look at his final his patent number two four seven nine five three zero she can go it's always interesting to go read those patents you always said even need to look it up just imagine a modern shopping trolley yeah yeah it's nice so but the problem is watson you think again this always happens as we talked about in the last episode and we're gonna talk about a future one too on some other stuff but this always happens so the guy who invents it it's just like you know either they don't get credit or they don't make any money off it or it's a whirlwind of legal battles if they try to like stake their claim you know because everyone is just gonna do this so this is this is Watson is gonna have this problem and Goldman is actually the root of his problem because he comes up so Watson comes up with the design oh I lost you for a second and I lost you so that yeah are we still life everything's doing good I think so okay so he shows this around because not patented yet and so one of the people shows it to of course Goldman's industry looking at the trade shows and so he sees it so he doesn't man eventually get a Salesman George O'Donnell whose wants to get on board he wants to help market it to the different people and so they they they together form telescope karts inc in april 1947 to sell these new carts which are you know very similar to the modern cart six months later they're set to debut this due to this ready-made they're ready to start selling it at a trade show they go there and just before they go there though Goldman announces they to have created a nested carts that they invented which is exactly like Watson's in design like every part of it looks exactly like Watson's and so and they were gonna because Goldman is a big company and they can offer you know they have do steel deals with steel and all this at the time they can offer a cheaper I can make it cheaper and they can make it faster and so they were actually offering and also three dollars cheaper per cart which is about thirty four dollars cheaper today which I mean that adds up when you're buying hundreds of them so of course people are gonna buy from them and they can they can produce it mass like basically right away and with good quality whereas Watson O'Donnell they're still trying to wrap up the main you ramped up the manufacturing they're trying to get the steel and this is like you know mass producing anything especially when just start now that's really complicated you know but Goldman's kind of got a dump on him there but they're just using Watson's design right but they're just claiming it as their own so O'Donnell he finds out about Goldman's new cars that he's gonna debut with this they're supposed to go to so he writes Watson a letter on October 16th 1947 in something of a panic these people have virtually copied our carts and have beat us to the punch with presents introduction to this important group of buyers as stated they will also be at the Super Markets Convention which of course will present competition and to a great degree take away from us all the glamour of being the only ones with such a featured cars the important question is what have you done with your patent attorney to hasten a thorough investigation as to possible infringement and I'm sort of shouting that because you wrote down all caps or perhaps yeah we cannot afford to take slow measures in determining who is right or wrong something must be done immediately to ascertain the facts and if at all possible restrain them from exhibiting their cart at the convention emphasis they're not mine yeah no yeah he kept a lot of it and so Watson he's the other he's like he's cool customer and he's like whatever dude so he responds like quite calmly response two days later it's unfortunate that there is always someone to spoil one's fun especially if that fun is good and ours is good and we will be fighting off continually from now on is my guess this is just the beginning I bet it didn't take all these car manufacturers long to get here and examine our carts on at the Floyd day store when it was first put in and with all the Bob through the whole of the talking we've done and pictures we've passed out it just wouldn't be possible that they did not know about them and of course they did and if this this and if this Oklahoma outfit knew about them at that time they would have had this guy is he seems to have an allergy to full stops at that time they would have jumped on jump down on our neck long before this if they had had any ideas of a patent on this telescope principle he seems very laid back and he's not reading what he's written it is not only laid back he's just like yeah we're gonna have a lot of you know it's gonna be legal battles non-stop whatever this is gonna be an absolute our whole company but you know whatever it's it's fine so legal battles didn't sue so the the document evidence does strongly indicate that Watson invented it not Goldman and Goldman just Goldman's firm just copied it but Goldman had money they had a manufacturer and they just threw lawyers at the issue you know it's just you know sue Watson into oblivion Bolivian so so they decided ultimately Watson of course he doesn't have money he doesn't fight the giant you know he's not gonna be even if he you know he tries to manufacture as this was dragging out his company's not making any money you know office because everyone's gonna buy from gold links is cheaper and better quality because Watson in his partner were having trouble with manufacturing and stuff so they settle out of court they reached an agreement June 3rd 1949 with Goldman Goldman officially recognized in Watson on this one Rod's Watson invented it we copied it and we will pay Watson a whopping $1 $10 today for having infringed on their design for a couple years up to this point and in return of course the the longer part was Watson then granted Goldman exclusive rights to manufacture in the cigars and nobody else can manufacture you want this nested cart which now everyone wants goes its way sphere you'd have to buy it from Goldman excepting there was a few licenses Watson NRT sign but other than that everything so Watson companies would be given some royalties for every cart sold so now they're kind of out of the manufacturing business Goldman's just gonna make it and Watson's just gonna sit back and make his money um so this is like an agreement they could have come to the beginning yeah yeah they could have partnered up it would have worked out but so this sound totally works out awesome for Goldman yeah he gets even better for Goldman because so Watson you know he's probably just kicking back you know sipping sipping some beer on the beach somewhere right collecting his royalties but no because every other cart manufacturer and a lot of companies elsewise we don't want to buy from Goldman you know like you they have a monopoly now they can do what they want and so everyone's mad at Watson basically so they all sue Watson so all these current manufacturing sue Watson to try it and they're trying to get his patent invalidated is what they're trying to do so they can make it so that Goldman doesn't have exclusive rights and so this is this is what he's dealing with for the next few years I was just everyone trying to get his patent invalidated and then on top of that Goldman turns out it's like you know what I don't think we should have to pay you royalties for your design and so they just stopped paying him and you know just stop and they do give him a flat fee but it's like way less than you know what he would have been so during this time when he gets the flat fee they're gonna renegotiate basically but they're just no we're not gonna pay you and we're gonna renegotiate the deal it's like well that's you know this is do it what Paul walks yeah what's poor Watson but of course I'll laid-back user brother yeah whatever yeah I hate money he's an inventor though he gets inventive with this and this is where the deal gets even better for Goldman so he does he makes you reworks to do Goldin now goldman will allow him to license the cart to other companies but he has to give Goldman a percentage of the royalties license companies yeah for this thing that they didn't even invent and so in exchange at this point just making money basically and so in exchange for this so that's Goldman side and now on the other side if this works out now he can license the other so all the other companies they they agree to drop their legal battles against Watson to try to get his patent invalidate so now they're happy because he's licensing to them and Goldman's happy because they're getting royalties for all these cards they are making plus the guards they are making and then Watson presumably still I mean everyone's using this card so what it presumably Watson I've ended up super wealthy and kicking back and yeah he was 50 when all this started singing he's retired he's kicking back on a beach time we're probably gonna chill around yeah yes that that is the saga of the shopping cart that we know and love today I like it well I mean no well yeah yeah it kind of works out for what ruse yeah this happens over and over every time you read like a story of someone the first person who invent some new really it's always this it's like everyone copies it without paying royalties and then there's like a series of lawsuits with the person who actually did it spending more money in legal bills usually fights in poverty the last one be fascinating origins of everyday things we could just call it people stealing each other's ideas for a while and screwing the original inventor cuz you know why not we're gonna we're going to talk about later we've covered in on YouTube but we're going to talk later in one of the others we're going to talk about some of the origin of instruments and I mean I'm gonna throw in the saxophone one even though we've already covered just because I it's so interesting and that one is like the epitome of all guy getting screwed for his amazing amazing inventions but yeah that'll that'll be coming in a later episode but either way I'm already looking forward is that is that today's episode wraps or a second that is that is today Wow okay Thank You Rudy for listening I apologize for the mild
