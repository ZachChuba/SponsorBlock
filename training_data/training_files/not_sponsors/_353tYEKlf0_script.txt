hi guys welcome to reaction time this videos gonna be little different I got a bar still here I'm gonna use it kind of like as a table and I'm doing arts and crafts today yeah I'm back to school arts and crafts class was like the best class no but seriously I got CVS stuff right here I'm gonna be recreating ways to sneak food into class I don't recommend you guys doing this I don't want you get in trouble in case you get caught but this is gonna be pretty exciting I want to see if I can recreate them as good and as sneaky as these videos they're like five minutes and choo-choo alright first why I'm excited we got the table Bubba where is it boom so you can't take this into class of course no gum allowed in most schools but let me open this up what have you put it instead as they show in this thing well what if you put instead in a clear tape roll and that way you can kind of hide it it won't be that noticeable they'll just think it's pink tape so we got these basic ones right here I'll have to do simply pinch this and take it out one two oh no we got this okay nice and simple let's see how they do it secret coded tape dispenser with acrylic paint I don't need to code it because I already have this oh no a strip around it so I'm gonna this fake money since the closest thing I have right here let's take this one yes no we'll use different tape right here we got one let's connect them with tape right here okay and then I'm just gonna make that roll this is fun this is really cool now I'm just gonna roll it around this like so I'm trying to be like really precise here oh there you go look at that we got it all right now all you have to do is start rolling the hubba bubba around this this is a lot more complicated than I expected it to be whoa I guess I don't have a knack for this stuff like other people do whoa there's a lot of flour on this thing or like powdered sugar yes oh baby so look at my fingers look at this look at this all right here we go make this a little bigger yeah yep roll it keep it rolling I'm above a gum ah I'm on my first craft and I can't even do this properly almost there I mean it doesn't have to be a lot right what do you guys think look at that now from this side if you just put it you can't really tell let's roll this out and then you can just take a piece that's pretty cool one time you can take a bigger piece if you want you see on this side but make sure this is facing your teacher Wow all right start economy will match right here like this I want to clean up now I would say the first one is a pass I don't think it was a fail it might just be better just sneaking the hubba bubba in your backpack might be easier but if you want to do it in front of your teacher without her knowing that's definitely a way to do it all right next up of course we had this one as you can see you can share with your friends what's next seems like next up starburst when we got these erasers okay can open up these erasers you got to make sure you had the one with the cardboard on them like little wrapping that's the only way it will work you can't open it good thing on how this this yes open this one up we got this alright now what you want to do is take this eraser and cut a small portion on the bottom like that and then you can put it on the bottom as like a placeholder in here you're gonna take some starbursts open it up choose one color as you can see I'm using the pink one and putting them all together it might be a little too much work for someone who doesn't want that much work but it's okay more pink ones and you want it to look kind of like that rectangular shape that an eraser has but there are liable you just gotta work it ah keep going use a lot more probably use a plate for this if you're actually gonna consume it do not try this without oh okay here we go just using my thumb now oh it's tough this is tough huh I made a starburst eraser Wow is there any more pink ones make sure they're the same color it could be any color I mean I could have used a red one but pink looks more like an eraser now you're just gonna stuff it in right here and it's starting to take shape now you got a little eraser you can just buy it you can also get rid of this thing in the bottom and just have this whole thing made out of starbursts let's get more get more pink ones pink so you got to really use your fingers and like squeeze them cuz they're maybe warm them up a bit with your hands and then squeeze it squeeze this one in here yeah make sure you wash your hands don't touch the eraser and then use this and then let's squeeze it like this no that's an eraser yeah alright I think we're good let me just line it out make it a rectangle yeah okay perfect perfect perfect now I got pretty much a starburst eraser just pop it in here you know check it out got right back in the video so I hope you guys enjoy let's go yeah as you guys can see pop in here push it down okay now it's stuck that's the only problem with starburst gonna lengthen it a bit teacher said no food in class he said aha check this out of course you can add a lot more in here to fill it up which I will do but then you just take a bite let me add some more and then I'll take a bite oops oh my hands are sore from this but I guess you can use like real equipment like a spoon or something to just mash it together I'm using my hands all right we got the eraser check this out right here check it out that's the eraser now you can take of course a bite it's pretty good mmm this is really cool all right next up a sour rainbow belt and cut it off at an angle cut off the excess to make it the same size as the utility knife blade whoa make a small hole at the bottom take apart a utility knife attach the sour belt instead of the blade and put it onto the night well this is not working it's not working I need a screwdriver I must a screwdriver but why not have some of it so yeah yes ready let's unscrew this thing okay so they said take it apart like so make sure to wash this if you're actually that consuming but then you get your rainbow shower belts so let me open this up yes one we got one maybe like shake it off a bit see what else I take out the blade it looks like unicorn school supplies it bends suspiciously and smells like a candy it's dangerous to take food from the knife blade but this blade is so tempting itself Miss Elizabeth can prank her new students now if you bought this at school I would be really concerned if you're just using this now I guess it kind of works right I mean I like it what else next up we got this we got a glue stick try to get the large one take it off roll it all the way so you can just pop it out it's kind of a waste of glue but it's okay you're trying to sneak food into class you know so you just discard this and then you roll it back down okay as you guys can see it's empty and we can do another one of these starbursts and then just put it in the glue stick take them home all together I'm gonna take the red ones this time take a lot and then just mash it together again make sure your hands are washed and you don't want to wash this really really well if you do it yeah it's like really tough dough pretty much feels like gum this is difficult it's tiring we got it so now wait was I supposed to stuff them in one by one no way oh I think I needed this yeah guys I needed this you do this roll it out make sure you wash them like I said I actually don't recommend you guys doing this so just roll it out make sure it's it looks somewhat nice you know like this what do you guys think and then you put it in here and then guide it as you're pulling it down you got to push it what yeah roll it roll it what this is a workout same thing second attempt let's go come on glue stick make me proud I should have probably put powdered sugar over this so it slides and smoother maybe I put too much starburst I don't know okay this is all that it can take so then cut this top at the end yeah and then you can cover it with this look at that all it worked I cannot believe it worked so you just smash it in at the end you can cover it and now you got starburst glue stick look at this ready here we go woah this is really cool I think you just take a bite but I'm not gonna do it cuz I don't wash my hands guys like I said you gotta wash your hands also something you can do is use this for some nerds so this is empty all you have to do is just take some nerds and pour it in and then you can wow and then you just cover it look at this mirrors inside you cover it whenever you want some just don't look like the kid that's trying to eat glue sticks in class so you just open it take the lid off eat it cover it no whatever no well if you have people staring you but it's another cool way to do it so guys if you enjoy the video it's gonna wrap it up if you want me to try any other DIY stuff whether it could be like back-to-school pranks anything like that let
