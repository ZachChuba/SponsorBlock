little bit what does it feel like to be so majestic uh i i i don't i don't think i am but um it feels good how does it feel to hold the responsibility of having so many female viewers go head over heels for you i'm sure you know you're really popular right no no no no um mr sakuna you have this aura huh mr sakura what got you into streaming uh well i i didn't uh i didn't have a lot of friends

it's really strange looking the hair is so large what's wrong with my head nothing's wrong with it but it is it's i think it's larger than your body if you saw me walking down the street with my head this big would you run away or would you say hi i mean honestly i i mean i i might have to kind of go around wait wait wait wait wait wait wait no no no hold on hold on i have wait what about this oh
