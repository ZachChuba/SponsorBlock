yeah frame rater this video is supported by time stamps if you're looking for something in particular do keep these in mind as they may turn out to be very helpful for you the xbox the so-called emulation king negotiably the most ambitious console homebrew scene ever to exist yet and with the way things are going potentially forever there are many places to learn about how the xbox was hacked and what made it such an incredible piece of homebrewing technology but i'm not here to talk about that today all you need to know is that the xbox is easy to mod and simple to work with first things first while it is true that these xboxes are fairly simple it isn't quite on the level of psp or nintendo wii well that's half true once you've got the thing modded and found your preferred way of transferring files over it's a piece of cake again there are other places to find more information on this most people will choose transferring files by ftp though you can technically use a limited selection of usbs with an adapter before i knew anything about ftp the usb was my go to choice however you'll certainly find once trying ftp that the usb method is quite frankly terrible transfer speeds are abysmal and it often takes a while for the xbox to read them properly this may just be in my case with the usb i'm working with alas this is the only usb i own that is recognized by my xbox again not too many of these will work so it is a bit of a trial and error process i've even had two usbs of the exact same brand of the exact same file size from the exact same time period one of them worked and one of them didn't and this is that one that worked i eventually decided to give up all my stuck up ways of usb or nothing because i found that ftp is really the way to go it's very fast and there's no need to transfer between devices this information may be incredibly redundant to you but i do try my best to make these videos noob friendly i figure that mini rant may help some make the correct decision now here we are today with countless emulators for countless different consoles today we're going to take a look at the grand majority of them but not every single one out there last time with the wii i tested every single known emulator to exist on it nonetheless it was a huge task but doable since that scene was big but could never be on the same page as the xbox before the wii i covered the psp which is in many ways similar to the xbox's modding scene personally i feel the psp only got as far as it did because i had major appeal and portability emulation on the go at the time nobody did it like psp granted there are a lot of emulators for the psp so i didn't cover every single one safe to say however i covered the bases and i don't think i've come across a single comment yet on that video disappointed that i didn't go even deeper so today i'm taking a similar approach to that one a hugely ambitious but realistic look into the emulators available on microsoft's original xbox how deep are we going today let's elaborate for the xbox there are a lot of emulators even for single consoles don't get me started on anything sega for which each platform has practically five or more different emulators i've decided not to cover each of them only those that proved to be superior that usually means emulators created for the xbox between the years of 2002 and 2005 are being ignored in favor of more recent efforts there are a few exceptions but that mostly resides in platforms that don't have much of a reason to be on the xbox in the first place like the 3do for example honestly those stupidly ambitious emulators are the most fun to play around with in my opinion so with that said it is possible i'll miss out on a superior emulator here there i've tried my best to keep things as up-to-date as possible but i on several occasions had finished recording only to stumble across some kind of redirect that informed me i was in fact using an inferior emulator despite a google search would imply completely otherwise some of this stuff is well documented others not so much i hope you can forgive these potential mistakes in advance there are a couple more things we have to cover before getting into the emulation coverage firstly the xbox is capable of several different output resolutions for this video we'll be working with 720p and on rare occasion 480p 480p only went absolutely necessary and i'm not saying that because it provides an inferior picture no i'm saying that because for some reason my elgato capture box makes games sound like this in 480p [Music] if anybody knows of a solution please let me know in the comments if you're wondering how i'll be able to capture those 480p forced emulators well this is how keeping a camera next to my tv speakers and recording the audio to put alongside the elgato capture footage needless to say kinda hate elgato right now for those of you following along at home don't worry this is a technical problem on my end only you should have no problems displaying these emulators in 480p on your set the xbox modding scene is home to many different front ends if you don't know what that means front ends are like total user interface overhauls for your system personally i use xbm cmu station which is the first thing you see after booting mine up now while this front end will make it very easy to just select and start playing emulated games it does not guarantee that you'll be playing these games at their highest potential on the xbox my copy of xbmcmu station has some inferior and outdated emulators now this might be a result of the xbmc station being older but i just wanted to say if you're using a front end specifically there is a chance the listed emulators won't give you the best performance my biggest critique of this particular front end is that when you have a lot of roms for a certain system it takes a very long time for the selection to load for the record my build was compiled on april 17th 2019. anyways much to everyone's satisfaction all these frontends should come with file managers built in which is what i'll be using to externally test all the emulators i've downloaded today speaking of those emulators a lot of these have been designed in such a way to provide ultimate customization of their user interface skins for example are very common as well as strange menu background music choices i have to give a shout out to these efforts especially those that encourage you to play around with them for your preferred setup but other than this brief mention i won't be addressing the emulator uis in this video unless necessary to do so before jumping in it would be smart that i mentioned the fast forwarding options this makes annoying tutorials or cut scenes in specific games no problem the only problem i have with this is that the function is almost always defined by the right trigger by default despite it'll also be set to the console and questions right trigger bit of an oversight i would think if you come across this which more than likely will just redefine the key in the emulator control settings may take some time to figure out the binding for you but once everything is to your likings it can really make these emulators feel like a step above playing on real hardware depending on who you ask despite the xbox being a powerhouse of emulation it isn't perfect as no emulation scene is certain things like hardware limitations can prevent certain systems from being emulated well this usually resides in the more ambitious platforms although even some of the much older consoles can have issues here or there i've been told there are ways to expand the ram for the original xbox which makes a lot of these emulators run even faster sounds pretty great but that's probably more of an expert's angle for maximum accessibility i won't be doing anything extra to my xbox i'm using a completely stock crystal unit which internally should be no different from yours should you not have physically modded it of course the xbox is soft modded else what we're doing today wouldn't be possible last comment before we get into emulation while i did a lot of research and collecting on my own i'd like to give a massive thank you and shout out to xbmc mods for xbox this guy really helped me with this huge package of archived emulators not only does he have those emulators but tons of other stuff for xbox as well such as dashboards abandoned game dlcs and more check out his work if you're looking to get into or maybe back into the xbox homebrew scene so i think with that said we're ready to finally take a deeper look into the available emulators on the xbox platform ladies and gentlemen this is everything on the xbox disclaimer due to the nature of this video it was required to download roms from the internet this may be a simulation of theft but it is for educational purposes only all games downloaded had been promptly deleted after footage had been captured i support all video game manufacturers and purchase every game i intend to play for entertainment value this video does not encourage piracy in any way shape or form thank you for understanding once we have an emulator installed we have to launch it where you've put it depends on you but for me i put it in a sub folder on the c drive let's get into those home consoles starting with the atari 2600 the emulator i'll be using is called z26xv7 the first thing i do every time i start an emulator on the xbox is to make sure i'm getting a proper aspect ratio this ensures the games will look the way they were meant to look and can also prevent visual distortion z26xv7 has the same interface as pretty much a majority of the emulators on the xbox all you have to do is set the screen size position to size to fit keep aspect ratio and you're good to start playing some games i'll only be mentioning it this once but do consider this option for every forthcoming emulator whether it's this easy or not it should be there but if the option is missing from the emulator i'll be sure to let you know about it playing typical 2600 games was no problem i even tried some of the most infamous examples without any flaw tried paddle games which was interesting for these the control is set to both left and right triggers as analog by default it's inverted which was disorienting over time in practice you might be able to adjust to this control method but it doesn't beat a traditional paddle for any other games you should have no problems an excellent emulator magnavox's second odyssey console is next using odyssey xv3 beta 3. games in this emulator played at full speeds however as i usually come across with the odyssey 2 some games wouldn't react to my controls i've never used a real odyssey 2 before so i'm sure there was some fault on my end but oddly enough the results are often inconsistent i remember getting super cobra to work on another emulator long ago no problem but here i can't in this tutom game i get to hear this man's cries of pain get consistently louder and there's nothing i can do about it hilarious point of the matter is the games which i was able to control worked perfectly next is the intellivision using blissx v10 emulating in television on the xbox performance wise is great the only problem is irrelevant to the emulator it's just that the way the original and television controlled was so bad games like shark shark are frustrating for that reason alone perhaps an irrelevant comment but hey here's something relevant controller overlays for the intellivision games are included pull these up by clicking the left analog stick down then make your selection great stuff for the colecovision we'll be using an emulator called atom xv6 while this system does use a keypad controller all you should really need is mapped already starting a single player game is usually done with a number 1 which is mapped thanks to this starting up a game is super easy the games run at full speed and feel great on the xbox the atari 5200 emulator is multi-purpose so we'll be revisiting it again later into the computer segment this emulator is called atari xlbox v8.05 b so for whatever dumb reason this emulator has the start button unbound by default a button you need to start a majority of the 5200 library what an oversight once you've sorted that out it works great eh well the ones that boot do a small few games like mega mania might crash your xbox for some reason a shame since that's one of my favorites for this system for whatever game you can get to boot you should be able to enjoy a solid experience for emulating the vectrex we'll use mestrex v3 wow the overlays for each existing vectrex game are here that's some dedicated stuff the games played just fine though i feel there's something funky going on with the resolution here the lines look sloppier than i remember even compared to old footage i recorded everything looks a bit squished for some reason whatever the case the games themselves all ran at full speed the synthesized voices for spike were missing but that's the only gameplay related mishap i came across if you want to play vectrex today this isn't a bad choice another multipurpose emulator surfaces as we look into sega's sg-1000 console this emulator is mecca xv2 which also covers sega's game gear and master system rumor has it there exists a third release of this emulator but i wasn't able to find a copy of it maybe that would fix the single issue that i had with it but that's relevant to a master system game so i won't bring that up just yet regarding the emulation of sg 1000 mecha xv2 does everything right full speeds fully playable fully enjoyable nintendo is next with mendefen xness v15 mendefen huh that's a familiar name for several reasons this emulator achieves all it needs to being a smooth and accurate experience that plays anything i throw at it even the bootlegs what can i say other than it's excellent the atari 7800 emulator is known as atari v6 much like the last emulator there's nothing but good things to say about this everything worked well at that it's all i'd want from a 7800 emulator we'll now return to mecca xv2 for emulation of the sega master system so as i said earlier there was one issue i had with master system emulation on this and what would that be well the music in sonic 2 played a bit too fast i tested a good few games and nothing stood out to me other than that most of the sonic games were chuggy but then i found out that's actually just how these games were played on the master system themselves if you want to try your luck with other master system emulators there does exist one multi-platform emulator i'll mention in like less than a minute for the sega genesis that one will also play older sega console games but it wouldn't even boot sonic chaos so make of that as you will for turbo graphic 16 or pc engine games mendefen xpc v6 is the place to be no flaws to make note of a completely flawless experience from what i played it'll also play super graphics games if that's your thing yeah all seven of them now for that multipurpose emulator which emulates pretty much every sega console ever at least from the sega 32x and under for sega genesis emulation neogens plus gx v1b10 is the choice of champions it uses a few different cores for ultimate compatibility it'll even run virtua racing with pretty crackly audio but it's a step above neogenesis another xbox genesis emulator i tried that couldn't run virtua racing at all even still no real reason when you've got access to the 32x release that plays much better here i'll save those comments for a minute though this emulator is kind of like an overclocked genesis with a few exceptions why i say that is because some games that have performance issues on the original hardware like duke nukem 3d played far better here in fact for duke nukem 3d the soundtrack got a bit mushed at times because of how much better the game is playing than usual not faster than it was designed to be played but better than a stock genesis this difference you shouldn't notice in many genesis games those that already played fine on stock hardware will probably play just fine here if not better i didn't notice a single instance of dropped frames on anything other than virtual racing while this emulator does serve as a bit of a sega hub with its ability to play many sega consoles before it i wouldn't say it does those particularly well like i said wouldn't even boot sonic chaos nonetheless this was the best emulator i found for the genesis on xbox and yep it's pretty sweet the super nintendo has some competition on the xbox but these days there's no question about it z s any xbox v 3.7 which may be a bit of a sensory overload in its ui is the most accurate emulator for snes on the xbox let me tell you i tried a good few of these i thought the effort was futile to get a great working super nintendo emulator on the xbox until last on my list was this one and it was a true case of saving the best for last the majority of games intensive and super effects ones will run just fine here the only problem i had if you can even call it that was slightly crackly audio and star fox but it was honestly barely noticeable in the first place the emulator also seems to have some sort of anti-aliasing turned on by default which looks great this is an incredible emulator for emulation of the sega cd we turn back again to neogens plus gx v1b10 32x emulation will take place on the same emulator fun fact that old sonic cd video i did i had the full intention of recording my playthrough via this xbox emulator or at least one very similar that ran discs since i still had my complete copy of sonic cd at that point oh speaking of which this one also runs discs but then i came to this screen and had to resort to the sonic gems collection release instead i didn't have to do that i just couldn't figure out how to access this options screen to initialize the ram cartridge it's literally so easy just boot the system and before the game starts go into the bios menu and format the memory then you can start the game and it'll work just fine as did every other game i tested how about 32x games though tried a handful of games afterburner complete didn't boot but i guess you just have the original genesis releases for that otherwise all games i tried played flawlessly except for star wars the arcade game it was just slightly playable if i'm being honest every second or so the frame rate would go to zero then back to normal and then back down to zero short increments of time but so frequently that yeah i could never consider playing the whole game like this it's pretty funny how as we get into the 32-bit and above platforms the order playability is all over the place i guess that's understandable though for some of them like being a console that we all know but barely any of us have touched the 3do emulated with 3dox va 0.715 here's the first emulator on the list that forces you into a 480p resolution so as i elaborated on earlier i had to put my camera up to the tv to record audio sorry if you can hear other background noise i tried my best so on first impression i had no idea what to do i couldn't get any of the roms to actually boot it just went to this blank insert cd screen luckily like with the sega cd emulator it takes disks wasn't expecting that for such a slow emulator oh yeah so the emulator is slow what can you expect from a platform in this era nobody really cared about that being said this still really impressed me it ran far better than i expected i thought i'd get between 2 and 3 frames per second but no you get just under 10 for some games and even sound emulation it's not playable unfortunately but the potential is here if anyone was dedicated enough this could turn into something incredible for now it's still an astonishing feat that you probably wouldn't try more than once for curiosity's sake by the way you can't change the aspect ratio the screen is stretched and i'm fairly sure you can't do anything about that here's another console most haven't played the atari jaguar emulated on virtual jaguar xv 1.20 we'll call me impressed again these games are playing at a pretty good frame rate alien vs predator is playing similar to the speeds you'd see on actual hardware the only problem is that there are many graphical glitches and unfortunately no sound at least that was the default configuration turning it on was said to cause the speed to drop dramatically some games actually do have sound on by default though and are very playable ryden is a kind of playable example it had unpleasant flickering effects that may cause epilepsy so i can't show too much of that rayman might as well be considered fully playable even though the music can get a bit choppy and for some reason the sound effects are completely missing tempest 2000 yeah this is not playable the graphics are practically missing in most cases zool 2 is another example of a largely playable game this is an actual reason to keep the emulator installed on your xbox and that i think is really awesome for this emulator like with the 3do the aspect ratio is stretched and there doesn't appear to be anything you can do about that getting a bit more on the popular side now here we have sega saturn emulation via yabose c public alpha 2.0 and as can be said for saturn on most platforms other than pc it barely functions and again the aspect ratio is stretched by force you'll get single digit frame rates for just about everything got no sound for daytona usa but surprisingly it did work for wipeout the game was by no means playable but it was an experience i tried radiant silver gun and this was the best experience with the emulator yet even still it was less than 10 frames per second the sound played better here than all those other games i tried for it though if that means anything for you it's been said that you can get faster results playing at 480p instead but those results still aren't going to be able to give you a playable experience if this emulator ever gets a future revision it might be worth taking a look into the best i can hope for though is that it would get on the league of the atari jaguars emulator which even in that case only a few games i'd say are playable things get really interesting with playstation emulation played on pcsx reloaded x v 0.7 true i can't put much on here due to the available hard drive space but this is another emulator that accepts original disks as such i was able to test a good few i otherwise couldn't still the emulator notes that playing from a disc will grant slower results than using a rom i tested this myself and yeah i mean i can tell there's a slight speed up when using roms but honestly it felt pretty similar to me maybe my disk drive is in really good condition or something pcsx reloaded x v 0.7 isn't the only playstation emulator in fact this one's actually quite a bit newer before this one i tested pcs xbox v23 and had some interesting results i found that certain games namely powerslave and striker's 1945 played better on that earlier emulator that being said games like crash 2 were extremely choppy on that emulator but were more or less fully playable on pcsx reloaded xv 0.7 since this emulator is new i imagine it will eventually dominate over pcs xbox in every way for the time being though maybe keep both of these installed something else i'll have to mention pcsx reloaded x3 0.7 puts on an anti-aliasing effect by default i figured some might point that out and suggest it changes performance but i tested without it and i honestly couldn't notice a difference there are other settings you can try to mess around with for better speeds but this caused a lot of graphical issues that are more likely to bother some people i've read up about how increased ram to your xbox can dramatically change how these emulators perform a lot of modders these days will double the ram at 128 megabytes which is said to do wonders for nintendo 64 emulation we'll get to that old n64 in a moment but first it's fairly interesting how virtual boy is handled with the emulator virtual boy xv3 beta 3. i've never seen the thing emulated this slowly before this shocked me because how great the other prior emulators have been on the platform the virtual boy was a decidedly low spec console for the time not much of an improvement over the super nintendo if any no games for the virtual boy appear playable i mean i guess that's debatable but it was all under or around 10 frames per second consider me shocked because i was really expecting better from this the nintendo 64 is a very noteworthy platform to be emulated on the xbox accomplished for years and always improving slowly this emulator is called surreal 64ce b6.0 before you start downloading some rom's willy-nilly consider that an effort has been made to optimize nintendo 64 games specifically for these xbox emulators you can find these roms by looking up earthworm james xbox and 64-pack the emulator is suggested to be played in 480p but the option for 720p is there so that's what i tried first results were half and half some had major problems whether that be slow down or troubled graphics presents others played really well i wouldn't say anything was perfect but totally playable in many cases super mario 64 was fine mario kart 64 was fine and star fox 64 was usually fine with some stuttering here and there no turok 2 was actually playing alright some stuttering but would you actually believe this ran better than smash brothers hydro thunder didn't have any sound for some reason but played at a full 60 frames damn need some bad examples though super smash brothers stuttered constantly fox tried to persuade me into loot axe but i wasn't okay with that so i pistol zapped his ass back to corneria wipeout 64 was oh my god oh my god well it played too fast in each rom's settings you'll find them attributed to a specific core it seems the selection has been hand-picked for each game though most games seem to launch under the 1964 core you can swap the cores if you really want to though i imagine the default sets are going to get you the best results i actually did try swapping cores for smash brothers and it just crashed the xbox so yeah of course i had to try this emulator in 480p mode so i did and you know wasn't much of a difference i think smash bros in particular played exactly the same if not worse actually no clue so those are the home consoles now let's take a look at arcade emulation typically i wouldn't jump from home consoles to arcade but for the xbox i'm making an exception the four controller ports specifically make the xbox a great multiplayer platform since arcade games are known to focus on this element of gaming it's fitting for arcade emulation to have a solid focus in the xbox emulation scene ironically however we're starting with one that kind of stumped me you see it's preferred to be playing neo geo games via final burn emulators however each instance of final burn i tried had some type of error loading the games this is generally due to missing parent files required for those arcade games to run i've always had a lot of trouble with this you have to kind of know what files you need prior despite there isn't much of a way to know other than researching each individual game this would be to the inconvenience of most unfortunately i suppose there is an alternative and that's what i've chosen for the video that would be coax v 0.11 by the way both emulators in question should be able to additionally run capcom play system games oh and to those saying the neo geo aes isn't an arcade system but a home console i know this but at the same time i've always felt that the library insinuates it is an arcade system just built for the comfort of your home so why did i first mention final burn over kawaks well kawaks is stuck in 480p so naturally the games aren't going to look nearly as crisp in comparison final burn looked far better alas finding the right rom files is a pain and a half so this had to do for it was able to load tons of roms whereas final burn refused without me having to dig across the net for obscure files kawaks is a very well designed emulator and it makes sense that it's restricted to 480p why well it's old for neo geo games i do recommend final burn over cowox but if you just can't be bothered trying to find all those associated files kawax will do a good job with a reduced score for presentation to my embarrassment the following emulator i also can't give a proper demonstration for this time at least it isn't really my fault the laserdisc platform is known for full video classics like dragon's lair and space ace alas the format was known to have very large file sizes associated with the games at least for its time even still i don't have enough space on my xbox for even one of these games so this menu is really all i've got to work with today from what i've seen the emulation is superb for this emulator so if you have the space for it daphne xv 0.96 is the way to go cd-based platforms aren't all doomed to massive file sizes even though that generally would be the case for the neo geo cd a good few games aren't too huge which allowed me to demonstrate x neo rain 1.2.11 this is another emulator that mind you can launch original games from the cds if you have them the readme for this emulator states it was built off the best existing neo geo cd emulator out there and that comes as no surprise to me all the games i tried played perfectly the only flaw is the forced stretched aspect ratio by the look of things there's no way to change it to match the original so long as that doesn't bug you the simulator does the job and does it well the last two emulators for the arcade would be final burn legends v 1.26 and memo extras v 2.1 ah the battle for the best dedicated arcade emulator well i can already say that hands down final burn legends v 1.26 takes the lead it offers crispy 720p whereas memo extras v 2.1 despite not being that old of an update supports 480p at its highest weird as you might expect by now from arcade emulation each build has different compatibility you might find having both installed is a good idea final burn legends is probably the way to go i say probably because the library of compatible arcade games is way too massive everything will vary what works versus what doesn't is gonna have to be determined by your own hands if there's one thing that needs to be said everything played at perfect speeds on both emulators with the exception of go go miles smile that one always seemed to struggle a bit not sure why played a damn fine game of turtles and time just after though can't complain just as a side note before i moved out i had a big yard sale where me and my friends played through a whole bunch of classic side-scrolling arcade beat-em-ups in the garage as people were showing up once you got everything up and running as you like a one-time process as long as you don't delete anything the xbox is a perfect choice for multiplayer gaming the arcade emulation really sells it alone alright so those were the arcade systems now on to those handhelds starting with the gameboy and game boy color models using xboy advance x25 a multi-purpose emulator we'll take a look at it again for the emulation of game boy advance in terms of game boy i tried a bunch of games mostly fine some mild stuttering on bonk's adventure but by all means playable didn't have any issues with the game boy color games i tried even hax played fine yet again though with game boy color emulation i ran into a struggle with shantae this did not play well at all flickering graphics terrible slowdown the menu is usually missing unless you go to the top of the map where it removes the first layer of sprites and speeds up very strange indeed now i have tried multiple game boy emulators on the xbox and this is indeed both the latest and greatest it's great for what you want to do probably unless what you want to do is play shantae one last time we'll take a look at mechax v2 for its emulation of sega's game gear honestly if i had anything new to say i'd say it but no mechax v2 is very good at emulating the game gear no complaints it's atari's one portable the lynx emulated by medinafen x link seven the emulation for this handheld is usually a tad wishy-washy first impressions were good until i played the ryden port graphics would frequently corrupt in this game one time it even crashed i tried road blasters a notorious game when it comes to atari link simulation usually the bottom hud flickers and yep still doing that here thankfully most links games played fine for me even those that didn't were still playable here's a platform i've only heard of before the watara supervision emulated by supervision xv4 so granted i'm unfamiliar with the system but the emulation here seems okay on rare occasion i would come across garbled graphics and for a good amount of the games i played there was no sound however each game still remains playable by the look of things neogeo's pocket and colored models will be covered by neopop x v6 another instance where i have nothing of value to add here because the emulation was flawless none of the games i played had any noticeable issues i'm about to head over to pink gorilla to get us some bandai wonder swans emulated with wonder swan xv5 yeah i'm really gonna want to go pick up that genuine wonder swan after toying with this emulator truth be told some games appear to play fine others run slow or the sound is all kinds of messed up [Music] other than for a few choice games like mr driller i'd recommend emulating wonder swan elsewhere back to xboy advance v25 for emulating game boy advance games i'm aware of some system intensive game boy advance games so i tried all of those no issues with the first person shooters speed based games like sonic advance 2 worked great i tried smashing drive one of those advanced 3d games and i'm pretty sure this was playing slower than hardware but not significantly i had the same kind of problem with rayman hoodlums revenge i'm not sure if it was the frame rate more so it had some stuttering problems it's playable but it's just not entirely smooth seems as if every game will play though and i'm sure the vast majority are playing at full speeds usually these older consoles have trouble running nintendo ds emulation and the xbox while promising and perhaps better than some of the competition still struggles with dismounme xv 0.87 games play between half to 75 of the intended speed for the most part which i suppose makes some of these playable sound is enabled for all of them and that's about as you'd expect games like kirby's squeak squad might be enjoyable to play at this speed i guess the point is it's doable stuck on a suck v2 might be wondering how i accomplish this not the suck the bringing the bubble into kirby's mouth well you can actually swap screens on the fly with the press of a button the cursor here can then be moved around clicked and dragged many game types definitely don't call for this kind of thing but for a game like kirby it works as a whole though 3d games are a no-go mario kart ds no thanks could you believe new super mario bros is still playing like three times better than the speed of my netbook that i played it on back in like 2009 with that said i'm sure many people would consider this playable i mean it very much is it's just not preferable these days someone put that poor rabbit out of its misery touch the dead is real slow but that's probably a better idea when touching the dead and yeah there's nintendo ds emulation on xbox again like the jaguar some games might be loosely playable but most of it won't be and now for the part i usually hate computer emulation typically plagued by nondescript keyboard controls and wacky disk swaps it takes a lot of mental work to figure out if you're going in blind some of them are still fairly easy to deal with but the first one isn't thankfully in this case i was able to figure out how to work with it and i'll explain that to you this emulator is kegs xv5 for apple ii emulation so when you first select a game what you're going to want to do is use the arrow keys to navigate to control panels slots highlight startup and press left or right until it shows slot 6. press return or enter to save quit and now when you boot up another game it should boot as normal well as normal as the emulator allows for or my brain anyhow honestly i never know with these computer games a few of these games i tried worked fine without a hassle others either wanted something extra for me like boulder dash or they were just looping in terms of speed they seemed to work just fine so if you're patient enough or know what you're doing this might be a great emulator for you returning to the similarly built 5200 we have the atari 800 emulated again with atari xlbox v 8.05 b i don't expect this to be much trouble the atari 800 usually isn't and it wasn't every game booted and played normally i can only wish all the computer systems were like this for loading roms dos can be an issue to emulate on consoles due to the need of mounting games properly thankfully dosbox v13 for xbox doesn't require that it has its own navigator for easily selecting and loading games it's not perfect though and my reason to say that mostly resides in the way it controls it seems as if there's no way to set keyboard specific controls instead relying solely on joypad compatibility some games i tried don't even have joypad support so they appear to be unplayable in some cases i'd have to use the game's own options using the virtual keyboard to select joypad something that always perplexes me with these computer emulators is why can't they have some type of easy control swap feature built in to swap between keyboard and joypad of course we'd only apply a few keys but at least give you the most common of layouts arrow keys control spacebar enter you know the basics i have no idea what was even happening here in 4x4 off-road racing wolfenstein 3d behaved strangely as well i'm not sure how to explain it but essentially i would walk extremely slowly until i would open a door and suddenly i'm using bolt only for a handful of seconds then i go back to a snail's pace on the positive side i love the navigation in this emulator this is the kind of ease i want to see in dos simulation thankfully in recent years this is becoming more the norm in addition the games themselves performed very well and when i could control them properly they were fully playable and enjoyable full speeds all around the unfortunate oversights and issues this emulator has with controls though sells it a little short with some work this could be outstanding as is well it's all right i guess sinclair zx spectrum is next with didn't x spectrum v5 you you didn't what some games booted instantly others took a really long time i can only assume that's normal some games played great others had errors like the missing music in bosconi in 87. then there was the occasional one that wouldn't respond past a title screen a lot of them however i just couldn't control or maybe just one of the buttons would work even using a keyboard in some cases didn't seem to do anything at least the game seemed to be playing at full speeds yet again i must say it could be my inexperience with the system causing this but at least for those interested in trying out some of the games this might not be your preferred platform of choice for the zx spectrum are you on the spectrum i'm sorry now for the commodore 64 using vice 64 xv11 this emulator takes forever to transfer over due to there being nearly 6 000 files contained in the folder and to be honest i think a lot of those aren't even necessary but don't quote me on it once you've got it on your xbox though expect to have a near flawless c64 experience minus the intro screens that maybe this is a controversial opinion but i really feel like roms of intros should either be removed before uploading or not even uploaded at all at least with a warning or disclaimer but yeah solid emulator for the msx we'll be using blue ms xbox v8 oh what the hell was that crap this is a very solid emulator safe for one thing i know it's an intensive game but you gotta have a working metal gear yeah no matter what i tried couldn't get that game to work everything else i threw it at work perfectly though even super boy but i fear using super boy and perfect in the same sentence for emulation of the amstrad cpc will use arnold xv5 yeah this was basically flawless unless you're coming across a game with drm passwords no titus the fox for me everything else worked like a charm another solid emulator the commodore amiga uses the win uaex lite v19 emulator like many before at the amiga may have random shenanigans you'll need to deal with before a game starts in amiga's case you may even have to insert a second disk and i have no idea how to do that even when i booted games with a second disk inserted it often told me to put in that second disk despite in theory it was already there well the games that didn't require additional disks worked great for me so yeah it is a solid emulator i'm probably just missing something lastly the sharp x68000 will be emulated using x68000x v6 i tried arkanoid 2 revenge of dough and by the end of it i was the one saying controller and keypad didn't seem to react to the game past the control screen so i guess that's unplayable some choice games mine though played flawlessly bosconian perfect bubble bobble perfect lots of other games no flaws to report i deliberately tried a system intensive game f15 eagle strike 2. yep now that's what i call slow so as long as you're keeping to the 2d games to my knowledge being majority of the sharp x68000 library you should be good to play your favorite titles on this emulator alright so those were the emulators i tried for the xbox keep in mind i did try multiple of each console and have reported the ones that perform best in this video making sure i was using the latest versions in each case there are a few more emulators i skipped talking about mostly for reasons like with the atari st emulator where i couldn't even boot a game i had no idea what was going on i thought it was really interesting to discover that an emulator for plug and play consoles exists specifically those that ran on the spg2 xx chip but unfortunately i couldn't find a site that offered the roms the xbox is an emulation machine no doubt but it isn't perfect several platforms that are totally capable of being emulated on the system still don't run well like the wonder swan and virtual boy not much to complain about i doubt many will really care but it seems still a little bizarre to me in some ways to me the psp's emulation scene feels a bit more developed i'm just saying that in comparison i feel like the psp had more of a focus in the areas where it mattered most after all the psp is far less powerful than the original xbox yet the speed and platforms it is capable of running are not too dissimilar you would expect for the xbox it would be leagues above when in reality that's only somewhat true granted the psp is still actively being worked on for emulation not as much as before but still to a degree it is a great portable solution for emulation these days a lot of efforts to bring more platforms or speed to certain platforms is more pointless on the xbox than ever since so many more home emulation stations have come to light in recent years especially like with the wii and the wii u which require far less effort to be modded people have moved on from the xbox and in many ways it does make sense what the xbox needed the most has already been achieved and that is solid arcade emulation the xbox is a multiplayer monster it's no wonder that many xboxes even today are the brains behind mame arcade cabinets the controller ports and emulation support makes it a fantastic choice for gaming get-togethers the wii shares its number of controller slots with the xbox via gamecube controllers though since the wii's emulation scene does not surpass the xbox xbox has the high ground in that situation but not only that the gamecube controllers aren't everyone's favorite when you want to sit down and play with a bunch of your friends generally you want something that people find universally comfortable let's just forget about the duke controller for a second i know that when it comes to playing multiplayer arcade games at home there's no question about what platform i'll use ultimately i turn to my xbox and with the countless other emulators that work great if not perfectly the xbox is still a beast of an emulation station huge thank you goes out once again to xbmc mods for xbox for providing me with a lot of the emulators i may not have been able to find so easily on my own so thank you all for watching and i'll catch you frame raiders in the next [Music] video [Music] bye
