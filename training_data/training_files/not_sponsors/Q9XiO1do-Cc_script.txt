why is this hot we lookin so red I thought that the hot wing is looking back at me like this hey what's going on everybody for first we feast I'm Sean Evans and you're watching hot ones it's the show with hot questions and even had her wings and today we closed out season 10 with John boyega he's an actor and producer you know best from films like attacked the block Pacific Rim uprising and Star Wars speaking of you can catch him in Star Wars Episode nine the rise of Skywalker which is set to theaters on December 20th John boyega welcome to the show thank you for having me I've heard you rave about pepper soup in the past so I take it you're no stranger around so I shouldn't have said that man this is a mad thing Matt well you know what we're here and I'm happy to be a dude watch the show big fan mm-hmm that's good yeah this is good chicken wings man what you don't get this one my belly's playlist over here on 34th Street Oh ah-ha see this is good free plug [Music] everything on this table is against me dude I'll go make sure I'm on point focus focus focus I understand that girion food it can get quite spicy where we at on the Nigerian heat index probably not even registered with this this is not registering on my tongue nothing no there's nothing and then I understand that you took Harrison Ford to a Nigerian meal in London yeah what was that like because that seems special on multiple levels yeah on the day we were on the Millennium Falcon actually due to shooting a scene and Harrison was like you know what I want to go and eat like real food like different kind of food like different tastes someone sick of the chicken breast in the salad I saw like a cool man come down to the ochem road it's a Nigerian restaurant there and go there and have some food and we went down there got a car and he ate everything he ordered literally more than me and then in the car back he was slumped he was gone so gone that he was just like can we swap positions because you have a lot more legroom the Harrison forward then break in like literally climbed over me to get into my seat with swap places and he was sleep like snoring gone Nigerian food calm yeah and then I know that your major proponent of the food scene and Peckham including your favorite chicken shop over there on ride Lane yeah what can you tell people about the chicken shop culture in London because one time I went to Tottenham with this guy that chicken connoisseur oh you were gonna slow down you know chicken kind of smooth and we were at this spot and Tottenham and kids were just banging on the window trying to get in to take a picture with the guy yeah yeah I mean you know he's the best of the British especially when it comes to chicken wings you know you get your standard two piece chicken and chips and get you the number four which is really good they throw in some ribs and some corn on the cob so you know who got some good nice dishes back overnight well it's a culture like you know it's a nice cheap as well you know in little box fries chicken you could for the day [Music] Ocampo nothing a compliment step up guys step up step it up remember he said this remember he said this know what is how I'm gonna go out confidence you've kept some pretty cool keepsakes from your time at Star Wars from red spider-man stormtrooper helmet that JJ gifted you to the Han Solo action figure that you got signed by Harrison yeah which one is most special to you when you think about your time on set that Harrison Ford figure is really special to me like I was able to hold on to that figure and go through the whole franchise and get multiple different people to sign it this is you know new characters are we have met yet and obviously you know some some characters that are you know pivotal to the Star Wars story but they're not obviously on set all the time and when I could locate them I'd locate them and I have to figure on me and be like could you please sign better video game in your opinion the Force Unleashed or Battlefront I would say bow front definitely a bad game because of the online platform and then the film is one of the most lockdown secretive films that I can recall being made yeah can you reveal some of the behind the scenes security measures that go into putting a cap on Star Wars I know I remember I bought an overcoat because every time we leave the set we can't actually leave in costume so if you want to go to the toilet and understand studio a lot we can't just leave-- we have to put these these cloaks on and I put my cloak on and I couldn't get back in to set security guy must have been in his first day and he was just like nah nah nah I can't let anyone in but I'm not yeah but I'm in them I'm in the film to promise you a minute but good enough like one of the senior security dudes came down and you know gave me the Parsee let's read that yeah that's amid [Music] cool so to someone on the outside of the movie business it would seem like more British actors than Americans worked their way through the ranks of theater or at least classically trained at places like Rada and central how would you explain the drama tradition and Britain to an outsider caller New York right guys the theater scene Harris is pretty consistent very professional some really top-notch training it's the same thing than UK but the special thing about the UK is that the theatres are also tied to after-school activities so you can get involved in theater for meeting young and that's how I got involved was just a youth group and then we ended up you know connecting with different theaters different performances and that's why you really either get the bug where you can't leave it be boys boys a good experience do you see any difference and say an actor who has a theatre background and a big-budget movie set versus someone who's just been doing TV and film since the beginning you know I thought it depends on the individual I think that some people are talented to the point where regardless of the format they adjust and adapt and some people just have it I guess it depends if you've been doing TV for a long while maybe there's some bad habits you pick up you know you're not used to you know transitioning onto stage it's a different process also preparing for for stage work so it just depends on the individual to me but you know there is a significant jump from film to TV venture to stage is you know three different formats and then I know one of the places that you studied was at the identity school for acting yeah what is special about that place because there seems to be a lot of the alumni popping up in big huge blockbusters all over the place right now it's incredible like that was just basically a drama school set up by my agent Femi organs and he was in London and found that not a lot of black people are getting into mainstream drama schools you know what were finding the you know one per class inand that and that for for him it wasn't enough he had been an actor before and he was in like you know EastEnders you know those you know British TV shows and in on the leaflet he was basically saying you know get trained by actors who've been in you know EastEnders casualty and who's talking by himself but fruit through that he set up a drama school and me latisha riot Malachi Kirby some of the British names that you know now I've see on that one on the big screen we went there and it was a hub of creativity where you know with just a lot of young people who had the same dream who didn't laugh at each other's dream and it was cool like I live it's like some of the best days of my life I really enjoyed it you know got some so first we feast recently did a deep dive into the connection between anime and hip hop on this new show that we have called go Chi gang and I know that you're a huge fan yep what do you think it is about anime why do you think it's inspired such a huge global following anime I think because of its long-form format so it lasts for ages you take a summer night in our ruto for example you literally watch a character grow up day by day and then there are filler episodes that give you kind of like clarity on the world surrounding the leads of the several different leads in and in the anime and it's just the way it's the way they tell stories a lot of the time when characters are like standing in one scene you're going into their subconscious mind you know like for example I'm here like I'm doing well the chicken wings are good but [ __ ] I don't know if this next one's about to blow my [ __ ] freaking brains to the sky right it's like that and they do like a subconscious thing we go back and forth and that's cool I really like that it's great way of storytelling this fun and I guess it just touches - did they tap into the imagination of individuals and people just really really loved it there was actually on YouTube an anime version of Star Wars they had the X wings flying in they animated exactly like what it would be like in an anime TV show and it actually it actually really really worked like really really then I think the x-wings the spaceships the lightsaber fights all that kind of stuff is anime esque what would you recommend like if somebody are just dipping their toes under the anime pond and they were just wanting to get started what do you think are some titles to get them started I would say attack on Titan I definitely say Naruto one punch man one punch one punch man larry's people say I look like one punch man I get that tweeted that I know yeah you know lassithi on my little bit that one look moist Erised in that source of that okay what's going on the biggest fan of his sauce taste is a bit fire that horseradish yeah yeah no big fan of that what that's the way still sitting until you do not mean stick all right time we have a recurring segment on our show called explain that Graham where we do a deep dive on our guest Instagram pull interesting pictures that need more context yeah so we'll just put them up on their monitor you tell us the bigger story does that sound good yeah sounds great rusty I have people at home if I've got chicken wings at the corner of my mouth he is way he's [ __ ] so this first one okay someone said to me that it looked like I was taking horse riding lessons from Putin it is amazing okay the fit is amazing child to daily paper a really good fit I was training for Star Wars Episode nine there's a big Calvary scene that we we have specifically me and know Naomi and this was one of the days that it was just hot as hell I've been in the gym and I thought you know what shedding moms man all right up next we have a Tokyo my best friend Asia I'm a boy Stefon we were there for for a little bit and we were just exploring P big kids were all into anime you know Gundam stuff but they have a big like life-size condom in the middle of Tokyo that would change like whoo that would morph like in the evenings like this is actually crazy I'm about to go again I'm gonna do a whole bunch of stuff but this was just us exploring the gaming district that had like a lot of arcades figures well that's nothing you just looking around why is not in Hill Carnival it's such a big deal such a big deal you know what I go in trouble for this [ __ ] what I went to I went to not in whole carnival and I caught wines like you know you go not on who carnival we're gonna catch wines like you wine on a scale you know it's a dance and Ernest that's what I'll do I'll Carnival this is one of my many subjects and we had a fantastic time take a picture and I don't know I guess there was some Disney fans who were like uptight and be like oh so that's what Disney wouldn't do a thing like that I'm not shut up man catching wines at carnival yeah baby I'm going on boom yeah okay cool my subconscious just one of this I put an item off me mmm my spicy so I I read that before you accepted the role of Finn JJ Abrams he gave you a long speech cautioning you about the responsibilities that go with being a part of a franchise that's as iconic as Star Wars mm-hmm the morality that he was speaking about the responsibility for me like I found that nice because you know this is someone who was just kind of like keep it humble be yourself enjoy this experience but make sure you understand that you know obviously a lot of people are gonna be watching you make sure every choice that you make is something that you're okay with it's such an interesting position to be in where it's like oh here's a role that's just gonna catapult you into a spot that nothing in life really builds you for I'm not nothing prepares you for it and a lot of people who had opinions as into how it was gonna go and I was all ears you know but there's nothing like you going through that yourself and then finding out what works for you and what what does it and then you get a letter right there before every sentence my man's left listen what's goin on minutes but it gets me ten seasons in oh yeah closing outside my mother's you know you're right it's like a running back yeah you're right I put a lot of miles you're right I do you know fresh from college you know I mean yeah I get it I get it and then you get a lot of credit for being an ambassador to Star Wars and for Star Wars and you're not afraid to mix it up with fans or respond to feedback on Twitter yeah when has trying to out nerd the Nerds backfired on you never never never has I choose my battles wisely and a lot of the times online I'm I'm like so intrigued to hear what the fans think to hear how they feel and they're just disgust fingers as nerds I think the the biggest one that I did was when I said that Anakin Skywalker is a stronger a much better Jedi than he is and I think actually the fans kind of galvanized behind you yeah and I mean well you know whether were sometimes we'll just like that's not true but no you lion Anakin's Tucci Rey will get pushed to the side we will all get slammed to the wall and held there so while he fights so like guess just true [Music] my kneecaps are shaking a bit I can't lie I'm doing well the chicken wings are good again ha but that just means this guy I feel like you are gonna have a Nigerian woman walk out with pepper soup right now yeah you got it is the season 10 finale what's going on so in addition your ps4 and jo Malone London cents I know that one thing you always travel with one thing you always travel with is books is there a self-help book that you can say actually changed your life for the better I would say Devon Franklin's produced by faithful was quite work quite a good book I really enjoyed it from someone in industry that then speaks about you know faith growth industry matters in a very very cool way that was something that definitely was motivating to me I thought this she has been we've I've learned so many lessons man like I've learned so many lessons about myself I've made some changes I'm just in a way you know I interact with with people my friends who you know within my family mom and dad had to take care of their more so for 2020 I actually want to see those lessons exercise [Music] all right the bomb beyond insanity okay why is this what we looking so red I thought that the hot wing is looking back at me that is oh yes on that Nigerian heat scale we starting them we in the gana God man Sammy hey we're in a game now win the game so I know that in the lead-up to Star Wars you would do months of lightsaber fight tiny woo to prepare for the film mm-hmm do you remember the first time you picked up a light saber heavier than you thought it would be lighter than you thought it would be heavy it was a P heavy as hell but we had a lot training they came in Taurus our student might say but what's the basic news and then we slide going I hate getting faster stronger I really really had a good time well I don't know if you're aware of this but on YouTube there is a whole genre of amateur Jedi's though it seems that very few of them actually have taken to me when I'm glad fruit is profit so what I want to do but he ignores everything you're going to show you some of the aspiring Jedi's that we found on YouTube and I'm just wondering if you have any snap takes to this okay first up what do you think of this spinning backfist now if if the verse one of the Sabres on set you would have finished you would have been finished if those Sabres caught you on set you would have been knocked out so that that's dangerous but that was good all right up next how strong is the force with this juggling Jedi does he have the wing in his mouth sit I'm impressed but during the video all I saw was swirling flames is that like a filter you guys have in a studio because that classy [ __ ] definitely not a personal problem definitely not a personal problem oh my gosh this despise was on the cloth and I wiped onto my nose that's like something double [ __ ] I did wear some watch the eyes are definitely washed eyes whoo all right there's anything like this ever happens you on set here we have a father-son yeah yep he just called his son awesome is that - oh yeah Adam driver actually caught me a few times on my fingers and I genuinely I got mad about it I was like this guy needs to aim up man or don't aim at all so we're going back and forth I actually disarmed him and he's saved by like flew and landed in the snow the whole crew was like I was like that's how I should have ended that's how it should have ended all right one more for you yep and it has nothing to do with light sabers per se yeah kid I said you guys do the heat and Lucifer dwelling in my mouth here's a guy farting the tune of the Imperial March just curious if you cool your mouth I'm confused when I dropped the load like you know we freestyling so I don't know what's going on down there [Music] [Music] I mean after that move on to walk Ian's fire I don't I don't know why I think you know playing with you in my hand it's gonna change was like our gonna find some spot on a you know I mean yeah
