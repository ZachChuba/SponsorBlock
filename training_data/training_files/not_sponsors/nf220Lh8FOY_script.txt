this video is sponsored by skill share a little while but for now let's talk about Jordan peels second film titled us us comes on the heels of get out and while I personally didn't find the film very memorable clearly I'm a [ __ ] because it was one of the most successful horror films of the year he'll even won an Oscar for writing the Best Original Screenplay of 2017 so peels second film us was greatly anticipated by audiences the plot of us and I will be getting into heavy spoiler territory from now on can essentially be summarized like this [Music] there are clones of civilians living in underground spaces underneath the United States these clones known as the tethered were made by the government to control the citizens on the surface the experiment was a failure so the government simply abandoned them underground in over the decades that tethered lost their minds but then red shows up on the scene red organizes the tethered and plans a massive invasion of the surface their goal aside from killing their surface doubles is to recreate the 1986 Hands Across America event to show that even those marginalized by society and given no opportunities are still capable of doing great things at the end of the film we learned that red was actually born on the surface and her tethered now known as a delayed switched with her when they were children the tethered successfully invade the surface and recreate the Hands Across America event the main family manages to escape that was a very close call as their fate was ultimately decided by a knife fight between Adelaide and red they escaped south towards Mexico watching this I couldn't help but think that the plot was very convoluted and made no sense but also that the family could have survived the situation with significantly fewer trials by combat there are in fact easier ways they could have beaten this situation and as usual I discovered this by googling a bunch of a name facts and figures most of which have put me on government watch lists the last solution on this list would completely stop the tethers invasion of the surface without any loss of life so welcome to my video blog of how to beat the tethered from us I call it the blogging but before we can get to those solutions first we need to explicitly consider the conditions of the scenario to figure out exactly what obstacles need to be overcome to beat the tether to from us now I'm going to attempt to explain exactly what the conditions of the scenario are but my god is this going to be a monumental effort because this movie just does not make sense this movie makes less sense than the birthday t-shirt ads that Facebook keeps showing me Jude Man you know my name not my story you see my smile not my pain you notice my cuts not my scars you read my lips not in my mind this one is my favorite though uh sorry I was already taken by a freaking awesome June guy he's a bit crazy and he scares me sometimes wait so this is a domestic abuse situation right but I am his queen he's my whole world flirt with me and the beast inside him will awake and they'll never find your body oh [ __ ] I had no idea that if someone born in June I was an unstable spouse abusing murderer thanks Facebook the film glosses over some very important details that are either not explained or make no sense so I'm just going to list all the logistical problems this movie has so that we can get past them and focus on the conditions [Music] but the worst plot hole of the movie is entirely unforgivable where is all the rabbit poop do you have any idea how often a rabbit poops the average rabbit poops 100 small pellets a day and yet these floors are completely spotless I can forgive the rest of these problems mr. peel but rabbits without rabbit poop is one step too far my friend the lack of rabbit droppings in this movie is a complete farce and I shall not have it so what are the specific conditions the Wilson family is facing first let's talk about location the plot takes place in Santa Cruz a small city just south of San Francisco the cabin that the family stays at appears to be on a lake because every shot shows land on the other side the water is also far kamar than the ocean usually is and finally these water scenes were all filmed on Lake Gregory just east of Los Angeles there is no good candidate near Santa Cruz for which Lake the cabin exists on so the lake and cabin are assumedly fictional what's confusing is that they drive into Santa Cruz from the east at the start of the film as the water is on the left when they're trying to escape they drive into Santa Cruz again but this time from the West their cabin and the lake are somewhere near Santa Cruz but because of this we can't pin down exactly where they are it was important to figure out if the cabin was actually on the ocean because if it were the family could have escaped on the boat unfortunately that's not the case now let's talk about the tethered themselves they share the soul of the person on the surface which gives the tethered some vague psychic knowledge about them they seem to know the location of their double for example they also possess the same skill set Gabe can drive the family boat and as a result so can Abraham the twins are very acrobatic and so are they're tethered this even applies to physical strength and cardiovascular fitness as the daughter's tethered can run just as fast as she can the tethered are unable to speak English but do communicate in a way suspiciously similar to Michael key the tethered are somewhat resistant to pain but they're still vulnerable to a mortal wound every single one of them is armed with a pair of golden scissors because of the scene where Pluto attempts to kill the family with fire we know that they won't exclusively use scissors if they find a better way to kill you speaking of killing you the tether do seem exclusively interested in killing their surface double when Umbra chases Zora they get interrupted by a mustache but Umbra initially ignores him only when he really bothers her does Umbra kill him this is illustrated again when the tethered homeless man kills his double afterwards he doesn't bother anyone else but simply waits for the rest of the tether to form the line this suggests that the tethered are only interested in killing their surface double and won't attack anyone else unless they interfere somehow their goal is specifically to replace the person on the surface not wage war against all surface people in general their secondary goal is to recreate the Hands Across America event and at the end of the film they do appear to succeed their success gives us a good approximation of how many tethered there actually are the average wingspan of an adult human is roughly 5 feet and 7 inches if you take a horizontal line across the United States starting in Santa Cruz which is where the West End starts the distance across the United States is approximately 2,500 miles we're in the rising gaining elevation is mostly negligible using these numbers it would take at least two point three six million adults in order to hold hands across the contiguous United States so there are at least that many tethered since they appear to have completed the Hands Across America event by morning and their first goal was to kill their surface double that means the tethered have killed at least two point three six million people by the end of the film the footage of the line seems to indicate that all the remaining tethered are required to form it as the Wilson family don't encounter any of them on the streets of Santa Cruz nor do they see any on their drive down to Mexico the tethered invade the surface somewhere within a 12 hour period but not simultaneously the first we see is the homeless man on the beach who kills his double and then heads for the start of the line sometime past 2:30 p.m. the main tethered family emerges at 11:11 p.m. and several hours after that the tethered of the Tyler family strikes although a delayed calls the cops and they say they're 14 minutes away let's call the cops I did they're 14 minutes away what 14 minutes they never do arrive which indicates that either the tethered eliminated the cops before they could get there or the cops got sidetracked by either 9-1-1 calls caused by the tethered either way most of the tethered attacked within this 12 hour time frame the news report they watched seems to indicate that by the time they've dispatched the tethered Tyler family the invasion is well underway and by morning they've completed the Hands Across America event that's a comprehensive breakdown of the conditions of the scenario that the Wilson family is facing now let's move some love by clicking the link below there are only a few possible solutions to us and this mostly due to the surprise and speed of the attack millions of tethered invade the surface in the span of a few hours with no warning whatsoever most would be killed as they slept or before they had a real chance to fight back even if they were awake I expect that coming face-to-face with someone who looks just like you would be distracting enough that most people would let their guard down upon encountering their tethered oh my god it's a clone now neither of us will be virgins the Wilson family is the exception however red doesn't want to just kill them she wants them to suffer to show them that the tethered are just as competent as they are because of this the Wilsons are able to trick or evade Reds family and escape onto the boat as far as I'm concerned this is the first time in the movie that the Wilson family has the ability to make informed decisions they're not aware of what's happening until Reds family already has them cornered but due to a series of very lucky circumstances they all make it out alive and regroup at the boat so what actions should they take at this point in the film they go for the obvious move which is to go to their friend's house for help but since the cops never arrived at their house after they called them they should know that some larger event is happening so knowing this what should the Wilson family do I think the solution that makes the most sense is a paper fortune-teller the tethered have some kind of psychic link to the surface people that lets them hone in on their location when they invade but that doesn't necessarily mean that it works immediately or that they know precisely where they are the Wilson family run to the Tyler's house and after they defeat the tethered they find there they run into hombre but why does only hombre show up if red knew exactly where they were why didn't she and Pluto come to instead red and Pluto set up an ambush for the Wilsons in the event that they try to escape Santa Cruz my guess is that either the tether don't know exactly where they are or the information they get from the surface people is delayed by some amount of time Umbra showed up alone because red told her to go find out if the Wilson family was at the Tyler's the solution around their psychic connection therefore is to be unpredictable if the Wilsons having escaped Reds family on the boat made a her fortune teller and wrote down four places to hide such as hide under a dock run into the forest hide in someone's boat or circle back and try to get in their own car they could probably evade Reds family until morning at which point all of the tethered would have joined the line and they could steal any car and escape to Mexico they just need to evade Reds family for about 10 hours and then they're home free if they keep their location unpredictable they should be able to escape it would be a lot less risky than having to kill the tethered in the Tyler's house and then having to fight the remainder of Reds family of course there are a few problems here the lake scenes were filmed at Lake Gregory and if we assume that the lake they're on has the same dimensions than they're in trouble because leg Gregory only has a circumference of around two miles Reds family could still find them by sheer luck since two miles isn't a lot of distance to cover escaping into the woods would also be very risky as the houses around the lake are very tightly spaced meaning they'd be in danger of being spotted by other tethered they also don't know that it'll be safe to escape by morning because they don't know about the hands across America event at this point in the movie but as long as they hide for a minimum of 10 hours if they choose to escape anytime after that they will be safe despite these problems I would argue that the paper fortune-teller solution is much more risk of earth than what the Wilson family does in the film and is therefore a better course of action but an even better solution than a paper fortune-teller would be another paper fortune-teller except this time instead of hiding until morning stealing a car and escaping to Mexico the family should instead drive to camp parks or is si Alameda it just so happens that the movie takes place in the same area as bird box and as we found out in the last video there are two active military bases near San Francisco the problem most people faced when the tethered invaded the surface is that the tethered had the element of surprise because most people would be asleep at this time but military bases always have personnel on guard they are also armed with guns not scissors you know I swear that I don't try to do this but in most cases horror movies can be beat by either finding someone with a gun or getting one yourself the point I'm trying to make is that if the heathered attempted to attack an active military base they wouldn't stand a chance therefore the safest and easiest place that the Wilson family could go isn't Mexico it's camp parks it's only an hour away from Santa Cruz the one thing I didn't address in my big list of problems is that if the Wilson family is trying to get to Mexico they'll need to get past the line in this shot the ocean is on the right since Santa Cruz faces south towards the ocean this means that their west of the line in order to reach Mexico they need to get east of the line at the end of the film they seem to be driving to Mexico without any issues so assumedly that means they actually drove through the line and mowed down the tethered with a car at some point it makes driving to camp parks instead of Mexico an even better idea since they won't need to risk playing Red Rover with the people in the red suits once the Wilson family reaches Camp parks they should be completely safe and won't be considered a threat by the base as they're not wearing the red jumpsuit of the tethered who have assumingly been attacking him all night and while we're on the subject the tethered may have succeeded in mass murder and recreating the Hands Across America event but in no way does that mean they're going to survive on the surface for very long once again they are armed with scissors and they have just accidentally declared war on the American military did you know that the US military has 1.3 million active-duty troops and another 800 65,000 unreserve that means that the estimated two point three six million tethered armed with scissors in wearing bright red jumpsuits are now going to have to fight 2.1 million american soldiers supported by the most bloated military industrial complex on the planet keep in mind that the government created the tethered so they have a vested I would be amazed at the tethered survival on the surface for even three weeks regardless of what the Wilsons do the tethered will not be a threat for very long but in a short term their best option would be to head to the one place that is completely safe from the tethered and it's only an hour's drive away to confirm this I actually called camp parks to see if they would agree unfortunately most of the questions I asked them were classified for security reasons how many trained military personnel are like permanently stationed at Camp art however they did have this to say and in the movie the main character is try to get to Mexico it's the way out but to me that makes no sense because why would they go through the people when they should just head north and head for the closest place of safety which to me can't Park sounds like a really great destination but the best solution by far would completely avoid the invasion of the tethered and would end the crisis before it even begins as already mentioned Adelaide the main character of the film is in fact one of the tethered but she switched with her surfaced double red when they were children therefore Adelaide is completely aware of the tether and that her service double is living amongst them she even tells her husband about red in this scene my whole life I'm coming so Adelaide has an in its sense that red is coming for her there are other things she says two things that she shouldn't actually know game they've been planning this they have the upper hand how does she know they've been planning this and how does she know to immediately call the police the second Reds family appears outside their house why does she insist that they leave before dark the night when the invasion is going to take place we leave before dark what I'm suggesting here is that Adelaide is still gaining information through the tether she is one of the tethered so it makes that she should know what the original is up to and if Adelaide knows that red is coming for her it makes sense for her to kill rent way before any of this happens she says that she has felt her whole life that red is coming for her so if she knows this why did she never preemptively kill red it would be incredibly easy for her to procure guns and ammunition on the surface go down to the underground at Santa Cruz and kill red this would have solved all of Adelaide's problems and inadvertently would have stopped the invasion - because without red the invasion never would have happened as long as she kills red before red plans for the invasion the tethered never would have attacked the entire situation would be entirely avoided so Adelaide just needs to find red and kill her even if the tethered tried to protect red remember they are armed with at most scissors Adelaide could buy a full suit of armor in an ak-47 and just go to town down there especially in those narrow hallways if Adelaide is able to kill red the crisis could be entirely averted but if you think that you have a better idea if you think you have an even better way to beat the tethered from us
