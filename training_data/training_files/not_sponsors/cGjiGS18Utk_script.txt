Kevin Stefanski obviously got outdueled by Robert Salah in a blistering fashion I'd say this past weekend right I mean D coordinator for the 49ers Robin Salah Kevin Stefanski offensive coordinator for the Vikings they're playing against each other the Haslam's in the Browns organization and D Podesta released the fact that these two are basically the finalists for the head coaching gig so everybody's watching you know that's thinking that they have to speak about these types of things like okay here is a perfect layout of who's gonna win hey who's gonna win who's gonna win the head coaching gig right here that's what everybody soon so then once the fan ski gets hired after Kirk Cousins in the boys so very very average against sulles defense it was obviously a bit eyebrow-raising and my eyebrow was also raised because to be honest and to be completely candid I had no idea who the guy was I did not know that was his name I thought he was a handsome guy who calls plays for the Vikings but I've never looked past Zimmer for some reason I think it's just my amateur mindset I've never really dug deep into who the Vikings offensive coordinator is that's just not something now maybe like the Chiefs offensive coordinator I would be intrigued by the enemy but I thought Andy Reid always did a lot of things but then I learned no be enemies calling a lot of the place I'm like you know what that makes sense then that I would want to look for that particular offensive coordinator never in my life what did I go the Vikings offensive coordinator that's the guy I don't think any of us did there is a public meltdown at the beginning of a season because of the Vikings offense the Kirk Cousins show was number one on all of the internet worldwide because he had to apologize to Adam Thielen because the offense wasn't working and Adam Thielen got upset about then that led to Stefon Diggs who a video released of him telling her cousins and have force bottom relax so I guess his a much better guy than what a lot of people are saying and I didn't say he's a bad guy so it was interesting he threw his helmet while up anyways he almost quit didn't show up to practice can find $250,000 because this office was working now the offense did get hot from there I believe it started rolling tor cousins started looking like great quarterback they get to win against Dallas they went against the Saints massive victory on Kurt cousins arm so I can understand that that but for me the Vikings offense coordinator isn't like the the desirable human here now from what we're learning now is D Podesta the guy that's running the Cleveland Browns out of California last year he wanted to hire mr. Stefanski over Freddie kitchens but Haslem who's the owner of the team in Cleveland said no I'm taking Freddie kitchen that was a massive failure d Podesta gets his guy now they're gonna search for a GM and everybody saying Andrew berry is the guy now I know Andrew berry Andrew barrer was a scout for the Colts whenever Jim Caldwell was the head coach and Bill Polian he's his quarterback from Harvard and he is a legit dude legit dude relatable intelligent can speak well knows his stuff like even when things weren't going great he was around for the quotes for a little bit even when things weren't going great the guy was always a straight shooter a guy you could trust he's probably gonna be hired as the GM then and you know who I think he probably would have had a little bit of a saying yeah as his first GM position he's young I thought he should have got the GM job from the coach there when I was open to be honest he was like 20-something years old I was like oh my god the Colts are about to hire like the youngest GM in history because I thought Andrew berry was gonna get the job that's how impressed I was with Andrew berry as a human and everything like and everybody that meets him feels the exact same way that's like Andrew berends legit but now Andrew berry gets his first GM gig probably and they're not allowing him to pick his own coach which is very interesting right because now you're forcing a relationship even though Andrew bears good guy probably get along with Kevin very very well I'm assumed that GM would like to have a little bit of a say and I honestly believe and I was told that nobody knows how his health is at which I did I hope isn't the case but Jim Caldwell was my coach for the Annapolis quotes he was a good coach man he gets a bad rap because he was so boring to watch on the sidelines I mean he was dry milk on that side I mean there was but that was him though he was a business he took it as hey we did our job let's go he never got too high on the highs are too low on the lows he had to talk to me when I got in trouble and it was like a it was one of the best conversations I've ever been a part of it was I was always a big Jim Caldwell fan but he got a nasty reputation up there in Detroit because he was boring and didn't show emotion was like yeah but behind the scenes I think he's respected like that he was very well respected in our facility and now we sucked a year and he was gone for a whole new staff and Andrew Luck became the star quarterback and Peyton Manning went to Denver and all that he went to Detroit and they didn't win the Super Bowl for did the Detroit Lions but I think he won like nine games ten games he won nine games and they're like get him the hell out of here Jim Caldwell is a guy that I think would do very well as a coach for the Cleveland Browns not that's the fancy one I don't know the guy I just admitted I don't really know much about the guy well hello there get $20 off your first order from seeking now back to the magic but Jim Caldwell was the type of guy I thought they were gonna hire like a an older guy who has instant credibility with a little bit of a flex because it feels like you got a brand-new first time head coach again is he gonna be able to handle that Freddie kitchens was unable to handle it was obvious there was the most penalized team and documented history I mean they were dead there was just so much going on off the field that the field didn't even matter anymore let alone the thought let's remember a guy took off another guy's helmet and we'll see oh I have to see obviously this how this all works but for me I didn't I did not expect it I thought at least Isola would get it because of the dominating performance other Niners know once the fancy gets in I'm like alright here we go Brown's being a Browns again digs the dog pound doesn't deserve this if this doesn't work out I think Dog Pound knows they got a run right here yeah I mean obviously we don't know how it works out it could be a great hire but just from the initial reactions of everyone no one's surprise I mean this is just the Browns and I there's rumors going around that he got hired because he agreed to three-hour meetings with Jimmy has them on Monday what what is going on it said hours long meetings hey I want you to know when you walk into this meeting this is gonna be out if we get everything done in the first 10 minutes doesn't matter you know how they used to say thousand word minimum and whatever in your essays and you could have done it in what twenty does that's what this meeting is we're going to talk for at least a hundred and twenty minutes you hear me and if we go to a slew of hours that's how it'll go does Jimmy has him think his input in the games is the reason why they're not doing well it's it's so weird that's awesome if that's the case because if he thinks it's because this is this is awesome this is if Haslam thinks his football IQ not being implemented weekly is the reason why the Browns haven't been good I love the guy I love it's so weird that's a case because he came from a minority owner of the Steelers and you haven't heard from the Rooneys participating in any football operations since they took over the team it's just owners when the owners get involved it's never really a good thing unless you're Jerry well I mean they Jerry put together a hell of a team down there I don't know how much more Jerry's doing he's Jerry doing all of it still no his son Steven does a lot of it yeah he Stevens always right there next to you no never behind him always next to him that's a sign hey cuz you have a little bit behind that means hey the leader the wolf pack's right here Bell Steven seems to be right next to him like in his booth and all that stuff you know they've got people that his suite by the way is what the most of you have no idea it's good they're always partying whenever we play down there Papa John's was up at all please give a Dallas hello to Papa it was on like that 85 yard Jumbotron Papa John sir Payton wise was he a rare Pig
