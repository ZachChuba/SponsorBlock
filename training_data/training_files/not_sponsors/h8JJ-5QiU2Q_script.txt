hi I'm Annabel trades and a few weeks ago I shared with you the story behind how I came to be keeping bees currently and this week I'm going to show you how we harvested our honey for the year using this centrifuge this is from vivo it can be ordered on Amazon I will have a link for that below and before we get support creating awesome videos like this in my head we have the vivo electronic honey extractor we have a heat dish which is basically warming the whole honey cavern there's cauldron let's call it a cauldron and it's going to basically keep the honey nice and supple in there so that it can float out we have jars a canning receptacle to make it so that no one honey escapes we have a sieve or sim pronounced we have extra jars we have a heat gun and we're gonna be using this instead of a hot knife so lots of experiments going on but I think it's all gonna work out just great this frame is not actually very full of honey at all but it has a few little things that make it much easier to explain what we're doing here so this is foundation this is just wax that is printed out in a factory somewhere and then the bees start to draw out their own honeycomb on that and basically we want to leave as much of the honeycomb intact as possible because it takes the beast time every year to draw out that honeycomb so in the idea behind heating it instead of cutting this part is basically we're just opening up those caps and allowing the honey to flow out so like I said this is a bit of an experiment but if we can keep more of this intact we'll be able to get more out of the bees next season around so you can see we have two different sized supers here we have a deep super and medium super and the way the centrifuge is laid out it allows us to do eight little ones at a time but only four big ones at a time and the four big ones have to be actually flipped so we're going to start with the little ones and just get a hang of the process before we go ahead and move to the bigger ones let's go right in there and let's give it a [Music] so the instructions I was given for this thing was basically to let it run on a low speed for about five minutes before I actually put it up to full speed just make sure everything's fully balanced but you'll also notice I haven't bolted down to a piece of plywood so I can actually stand on here so it doesn't get too shaky ramp it up a little bit oh I can feel it starting this shirt so this is a slightly different color than the other honey so this was probably from a different time in this season or the bees were harvesting from a different spot but anyway it'll be interesting to give it a little taste these ones we have to do like I said the opposite way so we're gonna have to put these in like this and then flip them but no problem there so you might see there's a bit of a scene change now as it turns out the heat gun approach did not really work out very well so instead I consulted one of my beekeeping friends and he said actually just to scrape off the outside so we are going to do just that we're gonna scrape off the outside of the comb and then we will just drain this through a sieve or sieve however you want to say it and then we'll have honey for leftover from that and then wax leftover from that and then it should spin out of these a little bit better too so here we go for take two you think now that literally everything I own is sticky starting slow I've got the heater on heating this up it's nice and toasty in this room oh I can hear it hitting the sides of the machine oh whoa it certainly smells like honey in here so that's glorious so the end result of all of that is obviously not just one jar we're probably gonna have about two gallons by the time we're finished processing at all but this delicious honey and then beeswax and basically to get the beeswax from the honey you strain it as you saw me doing and then you boil it and you can purify it further but I actually just boil it and then pour it into little forms and use these as little pucks to lubricate my hand playing Souls what are they use for these bees wax pucks that's especially prevalent around here is soap making so I use my goat milk and beeswax and other things that I've created here on the farm to make my own soap and if you're going to be producing soap for other people you probably want to refine your beeswax more but I don't really care if there's a little extra gristle in myself so here we go two awesome things that are result of keeping bees not to mention the fact that our entire garden and and farm has been pollinated by these awesome friendly little beasts as I mentioned at Squarespace comm slash and of all trades for a 10% discount so thank you so much for taking the time to watch this video for supporting this channel if you would like to support me on patreon as well always the link for that is below for a couple more weeks there are fluffy calendars available on website the link that is also below thank you so much I hope you leave this video feeling challenged and inspired to get outside and to make things with your own hands as well Cheers
