yeah they turned into sand oh i see didn't you see all the fire you [ __ ] idiot it's like what happened to constantinople is that a a parachute or a life vest rotates objects how do i i love that you could do this [ __ ] it's so fun look now it's a telescope you're like the macgyver of your time you'll need this for the rest of your journey wait what was the point so i can do this to pretty much anything now don't let that power go to your head boy let me out of here it's dangerous this game rocks you could throw it but you didn't break it you should have thrown it harder i'm sorry wait you can have that's a weird icon just realistic human hands i know what a p.o.s first interact with them then move the mouse there was a handle oh i got the handle tab to open you really got a handle on all of this yes thank you lyle come on yes oh no beetlejuice then the sand worm comes out she's got a runic sundial on her arm yeah if you walk too far from the plane the sand worm's going to come i love when games model the vagina inside the clothes what is that a common thing yeah you can you can tell they also modeled all the poop in her pants and in her distance you've got a poop meter and it's just a hyper realistic thing even though you can't see it there's a there's a full track like intestinal tract with little poops floating through it yeah my vision sucks and if you get close enough to it there's directional audio of that song that's like oh staying in direct sunlight we'll give you skincare sorry i'm sorry sorry i feel bad now so this is a horror game where the sun is a bad thing oh god sure are you shaded now i hope i don't know i'm just gonna follow shade i guess so i never like played the original amnesia but is that thing that looks like homer simpson is that still about i don't know i like i said i watched somebody play this about 10 years ago it was our first classic let's play it's what shot us to stardom to begin with it was no worry it was a big let's player game though open the chest wow so what am i doing with you anything yeah move all this useless fuel out of the way get the [ __ ] out of here now you got a nice box to sleep yeah was there a point of that maybe it was just showing you how to open chests what am i hearing i'm pissing myself wait i think there's crabs that noise is coming from everywhere you're going nuts man or it could be you like boiling i'm not sure that's your skin boiling my eardrums are turning into popcorn oh i feel like you're real [ __ ] nanny now oh look what i found a clue well it's just a okay it's a floor detail there's like clearly signs of here look at that like that the big stone thing hide your wasps in here um there's a big slab kind of awkwardly in there what is this stoneware bowl what is the point of all this oh adobe parts just for me you can't put any of this in your inventory can you like you did with the little no okay this is just environmental storytelling what about that thing that looks useful check this out [ __ ] what he finished oh that is a cave why is the one object you can't identify the one you assumed was useful there was a scary monster everything else was obviously not look what i found oh postcard i don't want to listen to you the smells in the funny things and it smells it stinks it's amazing oh wait there's another thing who's that chief people wrangler that sounds like a job are we searching for her pieces of tomar's beard they will keep you safe i made it to the cave you guys oh you get to you're rewarded with this little baby just look at their hands christopher here's the death grip on that babito when you have a baby you always massage its spine until it dies it's not a thing why not you massage its spine until it grows longer and longer yeah the more you massage the spine i'm scared what do i do you don't want to do it too much though because then you end up with a baby snake go toward that there's light oh it's it's just a little hole this is a very pretty game isn't it i could do without this [ __ ] [ __ ] i'm sorry i got stitches oops looks like my uncle jimmy even the big gash in his side especially the big gash in his side would you think she was already dead by the time this happened this is all just hell well one my uncle jimmy's a man and he's still alive i meant in the story you think it's gonna pull lost maybe didn't didn't the people who wrote lost even say like uh we we don't know what was going on with that [ __ ] show jj abrams i think so yeah he's like ah it's my mystery box my mystery box he's like purgatory and then he was like they're not in purgatory and then he's like i don't know if they're in purgatory i saw a twit like a fan twitter account about lost the other day just appear in the wild what something angry at it it's just bizarre it was just a weird thing to see but something ends badly i don't understand how it can yeah you're right you got a match give me a bottle i'm sure you have a really interesting backstory but we'll never figure out what it is i don't give a rat i just want to see a cool spooky monster i can't get it all invested in a story with youtube bozos how are you supposed to get invested if you don't know about your tragic past i love reading in french or wherever it's touchy tonya and her picture of a baby they're a really good artist yeah whoever drew this and not the title screen you did a great job but they did the title screen too well if you did then take take those two things add them together then divide by two and that's how good of a job you did that's [ __ ] that's mean it said there were like lanterns or something oh try lighting that with your matches this is too much [ __ ] all at once yeah it's a pretty big exposition i feel like they're trying to space it out so that it doesn't feel as big but it's yeah it's big i don't feel like they're spacing it out at all like you went into exposition cave and then they they were just like spaced out in the sense that there's like interactivity between it i guess versus just a long cut scene but it's like here's 93 books and you might as well get as many lights out of this burning down match until it hurts your fingers it destroys your finger there you go oh it's very quick yeah games like this usually they're like all about the limited resources so assume that you're not going to get matches too often oh i'm scared should i let it match is right as well is there a lantern somewhere that you can light and uh yeah you're good that that there's there's light you could keep going okay can you grab that torch not long ago yeah i would just steal this whole pyre i guess it's pretty big and heavy you don't want to see what's on that bloody note uh okay you know what when you say it like that i went to see my mama at the market but he has no more work until next week i know that tassie has savings and i know that something will come but it is hard it's definitely like metaphorical why would you crash in the desert and then find stuff in a cave that's all about yourself what's causing the scary blue light i don't know go towards the blue light source i think oh my god if you find a blue meanie in this cave you could just push or they have a match whatever you're doing well enough without it i'm not sure crawling into the evil i heard a scary thing try to light as many as you can oh oh [ __ ] you gotta walk slower with that oh a [ __ ] scarab off that bites you you're gonna turn into a skeleton i know what you do i saw the mummy that's a big boy okay so you have like a stationary hide ability i love you big bug look at that that is a big bug that's a baby it's bigger than your hands yeah i hope you don't bite it oh oh he's clipping into you you're becoming one i can't get up you're gonna have scarab hands soon you're so big i can't get up fusion is almost complete chris get up all right that was scary you almost became a beetle borg there you could use your remaining match [ __ ] that's not good don't move around too much move slow oh my god it's burning so fast come on damn it oh god okay you got your blue oh that increases your fear what's that okay oh is that a real torch can you pick it up is it something no it sure looks like something mute it's got a rock on it oh you got more matches at least damn man they come they go real quick maybe you do get a good amount of them and they just they're a resource you gotta like use because it was telling you you get you get a good fright when you uh oh when you're in the dark too long candle what is that oh is the idea that if you had a candle you could place it there i don't understand i guess it looks like you lit a vigil for those lips oh i guess it's just a little oil lamp that you lit i can jump okay there you go okay there's super mario wow that's not you can't i guess not yeah just a little square i think you're getting scared in here yeah yeah this is bad for your sanity i am scared oh oh put it back put it back i'm scared i'm scared i hear your brain boiling again oh my god oh that's like a shadow [ __ ] you're an upright shadow can i burn you can i no what's through that looks like a little man you can open the door look what i found ah it's just the creepy creature i pray to you live what's that little strip that it was letting you look dude holy mother hear my plea uh see that's the length of letter that i like yeah that was easy to read this is where we reveal i've been illiterate this entire time you've been faking it pretty good though you've had some pretty good guesses look more matches okay oops only two that's a pot scare more of a bull scare okay tomorrow okay tomorrow pray to it please uh what the pretty please pretty please don't let me get scared before chris okay that's a traditional jewish prayer pity please what the [ __ ] that's scary you could have closed it and barred the door that would be a good place to escape to it's the wind it's the wind the wind is scary you light another match now oh my [ __ ] god oh anyone hello hello jesus [ __ ] christ she scared me it's dizzy my thoughts exactly she needs to learn from master chief and shut the [ __ ] up yeah and it makes me less scared i do think that there is like something a little bit like i'm not scared right now but the character is freaking out and it kind of makes me like not care that's exactly what i mean yeah hearing her talk is if anything makes it less scary just because it's a human voice and that's comforting yeah that's a really good way of putting it no oh buddy [Laughter] can you light a match what am i doing moving toward that line go towards the grain that's got to be shrek shrek don't let it rise or let it rise okay i'm [ __ ] dead those stupid crabs won't get out of my ear i kind of want like abe for maybe odyssey to show up and do a flip he doesn't do a flip well he would here okay because gravity would be less on earth what oh my god what the hell is wrong with me i've got worms in my hand what the hell is wrong with i need to stop drinking is that really my first time noticing that uh yep god i'm pasty you want to mine some ore oh dude that'd be epic why are you shaking there's something to it it's vibranium unless it's that's not on purpose i can't tell if that's on purpose or not black panther it seemed like she was reacting to it like what is this stuff the element of [ __ ] i think there is some sort of weird physical phenomenon don't stand in the dark too much sorry dude except don't stand in the sun too much either yeah she's real picky huh she picks her ass she's real ass picky i guess those floating rocks are on purpose unless this game is just ass i'm glad it's on purpose things that are on purpose are way more fun things that are on accident are still stupid when did you get that she's had that she's had that since she got off the plane really yeah it better point me towards cool stuff oh [ __ ] that looks like uh pressy to bring out or put away the amulet oh we should bring it to joffrey bring me the amulet the amulet of kings uh oh okay yellow is the color of p so that means you should be more afraid now oh okay what's that you just walked into the gross dimension the poiple dimension okay if someone gave you an amulet that was like i don't know like this big and they were like if you keep this amulet on your desk for three years i'll give you a thousand dollars would you do it yeah why not because it would occupy space on your desk for three years for how much money again a thousand dollars oh for a thousand dollars no death space is important to me that is the thing right it would be like almost to nothing inconvenience but if you spread it out across three years it might actually it would just get on your [ __ ] nerves yeah so really just depends on how thirsty you are for a thousand bucks yeah push little baby don't be shy daddy's gonna plant a plant in your eye and if it comes out of your brain that he's gonna fly away to spain [Laughter] daddy will breathe right up your nose alas the plant so big it grows [Laughter] if only he looked more into this [ __ ] daddy probably would not have done it oh i don't need to light you someone's been here stop saying that i don't think even in the first game the guy talks does he no i don't think so he just goes i think he just walks around in a [ __ ] like labyrinth of stone yeah they're really trying to pile a lot of story into this and it's just kind of like i don't have any problem with that but the talking really doesn't help with the uh the atmosphere i don't think the whole point of this game is to be spookity and to feel alone no because it made the ground drop out from under you i shouldn't have done that dude that's the experience of women every day in america you shut your [ __ ] mouth ooh what is going on with this place is this really what it is like being a woman in america i mean this is just what it is this is exactly what it's like for a woman in the workplace can someone please turn down the ac in here my arms are cold my arms are cold i love that that that's our bit where we've swapped bodies with a woman for a day and then finally we understand oh you don't want to go through that little crevice oh i love going through crevices but that's just that's just me as a man that'd be the funniest porn premise ever if the woman's like oh oh wait actually let's look at this first wow what is that jpeg off in the distance i feel like i would have related to her more if she said something more human like wtf is that thing yeah erm kind of random but okay she would have said that a big tear in the sky yeah or like bruh and three laughing crying face emojis but okay yeah la mao who made this oh that thing's holding a goddamn ball of sorts i like this oh my god oh sniffing creature is about with a violin i like the uh sound design though so sorry like love crafty and looking world yeah i like it i like that the sound effects and music aren't just generic [ __ ] i've heard a million times push you push it come on this is cool i feel like i'm on a big scary adventure what was it going to say the porn premise where a girl's just like oh it's so hard being a woman if only a man [ __ ] knew and then it's like freaky friday and they both have to learn how to like you know be each other but instead the man just sits in bed fingering himself all day isn't that what happened in uh the rob schneider movie the hot [ __ ] i don't think he sits in bed fingers crossed it would be way funnier though it's one of those movies that's almost so [ __ ] it's good i i haven't seen it in a long time and i don't have any urge to rewatch it but i was gonna say like i like freaky friday better but the hot chick is probably one of the better rob schneider features it probably is the best one honestly all right i know we've all got them in our wallets pull out your rob schneider top tens all right uh the animal is that ten deuce bigelow two is that nine do you speak a little one is that eight uh i forget all of this you forgot that's scary that is scary i'm losing it the amnesia is finally getting here it's crawled through the tv screen remember 10 rob schneider movies please help me thing help me remember rob his beautiful blue eyes i'll appear you chris watch the real rob season four i don't think it even got the season two yeah it's really weird that the final episode of real rod railroad real rob is like his brother steals money from his bank account and it was the first time that there was ever kind of a relatable human thing that happened in the whole show he saved it and it actually gets you kind of invested how [ __ ] angry he gets and then that was the final episode you probably should have started episode one with that did it leave on a cliffhanger kinda yeah so we're never gonna know if fictional rob schneider gets reimbursed i don't know damn oh this is just ripping off everything i've ever done let's do a yeah yes it seems like there is like none of the hiding elements or anything really matter in this part of the game well we haven't even seen a [ __ ] creature yet well we saw a creature we saw we saw our first creature yeah but we haven't been skittered at by a critter there's been area critter scattering oh my god it scared me do we want to keep going down or are we going towards something i don't know bro i led me down here are those lamps or those those wumbo plants no those are oh there's one bows damn it the wizzy wombo doesn't that kind of look like a breast with a nipple on top i'm getting a little bit horny just at the prospect nibbles top 10 landmarks that make me go wow a whoa guy uh i don't think that's important let's get this whole thing out oh no more reading wait a second that's feces yuck when you wipe your ass with the same tissue so much it gets holes in it relatable my face one hello pot get out of here no that's a pot scare yes i went from wind music to mayan music how do you know what mayan music sounds like oh i've been to maya oh we're about to be our first noticer noticer yep oh because they're telling you to sneak so they not to be noticed i got you you will get it noticed tm that's the new the new mechanic this game came up with was the notice the notice system i love the notice system oh oh there it is the great noticer notice me please he looks like he's faced away oh he's looking to do some no is he even live or is that like a frozen thing oh is it breathing or is it like no that's that's a stone man that would never notice you christ it's like uh pompeii criminy i don't want to be pomped she took the christ's name in vain oh what happened to you poor [ __ ] guy oh [ __ ] he got noticed to death dude i think there's a t-rex what happened to that i don't know here here's a tip go on youtube and look up uh pompeii song it's like the coolest song ever it's like they don't mean okay you think this is supposed to be pompeii no they're they're and that's why there's ash everywhere and everyone's no i don't think it's supposed to be literally pompeii okay how scared would you be though if a volcano started chasing you i'd freaking freaking if a volcano just like stood up and lifted its tiny little legs out from under its volcano skirt and started running at you oh yeah homer that's a great visual i'm honestly kind of impressed he painted a picture with his words better than the title screen of this game see remember that disney pixar short lava yeah that big volcano is just being a big [ __ ] loser and singing yeah you say that but if that was trying to eat you you'd be [ __ ] terrified if you lift it up and skirt and ran at me i'd [ __ ] scream that'd be way [ __ ] more creative than that thing just knowing that that thing was like alive would be kind of unsettling if you were close enough to it it can move its mouth really quickly if you look at it yeah oh they're praying to a [ __ ] to a jalapeno pepper can i get on here excuse me and pepper or is that a poop oh great spicy oh it's moving it's like a little alien larvae it's a yeah it's a pepper worm i want to just reach out and eat that well something's charging a laser beam yeah you might want to sneak a little more sneakily it sounds like a train or something oh did you see that yeah it was like a phantom in the wind there you go that's looking like work oh what what oh my god jesus you're freaking you're freaking uh what do i do is it because you're looking at something oh yeah can you not look directly at it was that a thing in the original amnesia you couldn't look at homer yeah did the thing really look like homer it did it looks like homer if you like tore off his little like brown muzzle and then it just had like teeth you think one of these guys is gonna be a monster oh yeah like it's gonna move i never got that far in the original i was too scared i got to that water thing and then i just couldn't progress and i got too frightened certainly not that thing they're all like looking directly at you better go that way oh it's the engine this is like a donnie darko thing hey you can't bring up a movie you just watched why not do you just watch that yeah because you're being you're being disingenuous people will think that was a cool remark and that you're clever but you're just lying the jet engine was a whole big plot device from danny darko though oh you're just lying again this is one of your [ __ ] metaphors tomorrow god damn it looks into cribs responding to the metaphorical oh look it's the monkey look this is kind of what i've been looking forward to the entire game we can stop playing now right you guys don't want to want to not ruin the monkey part for me i'd appreciate it yeah this monkey won't rotate okay commune check this out right into the crib [Laughter] whoa i was 16 i think and i must have driven him crazy um he said it was so i would always find my way home i wish i knew him better so do don't look at that oh wow dude this isn't amnesia this is remembering this is in fact the complete opposite of amnesia tomorrow where are we on this map in lithuania my family my family's from lithuania oh really yeah at least my dad's side is are they from mobile are they from velos mobile lithuania are they from polotec i actually don't know which city are they from carolina where is this this is all made up countries these don't exist yeah tomorrow you just lied about being from the shire i did not lithuania is a real place that's middle-earth yeah i'm sure this is where frodo starts all the way up there you actually moved to kiev though frodo no my family moved to kiev by the way tobar that whole donnie darko bed i was trying to start like fake drama oh i wasn't really actually implying that [ __ ] i didn't think you were you're always trying to start fake drama for views chris he put the chair in the crib ah a precious memory i need to get out of here it's getting too real let me out you could totally open that oh yeah i can't take it i bet there's just gonna be a normal ordinary house on the other side of that door nothing weird oh my god ah go to singzo go to singzo the loud this is just a longer version of the same room hey you can't do that no no baby grab it before it disappears no no our baby has become liquid my wife she named her baby annie isn't that a spice no i was just thinking it sounded like anus i will call you anus it's a shame she melted before she could get bullied at school where's my baby be funny if the baby from rugrats was towering over you who made this stupid house the woman says oh my god oh it is the jane baby but it's not the one that says i'm hot come here baby i love giant 3d baby fetuses i would never buy property near that [Laughter] it would bri it would bring your property taxes beautiful the decor is spotless but i just i think we're gonna pass because of the giant floating fetus the giant fleeting focus did you know that uh in japan you can get like a ghost house for free really yeah you're saying they're people that superstitious that you that they just give away haunted houses i think it's kind of like it's kind of superstition and culture but both things that it's kind of like weird to own a house that someone's like died or committed suicide in so there there's straight-up houses in japan that they just give to people for free if they're willing to take them [ __ ] i want one of those i'll take it yeah i kind of although it's even cooler if it's a real ghost house yeah that's [ __ ] metal they're japanese ghosts too those things don't [ __ ] around not like our [ __ ] ghosts yeah i want to like run into some weird like like eyeball rectum ghost or like an umbrella head ghost it'd build character for sure i'm really impressed with the caves in this game usually caves and games look like [ __ ] you have to put in a lot of work to make them look good why is that i don't know it's just like putting a bunch of rock thinking together it just doesn't usually look very good yeah i guess you got to put a lot of work to make sure there's a lot of variance in the rocks you're putting together so it doesn't look like a copy-pasted thing you're right i feel like this is the highest budget they've ever worked with just because of how well their first few games did yeah they they really went all out you said the second one was called like pig mania or something it was called like a machine for pigs oh yeah i remember that but i've never played it that's so that's the extent of my knowledge of a machine for pigs yeah nothing burns in this world you notice that you guys want to know a funny word for a bundle of sticks what's that you better say the funniest word i know it's a thicket oh that's funny i don't know if the thicket it's really a bundle of sticks well maybe i just don't know the word then i didn't think it was notable information anyway i like that joke [Laughter] i like that joke what the hell matches a single match what the hell look at this tiny funny hole i think oh you might want to pull up yeah can you mash out here oh my god what happens if you get a feared to death do you just think about that mask until you die yeah probably i guess technically because this is a metaphor you got this you got this you're close hello little thingy you can just get scared to death oh wow this is pretty come on we're so close i can smell it oh my god this is so freaking scary i'm always smelling on the job oh no that one really went maybe they don't want you to be able to see here are you out i'm out of matches already i can't go down the ladder go down the ladder yeah go ahead go to there silly little oh you took a hit looks like you got regenerating i think as long as you're near a torch you're good oh a goo hole my little lady legs are staying what they used to be these little lady legs just ain't what they used to be [ __ ] yeah none of that for you not using a stupid ladder monkey it's monkey jerry give me my monkey you're in purgatory lady come on that's an old thing they used to do right shove soap and water up their [ __ ] and then shove clothes up their [ __ ] and squash lit it all around use their ute as a washing machine medieval times and the husbands would punch them in the tummy to help yeah it was a profession they had like midwives basically for that you were you'd go to the laundromat and it'd just be like eight ladies in a line and you'd put your articles of clothing in it the jeaners yeah she saw rugrats in paris yeah you said when chucky ran in and said no [Laughter] that was my favorite part of the movie if i was her i would just shut up yeah why are you talking about having children in a death cave [ __ ] one-track minds a lot of them it kind of feels like without her talking people would have realized that nothing's really going on and this is all fillers so far yeah nothing's super happened i mean we're probably going to get [ __ ] because it's like well if you read all 90 of those no i don't [ __ ] care oh there's there's a deadman [Applause] no your love must have ditched you pretty far if this is really him yeah why did he leave you what do i do oh look at those limp wrists you're not missing out on much lady those are beta wrists i heard eyes don't stay closed if you do that they just pop right back open they literally have to put these little cheese grater discs in your eyes that keep your eyes closed yeah yeah they like to just like like when they prepare you for burial yeah yeah they used to just use quarters and stuff when they have a camera you could take a picture of his corpse so it'll last longer or at least that was what my mom told me she's like always wash your hands if you touch money because they put coins on dead body's eyes i was like i really sound like that kinda oh [ __ ] i got a lantern yeah let's get the [ __ ] out of here go go go you smelly woman go oh my god there's all sorts of rocks falling down that's our way that's a way oh my god oh [ __ ] oh are you dead yeah i guess that's it yeah we've really been playing this game for a full hour nothing's happened yeah not once i mean like something just happened but nothing fun's happening we saw a big fetus it's actually a norse uh cultural thing is if someone dies you're supposed to stand over their body and go tomorrow you're a good voice actor you do a better job than her right now well i don't think there's anything wrong with this performance you're okay you're a french what all right oh tomar you're getting deported if you're too much of a [ __ ] i'll do it okay i'm gonna have to act like you guys just died [ __ ] why rat tomar and lyle [Laughter] it's so frustrating that's going to be my whole afternoon i have to record all on my own uh this sucks press a button to continue i want to push the baby's belly button
