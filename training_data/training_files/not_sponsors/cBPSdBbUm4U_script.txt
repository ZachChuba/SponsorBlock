the dual arena remains millions of dollars flow through here every year and the scammers thrive stronger than ever unchallenged by the game's anti-cheating team there's no end in sight this place has festered one of the most toxic communities in online gaming who would have guessed that the people who make their livelihood from manipulation and scamming are the same people that bought for days on end that create death threats against my friends ddosing attacks bombard jeggeks with requests to eliminate their competition and spout racial slurs non-stop a long time ago i made friends with the staker his group of friends taught me how to stake stuff like how to get a guaranteed first hit against an opponent they kept most of their secrets to themselves but we were still friends after one year of skype calls and being friends he scammed me for 250 mil seven years later he has continued with staking all this time he's been in the discord community of stakers and scammers and has come to me with a feeling of regret he says the damage the dual arena has caused is too much today i offer an inside look into the underground scamming scene but first a quick message from today's sponsor expressvpn i've been trying to get an expressvpn sponsorship for some time now because i love the service they provide and have been a paying subscriber for four months expressvpn is the number one rated virtual private network service that allows you to effectively use a different network while on the internet i've used this service a lot because i was recently clanning on teamspeak and if you didn't know people can find out your ip address and where you live when you use teamspeak i prevented them from sending ddos attacks to my network and they were no longer able to pinpoint my physical location expressvpn is the only vpn i found that can allow me to selectively decide which applications on my computer use the vpn and which ones use my local network also i tried to play a free online poker game on my computer i was getting a horrible connection and booted off the table constantly i only had to click a few buttons to set myself up from england and i scored a super fast connection whether it's to watch other shows not available in your country to mask your ip address from malicious people online or to play games at top speeds from anywhere in the world expressvpn has been incredibly helpful to me find out how you can get three months free by clicking the link in the description box below at expressvpn.com kempq now back to the video in a conversation with the guy that scammed me seven years ago he's afraid of his friends because they might threaten him so i hired a voice actor to say what he said in the interview as far as the depth of rwt on runescape as a whole i bet that the monthly trade volume of runescape gold is larger than the payroll of every jagex mod combined it's absurd how much money gets through the rwt funnel on runescape there are specific accounts that are there at the dual arena right now that have sold hundreds of billions and no matter how much you tell on them like if you dm a mod they say why don't you send it to this address and it never gets dealt with if i was a mod i took just one hour a week to run through the dual arena i would have stopped the rwpt problem already anonymous has laid out two key points here number one real world trading makes a lot more money than a jegax salary especially considering for how much jegax makes in revenue per year they pay notoriously low salaries to their employees it all goes to the stakeholders and the employees get sense on the dollar of the total profits it's remarkably small different given where we're at i don't know how it compares mike to like other games you've worked on and stuff it's about it's probably usually mmos i worked on you're looking at maybe 20 of the money that the game makes gets pushed back into the dev team you guys are down low single digits right like it's it's really amazing what this team has done and in the fourth most expensive city in the united kingdom how the hell are they getting away with that the second point is this stuff has gone on for seven or eight years and nothing is being done about it there are specific accounts here that i have recognized myself that are definitely real worlds trading that have no other stats other than to stake with why is the anti-cheating team a thing if pretty much the number one source of real world trade in the game is coming from this area and nothing is being done about it now the next thing i'm going to say i'm not saying as fact just what others have theorized but i'm just going to give you the publicly known information and you can make your own deductions mod jed was a jack x employee that was in the clan reign of terror a clan notorious for their general toxicity in the game and rumored to rig multiple runescape dead man competitions through cyber attacks jed stopped working at jegax in 2018 and has since been investigated by criminal agencies a short while after this message was sent to players that had been hacked for billions of gold paraphrasing it says their gold had been refunded and a jagex employee was dismissed from employment for misuse of moderator privileges this makes sense because almost never in the history of runescape have jagex ever refunded hacked runescape gold this person had two-step verification on his account and somehow still got hacked and when he got refunded he was given back 46 billion gp he's actually a legitimate staker that i think made his money through 50 50 stakes in fact i used to watch his videos eight years ago but why was this guy in particular chosen to be hacked well some people theorized that the scammers at the dual arena took note of how this guy was taking a lot of money and decided to hack his account through misuse of moderator privileges this is the theorized conspiracy that there's collusion between jek's employees and the staking community runefest is an annual gaming convention hosted by the creators of runescape while right after mod jed stopped working at jackax he slipped into the after party of runefest i spoke with him directly and he told me that he didn't do it he was framed i'm skeptical i don't know what to believe but given the fact that people have complained about the dual arena for years and it's still around kind of begs the question who is supporting this going on despite all the evidence of it destroying the game there are a lot of other scandals at jagex i won't talk about mod reach right now but i'm sure many of you are familiar with the story anyway some of these employees get paid barely a livable wage which increases the chances of these scandals but also forces the most valuable members of the jmod team to seek better opportunities elsewhere in fact the lead of the anti-cheating team just quit this might be because of the low salary but more likely i think it's just because jagex doesn't invest in the tech the tech that helps them detect cheating in the game the engines they're working off of are really old and i don't really know much about the back end but it sounds like it's ridiculously difficult to get anything done but with all the revenue they make it only seems like they should do an overhaul of their back-end infrastructure in order to make better automated detection systems will they make the budget for it that's the question and could determine whether or not this game survives runescape's graphics is definitely not what is keeping players around it's the community that is the integral part of the runescape experience and what both retains players and games new ones real worlds trade alone is not why i'm so against this underground community if i was morally outraged at real world trading then i would be making a video about how jagex sells bonds instead i'm against the people that hurt others while they use this game as a source of income bought non-stop send death threats to people that talk about it and conduct cyber attacks against people's personal internet and jagex's servers which happens all the time all right boys if i don't lag it was a coincidence if i lag i'm being targeted okay big stake damn clicking into it and wow wow yeah i'm done i'm not thinking tonight today's i'm not saying i'm being targeted this is stupid okay so this clip here me saying 1.5 bill i already was getting throttled and ddos the second the countdown would start by the time it would get down to like three or two everything would completely freeze up and this only happened on stakes that were one billion plus no matter how much i would spam click no matter how much i would click it would never register that i'm getting a hit so whoever was staking me would always get the first hit wow but in the very first stake i made a mistake and i sat there the whole time spam clicking and because i was getting throttled so bad and the world was lagging every time i would spam click it would re-register that i'm trying to establish a hit and i would never hit the opponent what four or five stakes that always lied the second i would start it somebody was just sitting there on stream and watching the runescape the exact same time just to start lagging the world the second i would click accept on the stake how many times do you think this has happened to you where someone tries to get in a stake with you and then ddos the world so they have an advantage uh this day specifically happened four times there was people that were trying to come up to me and stay you know a lucrative amount two three bill and saying that i only do it in a dragon dagger style which i know for a fact if i'm already lagging i'm already getting throttled on the world yeah that's the worst idea i never did it just because you know in that case i'm just gonna stand there i'm never gonna hit a special attack how many people at the dual arena would you say are real worlds trading their profits i would say 99 if not a little bit more than that bro like i'm scared bro i'm genuinely scared voila we're okay rebel i'm waiting for you to click accept as soon as you click accept them there [Music] bro what the [ __ ] bro i have paid and it's 46 hp 41 i'll take the odds here don't dc no no don't do this to me gagex please just finish him he has 22 hp no way man there are a lot of stakers that high risk with pk scripts like the best you could imagine i guess when you have money to pay for the most optimal setup you spend the money and you're off to a good start i knew people in the dead man mode tournaments with teams of auto hotkey cheats all the same type of things literally bots that grab control of your mouse that can sense whatever id item is in your hand they automatically switch your setups and your prayers to literally fight back with the most optimal setup otoblock staked this guy for 30 mil in a highly skill-based battle little did he know that the guy was using a script to cheat and make sure that he got every prayer correctly against oda block but the guy denies that he was cheating so autoblock tells him to share his screen i'm on a windows 98 pc dude can't not enough resources to screen share covered in grease and too [ __ ] sweaty or like you're actually an hking a rat and then you say thank you for the 30 as well that's crazy wala like you literally you literally use flying like imagine being that [ __ ] like like yo can you let me talk i know you have adhd alright go talk all right your stream is the only stream in the game it's always at the top right they need to fix the lines because it's running rampant everywhere it's the perfect opportunity to get it out there that it's actually disgustingly broken so wait so you okay i agree i agree with you but why don't you refund be like yo oh like i used it against you i used a client here's your money i just wanted to prove a point so if you actually cared if you're hungry man what do you mean so like you just admitted that you used it correct used what the client you just you just admitted it no i just said clients are dude bro you literally just submitted it on stream you can't take it back now like you literally i can take it back but if i want but like but like you literally just admitted it like what are you talking about okay but do you actually care i don't but i want you to admit it like be a man be it man what say i aged kade you use the client correct like yeah good fight i gotta i gotta go to mcdonald's you're legit cringes my guy he just wrote to you just wrote my discord he wrote oda they are hacked accounts i don't care if they get banged lol he was like damn i should have done more question mark these guys that make all their money from scamming people why do you think they're so toxic when they do it i think a bit of the toxicity comes from these people say these horrible things and there's no ramifications for it for example i've never seen someone get muted ever i could log in right now i could tell someone to kill themselves whatever you can think is the most horrible phrase if someone said that and you reported them they wouldn't get muted it's a fact and to be honest you shouldn't be getting muted at that point you should be removed from the game because some of the people who are playing these games are using it as an escape from their real lives and i know that's not for everybody but there are people on these games that use runescape as an escape from their real life and if you say that stop to the wrong person they might actually kill themselves to see an rwp or talk like that to a real player who's using it as an escape and the rw tier has no ramifications for that it's just laughable some of the stuff people say you could get into legal trouble for it might not get muted or banned but if i take a screenshot and brought it to my local police department and said i'm gonna press charges in the legal department in contact with jagex they would be able to take legal action on some of the stuff that said to these players but no one's getting muted no one's getting banned for what they're they're saying i think that's why the toxicity is still here because it's not against the rules as far as i can tell scamming botting targeted harassment these are all supposed to be against the rules rules like this mean nothing if they're not enforced take a look at all these bots at pyramid plunder this is going on 24 7 all over the game with different activities runescape has had a consistent uphill trend with net revenue and net profit over the years but still demonstrates a negligence when it comes to investing in the salaries of good employees and upgrading their system to detect these harmful things within the game a complete upgrade to their back end systems is necessary to fix the cheating in the game but there's no sign that is coming anytime soon it's a shame because given the game's growth updates like this will certainly happen but perhaps five years too late if the community gets behind it hopefully we can make change before it's many times in the past try expressvpn.com kempq catch you next time
