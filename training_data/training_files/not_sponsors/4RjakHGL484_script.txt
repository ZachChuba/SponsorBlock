well well well folks you've been asking for it and now here it is meet the L g27 GL 850 the superfast IPS monitor is not only one of the best gaming displays I've ever used but one that's actually at a very affordable price and usually when I say those words there's some sort of compromise attached on the end of it but to be honest not so much with the LG in fact I'd go as far to say that if you're after a gaming display that isn't ultra white not interested in one of these super high-end HDR displays then this is probably the one that you should be buying and while we're on the topic but please be quick this offer ends on December 3rd the LG G L 850 then let's start by talking specs we're presented with a 27-inch screen that packs a quad HD 1440p IPS panel running at 144 Hertz with a standout feature of a 1 millisecond response time and this is actually huge news as normally you have to choose between the image quality of an IP panel but then put up with a four or five millisecond figure of response time or maybe opt for TM with a one millisecond response time but then have to face slightly washed out colors and poor viewing angles with this monitor then you can actually have your cake and eat it but what about say juicing support well actually this is present here too no to be fair this isn't actually the full shebang as it's actually adaptive sync that's been certified as juicing compatible but this does have the benefit of bringing a price down and it means that AMD users will be just as happy as in videos but don't forget that this also has the added benefit later down the line but it's not going to tie you down to a particular brand of graphics card and all of these things are items that we've been asking your monitor manufacturers to actually put in their displays for quite a long time now it's all very well having these super high-end features but if it's always constantly bumping the price up I don't know about you but it's not always that interesting to me I want to be able to spend a realistic amount of money on a monitor and get one that is much better than maybe a monitor that came out a year ago two years ago this is a prime example of that design-wise I really like what LG have done here and looking at my review sample there's no RGB lighting like you'll find on some more expensive LG models but I really do think that this strikes the right balance between gaming and tasteful aesthetics now the stand is very quick to fit and it has all of the adjustments that you're going to need for economics but it is slightly strange that there's no swivel on offer but to be honest this isn't really a huge concern poor selection consists of two HDMI sockets and a single DisplayPort 1.4 while controlling the OSD is done with a four-way selector found underneath the chin and this makes navigation of the menus very simple and the menus themselves are actually very well laid out and easy to navigate it can even show your framerate in-game so you can check that everything is actually working as intended and speaking of gaming this is of course my favorite bits where we talk about gaming performance and in a word this is marvelous it was instantly noticeable he into a seasoned monitor connoisseur like myself god I'm lame just how much smoother apex legends looked than usual obviously the 144 Hertz refresh rate is mostly to think here but more specifically this time around the seemingly less blur on the screen as you moved the mouse around so we're not only feel smoother but actually looks a fair bit clearer to take a look at this slowdown footage of Gears of War 5 even with the silly motion blur that I forgot to turn off an abled you can see just how responsive this game is when you're roaming about and doing the old point-and-shoots I'd be really interested to see what a die-hard 240 Hertz eSports enthusiasts thinks of this as I really can't think of a monitor that's given me a better feeling of outright connection to the game when I move my hand I almost feel as connected to the character as possible and the feeling of lag is well imperceivable and the color accuracy and the richness of this panel was also instantly noticeable as soon as I got to the desktop IPS panels are pretty much always better than TN and often can be better than VA that sort of is a little bit here and there but that's a topic for another day point being with this one though it is a clear step up even over some mediocre IPS panels this is one of the best gaming monitors I've tested for outright image quality before we start talking about the really professional monitors that you'll find with the g-sync ultimate badge the overall package provides you with an immaculate image that's not only sharp enough to make all of your content viewing look its best but it has a velvety contrast and color that really does leave the usual gaming monitor compromises firmly in the dust behind it's not quite perfect as IPS is still susceptible to the dreaded IPS glow if you sit in a dark room and while chasing compatible does work a treat and reducing stuttering and tearing it's not quite as good as a fully fitted g-sync module in my experience and I have definitely seen a couple of tears come through in Apex legends this screen will also take an HDR signal when it will say HDR on the box but with a mere HDR 400 rating it's pretty close to always too time to be honest as it's not great enough and it doesn't have an advanced dimming system that is required for the next generation of HDR gaming experiences but at this stage I am being very nitpicky because what I always say with the high-end monitors is that if you're gonna use those features then getting a high-end monitor really can be worth it but for what everyone does which is play games this is what this is designed for and this is what it does such a good job at doing for my usage it's pretty much been playing some kids of war 5 some apex legends doing some work editing a little bit of videos and yes it's not perfect for everything if I just wanted a monitor for content creation obviously this wouldn't be the best option for me but this is pretty much the monitor for gamers period unless you're wanting something specific or you're going to be doing something specific on the side alongside your gaming then I think this monitor excels in pretty much all areas it is a shame that the HDR isn't where maybe it could be but that would bump up the price and then I'd be saying that this monitor is too expensive ultimately it all comes down to whether you want a sixteen by nine monitor or maybe an ultra-wide because in my opinion I prefer an ultra wide displays it's more wraparound it's more immersive but if I was only really playing sixteen by nine games anyway or maybe just games that don't need to feel your whole field of view and you're playing not professionally but you're playing competitively then sixteen by nine may well be better anyway and at the moment the only ultra woods that you can get with a 1 millisecond response time the same as this is LG's 38 inch one which I will be testing very soon but that is around about three times the price of this if not slightly more so it's not really in the same ballpark there's very little to complain about if this is the sort of monitor that you've been looking for high refresh rate 1440p I have not come across a best one yet and it does come highly recommended if you do want to check out current pricing on this then you can with my affiliate links linked
