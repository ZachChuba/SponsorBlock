I'm so happy to be here is going to be a thank you for being here if you haven't yet video is going to be on my phone okay so I think I've said this many many times but phone-tapping is is probably my favorite all right so that's what my own looks like so I've always done this thing where the first you know like your home I don't like having a lot of stuff on it for some reason so I've always done this thing where I just have apps on the top and the very bottom of course I'm not sure why I guess it's because I like seeing the the wallpaper I'm actually not sure why I do that anymore I guess it's just a habit but it's just like a more clean look to me instead of opening my phone and just seeing all the apps and once I guess if that makes sense so yeah that's thumbs green it's like the galaxy background I think it's the one that comes with the with the phone so yeah that's that's the home screen so up top we have mail definitely one of my most used apps on the phone just having having a few different email accounts on that and yeah that's that's mail photos that's weird weather and clock so mail photos weather and clock up top okay I use clock low time to fur alarms and all of that okay so that on the bottom we have messages and the reason I have messages on the bottom left it just makes sense to me is because I use my left and all the phone was at a time and so it's the closest thing to my thumb if that makes sense so like if you're moving the phone it's just right here and then the phone Safari and and then camera so those are like you know I was it leads to me like the eight like basic things that I use all the time so I have that on the on the first screen all right I put her on an airplane motors there's things popping up but so yeah that's the first home screen all right so let's go over now we're getting into the good stuff so up top we have interest which I don't use very often but I find myself if I'm looking for an idea for like a recipe I use
