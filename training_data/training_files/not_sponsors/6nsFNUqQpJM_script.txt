online store make it with Squarespace [Music] this 1993 photograph entitled a sudden gust of wind is by Canadian photographer Jeff wall walls image is full of movement and drama a moment captured where figures are caught in mid action as they struggle to deal with a massive possibly important papers escaping across the landscape the trees are bending and hair and clothes are flying in a wind so ferocious we can almost feel it as viewers this is a perfectly timed split-second capture of a spontaneous moment except that it's not this image is actually a digital composite made up of over a hundred different photographs taken separately over the course of two years every element has been meticulously choreographed and arranged by the photographer this is a scene that never existed in reality a sudden gust of wind is in fact a carefully planned recreation for the 19th century woodcut by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai it takes the classical composition and spectacle of the original work and reappropriation in a different medium the digital manipulation used in the creation of this piece is widely accepted as being okay as this is a piece of fine art the process is more than irrelevant it's almost part of the artwork itself but when does manipulation become cheating when does photography become a lie [Music] this is Robert Frank's iconic image elevator Miami Beach 1955 from his series the Americans a series that has been widely acclaimed for its social commentary on post-war American society this image has have much written about the then fifteen-year-old girl working as an elevator operator Frank catches a moment of contemplation as she stares off into the distance caught in a daydream while framed between two blurred figures exiting the elevator a telling moment about the culture and social hierarchy of the time but do we still feel the same way when we see Frank's contact sheet for this image when we realize that this was not a perfectly timed moment of genuine emotion but rather a set up shot that Frank got after spending a while in the elevator with the girl and posing her in different ways the answer to this question isn't simple if we feel cheated by this is it because the photographer was acting dishonestly or is it maybe because our expectations of the photographic process don't accurately represent what photography truly is if this was a painting we wouldn't question how genuine the scene that was painted was we'd merely accept that there would be a level of interpretation from the artist and we'd focus more on what the outcome of the process was what the final artwork says to us what message it sends and how it makes us feel with photography there's often an assumed level of transparency we expect it to be an honest representation and less obviously manipulated for artistic reasons but the act of merely framing something means that the photographer decides what to leave in and what to leave out it is by definition and editing of reality in this sense all photography is a lie the act of choosing what to take and not to take is in itself subjective what we see is what the photographer has chosen for us to see the truth of photography becomes a more complex issue in contemporary society where photo manipulation tools are so widely and easily accessed but photo manipulation goes back as far as photography itself back before Photoshop before smartphones and apps before all digital manipulation back to October 31st 1941 we have moonrise Hernandez New Mexico one of Ansel Adams most iconic photographs but this version of the photograph the one we're most familiar with didn't materialize until several years after Adams made the first prints of this photo this photo without the extensive darkroom manipulation that Adams ended up using looks like this a very different a much less dramatic scene than the one we're familiar with but does this manipulation change the truth of this scene is Adams simply using the tools available to him to get over the limitations of the photographic medium and realize the vision that he saw when he was there and most importantly when photography is made his art does it matter there have been cases where people have come under fire for manipulating their photos like the case of chair wee who was disqualified from an icon photo competition when it was discovered that he digitally added an aeroplane into his shot in post rather than being lucky at the time of pressing the shutter there are many people who took exception when it emerged that acclaimed photojournalist Steve McCurry has been digitally removing figures from his images in order to create more balanced compositions is this dishonesty is it cheating is it just part of photography nowadays I think the truth in art is more complex than simply having a transparent process and even if you're completely transparent process were even possible I'm not sure that's the best way to accurately represent truth I can probably explain this further by talking about two different films the 1996 film Fargo written produced and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen is a crime thriller with a heavy injection of black comedy a distinctive signature style that the Coen brothers have become very known for as the film opens we're presented with a short statement this is a true story the events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987 at the request of the survivors the names have been changed out of respect to the dead the rest has been told exactly as it occurred now this is not true the story and the characters are entirely fictional when questioned as to why this false disclaimer opens the film joel coen said if an audience believes that something is based on a real event it gives you permission to do things they might otherwise not accept there was no mass outrage or feelings of the public being cheated by this people just accept it as part of the arts and continue to enjoy and praise the film in this case the truth is unimportant as it doesn't change the effect or the quality of the art but to examine an interesting cinematic example of a very different nature we need to look at Ken Loach's BAFTA winning 2016 film i Daniel Blake the film focuses around two main characters Daniel Blake a 59 year old joiner from Newcastle who's recovering from a heart attack and Katie a single mom of two who has been relocated to Newcastle after living temporarily in a homeless persons hostel in London now while Ken Loach based the events of the film on a range of different real cases the characters and the story are entirely fictional but despite this being the case many people feel it portrays a very accurate representation of what it's like trying to live on the benefit system in the UK and the problems with it this has been so widely felt that the film has created quiet cultural impact as a sign of the times so much so that the leader of the Opposition even advised the Prime Minister to watch the film in Parliament as he criticised the fairness of the welfare system mr. speaker could I recommend the Prime Minister supports British cinema and takes itself along to a cinema to see a Palme d'Or winning film i Daniel Blake what we have here is a series of fictional elements there has produced something that people feel is more real and truthful and resonant than news coverage and documentaries on the subject media where the process might appear to be less manipulated on initial glance I think we all have different boundaries of what counts is cheating and what isn't when it comes to manipulation of an image whether that's in the setting up of the photo or the digital iteration through post-production it all stems back to what our expectations of the media are and what purpose is being put to photography will never be absolute truth in itself but rather a communicative tool by which a representation of truth is conveyed Robert Frank's elevator girl may have been a staged image but it still speaks volumes about the culture and social hierarchy of post-war America for me truth in photography as with all art is not told through the intent or the process by which something was created but by what the end result communicates to me as an observer [Music] so first off a massive thank you to everyone who has
