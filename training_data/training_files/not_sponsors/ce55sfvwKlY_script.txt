flavor family what is up it is Bobby and art back in the kitchen I've got a ketose salmon patty recipe I know you're gonna love I made these on the Flav City Instagram the other week they loved it and I said you know what this should not only go on the blog but I have to do a YouTube video for it and I said you know what this could be the start the start of the new video per week we're gonna do four videos per week now a cooking video a livestream cooking video and two on the weekend are you as excited as I am high five right so this is gonna be good so today we're gonna make juicy wild salmon patty cakes with my take on a tartar sauce that's a little funky Munky and dairy-free if you want to do it before big thank you to them for sponsoring the video so let's get rockin here I have two pounds of wild coho salmon that I caught off the skin and this is my first time getting a wild salmon from thrive market and it looks really good I'm gonna talk more about that in a minute now this is super easy because I'm gonna blend it up in the food processor but before I do what makes this recipe Kido is I'm swapping out breadcrumbs with almond flour so let's scoop about half a heaping cup of almond flour into my bowl here and I thought to myself when I was doing this self how can I make this dairy-free for my friends out there who don't rock the dairy very very easily normally if I was doing Kido I would soak this in cream instead this is unsweetened plain organic almond milk I'm gonna pour that over I mean check this out art I'm gonna pour just enough to make it wet and mushy and let it soak for five minutes and that's how we have our Kido and/or dairy-free bread crumbs that'll lighten up the texture of these salmon cakes perfectly and then I'll grab my processor this is why I think people on instagram love the recipe so much it's easy blitzie blitzie cooking the pan over there done so I'm gonna put two pounds of salmon in the bowl here then I'll crack in one egg that'll help bind it together then I'll scoop in about 1/2 a cup of avocado oil mayonnaise that'll be our secondary binder shake in a couple teaspoons of tamari soy sauce that'll give it that kind of umami flavor pinch in about 3/4 of a teaspoon of unrefined sea salt a few cracks of black pepper and then I'll grab some spices and we have a few more things to go here but one of the cool things about thrive market now is they have fresh meat and seafood all the seafood is either farm raised responsibly it's all sustainably caught and they have a lot of wild caught salmon like this phenomenal so I'm gonna add a teaspoon of garlic powder a teaspoon of onion powder a teaspoon and a half of stone ground mustard check that out I love this stuff because you can see the yellow and the brown mustard seeds in there and it just has a great flavor and a little bit of crunch I'm gonna take some caper berries how about a heaping teaspoon plus some of that pickling juice that's going to add some nice flavor then I'll add the zest of one small lemon then see how this thickened up a little bit here the almond flour hydrated from the almond milk keeping in the almond family that's what I want to do we'll add that and you need this because the texture of wild salmon is a little meaty a little dense and this lighten it up it's kind of like putting bread crumbs in a meatball instead of being hard and dense it's light and airy and then parsley before I add the parsley if you're not doing that parsley hack yet you got to do it come back from the grocery store wash it up snip just a little bit of the ends off put it in cold water in a mason jar and then the bag that you've got it here just put it right back over the top store it in the fridge you guys two weeks yes your herbs will ask you two weeks it works best with cilantro and parsley do the parsley a favor change the water every 3 or 4 days but it's a great hack that saves you serious cash and then whenever you need it right just rip off some parsley give it a fine shop here and then add it to the food processor what the machine do its work for you pop the lid on and buzz it away all right take a look inside that's kind of the texture I want it's not a hundred percent smooth there's still some chunky monkey here perfect I don't want to fry these yet in the pan because they're a little loose so I'm gonna pop the top off put some plastic wrap over the top and chill them in the fridge for like 15 to 20 minutes all right let's get our ingredients for my take on a tartar sauce there's gonna be an option for a dairy-free because I think you can do it and no one would even know the difference so it starts with half mayonnaise and a half yogurt I'm gonna use the same in is from before about a half a cup of avocado oil mayonnaise this is where it gets interesting there's two dairy free yogurts that I really love the grocery store one is from kite Hill the other one is from forager kite Hill is almond forager is cashew they're delicious the ingredients are Bobby approved and I love swapping it out and sauces like this because I'm telling you the drop-off is minimal to none and nobody can tell the difference let's scoop in a half a cup of this and then the zest of about half a lemon and start with the juice of half a little bit of prepared horseradish if you have fresh stuff go for it but I love the spice this adds and this brand is really nice bubbies and then about a teaspoon and a half of dill that's sugar-free a little bit of salt and pepper should go in here and then for the herbs I'm gonna open up a pack of chives here finely slice um just keep your fingers back these are great because they have a really nice mild onion flavor and then add them to your bowl all right you have to check for seasoning I want this to be on the tart side to cut through the richness of the salmon patties wow that is good all right push that aside I'm gonna grab your salmon patties I'm gonna fry them up alright friends let's fry up some salmon patties I got my chilled mixture there I've got a large non-stick pan here let's preheat it over medium ish heat and for my fat of choice I'm gonna use avocado oil and then I'm gonna form some patties here so let me do billing just grab some of the mixture here form it into like a large golf ball and then put it in the pan like that and then carefully just smash it out into a thin patty that was a chunky one I was talking about look at that alright like it wasn't shunk a little too big I'm like art I said chunky monkey I'm standing by my words let those patties do their thing for about four or five minutes splatter guard is essential here prevents the oil from going everywhere and we will flip that in a mout four or five minutes let's flip these salmon cakes perfect you guys look at that color oh yeah that one's for our gorgeous oh you have really close thick hey we're a little rusty you guys we haven't done cooking videos in a couple months but that's the beauty of the hot pan that crust there not only adds flavor it adds texture now let article ice down his finger and we'll let those go and now they're two to three minutes and Mattocks let's evacuate these salmon patties let's fry up the second batch once again just push them down and by the way if you're using farm-raised fish for this number one make sure it's good quality farm-raised and number two you have to cut back on the amount of eggs and mayonnaise because farm-raised Atlantic salmon is very fatty and it almost binds itself but I will leave that detail in the recipe down below that'll live on Flav City comm all right wash the hands splatter guard back down buy more let's flip the second batch perfect this time I'm gonna be more careful amazing color on there all right two more minutes and we're done all right let's get these last patties out of the pan and we'll plate up a dish with some of the tartar sauce down and doing that restaurant swoosh and then grabbing three of our perfectly cooked salmon cakes right here and then a little bit of chives on top and then if I have a partially zested lemon I don't stop until it's fully zest and there it is you guys kedo juicy salmon cakes with a dairy-free tartar sauce so darn easy so darn beautiful art here's your weapon of choice thank you good sir extra sauce for me Cheers Kraus yep nice and
