I'm good enough this is either a sneeze a word you use when you want to confuse the sales rep at the local Best Buy or it's all the different kinds of wireless you can get for your devices probably that last one let's start with this wireless standards are mostly backwards compatible so while you might have a laptop with wireless and 300 megabit and a smartphone like the HTC One with wireless AC your AC router or your n router will work with both devices so if you don't feel like watching the rest of this video just go buy a router with good reviews on amazon.com and you'll be fine if you do want to learn more first up is speed grade standards these start with 802.11 and a suffix often a speed number is thrown in by the manufacturer and you might see something about concurrent dual band which amounts to a theoretical doubling of the speed normally associated with that standard however you will only realize that performance benefit with devices that also support concurrent dual band these speed numbers don't really represent what you'll see in the real world though Wireless is subject to protocol overhead and performance reductions caused by distance obstacles and interference in fact sometimes reducing these factors can do more for performance than buying better gear at all now with that said a dual band router can help even if you're not able to use concurrent dual band because if you have five gigahertz capable devices five gigahertz signals are less susceptible to interference from cordless phones microwave ovens etc so while maximum range is actually slightly reduced at five gigahertz signal integrity can be better third-party firmware compatibility is another big selling point dd-wrt is an example of a firmware that can unlock additional sometimes enterprise or pro-grade features on your router check if your router is compatible on their website before buying if you want to tinker with it some router manufacturers however will void your warranty for flashing on official firmware so watch out for that QoS or quality of service systems such as W DS audio mated fast-track class or link sis's manually configured options can allow you to prioritize certain pcs applications or even types of network traffic such as video streaming voice clients or gaming over others which can be very handy from Multi PC households many routers also have USB ports so you can add a hard drive to them for centralized file storage or PC backups it's no substitute for a real NASPA it's better than nothing a lot of the time and don't forget about the wired connections on your router honestly this should be what you're using for anything that isn't a tablet smartphone or Ultrabook find a way to get gigabit even if it means spending a couple more bucks unless your PC is very old it will support gigabit which is 10 times faster than 10 hundred for transferring files in the real world and usually many times faster than Wireless because of that interference malarkey I was talking about before last step well this is just the first step again after you decide what features you need go to a trusted retailer website and read user reviews we personally love the EA 4500 from Linksys and we're moving to an EA 6500 soon for wireless AC support but everyone's experience may be a bit different and even from a trusted company I usually won't buy a router unless I hear a few solid testimonials one don't forget to like this video leave a comment about it for the tech quickie team under the video and as always guys don't forget to subscribe to tech quickie
