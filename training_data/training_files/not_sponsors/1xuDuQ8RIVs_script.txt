description if you would like to join so if you didn't know I own a vanilla Ross server that's hosted by streamlined servers it's a 100 pop server but I'm going to be increasing the server pop as we go along blue prints are wiped monthly on the force web and the map is wiped weekly we have an amazing community who plays there and I'd like to invite all of you to play there this four swipe starting today I'm also gonna be gifting five new members on the server this week and you set up my foes wolf armor skins so watch out for that in server chat you might just be picked I'm also gonna be announcing in my discord when the server is wiped as we all know with force wipe sometimes the wipes can be a bit later in the day especially if there's a big update to put out so definitely make sure to join my discord as well because it contains more info on the server and the discord functions is the home of our beautiful community so this video features what happens after we got raided online by those two big groups if you haven't seen my previous video about those online rains please watch that first as this episode will make way more sense after seeing it I really hope you enjoy today's video the following is vanilla rust [Music] you oh hey Leon in the kid it had a freaking tier 3 in there raid base that's crazy base to cake yeah it's a K today and I was watching is it Foley oh yeah it's gone now yeah they don't have a shooting floor which was weird because I thought like if my chance you know we had enough people on where we could push instead of just staying in base defendant and you could easily set up a turret in front of that door and they'd be totally [ __ ] fully high cold days with t3 I've never seen that in vanilla rest now you killed one with a frickin check him he was there during the raid - that's him enjoyed was the other news Hitler I was like t3 - yeah you had a family earlier yeah yeah and I had shot him good yeah here's a crudo offers like it's a fanboy the funny thing is if they went through these front doors they would have got TC but they chose the back end it looks good it's a beefy boy it is yeah that TC placements [ __ ] really good got me just texted me he's like I just woke up I'm gonna try to get him on Elvis Jamie's gonna be on the 20 minutes so we could hit the rig's servers [ __ ] popping there's still a cue yeah the riggers are gonna be challenged but I'm wondering maybe we should just do a little like a little rock a train a rockin train just get some stuff that way free - I can't wait to see these [ __ ] redefine system yeah best thing I've done in rests okay then like Chloe it was the best bass defensive anything nothing just gonna Frank I think it was raining but give you compliments off for the radio you know I don't speak hardly any English they just ran away and I almost killed them all when they're trying to vote away and then to put three wooden walls down it would have been so caught you've had heart so it was back-to-back raids two minutes literally - it's never happened to me in rest dude and like I'm still kind of in shock about it they literally just finished rating and then ten guys [ __ ] stormed ARB is very one counter lowlich tried to help out like an hour into it oh stop long huh yeah John's hello long missed you our battle of bo3 instrument Gumby you want to run around to me try to look very make actual business we can farm and [ __ ] but I think we actually hit a good base save time doing this we have the Rockets cran what's up dog what a big dog back to back raids or as I thought we would have lost the Korean read though increment all foxy magic generated toys like there's so many of them bro so you got you had time to passion for the Korean rate or I patched them yeah and then I patched up twice with the Koreans soon and I blocked the stone walls once and then crimp did as well but they didn't get the loot they didn't get anything did they didn't get any profit you did it twice [ __ ] gum easily oh you're right I got in like at the end right as I was getting ready to load in I joined discord and Freda was like they're voting away they were so confused yeah they couldn't find it it but the the Koreans got super close they were almost there man they were like one foundation you wouldn't love them in on a stole your Gloria I guess in a way I'm kind of glad like there isn't that many because I could think more clearly my quest going some [ __ ] Simon you know thank you yeah we're gonna we're gonna raid the Koreans dude just join waiting room I'll drag you up these are you Toby top dog why did you give me this it's [ __ ] super nice stiff were you there this morning when you raided us dude you were fighting the [ __ ] Korean say a little bit yeah sure dude we're standing in the same room in towards their TV and they just sprayed this with them too dude all of a sudden I heard like 5m2 spray for like two minutes straight what the [ __ ] was that yeah they came from the [ __ ] we need a new Norwegian you like super you don't think that [ __ ] really I thought that was big all right okay are you the only one on right now yeah our base is 400 every hour it's not we're gonna raid the m-19 together we need like 250 rockets so we each have like 90 right now I think we need to farm up just a bit more and then we can do it is this at the farm I don't know it's better for allies at least until the end of this way up to to stake out this green team dude or your cause no way do you know who I am [Music] [Applause] Elliot really [ __ ] alright 300 right surrendered yeah okay okay no we had some good fights we fail rated you guys I have no idea what look at so many turrets inside the base dude our base this morning was totally Cornell but we yeah yeah did you see it we've picked it all we got 26 K clock take it pick it like seven our group and I were there for a couple hours young said tried to radio to [ __ ] be allies with you okay right I mean it I think it's kind of cool because you guys already rated us and it would be stupid to blow back in there you off our code plus week like we can just avoid any like it seems unnecessary because we know each other now and there's a bigger target on the server so yeah how old are you Toby what when did you get into rust do you practice I learned it pretty quickly I just watched like yeah ages we don't have a good you just got so comfortable you know yeah that's a good tutorial on it yeah we tried really first we almost wasted like cuz I think

not gonna raid them I know or just let's go - yeah right down here that is [ __ ] [ __ ] that middle one oh my god yeah it's just saying do you know I don't think we'd have enough for their main even if it was half walled we would have enough for their main we're gonna have to shoot from this top-down center they've upgraded wood stairs leading up by any chance to you would you like be willing to

you got a mini copper coming out to you good good good yeah here comes here comes oh he's right here guy sterile right here Tommy yeah Mon yeah we can switch out if you want see a body down there one of them out of death that was horrible yes I think that's a girl man we got raided but we're starting the live a couple acres already hosted by his name was Jim Rome it was a solo guy let's just this butch Johnson he had a bow I actually thought we were rated cuz I was dead I don't understand this I was dead did I kill you or did I do I don't know I guided by an element its goal and sidon aka kak wait up let's do this quick here you guys pick up Ethan all right boys I just highlighted this kid oh my god oh my god he was hard peaking it no second line he's loaded guys [Laughter] [ __ ] face what is that people don't touch me just hey [ __ ] you [ __ ] out of here bro I'm gonna shoot it he did they leave the server usually they're going hard right now and some of their shop items are out of stock and who we gonna read now so the larger group who raided us the second time in my previous video quit the server after failing to raid us we don't really know why considering the sheer size of their compound and membership but it gave us a chance to focus on other goals we had for the remainder of the light is the main base starting to decay or just the toner and practically gone and I see how good what's surprising is usually big surge like that don't rage quit after one failed raid yeah it's kind of weird and they usually save up again and raid the same Barisan smoke and fools ok ok yeah that's like Oh a mini copter welcome Abdi oh my god [Music] [Music] they need food the enemy I'll keep checking so the main base isn't fully destroyed from the water you can jump basically where I am you said burn give me your best little mouse Oh [ __ ] oh you got [ __ ] admit that's cheating haha yeah they're empty burnt you're the new guy I poke you is there any other way in where's that spelling the best way oh there's a chest turn how do you Lynn [Music] on something it's probably the second great washes blowing plume put a ladder here and get in Oh turn it over here the core seems solid still they didn't get all the way in okay yeah there's there's loot wait what is that what is this thing this red thing okay it's a one and a half floor bunker there's loot in here in Scott vein but they have hiked one yeah [ __ ] we got the Rockets and we don't have it now please land right here when sun's going down what it's awesome alright Barbie and I'm gonna go get the stuff we did I'm gonna bring some c4 in case there's like armored doors mm-hmm I'm literally right behind the turret yeah what are you gonna do about it there's sixty seven health on the foundation and I got a hatchet and some rock upconvert I'm gonna see how low I can get the foundation trying to think of like other targets but I guess we could just hit random basis yeah at this point oh this one looks like a demon yeah no no we gotta put it down oh I don't know are you sure I don't know I mean this one too I think they all I should be able to skin your horse skin your chuck it in the [ __ ] home pick it up with a hammer right in there what nice foggy day oh [ __ ] is that loaded oops it's not turned on okay we're about to get shot down oh it's open 33 250 i : CC I'm gonna clear it and get off we can get in here now oh my god three shotgun shops there it's named name on the empty air yeah your body okay now your body is twirling they must have these fun yeah they totally do spawned in here oh there's two bags oh there's some animal in it yeah that's a taking that Harrods us it was worth yeah you never know they definitely D spawned so I don't think anyone we just rated the Koreans yeah we [ __ ] them up okay so they ended up ragequitting after we kicked their ass yeah and their base started to King like almost fully today there's only 250 high school in there TC yeah yeah [Music] I've nine rugs on me but it was really curious to see what they had they had them they had a book it's kind of shocking though that they would reach good afternoon considering how big their compound is take care so now we have the box of rockets to use on whatever look at that [ __ ] holy [ __ ] no what's that [ __ ] is that holy [ __ ] why do they have stilts it's a weird vase oh
