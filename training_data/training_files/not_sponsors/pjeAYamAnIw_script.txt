Trish and I are gonna have a digging competition whoever can dig the deepest hole in 30 seconds wins treasure you ready you're diggin am i holding over there hey what's up guys Jake here today I'm hanging out my dog treasure and today we're gonna be searching for stuff at this drained River so this is my hometown and the water goes high to low flow every single day and there's always all types of cool stuff to find I actually have made of a dive here in the longest time just because it's been flooded but right now it's super drain and we're gonna be able to spot some things in the water I've got my dog treasure she's just gonna be roaming around having a good time while I'm picking up trash or any cool stuff I find along the way but if you enjoy this video I want to see more drop a thumbs up if there's support i'll get back out here with my dog and see what else we could find she's just going absolutely crazy man also if you new make sure you guys subscribe so you don't miss my next adventure [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi now did I get that out of my system hello Jason Choji let's go find some cool stuff so the tools I'm using today is pretty simple I've got three big trash bags to fill up as much trash as possible I also have a little treasure bag so anything good like iPhones GoPros or any cool stuff like that I'll stick in that bag I've got my trash bag I also have my little treasure bag so many cool stuff I find like I said will be placed in here all the trash I find will be placed in here and I'm gonna throw everything away at the end of the video I want to see if we can get more likes and trash that I find today you might be kind of hard but we're gonna start right here on the left side and the water so low and I'm thinking that if people are up top taking photos of the river they could potentially slip and drop their iPhone I found phones like that in the past year so let's start here make our way all the way down the Riverwalk and hopefully find some cool things but also maybe just pick up all the trash alright so the first fight of the day is the top of a worm bucket there's a lot of fishermen out here so we're gonna find a lot of fishing lures but also a trash just like this but what I'm gonna do place that inside my trash can and keep going I also see something else right here I think it might be pretty cool yeah I found a light maybe a fisherman was out here fishing that night and they dropped it light overboard I'm actually gonna put this in my treasure bag which is kind of cool and then I also see a can right here I'm gonna and then put in a trash bag let's keep walking huh I've had a fishing reel can you imagine when that guy had like I bet there's a fish on this pole and it just took the whole reel overboard with the fishing pole all right so that's definitely trash so I said oh no I dropped it no because your walk over here alright well I'm gonna find it it was a penny it's lost treasure supposed to be helping me out but she's just marking up the water plumbing I can't see anything you're faker dude go over there you have the whole River while treasures over there I'm gonna continue walking this way before she messes up the water and I can't see nothing wait wait that's two three one you know that kind of reminds me of it's pretty dark but it reminds me of the time I found a black box with human remains and I actually had a tad just like that but I would doubt that would be the case but if you have an idea let me know in a comment section below the numbers 231 again I'm gonna put that my treasure bag these chemical could be like a dog tag or something I'm gonna be careful so don't poke yourself check it out it's a swimbait and that right there's probably at least 20 bucks so that's a pretty good fishing lure the hooks are actually not rusty at all so as a recent loss but that's actually pretty cool man I'm stoked on that one I already put that in the treasure bag for sure you know these are actually some of my favorite videos that make because you just never know what you're gonna find you know there's obviously a lot of trash and that's because there's a lot of fishermen here also people are careless when they throw their trash into the water and and or maybe just during floods you know trash just kind of makes its way down here but you can actually find some pretty incredible stuff sometimes that's what makes it fun I've got something kind of cool I found a lock I'm not too sure why that's in here but got it I'm gonna pretend the trash because obviously I did I found a fork like a plastic fork Brandon always says whenever he finds before he's like that's working awesome I also got another fishing lure that's got a fluke with a chartreuse tail this is like to go to here at the river and we also got something else Warren's right here check it out a lot of cat fishermen use bells like this so when they catch a fish they get notified but you guys hit a notification bell and you guys won't miss out my next adventure the heck of that I got corn I got a plug to something probably a TV or something just found another fishing lure that's actually still pretty good I just got a bobber and a bunch of fishing save the bobber Oh fishin I got it just found some more efficient trash here we got a bobber and a bunch of fishing line fishing line is like one of the worst for the environment here in the river birds fish turtles I'll get stuck up in it and they die so anytime you see fishing line make sure you get it out and throw it away don't want any animals to die over that other than fishing line I had to say some of the worst thing for you why sure just going crazy right now she sounds like a killer but other than fishing line I had to say one of the worst things that you can find on our River to you are cast and check it out I know Tellem chatter so it's a super bad to you because all the turtles and fish and stuff like that can get all stuck in this so we definitely want to get this and throw that away as well so I'm gonna bring it over here to the sand and then I'll put it on my stand-up paddleboard so when we leave it throw it away hey Curtis she almost stepped on that and this is why we're out here today yep giant hooks in the sand that would not be good for any dog or person to step on we also got some more here so I definitely just want to clear out just for me and my family so we can come out here at alone you know but like if anyone else comes out here it's gonna be good for let's see some fish line right and another lure all right so I haven't found anything crazy good yet like not like an iPhone or anything like that but we're fine a lot of trash a lot of fishing lures haven't good time treasures on the Santa paddleboard we're making our way downriver there's so many islands to search so we have endless possibilities to find and stuff and I'm so excited to see what we can come across I just found something pretty gross found someone's shorts whether they lost it while rafting or maybe threw it overboard I'm not too sure why but we're gonna throw those away hey Joseph Oh guys check it out I found my first potential murder weapon found a knife honestly it's probably for fishermen stuff like that you know cut up a bait but you just never know man someone could have been killed run it over boy got some sunglasses there's actually a little like slime coated like mold wash them off reuse those charges getting tired all right so we're out of spot where it's getting get a little bit deeper so I brought my goggles we're gonna search this area alongside the wall and see if we can find some cool stuff down there so what is it Oh murder weapon got some scissors are these yours y'all wanna alright here we go over here I'm up there y'all go that's probably a murder weapon just never know man it's in the river okay so we just got done swimmin looking for stuff underwater I didn't find a lot of stuff and the waters getting a lot clearer than it has been it actually was like super super Murphy so that's pretty exciting I've got my dog treasure right here I've got it on a leash just because it's like people around here we're gonna check out this island first and then we're gonna see if we need to move somewhere else but I start picking up some trash and see what we can find you're bound to find like hands everywhere alright let's see what's inside nothing right here you always want to be careful because you just never know what's in someone's lonely you know looks like you look right here it's like someone actually splashed it with a knife all right I don't see anything quite yet no money inside there's a pocket right here everything's arrested so I'm just gonna go ahead and get in there all right there is nothing inside the wallet but I was pretty cool man I'm fine at the day so far no wallet someone probably stole this threw it off the bridge it floated over here and sad but yeah nothing inside then I can get back to the person so I'm just curious if you guys made it to this point I've been picking up nothing but trash if you have made it to this point in a video leave me a comment a comment section below saying that you made it and only people who made it here but know what that means so yeah leave a comment saying you made it if you made it on this island we're fine in like a ton of just trash like cans and bottles and glass and stuff like that I want to clear out as much as possible like I said I don't want any dogs or people getting their feet cut up on this stuff so let's keep walking around see what we can find check it out I just found a frisbee four discs off and these are actually kind of expensive so that's a cool fun is that this disc golf course right up here so someone must have just threw it in the water on accident but got a nice one I just found another wallet it's two Hyundai eventually only if I'm like three wallets in my life hey that let's dump it out got a lot of sand in there so I don't see nothing in this one either so yeah most likely these are like stolen wallets and people chuck them in the river to get rid of him yeah I don't know I thought it wasn't a knife at first it could be I'm not too sure what do you guys think potential murder weapon definitely a shame we've walked this entire River and we haven't found anything crazy good but with that said what I'm gonna do right now is get on my stand-up paddleboard we're gonna go to a trash can dump all the trash that we found today and then we're gonna wrap it up so let's head to trash can so check it out we got three full bags of trash I'm gonna save the frisbee I'm not gonna throw that away but put that in the trash bag for now so let's go ahead and start to put us all in the trash can sweet alright I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you guys did make sure you guys give this video a big thumbs up also don't forget to
