oh hello you know commander pre cons are on the shelves now but with a retail price of about $41 many Magic the Gathering players might find themselves looking to pick up singles at local games stores in their area rather than purchase the complete pre-constructed product especially when some of the best brand-new cards for commander are at least as of the filming of this video available for only a couple of bucks each ah but which to procure presented here are my picks for top 5 non legendary new cards from commander 2019 as well as the singular best new legendary out of all four decks for those who just want to buy brew and build after all for many it is the skill of commander that is skill share [Music] all right for this list I want to specifically exclude legendary creatures in particular the three possible commanders from each deck why because these are often the best cards in each deck and I feel like the list would pretty much be yeah this is an amazing new legendary for commander yeah this is an amazing new legendary for commander and I instead want to look at which cards for commander from 2019 are of note worthiness that aren't just the legendaries that maybe we want to put in our existing commander decks so it's not just going to be a video about me going on and on about how cool Kadena is but seriously Kadena is super cool before I get to that list of top 5 non legendary new commander cards from commander 2019 I will offer what I think the new number one legendary commander is and no it's not any of the four face cards nor their alternates it's not even a multi colored card sorry Gerard but it is in fact his counterpart the son of yog Moth it's no wonder son of yog Moth is the most expensive card out of all of the commander 2019 cards he is powerful oppressive prone to out-of-control combo and quite frankly potentially broken a perfect counterpart to your already potentially broken or Zadok son of yog moth is a legendary creature a horror minion that reads for each black mana in a cost you may pay to life rather than pay that mana also whenever you cast a black spell put a plus one plus one counter on the son of yog ma that's not really what's relevant what is relevant is that now black mana becomes phyrexian mana aa phyrexian mana broken broken broken broken so let's not only put it on a commander but have that commander make all black mana and black mana activation costs phyrexian as well what could possibly go wrong a lot let me start with the easy stuff pontiff of light go wide and drop this to drain your way to a game win as pontiff gives son of yog moth extort and extort can now be paid with phyrexian mana pay to life and assuming you have three opponents they each lose one life and you gain life equal to the life lost meaning you paid to life to gain three life rinse repeat even in a commander game with only two opponents you are still breaking even on life this is just one of countless combinations that the son of yog moth can create let alone just getting cards like phyrexian obliterator necro Potence and even doomsday all for the phyrexian man a free cost amazing card and overall the best legendary in the entire commander 2019 set what about non legendary cards I have five for you and four of them are very under priced at the moment hey one is expensive but you know what whatever this isn't commanders quarters okay get off my back mmm let's start with an excellent accelerant that is designed to go in just about every deck and only about 325 each at the moment empowered Auto generator is a powerful gem or artifact empowered Auto generator costs for generic mana it's an artifact that enters the battlefield tapped you can tap it to put a charge counter on empowered Auto generator add X mana of any one color where X is the number of charged counters on empowered Auto generator so this to me is reminiscent of storage lands like dwarven hold and sparse as a sparse tsubame goodness what a tongue twister of a card but empowered Auto generator has so much more going for it first this can go in any deck because you get to add mana of any color to your mana pool meaning even if you are missing that mana from a land you control you can still generate it with the Auto generate or but where things get very powerful here is that unlike storage lands when you tap to add your charge counter to the generator you automatically get mana equal to the number of counters so this thing is like a perpetual motion a machine I think it's currently very much under the radar right now as having the ability to both charge and get mana each turn is very powerful indeed the only drawback is the formatter price and the fact it enters tapped but with so many soul rings this could conceivably drop on turn to accelerating your game further and faster than your opponents by far great for any and all decks that don't have access to much in the way of ramp coming up next is a dollar 75 card from commander 2019 that I think might suddenly skyrocket once players realize how potent and powerful it really is sabotage your opponents and take their treasures in a split second it's sudden substitution sudden substitution is too generic and too blue for an instant with split second which of course means as long as the spell is on the stack players can't cast spells or activate abilities that aren't mana abilities exchange control of target non creature spell and target creature then the spells controller may choose new targets for it bow before the might of wait what so yeah as others have said you cast summoners pact and then before it resolves sudden substitution grabs one of your opponent's creatures and then assuming your opponent doesn't have the mana to pay for summoners pact they lose the game these sorts of shenanigans work with so many cards from final Fortune to just a plain old-fashioned demonic pact but it isn't just trickery such as this that makes this card so great it's an easy and effective answer to the bomb creatures all your opponents will inevitably play its commander your opponents are gonna resolve some insane threat why have it died to removal when you can just control it for the rest of its life and yeah if you want to get fancy you can just give them a one with nothing in exchange split second means they can't do much to stop you all right next up is a mostly universal card now whenever I talk about Universal and Commander there's always exceptions of course and I've been trying to watch my language and be a bit more accurate but suffice it to say that a colorless land that has an extremely positive effect let alone potential trickery involving your commander is absolutely something that many Magic the Gathering players will want in their commander decks and still at only three dollars each sanctum of eternity is a fantastic card to snap up sanctum of eternity is a land you can tap it for colorless mana or spent to in tap to return target commander you own from the battlefield to your hand activate this ability only during your turn hmm come and rest here beyond the constraints of space and time now when this card was first previewed many you had fun coming up with goofy combo possibilities involving everything from Sakana and pan harmonica on to at rata the silencer but what I really like about this card are the more practical and let's be frank realistic uses first of all by bouncing your commander to your hand you are able to get around the commander tacks something that rapidly escalates in a lot of games as your commander repeatedly dies to removal now it does have the restriction that you can only activate it during your turn so any of those sorcery speed rafts are not going to be during your turn but it'll still escape that instant speed removal on your turn that your opponent might try for what I like about sanctum is that it also helps you out of a pinch from mind control effects and the spells like dark steel mutation bounce your commander back to your hand to regain control of it or just get it out of that Kafka esque nightmare also all commanders with enter the battlefield effects like maelstrom wanderer gallant II Lord of luxury or shroom can start getting real value out of their enter the battlefield effect either way at $3 this is a great pickup for many commander players who didn't already pick up merciless rage but why did are around returning your commander to hand when you can do even better and return your opponent's commanders to their own hands all for a canned trip that replaces itself and protects you from no answer situations and it's only a buck eighty-five each its leadership vacuum leadership vacuum is a blue and too generic for an instant that says target player returns each command they control from the battlefield to the commands zone draw a card hmm while they scramble to fill the sudden vacancy at the top we strike finally an answer to those locked up cigar de board states this is well any answer to any commander is it doesn't target the commander so that means it gets around cannot sacrifice effects gets around a shroud and it draws you a card to replace itself you can even just use it to mess up their tempo while also clearing away whatever nightmare commander your opponent has brought into play get rekt you're all who actually the art itself is portraying getting rekt in a pinch you can even target yourself bouncing a dark steel mutated commander or perhaps make a political offer to do so for an opponent in a jam imagine the damage that hitting your opponent's Voltron commanders all those enchantments and counters go shattering to the ground problems with this card are that it does have a slightly high mana cost to cast and the fact that it hits only one opponent instead of all I still think this is a fantastic card and if you didn't by faceless Menace or mystic intellect it's something you might consider picking up as it's under two bucks each so you probably accurately guessed that the best card out of the entire commander 2019 set is also the most expensive one on this list safe of course for the son of yaagh moth it's a fantastic commander design and I think in autorun in almost every deck that shares a color with it costing only one generic and red dockside extortionist sadly is a whopping 13 dollars as of today and this is definitely the - fairies protection of the set as the lonechase card found only in mystic intellect dockside extortionist as a generic in a red for a goblin pirate RRR when dockside extortionist enters the battlefield create extra j''r tokens where X is the number of artifacts and enchantments Yoram ponents control now treasure tokens are artifacts that you can tap to sacrifice to add one mana of any color oh my goodness a small price to keep such pretty things safe this card isn't just fun it's also highly competitive itself you can generate huge pools of mana for bringing your plans to fruition and paired with Eldrazi displacer or Deadeye navigator this can just go wild but mana red decks like my beloved Feldon and obviously kiki ji ki would love this too seriously considering how many artifacts and enchantments easily drop in commander you could bring this out early or late for some big mana bucks giving you major advantage to push through for a win it's no wonder it's going for 13 dollars each and sadly i don't think that price is gonna stay there for a long as this will rapidly become one of the more requested reprint targets luckily commander only cards like this get reprinted frequently right so it's not gonna be 50 bucks in just a year or two right right hello but now I want to hear from you what do you think are the best non legendary cards from commander 2019 and why are you going to skip buying the pre cons and just by the singles you need for the decks you want to build or already own and want to upgrade let me know in the comments below and remember Target and Walmart doesn't even have singles for sale so when you're perusing to save some money try and do it at your
