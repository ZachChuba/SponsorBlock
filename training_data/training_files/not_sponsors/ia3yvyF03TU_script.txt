all right this is twenty twenty point twenty four point six point one and we're heading out onto the Beltway DC Beltway let's see how we do today of course we've got the new full self-driving computer we've got hardware two which means you've got fully full hardware for autopilot 3.0 which is the latest version and we'll see how things have improved if at all and of course we've got a whole slew of videos with a similar title they just have different software versions and different episode numbers so check the channel and there are everything's rattling in my car all right signalling out of this lane that's nice hasn't always done that I'll be getting over one more Lane nice it's thinking ahead of the game here he's been gathering data from other cars from the neural network see what it does up here increase the speed a little bit first time we almost went over to the Express Lanes on that first opportunity usually we skip by that one for sure but this time it wasn't that hard of a skip it could have almost made it let me know what you think let me know in the comments now and we'll be shifting back to the right lane usually it does that here after this interchange or these part of it I don't know why because we're on local lanes you wouldn't think it wouldn't want to do that especially if it knows we need to get the express lane let's see if it's not going to do that that'd be great if it doesn't do it see there's a lot of cars coming in here we're on tractors a little window here where he can get over in time to get onto the express lanes here but usually by the time it signals that window has closed up that opportunity's gone let's see it requires started signaling right about now and it's too late stay on solid someone cross the solid line we're not gonna do it it's too late still hasn't got that figured out whoa it's breaking whoa you got close to that what do you call them just a name for those things in the middle the road their crush barrier whatever you want to call it there's a name I can't think of it right now but it really thought it was what do you think let me know in the comments it really thought about going I thought second thing I might try it this crush barrier is crushed up here and we're going for it no problem we usually make it right through here if we got company here on the right there's a car you can see it there in the screen yeah it's gonna be competitive here how we gonna handle this all right we're speeding up oh you got a signal no that's rude should a signal what is the name of that thing not a crush barrier somebody out in a Model X in California he died when they ran straight on into it at full speed they crunched they crushed there's another one right here and people go into them on a regular basis think you've ever never replace these that's a full one a new one so we're heading down to 70 South just came from the Gaithersburg supercharger and we are gonna head into the DC Beltway we got to get on a spur before we to the Beltway we've got a little bit of traffic here it's definitely getting more and more traffic E as Koba 19 wanes things get open back up try confirming it really sped up there's a section here where the line goes away he used to give me troubles in previous versions the software doesn't give any trouble anymore we were over there last week see how this merch is gonna get handled of smooth emergency vehicle on Honda minivan that was the last exit mantra road before we get to the spur this means we're gonna have the veer off to the right up here and auto-pilot already knows all this I'm saying in point eight miles it's gonna be a right turn I can't remember if we need to get out of this lane or if this thing works actually last time we were here there was some milled paving all over the place here they've just repaved this section which is nice hopefully it's Honda minivans gonna stay in their Lane my screens jumping all over the place that big truck that wasn't very accurate right now I'm gonna couple pillows blindspots this is not good I wish it wouldn't stay in blind spots and we do this a lot of lanes here city it had some repaving here this is old pavement hopefully will go off to the right as we're supposed to here if signaled and we went good and then we're neck and neck with that Honda minivan am i right yeah I really wish they'd do something about keeping out of people's blind spots you think it wouldn't be that difficult to plug that into the software just keeping people out of my blind spot and me keeping myself from hovering in people's blind spots it would save a lot of accidents artists turn the signal to the right well see somebody appeared there well still trying to go that person to my right it was like you're both competing for the same Lane they were coming from the other direction but you saw how autopilot handled it it was handled well that person is still over there in my blind spot just what I'm talking about blind spot especially when traffic gets involved you get a lot of cars this really could be an issue all right they went they hung back they fell back so they're not my blind spot anymore they're good bit further back what do you think about that let me know in the comments how do you think it did well that is a panic braking that's what the shadows my protein bottles fell over this is the warning I'm in this person's blind spot and this Lane is gonna end something's that happened here yeah I've done previous videos here and in my Tesla it's not yielded in the past if you look back to three and a half years ago when I first got it it would Ram cars that tried to do that it would not slow down so things to quote come a long way with the software still other ways to go I'm just pointing out these things there's areas for improvement because Tesla doesn't really tell you when they've added or subtracted these types of things but they do from time to time these aren't listed on the list of functions that they guarantee or don't guarantee so we are on the Beltway now after that turn of the right back there we're on the Beltway circling around we're going counterclockwise heading into Northern Virginia we're in Maryland still we'll cross over the American Legion bridge in the Northern Virginia once we get into Northern Virginia we're gonna have to get into the the express lanes immediately in order to make our exit and that's been an issue we've made it once for the software actually directed us onto the Express lanes but other times it's been inconsistent and hasn't made it so we'll see how it does today basically if it's not going to make it I'll just take over the wheel I was really surprised when it did make it recently you can you can look at that just go back a few episodes with the same title different software version and different episode number it's hard to see here white pavement reflection for the afternoon Sun but it's doing just fine it's looking further down the road it's got the lines right something like that used to give it issues but not anymore apparently which is good we needed improvement in that area all right it's telling me the upcoming lane change as you can see a blue rectangle it's gonna change to the right lane because it knows it needs to do that well in advance this will give us plenty of time oh we have some traffic coming up this ought to be interesting a lot of slamming on brakes it looks like all right signalling now is it gonna try to get in front of this shot yes hopefully in front of it it'll scoot in it does good that's a nice one so much better than it used to be again if you look at the history on this they've got several years of history same exact car here - same car five four three and a half years 133 131 thousand miles supercharged almost 1500 times we've replaced computers both autopilot and the MCU upgraded same sensor suite they're all original sensors cameras let's take a have a newer car now so I almost think I got a new car almost there's all these new computers in here it's like getting a new phone so it feels like they they operate so much more smoothly even like an automatic emergency braking and those types of things pedestrians it's it's it's stopping with certainty now whereas in the past it wasn't rolling the dice whether it was gonna stop or not I don't it felt like the computers could barely keep up that's that's the feel I got anyway I don't know that for a fact but I did have to pay 2500 ollars for this upgrade and they didn't replace the screen they only want but they're getting they're gonna put that on there the d√°il me a free screen so no problem I'll get it later all right now we gotta get off to the local lanes here let's see what the system does I may need to grab the wheel up it's signaling there we go right right in line where needs to be perfect ice so glad to see that so I haven't really had to intervene at all and have it felt like you know other than the blind spots like I'm saying that's still not been solved with software but hopefully it will but I didn't feel the need to intervene but but the blind spot thing you never notice if someone just suddenly turns into you and then you're in an accident but so far that has not been as good all right now I'm going to get over two lanes of traffic to the right to get off and that shouldn't be a problem if we already got off from the Express Lanes I would think that it would do this asking me to assist okay there we go all right that's it nice and smooth I need your help with that please really helps me out thanks a lot see you the next video bye bye
