just over two years ago I released my first polyphonic video to a handful of subscribers that included my close friends and my parents now I'm fast closing in on a half million subscribers a number I never would have dreamed of back in 2017 so first and foremost I just wanted to make a quick video to say thank you all so much for your support you've allowed me to turn a passion into a job and more than that you've allowed me to learn more about music than I ever thought I would know I want to give particular thanks to my incredible patrons on patreon I know you guys work hard for your money so I really appreciate you putting it on the line for me I also want to remind you that Polyphonic merch is available and hopefully I'll be putting together a new line of posters soon so keep an eye out I'm a team of one so every video is a lot of work and your support helps make it feasible for me to put in that work and it helps me eat which is a thing that I like to do this is especially true lately as YouTube's copyright detection has amped up and every day I find new videos of mine demonetized or blocked outright and that brings me to the next thing I'm gonna talk about Nebula as you might have seen I was part of the launch of a new streaming service recently nebula is a service created by and for creators to try to give an alternative to a broken YouTube system for just 5 bucks a month you can get access to all my videos early and ad-free as well as original new content now I know that some of you are gonna say that you don't want to pay five bucks when you can get things for free or that you subscribe to enough services already if that's the case that's completely fine you'll still get regular polyphonic videos every week and I'm not gonna take that away from you but if you do decide that you want to support the channel in a new way think of it as 2 cups of coffee a month and it really goes a long way for me YouTube is a tough place to be a creator and this is especially true as a music creator so what is next week's video well the first video I ever released looked at black star and David Bowie facing his own mortality it's a topic that's always enthralled me so I decided to revisit it for my anniversary this week's video we'll take a look at two of my favorite Bowie songs rock and roll suicide and Lazarus and explore how Bowie uses them to say farewell I think you guys are really gonna enjoy it it's gonna be dropping here on Thursday but you can see it now by supporting me on patreon or going over to nebula furthermore in two weeks I'll be releasing my next Q&A video so if you have any questions about myself my channel nebula or just anything else please leave them in the comments and I'll try to answer what I can and one more thing as is quickly becoming tradition every year at this time I create a summer playlist this year's playlist is a bit of an experiment it's a playlist that tells a story I call it summertime a playlist in three acts and it's full of Easter eggs so you can go check it out on my Spotify and if you want to get in touch with me in any other way or just talk to me about music tweet at me my address is on the thing now once again I just want to thank you all so much for your support it means the world to me that you guys want to watch my stuff and the kind things you say really helped me get through the day so thank you I never really know how to end these things
