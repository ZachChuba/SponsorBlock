that one's said to be a thing but they always pull back their hair do you think i cover it up well or no i mean oh god i'm sorry jesus [Music] how you guys doing it's been a while my name is bob welcome to the stream i hope i hope you guys still remember me don't forget me please so sometimes when i do these i like to start with icebreakers but i would say that we already know each other quite a bit and i'd love to get to know you even more minx because you know not a lot of people feel comfortable getting really intimate you know they start to get nervous some guys you know whether it be like schlatt or george they just want to you want to keep it on the surface level just memes but i want to really deep dive and get to the true feelings is that okay if i'm being honest yeah i've uh i've been lonely and i feel like i want to be more honest about my feelings towards the people that i like you know so if nothing lasts forever minx you know will you be my nothing what the [ __ ] does that mean bob oh that's [ __ ] terrible why would you that is the dumbest [ __ ] if you ever use that on a man or a woman again i will come to [ __ ] america and just slap you across the [ __ ] face why were you so confident in seeing that trash [ __ ] line excuse me what do you mean yeah no excuse you yes you realize that like i just put myself out there right that i just explained to you that i've been lonely and i wanted to be more honest about my feelings and that that part i tried i tried to be sweet and i tried to woo you with my words i tried to say something that might make you blush because i know that sometimes as an e-girl you'll put fake blush on but i want to see the real thing i want to see those red cheeks i mean it was going fine it was going perfect you know it was nice and then you just ruined it with that weird if not last forever will you be my [ __ ] nothing you just call me [ __ ] nothing it is not a [ __ ] pickup line i guess and i get [ __ ] you didn't you didn't think it was you didn't think that was sexy no you literally just said will you beat my nothing you little [ __ ] daft [ __ ] yeah but like nothing lasts forever you ever like worse it's like oh you're gonna [ __ ] die soon are you saying i'm getting [ __ ] no no no like you have you ever had a guy whisper sweet nothings into your ear no bob i have it actually what what what is what is stop are you gonna take slat up on that offer you know fly out to new york you know what i'm flying to america but not for slap i'm also in new york too you could you know i'm willing if you were if schlapp was down to to share you if that was something you want because here's the thing i am pretty open-minded you know even the fact that you might smell like that's not a problem for me because i think it's pretty likely that you're gonna stink a bit uh have you ever considered making your name just a stinks what the [ __ ] bob have you is that no why would i why would i think about changing my name to just stinks first of all i don't even stink second of all even if i did sink why would i be public about my stick why would i call myself just the stinks am i gonna go on the the austin show this thing's chosen no it doesn't [ __ ] work bob no i'm never george not found your love is just a stinks the thing is mink's like i don't want to be alone right i want to have a woman in my life but what if i'm if i'm no good for them you know what happens if i'm just too useless as a human being to make another person happy it almost leads me to believe that i should maybe just jerk off and just leave women alone because even say you you're someone that i desire what happens if i know that will end in misery say if we have three good months of happiness and bliss and it ends in tragedy is that worth it would you still have those three months with me knowing the end how how would it end in tragedy bob what are you gonna [ __ ] do it's not the titanic we're not gonna start [ __ ] sinking sadly what do you mean by end in [ __ ] tragedy what happens if everything's perfect and then i just realized that i don't love you because you're just not hot enough well then bob i would be livid i would be i would be very angry at that farm that is a tragedy for you you would not make it back to america if you spend three months with me and then you suddenly turn around and go yeah you're just not hot enough that i'm falling out in love with you i would probably murder you on the spot in a video game torch no you could it could be not in a like i'm okay in that situation if you murdered me i'll consent to that bob you want to know something yeah i'm i'm starting a new plan a new idea yeah yeah yeah let's hear it i'm the the desperate girl online you know i've i've gone on probably even though i'm newer than others on the show i've probably gone on more love or host than anyone else at this stage yeah i mean if you go on the next show after winning oof but like they got to put you on because you're the only funny girl but keep going oh wow thank you bob that's very kind just kidding casey is way funnier go ahead that's just hurts my feelings anyways yeah go ahead go ahead yeah i i've decided to take a turn where i'm going to not simple anymore i'm not going to act desperate in fact i'm going to be happily single i'm going to live my life as a single streamer and then it'll come to me but then i'm still not in the right mindset because i'm still kind of fishing and looking if i'm expecting it to come to me i don't know if i believe you i think i'm going to be coming in like i'm just going to start hating men like an intel because i can't get anyone i just hate everyone but if i offer you like do you do you want to date me let's just put this to the test do you want to date dude no you can't do that right now bob because if i say yes then i'm going again i know that's why i want to put it to the test because minx here's the thing i don't believe you i i think this is a front i think that all it takes is is one nice sentence and you'd fall for me and i could put that to the test right now okay thanks i wouldn't mind growing old and fat with you what the [ __ ] bob how the [ __ ] every time i give you a [ __ ] chance to redeem yourself you somehow come out with are you calling me fat again no no i'm saying no no no no growing old and fat like you are young and skinny but we could grow old and fat together i'm gonna be fat again i've worked so much to lose this weight you're just saying that everything i've worked for to to not be a fat con has gone out the window that's what you're saying can you uh can you say that that i'm pog champ i'm not gonna do that thanks please no thanks ever part of this is like i want to do a stream with you because you're always so fun to talk to and i just wanted to build confidence back up to maybe stream again and i feel like it would really help with that confidence if you genuinely said on pogchamp don't do it because i'm forcing you to say it right now please don't say it because i'm forcing you but please just honestly tell me that i'm pogchamp maybe maybe i have to give you a reason to call me pogchamp you know let me think of something really nice to say to you minx are you are you a parking ticket because you have fine written all over you bob you are so weird champ i thought you were gonna say pog chant how moist are you right now i'm like on a sk on a scale of negative five to five because like negative five would be like cobwebbed where it'd be it would be crusted shut and five would just be like a like a bucket of water yeah i would say maybe negative two negative one really so so you're not you're not like at the sandpaper territory but it's now how could i be what i'm talking to you about i think i think i could fix that i really i think i could get up to a three by the end of this three by the end of this yeah i mean okay right i'll let you know where we are by the end on voicemeeter bob i need your opinion on something yeah do you is it weird that i'm not being loud shouty and cursing this is this is i'm trying this new thing for a week and then i'll revert back to my old ways but it won't be as severe see i'm for a week i'm trying to be quiet non-showy you're awesome i'll accept you however you are mix i really will i actually think that maybe you were even funnier on the george not found show because sometimes you'll rely on being vulgar you know you'll go the the amy schumer out where you'll just be like oh [ __ ] my corn and then you won't actually use your brain to think of something funny so then because you couldn't curse you couldn't go for the lowest denominator joke maybe you ended up being a little bit more likable and especially like with the after date in the minecraft i thought it was wonderful i didn't expect to watch it but then you just kept being so funny you were just oh my god you do a joke and then i'm just like no way she could do another and then you just did another joke and then it's just like no she can't she can't top that and then then you spit on him i'm minus three right now bob you actually are close to my ideal woman because i i do remember close yeah because i just haven't learned enough about you to confirm that you've checked all the boxes and i do remember i was at a point where i was pretty sad and i think when people are sad sometimes that they do turn to religion it's it's just like an inevitable thing i feel like sometimes you either get really rich and then think life is pointless and then you turn to religion because you'll have nothing left but god or you're really poor and then you have to turn to religion that's also the case but so i was at a point where i was praying i was genuinely praying and then once i met you i realized that my prayers had been answered i don't know why but i was really into the store like genuinely thinking you were i was actually listening i was listening for once bob i was listening i was listening for once you [ __ ] i thought you had a story for me what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] bob you think we're approaching a zero [Music] i'm back at minus two nice why do you why do you hide your laughter sometimes why don't you just embrace it if you want to smile just show the world because i think you do have a gorgeous smile and sometimes you cover it up you'll be embarrassed it's like oh i'm laughing i gotta hide because i'm i'm just the minks and i'm a character who doesn't laugh because if i laugh i'm breaking character so then you'll be like wait this is you this is this is i laugh all the time i laugh all the [ __ ] time you actually do look a little bit fictional right you know yeah yeah yeah honestly what does that mean honestly i feel honored to just be in the presence of someone that could easily be a rejected tim burton character [ __ ] call me [ __ ] corpse bride no no no no no no you would not be corpse bride you would be like a rejected tim burton character you wouldn't be one that makes the cut [ __ ] better bob it's no [ __ ] better it's always the [ __ ] timber and characters i don't look like a timber and character no no you don't you look like one that would be rejected i think i think there's a clear difference because you didn't make the cut have you ever been told that you're like too good for this world there's no way anyone's ever to why'd i even you ever ask a question you know the answer so then i asked her have you ever been told you're too good for this world why why would what in what is going through my head i know the answer to that question no of course not why would you ask it so bob i can invite you anytime on my stream yeah i would i will always make time for you with you bob yes it's even so if you're really busy i just want you to drop everything you're doing i don't i it doesn't matter if it's your wedding day if i'm like bob i need you on my stream you drop everything you're like anything for humans that's the end yes yeah of course what the [ __ ] so like you know you're you're you're at a funeral very important funeral and i'm like i need you bob like right now on stream you'll be like okay yeah and then i'd be in a tux too i would just be like yo i'm at a wedding what's up it would be pretty cool that's that's crazy okay that's cool you don't doubt that right you understand that i'm here for you really 100 of all people you know i feel like anyone else would like me can you repeat that what did you say what what did you just say what do you mean i don't know you i i don't know if you were mumbling or just in this having a conversation with me how do you know what no no the last thing that you just said though you're like no i didn't what i don't know i feel like sometimes i actually have a hard time understanding ugly people okay i'm one on the voicemeer i really i can't tell when you're being honest sometimes because i i do try and believe you right yeah like for example there's a lot of girls that say they're virgins on twitch yeah you are like the only one that i believe when they say it that's like such that is that is not a compliment makes can we just make a promise to be truthful with each other can we actually do that you actually uh i got sent a clip of you on the amaranth stream that you said that you called me hot um i was an example of someone that looks hot despite his awful hairline do you really mean that because we just talked about being truthful do you really mean can you can you honestly look at me and tell me that i still look hot should i say that yeah jd uh jd said it too oh yeah you know you could i could see a man one working for you bob that could fix your hairline you really think so thing but they always pull back their hair do you think i cover it up well or no i mean oh god i'm sorry jesus do you ever want to go into other forms of entertainment would you would you want to be in a movie that i'm shooting not not an adult film like what happens to a tv show like if i was doing a comedy would you want to be in it yeah bob do you think that do you actually have the skills to act because your fake crying is pretty [ __ ] and also i guess you might do better you might do i have going for me my crying everybody always [ __ ] believes it don't you dare you can insult everything i [ __ ] do but if you say my crying's bad it's only bad now because people know it's fake but before i i told before i i could have [ __ ] kept it going i just acted but it is good it's the one good thing i can do it's the only thing i can do do not stop my fake crying no one's ever asked you this will you be my girlfriend now you ca now that this has been asked you can't say that no one's not asked you i'll be the first schlatt's got no balls that's a ballless man right there he pretends to front balls but my man's a little insecure very funny very funny guy sometimes when you're insecure you could just get laugh after laugh but when it actually comes to his physical balls i don't know if there's anything there but me big balls and that's why i will ask you right now will you be my girlfriend yeah okay well you i expect no more tweets about i need a boyfriend because now you have one okay it's settled you're you're my girlfriend now now we could actually talk about more intimate stuff and more raunchy stuff now that now that i know that you're my girlfriend you even can put my name in your bio on twitter or like taken with her yes yes can i update that right now yeah taking my heart beside it edit profile instead of trying to find love boyfriend of at just a mix so now now we could talk about things that i wouldn't even dare say without you know being your partner you ever seen that porn where the camera is penetrating the woman the camera oh god ew what that's not real bob yeah no no no it will be sometimes they do the cameras on the end of the the penis too no you that's not real bob no that's real no it's not no it's not i'm not [ __ ] up from my history yeah no in internal pov you've never seen that bob you're [ __ ] lying no it's can you just take a second and can you google it it's weird to get it no oh my what about uh oh my god i'm gonna throw off that is disgusting i would say the dumbest thing ireland's ever done is what what the [ __ ] is st patrick's day dude green it's a good color but like what are you doing like with the leprechaun and [ __ ] the shamrock [ __ ] factory the audacity the one thing we [ __ ] have you guys got the fourth of july ours is an actual we got [ __ ] st patrick then chastity do not disrespect st patrick's day like that instead you know what you guys take our [ __ ] st patrick's day and you change it to your own [ __ ] thing you change it to stage patty's day t-t-y-s it's not say [ __ ] patricia's day it's not saying [ __ ] patricia day paddy is short for patricia it's patty p-a-d-d-y you're disrespecting our saints by calling them saint patricia when their name is named patrick let's let's actually explore that a little bit okay so okay fourth of july we celebrate becoming independent by gathering together to have some barbecue shoot some cool ass fireworks and truly be together for st patrick's day you guys just pretty much promote alcoholism you guys just get [ __ ] wasted and just act like this is normal i'm gonna be so stressed i'm gonna be so [ __ ] stressed because now it's like the apocalypse again we've done so good we were slowly turning ireland into a non-alcoholic place i'm telling you that [ __ ] straight the [ __ ] town the little [ __ ] village near me is gonna be [ __ ] swarming like a [ __ ] it's terrible why are they opening during a pandemic the irish cat metal by themselves they see alcohol they see red that's all they care about you pass them a bottle the bottle will be gone we are genuinely alcoholics here bob and i didn't realize until i went to america and i'm fearing for the irish they're gonna [ __ ] die off by being too drunk this is a weird thing okay so then do you agree with me about st patrick's day date then and like you know it's it's a little bit concerned patrick they get drunk anyway that's my bloody [ __ ] point you dot [ __ ] did you notice that you're you're being a little bit more classical minx right now do you know
