ship and three days of premium time as a bonus and let's get into it because today we're answering a viewer question because M's Silverman asks us why on the windows aligns with the rows of seats on planes while airplane manufacturers do design the planes with general row positioning and pitch the measurements from one seat to the same exact point on the seat in front or behind it in mind with the windows often lining up with the seats the designers exact recommended arrangement is rarely if ever followed you see the final placement of seats is left up to the individual airlines that purchase the plane to make the seating arrangement as flexible as possible for airlines there are multiple tracks on the floors that the seats are mounted on this allows the seeds to easily be moved closer together or farther apart the airlines can even switch the aisle arrangement via moving a line of seats to a completely different track for example on some versions of the Boeing 777 Boeing recommends a layout of three plus three plus three with a 32-inch 81-point to send me to pitch for Economy passengers in this layout you need a passenger density of 67% before a passenger may be required to sit next to someone else and if some passengers choose to sit next to one another the percentage is even higher before other passengers must sit next to someone boeing recommends this they are because in internal studies they've conducted they claimed that one of the biggest factors in passenger perception of comfort on a flight is whether or not there is someone sitting next to them nevertheless disregarding the manufacturer recommendation pitch on a given class of seats on the 777 varies from airline to airline resulting in the seats not necessarily lining up with the windows and it is not uncommon for airlines to choose to go with an arrangement of two plus five plus two in Economy on this plane which requires only a passenger load of 55% before people potentially have to start sitting next to each other for reference United Airlines flies at around a 70 to 75 percent passenger load per flight on average on that notes as is readily apparent to any one who's flown recently for various reasons airlines are increasingly less about the comfort of their customers who often have little other choice but do take planes for fast long distance travel atoms they're more about how much money they can suck out of each flight since passenger seating is the biggest moneymaker for airlines they try to cram as many seats as possible on a plane beyond profitability this also allows them to be more competitive with their pricing to try to get customers to choose their line over a competitor this is particularly important for relatively short flights where customers almost always pick ticket price over comfort no matter how much they'll later complain about that miserable flight towards this end only a few decades ago the average pitch between seats on commercial aircraft was 34 inches eighty six point three centimeters but today this is diminished to just 31 inches that's seventy eight point seven centimeters with even 28 inch 71 centimeter pitch seats now starting to be introduced a lines are not only shrinking the pitch between seats but also in some cases of the width despite the general populace as ever expanding girth for instance while 18 inches 45 point seven centimeters or more was once the norm for Economy Class 18.5 inches still being the recommendation by Boeing for economy seats on the 777 Rose's narrow is sixteen point seven inches forty-two point four centimeters are not unheard of today for reference the average adult's shoulder width is approximately 16 inches though of course vary significantly from person to person and whether or not the person is male or female if narrowed enough on certain planes this allows for an extra seat in each row for example the Airbus a330 was designed to have eight seats in a row but it's not uncommon for airlines to use thinner than the recommended width of seats to accommodate nine seats in a row on this aircraft and if you're wondering according to Cynthia Corbett of the FAA there is no set rule for how many passengers and seats can be crammed into commercial aircraft and the exit rows are even allowed to have the seat blocked the exit by up to fifty percent the only caveat is that the FAA requires all commercial aircraft to be able to be fully evacuated in less than 90 seconds with half of the exits blocked this must be demonstrated by manufacturers in both computer simulations and in life tests and we've got more on the inherently flawed nature of this testing in the bonus section which follows shortly but for now next time you're on a plane and the window doesn't line up with your seat know that the reason behind this is because the airline used a different seating plan than the plane manufacturers recommendation generally this was in order to cram more seats into the aircraft and save money and do not forget to stretch your legs and flex your leg muscles occasionally on a long-distance flight and whatever way you can manage given the tight quarters we have a diminishing our legroom aboard commercial flights is resulting in more incidents of flight induced venous thrombosis so regular stretching and movement while flying might just save your life now the good news is that flying is massively safe and those health concerns are probably your biggest concern on a plane premium times a bonus just for registering and let's get into something a little different a bonus discussion which we hope your comment on below this video while no regulatory body is much concerned with the windows lining up with the seats on commercial aircraft numerous consumer issues concerning the current state of airline travel in the United States did spark the formation of the Department of Transportation's Advisory Committee for aviation consumer protection in 2012 in 2015 they specifically began looking in depth at Airlines cramming more and more people into flights and in the process uncovered the many safety issues that this results in to begin with the recommended crash position that has been proven to minimize injury and death in the event of an airplane crashes to bend forward with essentially your head in your lap the problem is that with the ever diminishing pitch more and more people cannot physically assume this position given how close the seat is in front of them this is compounded by the fact that new slimline seats with hard rather than padded backs allowing for the saving of a couple of inches per seat to accommodate more rows of seats have been introduced so in the event of a crash not only can those of the pall of persuasion not necessarily assume the crash position but there is a strong risk that they'll smack their head against a very hard seat back in front of them in these types of emergency situations of course this could all be solved very easily without any real modification to most commercial planes via implementing the safety recommendation of dr. John Paul Stapp one of the 20th century's leading badasses and on the side crash test expert both in aviation and in automobiles he's also the guy who named and popularized Murphy's Law the more on his incredibly fascinating story ins just how much of a badass he was go check out our video titled who was Murphy in Murphy's Law so what was dr snaps recommendation well that was to simply turn passenger seats arounds to face backwards as this is drastically safer in crashes and at least in aviation it would be simple to do on any commercial airliner requiring no modification other than to simply turn the seat arounds in its track as staff and subsequent research by NASA shows humans can take the most g-forces and receive fewer injuries with the eyes back force where your g-force is a pushing you back into your seat with the seat cushions themselves also blending a hand and overall safety this also ensures tall people won't smack their heads and bodies against anything in front of them in a crash despite the massive safety benefits here for people of all ages outside of car seats for babies and toddlers few manufacturers of cars or planes seem interested in leverage rear facing passengers to save what would probably be at tens of thousands of lives per year when including automobile accidents so going back to commercial airliners and tighter spaces and other issue addressed by dr. Nia aller airs during the aviation consumer protection meetings is the Alpha mentions potentially life-threatening veinous thrombosis with less space for an individual to move their legs in flights over four hours long studies have shown a significant increase in instances of this condition in recent years two of the primary risk factors here are duration of the flight and height of the individual essentially the longer you certains the more tightly packed you are the more likely you are to develop this condition and to note if you're interested in avoiding VTE or are at a high risk of it you should know that you are twice as likely to develop VTE if you have a window seat compared to an aisle seat this is generally thought to be because aisle seat individuals by necessity have to stand up more than those who have window seats not just for themselves but because they often have to stand up to let other people in and out of the aisle an RC passenger is also able to occasionally stretch their legs into the aisle where as at present pitch levels many window seat passengers cannot easily stretch their legs as much government affairs association of professional flight attendants representative julie frederick also noted while addressing the Advisory Committee for aviation consumer protection that the present high-density passenger seating has led to a rapid rise in air rage incidents which are generally centered around personal space issues most notably among the triggers for these incidents is a passenger leaning their seat back resulting in approximately three-quarters of all air age related incidents due to the decreasing pitch they're often simply isn't any room to lean back without ramming your seat into the knees of the person behind you in the case of individuals over 6 feet tall 1.83 meters their knees may already be pressed up against the upright seats with no room whatsoever for the person in front to recline this inevitably results in arguments over who has the right to those few measures of space frederik also has noted that there are over 50 medical emergencies per day on flights in US airspace about seven percent of these require emergency landings but with increasingly overcrowded planes flight attendants are more and more difficult to not only get to the passenger in need quickly but also to find the space they need to deal with any medical emergency to sum up the association of professional flight attendants stance on modern passenger densities aboard commercial aircraft rhetoric noted the responsibilities of the flight attendants are expanding every year from security and safety to medical emergencies flight attendants are asked to do it all we know all too well that we are the last line of defense on both sides of the cockpit door as high-density seating increases we believe that both the regulators and air carriers management's will need to look closely at the causes and effect that packing them in has on safety security and not just the customer experience all that said while the modern seating arrangements on a percentage of commercial aircraft have become almost intolerably uncomfortable in economy class all commercial planes and general seating arrangements still must be designed such the passengers can all exit the plane in under 90 seconds with half of the exits blocked unsurprisingly when planes fail these tests the solution often used is not to reduce the number of passengers or give them more room to move but to increase the number of exits however as mentions there is significant controversy over these tests while the testers do many things to simulate a real crash evacuation the live testing scenarios can never actually accurately simulate real-world crash situations owing to safety concerns for the test subjects nevertheless the testers do try if I randomly blocking half the exits not even the flight attendants know which will be blocked in a given test restricting visibility by using emergency lighting only using humans of all ages in the tests including dummy infants first some people to carry and randomly placing luggage around the cabin and aisles of course even with all of this the passengers all know they are there for evacuation testing so actually pay attention to the normal evacuation instructions something real-world passengers almost never do they are all so calm and can think rationally there's no smoke or any such a visual or breathing impairments and on his injured they're not trying to get their children perhaps in another row away from the closest exit before evacuating and they must pass a physical fitness test before being allowed to be a test passenger for safety and liability reasons so don't accurate represent the general public unsurprisingly from this say 2013 Canadian Safety Board study determines this in real-world evacuations the 92nd evacuation time is rarely met even though many planes don't fly full and accidents don't necessarily block or disable half the exits while this is a concern korban noted that 90 seconds is not some magic safety number it's just a relatively low number two make sure manufacturers at least put some effort into making sure passengers can exit a plane quickly in the event of an emergency specifically the time was set somewhat arbitrarily based on one primary factor fire the flash burn fire event time on a typical aircraft when the rule was instituted was about 120 seconds furthermore if you happen to survive a significant plane crash by far those dangerous thing to you in most cases according to Frederick is smoke inhalation so getting out to fresh air as rapidly as possible is key to minimizing passenger deaths that occur after a crash it should also be noted that according to Frederick in a 35 years of experience in the flight attendant industry it isn't an accurate assessment to assume people will panic in the event of a crash even a major one in fact she notes that in such situations most people actually go into as she described it a space out mode which is why flight attendants aren't trained to shout instructions of passengers to break them out of their trance and get them doing what they are supposed to be doing essentially in her experience in real-world accidents many people's reaction is just a freeze and not do anything unless they are told this perhaps indicates that an automated redundant emergency evacuation system that gives clear loud instructions with writing lisara's pointing to the nearest exit from a specific seat might be beneficial to help the flight attendants out and help the passengers know where to go when a potentially smoke-filled cabin where the nearest exit might not be visible on that note both Corbett of the FAA and Frederick of the a PFA states that in real-world scenarios the biggest issue regarding safety and plane evacuations is not the former flawed evacuation testing but simply that almost nobody pays any attention to the safety briefings despite efforts by some airlines to make them entertaining though we must say from our personal experience that entertaining here is a bit of a massive stretch so look any airlines out there if you want a bit of a making an entertaining and educational video well you know you to call in any events as Corbett and Frederick posit passengers having their eyes glaze over or looking back at their phones three seconds into the presentation leaves many with no real knowledge of what they're supposed to do in the event of a crash nor where their closest emergency exit is and if you're now wondering will just conclude with noting that the safest place on a plane to sit is statistically in the rear in fact your approximately forty percent more likely to survive a crash if you sit in the back of the plane rather than in the front the other advantaged the rear is that most passengers choose not to sit at the back so unless the plane is full you might get the row of seats to yourself another factor to consider is where the closest exodus as a general rule studies examining accidents have shown that you want to sit within six rows of an emergency exit to maximize your survival chances so if the plane doesn't have a rear exit that's something to be factored in if it does have such an exit which is a relatively common and for some reason you're worried about dying on a form of transportation that is literally statistically safer than walking well reserve that rear seat so I really hope you found
