good afternoon everybody if you can hear weird licking sounds in this video it's cuz Nellie is there giving himself a little clean but before I jump into this video I wanted to kind of explain something this was supposed to be a proper makeover video we can be painting the walls going out shopping to buy everything for it I've been filming it over the space of a month and I had it all edited and I was so excited to like get it out there but yesterday my computer wouldn't let me actually save the finished video because it said my storage was full so I deleted loads of stuff and I accidentally deleted five videos that I've been working on five including the month long bedroom makeover video so I no longer have the actual makeover footage but I'm gonna flush on screen what this room looked like before I did to give it a little makeover before I kind of like made do with the furniture I had and stuff but I never really loved it so I thought I would give it a whole nother makeover and I absolutely loved it so much it's very different for me there's no pink in this room which is just crazy am i okay but before we get cracking months free linked in the downbar we're gonna get on with this room tour now let's go it's time to show you my finished room I'm so obsessed with it I think it looks gorgeous so I'll just do a little pan around first so you can see it so let's start on my bed obviously this is my bed it's the IKEA Tarver cost about 120 something pound for a king-sized and I've had it for two years now and I love it I got this gorgeous bed in from Urban Outfitters if I could be bothered to iron I would have ironed it but it's fine then I've got my gorgeous Matalin cushions I have these in every single room just cuz they go with everything I actually changed the back cushions they were a pink velvet and I changed them to this like weird khaki greeny brown color these are from H&M I always love having a big pillow at the back and then we've got my side tables from swoon Editions and these lights are from Ikea then as we go up I'm not entirely sure how I'm gonna show you these because the window reflects ah there we go the other side is better so I've got these prints from society6 I'm not entirely sure how you would describe these they're just a bit space-age I'm gonna leave them in a link below because I've had so many questions about them and I really do like them I think they pull the room together really well but I think they would look better in white frames I'm sure how I feel about the black ones let me know so around this side obviously I've got my side table and light again and then I've just got a little basket down below which has like my moisturizer and my tablets and stuff and then up here I've got this print Bonjour Madame and I've got this at all hanging plant which i think looks so cute here I really like it so this section of my room will be changing in February I'm getting a storage bench built in so it's gonna go from this corner all the way across and have like a nice velvet cushion on it and have drawer space and stuff but for now I thought I would just put these drawers here I feel like they look okay for now so these were from Ikea I really do like them and they've just got my makeup on so I've got like all my lipsticks and my palettes and stuff and then at the side of it I've just got this plant which was from Ikea if you want to see what happens to this section of my room and you want to see the storage bench built in definitely subscribe to my channel and stick around so I will of course film it hello then right here I've just got this little box this was from tiger it opens like that and it's just got spare beauty blenders and stuff in I just liked the way that looked moving along to this bit I've got all of my electric things that are used for vlogging so that kind of has to stay there and then another little hanging plant from Ikea and now we're moving on to my favorite part of the room so I've got my TV mounted here I love this TV it's a Samsung Smart TV one of the newer ones and it's so nice to sit in bed and like watch Netflix and YouTube it's my favorite thing then on top of my fireplace I've just got these crystals is that what they called gemstones or crystals let me know I liked the look of all of these so I picked them up in the Natural History Museum and I just thought they looked really cute there if we go up I've got this little hanging which was from Amazon and then another print I love this one as well she turned magic and then I've got another hanging up there and I just think this section looks really cute then if we go down I've got this bird-of-paradise plant I will leave a link to where I got this as well everything in this video will be linked if I can find it love adding a little bit of greenery in a room and then this pot was actually from Amazon and then if we come round to my desk area this is what inspired the whole so ever since I moved in here you might remember in my last but you makeover video I said I really wanted a dressing-table area but I couldn't have one mounted on the wall the world isn't strong enough so I just kind of made over my room based on that but I still did want a dressing table area so I found this it's actually a console table which is meant for like the hallway but I thought it would be the perfect desk it holds all of my makeup as you can see I've just got all four drawers filled with makeup and that was from La Redoute I do have to say though wait until they have a sale because their sales are incredible I think I got this like 200 pounds this is actually from the Ikea outdoor section I just really liked the way it looked and because this is a console table the drawers go a bit lower so you need like a lower chair to be able to fit your legs under so yeah I found that for about 20 pounds in IKEA and I thought it went really nicely then if we come to this section I always use plant pots to hold brushes I've just got my makeup bag and my plant mister and on this side I've got these pots from Urban Outfitters and this little leopard cheetah from Tiger with my lip liners in and then obviously on top of my makeup desk I've got this mirror which was from habitats I love this mirror I've got two of them in my flat they just work really nicely i when I nearly forgot to mention this rug this is from Ikea I was gonna have it in my dining room but I thought until I get my wooden floor it would be nice to have one under my bed my wooden floor is coming hopefully in February - so stick around for that it'll change this whole place I think and that is my bedroom now feel like you should have done this from the start but it definitely took me a few months to figure out how I wanted this room I love it so much let me know what you think in the comments I can't wait for my storage bench over there I think it's gonna look gorgeous a one last thing that I didn't mention is this light you can't remember the name of the shop now but I will of course link this below it's bloody beautiful I have similar ones in my dining room and I kind of like how they all tie together so yeah there we go that is my room Nelly giving it a little model so that is the end of my new bedroom makeover slash room tour again I'm really sorry that the actual footage of them is gone I was in mourning over it last night I cried like three times because it's taken me so long to put it together but hey ho I hope you guys liked this video anyway don't forget to check the
