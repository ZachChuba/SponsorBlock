welcome back to me rockstars I'm Eric vos and Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness director scott derrickson announced earlier this month that he was departing as director citing the super clear no follow-ups explanation of creative differences as a huge fan of Derek's ins work this was a bummer de year and as in past cases when Disney parted ways with directors like Edgar Wright and Lord Miller I wondered if this was just another case of studio interference with bold directors who don't want to play ball with the intensity of their precious cinematic universes but as days pass new details have emerged from the nooks and crannies of social media that are actually painting a clearer picture of what the second Doctor Strange movie plot was what those creative differences could be and what the movie might be going forward much of this information comes from the clues tucked in the outspoken Derek since Twitter history so that gives us an excuse to do our best to explain the rejected plot of Doctor Strange of the multiverse madness in another stars tweet damn okay let's time stone the clock back to last summer when dr. strained to the multiverse of madness was announced at comic-con it's got Derek send describe the project this way but when I came and talked to Kevin about doing a sequel I said I don't want to do just another sequel to do a sequel if I'm gonna do it it has to go into the territory that drew me into the Doctor Strange comics in the first place which is how they dipped into the Gothic and the horror and and the horrific and we're gonna make the first scary MCU films rewatching this moment it's fun to dive way too deep in the body language of these two men the moment derrickson says the word horror Maggie takes an uneasy step backward which might be nothing but keep watching [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know you know why no it's pg-13 you're gonna like it huh maybe I'm losing it but have we just picked up on figis poker tell with that ear tug and it's almost like Feige could not wait to backpedal on the dark horror promises of derrickson derrickson who before coming to the MCU made horror films like sin stir and The Exorcism of Emily Rose with foggy reassuring everyone that this would still be a family-friendly MCU adventure that we're used to still with a title like the multiverse madness many of us speculated on the cosmic horror influences derrickson could be drawing on like HP Lovecraft's at the mountains of madness where john carpenter's in the mouth of madness then jumping ahead to September 10th in which derrickson tweeted based on both my own experience and a recent conversation with five other tentpole directors the most common challenge / difficulty for event movie filmmakers is getting unwanted major script changes late in pre-production now we don't know exactly what derrickson was referring to here about a month later it was reported that Marvel Studios hired Jade Halle Bartlet to write a draft of multiverse of Manas Bartlet wrote the latest draft of the horror film the turning now previously it was assumed that Derrick's ins collaborator for the first Doctor Strange film novelist and screenwriter see Robert Cargill would be returning to write the sequel script and often with Marvel films they'll bring in multiple screenwriters to do passes like Thor Ragnarok had at least half a dozen screenwriters taking stabs at it throughout development but then derrickson posted more tweets that now looking back seem a little suspect like on December 16th he tweeted studio release dates are the enemy of art ooh two days after that he tweeted most major life choices come with major regrets it's unavoidable but the worst choice is not choosing at all hell is sitting down at the crossroads hell huh regrets huh choices huh all these words could mean something but all of this led to an interesting update from Kevin Feige on the multiverse of madness but download now from the link below okay back to pikeys Doctor Strange update during a recent Q&A Feige echoed that perceived uneasiness during Comic Con about classifying Doctor Strange to as pure horror genre multiverse of madness is the greatest title we've ever come up with by the way which is one thing that's exciting about it and I wouldn't necessarily say that's a horror film but it is as scott derrickson our director has pitched it it is it'll be a big MCU film with scary sequences in it the way when I was a kid in the 80s Spielberg did an amazing job I mean there are horrifying sequences in Raiders that I would say there's a little kid and do this when their face is melted or Temple of Doom of course or gremlins or poltergeist these are these are the movies that invented the pg-13 rating by the way they were PG and then they were like we need another but that's fun it's fun to be scared in that way and not a not a you know horrific torturous way but in a way that is legitimately scary cuz scott derrickson is quite good at that but scary in the service of an exhilarating emotion aha Mikey makes an important distinction here his favorite horror influences are the ones of Steven Spielberg's Amblin world in which dark horrifying supernatural events occur but stories typically balance out at the end with a nice sweetness to them an implication that there is a God in the world it's a good place if you watch your step based on what I know about Scott Derrickson his horror influences are more closely tied to John Carpenter's Stephen King HP Lovecraft the world is a dark place in which sometimes inexplicably bad things happen to innocent people and there's no logic to it hell is real and we're living in it buguese words from @qa were followed by a few surprising announcements in early January of this year one that one division which was previously intended to tie into the multiverse of madness was moved up from spring 2021 to sometime this year in 2020 second announcement the nearly scrapped did x-men horror spin-off the new mutants would in fact be linked to the MCU and three-d-- Erickson's announcement that he's leaving dr. change too and one interesting response to that was a tweet from filmmaker ISA Lopez the following day she was brought up by a fan as a replacement director maybe and Lopez said that she could never fill derrickson shoes and she said that the last thing Marvel would want is a deranged mexicana with a penchant for ghosts which prevents opening in China unconventional storytelling and a political agenda and derrickson liked to this tweet Lopez is referring to how Hollywood studios these days are increasingly catering to the Chinese film board which censors material to their audiences that may come off in their eyes as unflattering to the Chinese government preventing some films from making hundreds of millions more from the lucrative Chinese market Iron Man 3 aired a different kind of movie that included Chinese friendly scenes no movies with Brad Pitt or Richard Gere can release in China because they were previously in movies that were critical of China and there were rumors at the first Doctor Strange movie cast Tilda Swinton as the ancient one instead of the characters Tibetan comic origin in order to appease China which has a complicated political relationship with Tibet and in this case ghosts in the supernatural are also kind of tricky subjects for China like the horror film crimson ich was barred from Chinese release apparently because it featured ghosts though Chinese filmmakers have pointed out that positive depictions of spirits and ghosts would probably be okay but that in Chinese culture according to them negative and demonic entities have been associated with corrupt government officials so perhaps all the sheds light on derricks ins original plan for the multiverse of madness and why he parted ways with Marvel the most speculated villains that derrickson had brought up have been figures like nightmare in Mephisto who are straight up demons in the Marvel world nightmare comes from the dream dimension their existence brings that the existence of Marvel held Erickson's multiverse of madness could have looked something like mande revenge horizon with the sorcerer supreme without the time stone super vulnerable to protect this dimension from evil ghostly entities and then the hands grope and Stephen strange in the multiverse so revealed to be those of serial killers from the bottom ring of Hell your kids are screaming buddy you know you love it really the further horror derrickson wanted to go maybe the more he would risk depriving Marvel's big may 2021 hand pole release from hundreds of millions in China essentially if Disney as a studio wants to continue reigning supreme in the box office cash so they can afford their big Fox buyout and maybe someday buying out Stoney Spiderman properties none of their movies can ever go to hell now it is worth noting back into September Dirks and retweeted an animated gif of Walt Disney's 1929 shorts hells bells depicting Satan and his demons gathering for a wild party Cerberus is here it's lit and you can imagine goth filmmakers pining for an era when Disney wasn't so limited on the hellish depths that could explore that Plus disputes of rewrites plus Marvel's strict release schedule deadlines might have just made this project too untenable for derrickson and now instead of one division being tied to a horror project like multiverse of madness I think we may now be looking at a connection to the New Mutants which has softer pg-13 horror and now maybe a post-credits scene that links it with the MCU meanwhile fighty hinted at a new direction for multiverse of madness and not just to shift its horror elements from Lovecraft to Amblin but also in general to emphasize the multiverse over the madness the next Doctor Strange film for instance features some new MCU characters that will be making their debut in that movie that you won't expect or won't guess who it is but we founded cool way to make it work because we needed a particular we will want to make a particular type of movie there and there was a character we always wanted to do something with who we think will fit really well there unexpected new hims new characters sounds to me that multiverse of madness will be less of a journey into hell than a journey into the new brighter MCU multiverse to introduce figures maybe like Reed Richards or the mutants I know who do you think this new character will be and what director do you want to replace scott derrickson for multiverse of madness should we stick with horror directors good at nerdy adaptation like guillermo del toro or peter jackson Sam Raimi James Wan or should they really
