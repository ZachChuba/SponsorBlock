hey groupies welcome back from a therapy this is the culture study on the channels video producer and your host you can call me PD and today we are checking out Oh Tina by nature aka girls is the English title of the song now quick preface all Deena in Korean does actually not mean girls ah Deena means young child Audion means young and then M means child or youth now the English title girls is sort of in in that sense revealing a little bit more they're saying young girls right so we're gonna check this out hearing a lot of high praises for this a lot of people have been saying that this is quite something different for nature so you know I really really started checking out some more nature stuff recently so let's just get into it um Ponticelli is optional why don't you go ahead and just watch this video this is girls by nature and this is your former therapy [Music] okay very powerful impactful opening oh and it's a aesthetically it's very eerie and creepy - bouncing dance rhythm all the shortcut looks good on earth [Music] oh this pre-chorus is interesting the way she's singing in the way she's like elongated those words almost like more warmth I would sing a ballad [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay [Music] oh wow [Music] [Applause] [Music] even their outfits they're so unassuming leave oh that's cool [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] whoa whoa that was unexpected oh man nature really that really surprised me let's look at some of the previous nature title tracks let me see it's it's been a hot minute is nature the one that did oopsie my bad yeah okay so nature did previously I think that was their last comeback their last comeback was oopsie oopsie malbet and that was like the super intense like club track so they had the nature yeah nature dream about you hey there's my video um trying to find their other music videos it's just I'm getting like a lot of life stages all the nature kpop how about this time music video let's see oh yeah of course there got to me a paw now I got ya and then some Allegro con tabular okay so this is definitely this hasn't been done for nature this is a concept that is new territory for them and it looks like every few comebacks they do switch it up they do change things up I don't mean unlike all they change their concepts wildly but at the same time I feel like they don't have a definitive sound but I feel like they do pull it off incredibly well I think perhaps their definitive sound is more so very very loud loud in in your in your face in your ears type of music if you think about you know while all Deana while girls is a very different song compared to let's say oopsie or I'm so pretty all the songs that have in common at least with girls is that they're very loud they're very confident and they've got a lot of color to them and it's just I feel like the color of the song that changes not necessarily the group themselves and mind you I am someone who is all about a co a cohesive imager sound for a group but that's not to say that changing your concept can't be your concept you know but that's something you got to stick with you know some groups are not managed well to the point where like every comeback they're like let's try this let's try this this is popular let's do that that that is a bad way of switching up your concept I think the way nature switches up their concept is it's well thought out there's a lot of there's a lot of work put into it there's a lot of good coordination and strong push behind it and they do seem to at their core seem to know what kind of songs really make their music stand out or make the girls stand out at least this song Audino is incredible it's it's loud it's it's it's it's bombastic and it's kind of like like paired with the music video it's a little bit terrifying you know I mean even just their outfits like the like they're wearing such simple outfits and one of the scenes one of the dances there was just like white gowns it it looks like a nightie you know it's like you know like it almost like kind of signifies it's someone like the darker visuals you see in this video it's kind of like almost like if you ever watched like a horror movie especially older horror movies you know how like you know when the female character is sleeping in bed and she hears something at night and she gets up and I feel like that's what that white outfit and especially because they're dancing in a corridor like look at this image right here like they come out into this creepy hallway you know and it's like as if you just woke up at night and you're investigating something strange and look at just the absolutely gorgeous colors in this music video if you if you think about it you know all you really see is like a very big strong hints of very neutral colors and the only things that stand out and are really kind of punching up the scene are the red curtains a little bit of the red walls and then the black little indentation in the back where there's like the what is that is that not a trapezoid wouldn't it's not a cube either is it a cube no it's like a diamond I suppose the way that diamond structure is this scene is so you know it's so very shining esque you know you look at the pattern on the ground and like the wallpaper lining the bottom of the hallway it kind of has that old-school horror film esque inspired kind of bad design going on and I don't mean bad designers like oh this was badly made but I mean that's that was the sort of style of that era and so even though this is you know beige color walls are like my least favorite thing even like if you're a filmmaker and you're a shooter you know like shooting against like beige or white it's like one of the most difficult things especially beige because beige comes out really ugly it's like is it yellow is it white who the knows but they did such a good job with it because they accent it with the gold lights and they shoot it with these warm lights and then there's they over expose the girls on the subjects and it looks more like dramatic stage lighting and it's so incredibly beautiful it's it's it's I think it's one of the most like I feel like viscerally engaging music videos from nature from all the nature music videos I was I've seen I've seen at least more than five but I feel like everything about this is so inherently cinematic dramatic creepy and just the sound itself is incredible now one thing I want to touch that like look at the rust look at just like it's the scene is so ugly but also hauntingly beautiful at the same time now one thing I want to address is the same credible bridge section [Music] [Music] [Applause] let me hear that again let me hear the loser [Music] I think the lyrics are this harana pen an ordinary which is saying in front of my love I'm a childlike I regress into like a child in front of my love you know it's like when you're intimidated or you're scared right and perhaps that's like she was just wearing a blindfold it's like maybe it's like an indication of her being scared or like when you're a child when you're young you're scared like look at look at these images right here of her walking she's looking down a little bit sullen kind of like a scared child I wonder if that's actually the concept for this music video it's like that's actually really interesting it'd be really interesting if the song is like a typical love songs like they're saying when I'm in front of my love I become a child but then they learn and so they're talking about the fears of a child but then instead of like showing like a cute girl who's like afraid to tell like the person they like about their confession it literally manifests into this nightmarish sort of scenario that you see in this video but that giant loud chorus of just like the Sun on up in an Audino where they're shouting that unison oh my god it's incredible it's powerful it's one of the best bridges I've heard this year I I would say like it goes like the bridge and lunes is so what and then like golden child's the most recent comeback that bridge and then all dina for nature like this bridge is incredible it doesn't slow down as well it slows down tempo wise but then like like even though it slows down tempo wise like it's like bum bum it's a controlled rhythm and it's it's al even though technically it's slower it's bigger and more powerful and it almost sounds like an anthem and they're like screaming it out it's incredible it's incredible that they're able to pull off that effects so yeah I think honestly ten out of ten for naturist girls I think this is an incredible comeback I think they did an amazing job and this is is just wow this is incredible but
