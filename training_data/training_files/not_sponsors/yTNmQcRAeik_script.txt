Microhabits act like the compound interest
of self development. Frequency matters more than intensity and
microhabits are particularly easy to follow consistently. They have no direct impact in your life but
in the long term, theyâ€™re what provides the biggest change in your life. Here are the micro habits I followed or implemented
in 2019 and that I recognize that now, in December, made a profound change in my health
and my mindset. I hope you enjoyed today's video and I will
see you next week. Bye guys!
