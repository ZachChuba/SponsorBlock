this question has been asked the last few days on a couple shows who would you draft number one to or borough yeah this is a wild question because I understand that going into the year the tank for to a situation was a real situation I mean that was a real conversation - oh was this guy who came into Alabama was able to drop a ball into a bucket with his offhand remember he's a white dad forced him to be a lefty and he was able to pick apart defenses in the SEC something that Alabama didn't always do Alabama normally relied on the running back their offensive line and good defense and then - it gets in there when's a national championship by picking people apart and he was this proto style quarterback where he could sit back in the pocket he looked good and he could really dissect defenses and all these things top prospect everybody's eyes nobody even knew who Joe Burrell was we talked to Todd McShea Tom McShea said Joe Burrell was probably a fifth round six round pick going into this last season so whenever - uh yet again has another injury with his hip in his ankle and he's had three surgeries in two years and you watch this Joe burrow growth in an NFL offensive system like he had with Joe Brady as his offensive coordinator to think that you would still take an injured - who says he's gonna be healthy by April but do we know over a guy who has one of the hottest heaters right now in the history of sports who already has an NFL offense who has grown from 16 touchdowns to 60 touchdowns in one particular year to say that you would take two over Joe Burrell would be a very dumb thing but I do believe - uh with one year of you know rest one year rehab one year maybe learning behind a veteran quarterback could still be a very very good NFL quarterback but there's no way a GM right now could pick two over Joe burrow because if two of gets hurt that GM is immediately fired because everybody in the fan base everybody a new organization would say well no boy not me so that's a dumb question I think but I'd like the fact that it spurs conversation I just think Joe burrow is the obvious answer there he's earned it and well the Cincinnati Bengals mess it up maybe Carolina Panthers hires offense coordinator now everybody's like are the Carolina Panthers in play to make a play for Joe burrow if the Cincinnati Bengals mess this layup up mess up alley oop if they LeBron James that thing off the side of the rim and they decide to trade out of there and not get a new franchise player a new face of the team an Ohio kid that looks like he would love that opportunity if they end up trading out of there to get more pics and let somebody else pick them up they are gonna look stupid but I think that's what Bengals fans have come to expect of the Bengals organization I just don't think there's any chance they'd do it but if any team was to do it the Cincinnati Bengals or the Detroit Lions now people would say this is driving the price up on bro but bangles coaches are already talking the borough checks all the boxes yes seeking now back to the magic he checks all the boxes and he's from Ohio which is just a hole down level for Ohioans I would assume in the fact that the Athens County Food Drive and he's already a hero to the state he's on this incredible heater he smoked cigars he's his Midwestern I mean it's just he's everything that you would want if you're the Cincinnati Bengals organization but look for teams to try to bait the dum-dums at the Bengals out of that situation to make a mistake then potentially miss out on a franchise player also look for a lot of smoke screens from teams that are behind in the draft to build up to a to be better than Joe burrow just in an attempt to hopefully persuade the Bengals to build up to a there's a lot of smoke screen there's a lot of misdirection there's a lot of teams that are hoping to make other people make other decisions it's a lot of chess a lot of poker a lot of setup I think Joe burrow is just the perfect candidate for the Cincinnati Bengals this is just like when Andrew Luck was taking visits he was at the Colts he took a visit to the Colts before the draft and I have to see him there and West Virginia's our tie his dad was the athletic director at West Virginia at the time he knew a lot about Morgantown and all that stuff so you know he knew who I was and obviously I knew who he was and I was in a training room and he walked in he was meeting everybody else I can dream what's up man your life's got to be pretty hectic he was like yeah I gotta go Washington Redskins tomorrow whatever and I was like why like have we not already told you we're drafting he was like oh well I have to take all the visits bad yeah well if we don't draft this guy I mean we're making a mistake and he couldn't say anything but it was still like he had to do all is you know his visits and things like that there's stuff that's gonna start happening it's gonna come out about how good two is and all this stuff they're gonna be trying to persuade the bangles then for some reason to take to obscenity Oboro and then honestly if the bank was messed this up if the bangles trade out of there and let another team get jobber oh I will love it I will absolutely love it because it gives us a lot to talk about but bangles fans wouldn't deserve it I think Joe burrows obviously you want a dumb take yeah a team that could do it and has the mo to do it Jacksonville they have two first-round picks from LA in this year in next year's draft so if four first-round picks the next two years well I what the Jacksonville wouldn't be dumb to do that I don't think Jackson the bangles would be the ones that gets dumb to do that the bangle is not having a franchise player I mean Andy Dalton got a lot of wins for the Bengals the Bengals won a lot of games people forget that the bangle is in not so far history right like I think like four years ago five years ago they'd win like 11 games 10 games they were in playoffs they were doing all these things they just never got over the hump then it obviously all just started to spiral out of control a lot of Bengals fans say the Marvin Lewis doesn't get enough credit by the way for winning hmm hey won a lot better season they had a lot of players though too I mean they had a lot of good players you remember who shman sada back in the day in Ocho and hold Carson Palmer was there and it good offensive line there for a while there was never able to get over the hump and now after this last year whenever they were trying to win and they just couldn't do it a lot of people ask the question of the bangles think are they gonna stink forever if they trade out of that first pick and choose not to get their French as player I would say that they're they're destined distinct forever the first five years that thought was there they had nine wins 10 wins 11 wins 10 wins and 12 wins that's what don't and I'm getting credit either now because he obviously has that delicious ginger hair that quite a grow up whenever he he he doesn't get any credit for being a good football player got benched this year on trade day on his birthday then gets brought back wins the game loses a game I mean Andy Dalton doesn't get nearly enough credit as well but the Bengals have never been able to win that
