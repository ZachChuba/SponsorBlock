yeah we wanted to we wanted to just do a little Q&A if you have any questions for 10 minutes or so and try to answer them if you do what is the hundred million dollars do for the iPhone community well I think the hundred million dollars is because kleiner perkins believes that there's an opportunity to invest in a lot of small companies that are going to jump on to developing for the iPhone and we think it's fantastic because you know we love young developers young innovative developers developing their applications and a lot of them need funding and this is going to help them a lot Kate kleiner perkins loves it because that's the business they're into is of finding young entrepreneurs with talent and funding them and hopefully these companies grow into larger companies so I think it helps the whole ecosystem surrounding the the iPhone and the developer community
