protection for your phone check them out at the link below so we are here in the LG secret meeting room whatever it is this was the only place that we could actually get close to this thing and it might not look like much we got a speaker bar thing here we got some art here and then two clicks of this button and bam we've got the rollable TV so this is their OLED TV R which is short for revolution but we really think they should call it the Rho LED nothing nothing nothing alright so there's a few different ways you can use it you can use it completely unrolled you can use it up partially and there's kind of some smart applications you can see the time you can check the weather that kind of stuff or you can close it down entirely oh I believe the halfway up also has music support there's a there's a gallery thing that you can do you can even start your music playing roll the whole thing down and then you've just got this discreet looking speaker that blends in with pretty much anything not that of course you'd want to just use it as a speaker because this thing is one heck of a TV now you guys are probably thinking there's got to be some kind of compromise to the image quality because of making it rollable but in actuality this is exactly the same tech that we've all we've already seen I mean LG's been showing us their OLED panel technology and all kinds of different form factors for years now this is just the first time aside from that short-lived sort of curved TV thing that we saw for a bit there this is the first time that we've actually seen dynamic rolling in a consumer product and the way that they've done it is really cool so on the show floor we got a lot of b-roll of this thing but we weren't actually able to get that close to it well here we can so it's actually got these arms at the back that I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna lower it you can see what they're gonna do is they're gonna kind of fold onto themselves and then we can't really see exactly what's in here we know that there's a four point 200 watt speaker setup we know all the i/o and all the power for it is in here but we can't see exactly how tight the TV rolls up but we have to assume that it's going to be I guess as loosely as they can now there's a couple things about the mechanism that we do know we know that it's rated for 50,000 rolls and unrolls so that would be four times a day for 32 years and we also know that it's extremely quiet that was a big question mark for us down on the show floor we weren't sure but yeah it's actually really impressive how quiet it is now back to things we don't know when they're gonna ship this thing how much it's gonna cost we could make some guesses given that this is their signature line and these are generally kind of supposed to be eye dropping as oh my goodness as opposed to a great bang for the buck but frankly I'm not even gonna bother I'm just gonna sit here and admire the cool tech now we're about to head downstairs and check out the 8k displays that are supposed to come on sale later this year but first let's look at something that's really not ready for primetime it is a great demo so this is their 88 inch crystal sound OLED demo and behind the panel are five of what LG is calling exciters it seems to be working basically there's three that are handling the mid-range on the bottom part of the panel and then two that are handling the highs and they're claiming that they're able to get 82 I believe 140 kilohertz frequency response out of this thing but honestly that's not what really blew me away what blew me away was the positionality of the audio so whether it's for watching movies or games they've got some really great demos where you can really like you can like feel the UFO moving across the screen and then somehow from bottom to top though I'm not sure exactly how they did that last part hopefully we're gonna see this coming soon because then we can do away entirely with the speakers and and all that other stuff I mean okay you'll still need to put your game console and like maybe your computer and your set-top okay okay we're not doing away with all this other stuff but but no speakers now we're down on the floor and this is the Z series yes the entire Z series is one SKU an 88 inch 8k OLED TV that has a number of kind of unique characteristics so number one is that it actually comes with this kind of artsy looking sort of frame style stand but you actually have to use it so we initially looked around the back of this thing and we were like oh that's kind of that kind of sucks because there's no vase amount there's no way to like really do cable management in a in a meaningful way and what if this height isn't right for you what if you want like a shorter or or or a taller stand so as it turns out the way that it actually works is you can take the whole thing off of the stand and it's got these kind of downward firing speakers and reflectors so you can just run it as a standalone TV if you want or you can put it on the stand now there's not a ton that we really know about it's got their new alpha 9 Gen 2 processor which helps with 4k to 8k upscaling as well as it uses AI to like do better noise reduction and all that kind of stuff and we don't really know when it's going to be available and we don't know pricing oh hi sorry I mean hey guys you know you're not gonna be able to get away from that until you stop saying it out - - kind of I'm just gonna like jump laughs again he's got an lg ground with his notes right beside the camera right now QT show I'm not even hiding it 5 seconds to memorize my nose that's not memorized that's checking your phone every 5 seconds so the launch is supposed to be sometime in q2 we have no price and it's got Google assistant and Alexa mmm-hmm so here's a bit of a better look at the fancy stand so that panel in the middle seems like it comes off for a vase amount and in that panel gives us the i/o we don't really know how this like cable management they've got going on here works but that's all kind of TBD what has a more basic stand is there nano cell 8k TV so just like that one the entire lineup here is one model a 75 inch model that's 8k nano cell equipped with the same alpha 9 gen 2 processor and their local dimming Pro which has twice as many dimming zones as their non pro but we don't know how many of the non Pro has so it's not that meaningful we have no brightness numbers on this but same thing should be available later this year the link in the video description guys don't miss any of our CES 2019 coverage probably the rest of it that you see will be after the show actually opens and there's not like sky jacks all over the place but that who knows
