hey guys how you doing joe here thanks for clicking on the video i'm with my dog scout we're up north in the middle of the forest plan for today is use some new camping gear i got set up a tarp camp out overnight i have an axe with me i have a small backpack i have a wool blanket for my dog i have a rock to cook some bacon on and to cook some steak on this is gonna be an awesome trip i haven't been out in like two weeks so i'm super stoked to be here for free okay enjoy the video it's 9 30 a.m i got here at around nine i've been walking around for a good half an hour so i'm starting to warm up i'm starting to actually get a little sweaty which i gotta be careful of it's this morning was negative five supposed to warm up to about negative two celsius and then drop down to negative seven celsius tonight so i do have a sleeping bag for me and scout will be warm in his wool blanket i've just been scouring the woods for an ideal location to set up right now i i'm in kind of like a cold well and if you look behind me you can see the the land kind of raises up so considering it's winter time i don't want to be in a cold well we're going to camp on like a little bit of a ridge there's not much wind so that's not really an issue the other thing i do want to look out for our widow makers there's a lot of right around this general area some big trees some soft trees and you have to be really careful around them what are you doing oh yeah oh i like it up here barely any snow too heck yeah yeah i'm liking this a whole lot look you can see the ground barely any snow up here lots of melt going on i'm a good six hours north of my house and uh the whole drive up here there was no snow at all i get to this property where i come there's a bunch of snow but back up in here on this hill not so bad i'm not trying to deal with snow on this trip i want to be like a on the verge of spring trip all right well considering i'm up here on this ridge i want to look for a specific spot i want to camp at tonight watch out i will uh i'm going to drop my backpack because if i'm being honest it's pretty heavy i got a lot of stuff in this backpack including scouts wool blanket so i'm gonna leave that up here it doesn't sit in the snow and uh go around and look for a suitable spot up on this ridge what i do want to look for is wind direction and widowmakers it's getting more sloppy over on this side up here is not so bad actually right here or sodas well nothing too promising that way i'm starting to think where i first originally came up onto this ridge is the best spot i'll have to do some like house cleaning moving stuff around yeah let me show you what i think i might do there's that solid tree standing up and i think i want to make my shelter going this way because that's the way the wind is going parallel but on this side there's not a decent tree there's this half fallen one but i feel like if i clean off the branches and take take this one completely out of there i can use that for firewood that's a solid piece of oak and test this make sure i it's not going to fall this might work this piece might work just high off too it seems like it will it seems like it's solid yeah she's up in the crook there too she's caught in a crook so that seems pretty solid to me i might do that so the wind is almost non-existent it's kind of going like this on like a 45 to what i am right now so that's even actually pretty good because if i tie this here and then there it's going to stretch it back that way or that way whichever way i want to do it it's all coming together it's all coming together i'll have to take this tree out but she's dead anyway that's a cherry so i'll be able to use that for firewood too i don't have big heavy duty tools let me show you what i do have so this is the setup i hiked in with i got my italian wool blanket on top of my hidden woodsman day ruck and for tools and then sorry i had my sleeping bags on the bottom for tools i have my 19 inch sandvik and i also have a silky gomboy but neither neither of those things are big tools it's okay though they'll work okay let's get this backpack ripped down and uh clean up my area just trying to create a place where i can hang my backpack okay pretty good pretty good so this has got to come off oh she's solid but she solid that one there this thing is packed to the nines i'll show you what i got a little bit here right now i'm just looking after or looking up right now i'm just looking for my saw wow that is some seasoned seasoned oak okay good i wish i had bigger tools i'll still use it for firewood but it's gonna take some doing okay one thing done it's already looking like home working myself up some warmth which is nice just again i don't want to get too warm so stripping down layers as i can okay let's get this cherry tree out of the way here [Music] go let's go let's go i love my dog you feel bad you feel bad for knocking my camera over okay that cherry tree is down i'm gonna clean up the little stump so it's a flat um flush and continue on just cutting these uh pine branches off this fallen pine tree so that i can set up my tarp here without fear of i'm cutting them as close as i can to the tree because they have resin in them it's a little bit like a fat wood type deal so i'll keep those and start my fire with it too double purpose [Music] there's my plane my area is cleaned out see scooter magoots there right where my tarps gonna go i've cleaned off the pine tree pretty good pretty good so i'm just hoping that that's enough space i think it is if i tie near higher up on the tree over there and i'll do it adorating adirondack wind shelter good boy you're good and that'll be the first time i'm using the tarp that i have with me now okay time to set up gearbomb action i just did a gear video that's going to be posted before this trip video so if you want to know about the gear i use on this trip click on the link and now the snow is coming down pretty readily i'm going to have to get my tarp set up and get all of my gear out of the elements now it's always fun i do that a lot hey shoot the gear video after i've been out here for a little bit and then gotta like pack all the gear back into the backpack and continue filming the normal video of the big video but okay i gotta do this and i gotta pee i gotta pee real bad it starts snowing pretty hard there for a second it stopped oh no it's still coming down a little bit not half as much as it was okay so i got my one piece tied up on the other side i'm gonna come to this tree this fallen tree and just do it on a diagonal like it is here i'm sure it'll be fine tie a top line hitch on both sides actually you know what i don't want a top line hitch on both sides because i want my my tarp to be able to stretch as far as it can and if you use a taut line hitch sometimes the rope doesn't start till out here when you tighten it up so i'm gonna i'm gonna re-tie that side actually too i know what i'm gonna do i know so my whole my whole point is between this tree here where i'm tying off and then be there it's not the longest distance so i want the tarp to have as much distance as it possibly can and with me tying a canadian j or sorry a top line hitch you can see you can see it doesn't start right at the tree right like the because it's taut pulling out here it makes the knot stuck not start out here instead of back here so i'm losing like a half a foot space and it might not be long enough to reach there i hope that makes sense so what i'm going to do so if i had a top lane hitch on both sides i would lose about a foot because it would be away from the tr both trees so what i'm going to do is tie a a jolin so like a bowling knot but tied incorrectly so it's called the jolin that way it's just basically a loop that i'm going to feed the running end around just a little loop and feed the running end through and that way it'll be cinched right up to the tree on this side and i'll only lose if anything on that side half a foot or whatever hopefully that makes sense to you guys i understand what i'm trying to say i do have a much mouthy way of explaining things okay so now you can see right taut to the tree and i'll be able to get more distance yeah excuse me i will tie a top line on this side because i do have to adjust the tarp after and all that stuff but i think it'll be fine okay shion considering this is white and it's winter time i'll try and keep keep an eye on where the case goes and the stuff that goes she's durable man this is not a sill nylon tarp this is definitely rip stop a little bit more heavy but very durable you guys have seen me use my um coyote tarp the yellow one for probably the better part of seven or eight years and that's the same deal as this so i want to do an adirondack shelter so i'm going to go on a on a diagonal i just want to make sure that this is a 10 by 10 it seems like it's square so we're going to go on a diagonal put the corner over and i want to go to the third tire i believe so if i'm looking there's one two three and one two three perfect next thing i gotta do is get some toggles and that'll be really easy considering i have all these twigs and little uh shoots grown all around me so there's one there's two one of the reasons for tying the top line hitch if this is too tight which it is i can go over and loose it up so okay it should should work now all i'm trying to do is and you guys have seen me do this a bunch of times but bend the cord put it through the tab easier said than done and then take the toggle and slide it through and that kind of locks everything in place there okay see slide it and all that fun stuff now the other side the tabs are a decent size on this tarp bigger than my coyote one so that's good i'll just tighten this back up do a little overhand knot so it doesn't slip okay she's sliding a lot i might have to get thicker toggles got a big little heavy duty uh steak here just a little bit too heavy duty it won't fit in the tab trim it down a touch i've been able to peg some out and i've had to tie some off the trees the ground's frozen and it's not in different spots so it's a little a little bit of work but not too bad hey buddy all right let's go around check out the shelter okay there she is i do have to do some adjustments pull it up a bit in the back like attach a piece of cord to that tab and pull it way out to get myself a little bit more taut and more room which is looking pretty decent go up or down and the back is gonna get pulled out like crazy which is gonna bring the whole thing in together oh look at that big old stump right in my way i'm gonna have to saw that down [Music] [Music] so so to attach it fold your paracord over run both through your tab and then through the loop you created nice and easy my plane my planes here so this tarp the small one is made by the same people who make this white one bushcraft outfitters you can find them online at bushcraftoutfitters.com we'll be right back after these messages from loud planes okay well now that the plane is gone this will be my ground sheet um i don't really need to put it underneath it's full blanket there's a couple cool things about this tarp that can be um used for two different purposes depending on the time of year you use it right just take my firewood don't even worry about it man um in the winter time you know especially if it's not like this if it's actually winter winter with white everywhere snow you're not seeing leaves on the ground this can be like an inconspicuous incognito kind of stealth tarp whereas in the summer time it can be a signal really right like this stark white against like green or the brown of grass or whatever could be definitely a signal so it's kind of cool um yeah i like it i like it so far i like how durable it is and uh i'm i'm anticipating getting it dirty i'm i'm uh just like a knife when you get a brand new knife and you like can't wait for the patina to get on it same thing with this white tarp like i can't wait for it to get just not white use usage so my thermarest neoair x therm this is a great sleeping pad uses all the time it's nice to have a sleeping pad that packs down small that still has a good r value this thing is just as fine in the winter time as it is the summertime which is awesome therm-a-rest neoair extherm so a sleeping pad is one of those things it's not really that fun right it's not a fun thing to buy it's not an axe it's not a knife it's not even a saw not even a backpack it's a sleeping pad right when there is opportunity to use natural materials for a sleeping pad i like to do it but that doesn't always come into play right it's not always allowed it's not always a good use of your time if i'm doing a canoe trip or a backpacking trip or whatever i'm not going to get to my site and make a bow bed that's just not going to happen you know what i mean when i backpack i'm backpacking anywhere from 10 to 12 hours a day i don't want to get to camp and have to make camp right that's why i have things like this i want to get there and just be ready to go but then again just for change too right like my last real trip i used bows this trip i'm going to use this i'm doing a little bit of a one backpack kind of thing the last trip was like super minimalistic this trip i wanted to bring stuff that i actually like enjoy using like um when i think of like yeah i want to go to the woods and bushcraft up a bit like my kit that i actually really like like that i know personally that i've used a lot but the backpack really doesn't fall into that because it's new and the tarp is new but i have very similar things that i know i like um previous backpacks by malcolm and previous tarps by bushcraft outfitters so my point is for this trip this is what i wanted to bring i wanted to like bring tools that i enjoy using and pieces of equipment too not just tools gear and everything my dog i enjoy my enjoy my dog i almost brought my twig stove we're gonna save that for my first uh either maybe i'll do like a hammock camp in the spring or my first canoe trip i do like to put the twig stoves away like after the fall and not bring them up till spring you guys got any plans for the spring any big canoe tripping plans or backpacking or anything like that now is really the time of the year that i i find like the outdoorsy people really start having that wanderlust right that like that's why like all the outdoor adventure shows are now this time of year late late uh late winter early spring kind of deal although we're still a ways out from early spring i'm sure it will snow quite a bit more still okay there should be sorry scout good boy okay so that's where i'll sleep that's where scott will sleep oh yeah relatively flat that'll do that'll do scout that'll do am i the only weirdo who picks things out of my dog's eyes like gunk and crust is that super weird let me know in the co let me know in the comments of how much weirdos oh man i'm glad to be out here guys i really am i'm so so needing this it's been over over two weeks since i've been out man it's like i need it i need to stay going out to keep my sanity good boy he knows not to step on the sleeping pad we don't go boys yes cook up some bacon and cook up some bacon pretty soon just walks away so i think the model of this sleeping bag is called the talon i'm not mistaken they came out with this a few years ago it's pretty decent why are you so close on my stuff why am i grill bro why open my grill okay i got that and fancy fancy joe has a new pillow look at that thing i'm super jazzed on this pillow i probably showed it a few times now soft got insulation in it packs down smaller than my down it's lighter than my down and it actually works as a pillow any good quality cold weather sleeping bag should have this just like this little pocket in the in the hood here where you can stick your backpack or your backpack or you can stick your pillow this one also has a yolk you can see here just like uh it goes around your neck that's pretty cool stick it right in there she doesn't go anywhere oh i'm looking forward to sleeping that's for me big guy that's mine so look at this setup you can actually fit two people in here like um wherever where scouts back there i can pull it like i could pull this tight you don't even get more room a second person could definitely sleep back there no problem so two people under one tarp if you're out you need to have like a lightweight shelter for for a couple people when there's no bugs like that's pretty decent man and then if it were to rain like people are worried about sleeping in tarps in the rain and stuff i would just pull this straight down you know what i mean you get a pretty good uh protection from that and i've also before used this 5x7 tarp that i have on the ground as a as a straight door so i connected it to this tie out and this coyote and it fits perfectly five feet that way or sorry seven feet that way and then five feet down and it's like a complete straight wall and the only openings you have are a little tiny gap on either side where you can use as a door so it's like and then also you can throw this on over top too for extra protection so it's very versatile i that the way i camped there like i said um with the with the 5x7 down in front i camped like that for at least two or three nights in the middle of the winter uh years ago i was camping with ken and kyle and those guys were intense and i was completely fine it was just as good as a tent i had all the room back there to store my stuff because i was single by myself in the tarp but anyways very impressed with tarps in general square tarps i do like okay gotta start making a base for my fire i'm gonna cook up some bacon for lunch i definitely don't need a fire all night long to keep me warm because my sleeping bag is legit so i'm not worried about burning wood all day long i don't have to conserve and in this immediate spot i see a ton of dead wood my only problem is the small tools again but that's okay you can chew on it but do not take it anywhere i'm burning that okay let's go you gotta move man gotta move all right that's a good base anyway nice and straight sorry nice and flat pieces see if i can chop this one without a secondary piece go on scope go on nice boy crying man just trying to find the way it sits best is more uh more of a challenge than actually chopping it or splitting it okay that's decent for my platform for some fuel now i'll grab some smaller stuff which again should be pretty easy man there's lots of stuff readily available right around here actually i see a lot of really gnarly burls now let's take you on and show you some of these barrels hey that's my firewood homie bonus points for anyone who knows what this is called this is a fungus and i've talked about it a hundred times my channel grows on cherry black knot of cherry aposporina morbosa so that's not the burl i was talking about this one is here look at that burl boy look at that burl there's lots more too all around actually on that same tree more it's like a canker why are you crying man seriously hey why are you crying why are you crying okay find me some sticks buy me some sticks get your stick get a stick where is it do you stick get a stick get a stick and come go do it okay okay so i figure i'll grab all the pieces that um i cut off that pine tree with the fat wood in them and i'll make some shavings let's go no you have to leave that stuff alone now go over here and lay down here here take this that's for you lay down now lay down good boy okay anyways i'm gonna take the the pieces that i cut off the pine tree that have the sap in them and i'm gonna just like make some curls or whatever the thing is the sap doesn't go up very far into the branches once you cut them off like it's like literally a couple inches or whatever um but it's okay i still have to make like some kind of like kindling or whatever so i might as well use it use the uh the resin from those pieces it'd be nicer if scout was in the way and you can kind of see but that's all right too i'm all i'm doing i'll explain to you i'm shaving wood i'm shaving wood i got my new newer adventure sworn mountaineer and using that uh i actually haven't been using it too much i got it a little while ago and um i haven't maybe only took it on one or two trips i think i took it with when i went with griff and scott and then i think i had it one time after that love and the knife though just super super sharp super bushcrafty and i need to get this closer up here so you guys can see let's go it's just thinking i'm teasing them here don't touch the knife buddy he's talk i'm gonna let him take it i'm just gonna let him take it so he goes over there no what are you doing he's coming back for more dude you took it already homie you took it it's yours it's gone don't come and think you're gonna take more getting bullied i'm getting bullied by my dog here bro not even a bully breed can you see it see all the resin in there fat wood this is like wax hey when you shave it but the reason it's so cool reason so good look at that just goes burns with that black smoke sorry maybe at the end with resin pouring out of it so that's all i'm doing i'm just going to collect a bunch of that stuff make fire lighting kind of fun and easy so i've got a lot of resinous curls here but it's kind of difficult because i'm only really going like this near the ends and it's not the easiest way to make curls and i've really used up all pretty much all the resin i've gotten to the middle of the wood where it's actual wood again not resin so i'm going to take a piece of one of the one of the piece of oaks i just cut or just split i mean try to find a nice spot to work this wood is so dance man split this down a bit hmm so well bird's nest man that'll go up i'll go up real well oh man look at that tapered boy that taper son lead ventu bam okay i've collected some twigs and then i have my bigger uh fuel kindling and then my fuel pieces over here so all i want to do is measure out my distance like i said before i do not need yeah just take it i want to take it i don't need uh the fire for warmth but i don't want it to be so far away from me that i'm not feeling any warmth from it either while i'm sitting here by the by the fire tonight so i might put it about one good step away one really big step away so right here seems good to me you gotta move buddy thank you watch out there's your big boy watch out big boy okay that's where we're going to have the fire we'll do a couple flat pieces underneath it decent platform i'll even use a little uh brace there here's my oh my kindling or sorry all my shavings i want to use the resinous ones first off and i'll add the rest on i've got a nice matching fire steel with this uh this knife from adventure swarm sorry a scope close for comfort hey bud so because there's some resin in those curls they will burn for quite a bit longer than just normal fire normal wood curls so it takes a little bit of the rush out of it i guess not that there is a big rush anyway prop my sticks up on my brace all at once not trying to one stick it no one sticking it so the nice thing about the brace is if you mess up and smother it you can kind of give it a little bit of air but i don't think it needs any right now this fire is going to go good for show some of this is a little bit wet the stuff near the bottom of what i just cut so actually there's some some stuff in there but anyways i'm going to put it all on now so that while it's growing it's also thawing the wood out drying it out that's a nice big dense piece probably split that down actually that one watch out buddy whoa better off swinging it with two hands this wood is legit man nice and straight grained and easy to split and heavy btus it's probably the best of all i could ask for in firewood the best of all i could ask for words that mean things with joe fire's not smoking anymore man she's going nice great fire gets me a great bed of coals scout's loving it you want me to put your blanket out here buddy yeah that's what i'm gonna do just laying there enjoying the fire so he should be laying on this instead of the cold ground all right get up right here big guy here back on here good boy that's for you good dog hey it's a little bit better a little better oh yeah those cold hips hey those cold hems big boy he's got his uh crocodile collar on one my subscribers made for him that lives in australia my good boy so well this stuff is very dense and i don't feel like cutting it all up with my silky so one thing i'm gonna do start a long fire not out of need of warmth just out of not wanting to cut this solid solid oak into pieces so i'll just start it off like this with a with a a piece of wood near it and it'll eventually start to catch and everything i'm not really gonna force the long fire but it'll happen she's heavy she is a heavy piece of oak okay here we go i'll break it into piece or i'll break it into place when i need to yep move scope what's up good guy okay so instead of cutting it i'll just wait till it burns enough fold it over break it and then that'll be the way i cut my wood or the way i burn through my wood so i believe it's called an indian style i could be wrong with that though i used to make like maybe the indian star is the fire light i'm picking up where you build a fire right in the front and you have big logs sticking out at all different angles looking like a star and then you're just feeding them into the middle it's the same idea anyways uh i think i'm gonna go around and look for some rocks to prop up my rock that i brought for cooking i'm gonna cook my bacon and my steak maybe not the bacon i might be able to hang the bacon but i'm definitely cooking the steak on the rock uh i did bring this rock in inside my backpack it was heavy but uh it's an ideal rock for cooking and i am a person who carries around rocks to cook on instead of a nice lightweight grill that i have so i'm gonna go and look for other rocks to support this if i can't find that it's fine i'll use wood or i'll just throw it right on the coals or whatever everything will be fine but ideally i can support this up a little bit and uh push some coals underneath and stuff so while that's burning down that's a lot of uh hard firewood hardwood i'm gonna go around and look for some rocks i might even throw some more wood on there before i go but she's already starting to catch the oak on either side which is pretty cool it's only 12. so like uh it's a good thing i have a lot of firewood you
