hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with the French omelette that's right might not think need a video for how to make an omelette but unless you've already somehow mastered this magical technique I really think do and it won't be until make one of these and try it yourself when you'll realize just how badly needed to know how to do this since quite simply put it's unlike any other omelette experience so with that let's go ahead and get started and as may have heard to make an omelet got to break a few eggs three large ones to be exact and of course farm-fresh or at least the freshest highest quality eggs can manage please do not buy your eggs at the same place buy your motor oil and then two or three large eggs the only other thing is we're gonna add our epistle and a few drops of cold water like a half a teaspoon and other than a ridiculous amount of butter that's gonna be it for our ingredients and then what we'll do at this point is grab a whisk and bust those eggs right in the yolks and we're going to whisk those for a minute or two or until they turn sort of liquidy alright when first start whisking they're gonna be kind of thick and viscous but you'll see after about a minute or so the mixture is gonna kind of thin out and know you're done when the eggs drip off the whisk like this okay so we want to make sure our eggs are well beaten we want no visible egg whites at all so those are looking good and once that's been accomplished we'll simply set that aside and head to the stove to prep our pan and ideally we're gonna use about a nine or 10 inch nonstick which we will place over medium-high heat and melt a tablespoon of butter except when a French chef is making an omelet and they tell to put a tablespoon of butter and they always mean more like two tablespoons and what we'll do is let that melt over medium-high heat as we stand by armed with hopefully a large flexible rubber spatula one that's he proof of course and what we'll do as soon as that butters melted but before it starts to sizzle we will go ahead and quickly pour in our eggs at which point we'll begin a three-stage process which is the scrambling the spreading and the folding so we'll dump our eggs in and we'll start working them over with a circular motion with our spatula and then culinary school they taught us to do this in a figure eight but I never did master that and I found it splashed eggs up the side of the pan so I prefer using more the circular motion see here while at the same time sort of shaking the pan and if you'll notice since these eggs are still very loose when I shake the pan it kind of levels them out well basically we're gonna continue this scrambling stage until that stops happening okay when our eggs start firming up enough where we can't really do that and we sort of have to spread with a spatula to even amount which is sort of where we're at right now what we want to do is turn our heat down to low and we will go from scrambling this spreading and all we're doing is sort of moving around the runny eggs - less runny spots and what we'll do is continue spreading that mixture around down low until our surface is wet but not runny which is what I have right here okay so we don't have pools of runny egg but the surface is still very wet very moist and once it reaches this point what we'll do is turn off our heat and fold it up so we'll start at the handle and roll perpendicularly to the other side but not all the way we want to stop a couple inches away from the edge because what we'll do is use our spatula to fold that edge towards the middle so that we somehow someway end up with the seam on the top and because these eggs are nice and soft in custardy they're very easy to shape and at this point might think we're ready to serve but we're not what we're gonna do is toss in a couple small chunks of butter not necessarily as much as I just did but a few chunks and what we'll do is let that melt and kind of push that under the omelet to lubricate it or at least that's what the French chefs say they say it's gonna be easier to get the omelette out of the pan if we do this but I don't think that's the real reason I really think it's because they wanted to add more butter plus I think the texture of your omelets gonna be better if this sits for a minute in the pan but anyway we're gonna toss in a little extra butter and kind of spread it over and push it underneath and what we'll do once that's melted is sort of push our omelet to the edge of the pan at which point we can carefully flop it over onto a plate making sure the seam side goes down because the ultimate goal of a French omelet is a perfectly smooth glistening surface and of course once it's on the plate can shape it any way want some people like to leave the ends open but I like to sort of taper them although maybe after this I will reconsider that but anyway we're gonna play our omelet and finally it's time to eat just as soon as we add some more butter no I'm not kidding the last official step for any real French omelet is to brush or spread a little bit of butter on the top to sort of give that surface a beautiful shine but once that's done finally we can eat with a little bit of watercress and of course some toasted bread I was just about to say I could have made that a lot nicer if I wasn't filming it but know what that's not actually true this is probably one of the better French omelets I've ever made which reminds me who cares what it looks like there's people in the know now the true beauty of a French omelet lies within so let me go ahead and cut in so can see what I'm talking about and now I usually don't need a fork a knife for my omelet but I wanted to get a nice clean cut so would be able to see this because of our three stages of scrambling spreading and the folding we basically created layers and layers of beautiful custardy eggs this is like an entirely different food than your typical overcooked golden brown dry American omelet I mean look at that it's just so insanely creamy and delicious and by the way if want to add some of your favorite fillings before fold this up go ahead I mean are the Suzanne Pleshette of your French omelet but if you've never made one of these before I highly suggest make it as shown just so can taste the magic that is the pure and true French omelet but of course a little bit of Chi never hurt sorry I couldn't resist but anyway that's it my method for doing French omelets which by the way is the only omelet were allowed to have wine with it breakfast like maybe a nice cold glass of Sauvignon Blanc and I'm not sure if that's the best pairing but I do know how to pronounce it but anyway whether you're gonna make this to impress someone in some fancy breakfast or just can't figure out what to eat on some rainy weeknight I really do hope give this a try soon so head over to food which is calm for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy
