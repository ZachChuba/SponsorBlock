to sign up will get two months for free at the link in the description the rap game is all about fitting in from cars to close the drugs there's a lot of pressure to conform but there are rappers who hop on the trends and there are rappers who start the trends ASAP rocky sits firmly in the latter camp despite one of the most tragic backstories in hip hop rocky became an extremely influential figure not only in the realm of music but in a wider cultural context as well in this video I'm going to talk about how rocky came to be the legendary embodiment of style he is today from his unstable childhood selling drugs in New York to a southern-inspired debut mixtape Live Love ASAP all the way to testing an underrated an experimental look at the 2018 hip-hop zeitgeist let's get into it ASAP rocky was born in 1988 in Harlem a neighborhood of New York City known for high rates of gang violence Rocky's troubles began early on when he was 12 his father went to prison for selling drugs they had just moved to Pennsylvania and his father's sudden imprisonment sent the family into homelessness in a foreign environment Rocky's mother took her kids to North Carolina but they still couldn't find a safe place to live before long they went back to New York City because at least there they could struggle in an environment they knew back in the city Rocky's older brother Ricky became his role model he taught rocky had a rap and inspired his lifelong appreciation for fashion but when Ricky was 20 years old he was killed on the street in Harlem 13 year old rocky was devastated he had to start dealing drugs to make ends meet and within just a few years he went from selling weed to selling crack at just 16 years old rocky served time in Rikers Island for drug dealing his cellmate was also a future rapper and Casanova I know just from being a Tupac head myself he was born there are you does that influence you at all what - yeah yo it does believe it is not he was born in the same hospital he was born if I'm not mistaken that he was born in st. Luke's you know you know I was born as seniors he lived on a hunt 16 Street on the side I was born on a hunch 16 through on the side my brother died on 16 he lived on 182nd in Bathgate Avenue that's where I moved my moves to the Bronx so after he moved from the Bronx at the boom from Halloween to the Bronx did not believe he went to like Baltimore or like Rocky's first real attempt at making music and art was in 2007 when he joined a Harlem based collective of rappers producers fashion designers and bikers called ASAP mob its founders were ASAP yams ASAP Bari and ASAP Hills Rocky's first single peso dropped in the summer of 2011 it attracted attention from high-profile local radio stations and the song became an instant hit in New York Rocky's next single purple swag was similarly popular and even earned him offers from a few record labels he dropped a mixtape Live Love ASAP just a few months later the mixtape was hugely successful and rocky signed a three million dollar record deal just weeks after it came out Live Love ASAP was pretty diverse for a New York record the New York scene at the time was territorial and rocky took a big risk with inspiration from southern and Midwest specifically drawing a lot of production ideas from Houston Texas the beats on Live Love ASAP were hazy low to mid tempo and choruses on the mixtape are often chopped and screwed rocky was able to create a powerful dreamlike atmosphere that was surprisingly developed for a debut release thanks to local publicity rocky joined Kendrick Lamar as the opening act for Drake's Club Paradise tour in 2012 he also performed at the Pitchfork Music Festival in July of that year and he was scheduled to appear on the Jimmy Fallon show shortly after but he was replaced when he got arrested the night before after a brawl with another rapper rocki recorded his debut album in late 2012 on it he paid tribute to older hip-hop aesthetics with songs like one train a six-minute track featuring Kendrick Lamar yellow wolf Danny Brown Joey badass Action Bronson and Big KRIT including rocky there were seven rappers on the song and together they created a 90 style tribute to underground posse tracks but above paying homage to his influences Rocky's debut album was progressive he showed a great ear for sonic experimentation featuring indie singer Florence Welsh and dubstep producer Skrillex on two of the album's and most interesting songs he also made a song with pop star Lana Del Rey it failed to make the album but ended up being a fan favorite anyway long live ASAP introduced rocky to the mainstream as a rapper who went above and beyond what was necessary to sell records even as a newcomer his taste in instrumentals and collaborations was more than developed enough and for him to become considered one of the most stylish and refined rappers in the game long live ASAP debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in just three short years after rocky was on the streets selling drugs while Rocky's next album at long last ASAP would be even more mature and developed than his first it seemingly ended his stroke of good luck Rocky's mentor and the album's executive producer ASAP yams died a few months before it came out rocky was devastated by his passing and the rollout of the album was severely affected yemm's rarely took the spotlight for Rocky's success but it would have been impossible without him the album was finished before his death and no mentions of his tragic passing were added at long last ASAP is Rocky's first fully formed record rocky finally had the experience and tools at his disposal to create something entirely his own even if something entirely his own entails drawing heavily from a number of very different inspirations including a feature from British rock singer Rod Stewart an executive production from Danger Mouse at long last ASAP his party wrapped fused with rich musical heritage and careful curation collaborators on the album include pop singer mi a rappers future Lil Wayne bones and even pop singer Miguel ah at long last ASAP rocky became more than just a rapper he became a curator of different moods and experiences bringing together a wide variety of genres and musicians for one of the most stylish and charismatic musical experiences of 2015 the album debuted once again at number one spending four weeks there despite its success it represents a low point in Rocky's career marked by loss and grief Rocky's first project without the guidance of yams would prove to be his most controversial testing was released in May 2018 it didn't perform very well on the charts and critics didn't like it much either the album was criticized for being basic messy and directionless questions were raised about Rocky's ability to make music without yams help and indeed I do think that perhaps the album was most affected by the death of yams and Rocky's sister shortly before it was recorded Rocky's life has been marked by loss since childhood his brother died when he was 13 his father died shortly before the release of his first album his mentor died just before his second album and he lost his sister before his third album testing is Rocky's most thoughtful release yet because at this point Rocky's dedication to his lifestyle of excess has become weak of course he's still ASAP Rocky he still loves fashion and women and acid but he's alone now the people he could always count on the most are gone testings album cover is a picture of ten people standing above the photographer with a white background and I think rocky choosing this cover tells us a lot about where his head is at in the wake of these losses yams had a huge part in curating Rocky's sound and now that he's gone rocky had the choice to either throw their style away and start over or continue as if nothing had changed at all and testing in the end is an album full of ideas but without a central creative backbone and of course that's not to say that I didn't like it because it's actually my favorite album by Rocky and I would rate it in my top 15 records to come out last year it's full of interesting ideas and I really enjoy the variety ASAP Rocky is one of the most stylish and dynamic figures in hip-hop there are very few rappers who've done time at Rikers Island and later gone on to host performance art events at sotheby's rocky connects his past brawling in the streets and selling drugs to his present as a connoisseur of high-fashion rappers have always been dynamic from jay-z and Sean Combs successful business ventures to Childish Gambino's multi - at acting and directing career rocky stands among them as someone who's concerned less with creating the best of anything and more with getting into as many lanes as he can rocky makes fun engaging generational music he pushes the envelope of popular fashion and with that in a way has transcended himself ASAP rocky has come to represent the very idea of creativity in hip-hop not bad for a kid from Harlem while we wait description will get two months of unlimited access for free [Music]
