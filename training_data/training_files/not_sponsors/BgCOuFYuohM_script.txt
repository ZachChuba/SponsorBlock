Hi! Ever since I tested the LaserCube,
I have been wondering what's inside it? How did they manage to cram
the lasers, scanners, electronics AND a battery inside a 10 cm cube? In this video, I will open it up and compare the inside to
a more conventional show laser with the same specs. I will also test their output power
in a simple and in a more precise way. And just for the fun of it I will compare the performance with a show laser
twice as strong and with twice as fast scanners... Show lasers are meant to be seen but make sure that noone ever will be able to look
directly into the beam or specular reflections of it. Use laser safety goggles when burning
and popping with a steady beam. And don't open devices with a high-voltage power
supply unless you know what you're doing. For a start, let's test their output
power in a very simple way. How fast will they burn through a CD-case? I'm using the pop program in LaserOS which allows for a 6 seconds steady beam at full power. The 1 watt LaserCube made it through in 4.8 seconds. The 1 watt LaserDock is basically
the same show laser as the LaserCube. Just in a much bigger case with a massive
heat sink and a built in power supply. This does not have a built-in
battery like the LaserCube. Let's see how it compares. 5.3 seconds - half a second
slower than the LaserCube. What about the 2 watt LaserDock? Surely, this will be faster than the LaserCube? Bigger, heavier with an enormous heat sink
and two industrial cooling fans this is not discreet in any way... Let's fire it up! 3.2 seconds and a lot bigger
hole after a 6 seconds burn. Notice the different hole sizes
and orientations of the oval beam. One of these lasers will later perform over spec
when tested on a laser power meter. Can you guess which one? Time to compare the inside of the
two similar 1 watt show lasers. I'm expecting the LaserCube to be stuffed with stuff while the LaserDock should have some empty space. Otherwise I don't see how the
LaserCube can be a miniaturized LaserDock. Is the LaserDock mostly empty? Uhhmm, no! There's a lot of stuff in here. How on Earth did they fit all
of this into the LaserCube only replacing the power supply with a battery? Let's have a closer look at the different parts before I open and compare with the LaserCube. I'm not an expert in electronics so feel free to comment with
extra details or corrections. All right, finally time to see
what's inside the LaserCube. Ohhkay, it really is stuffed. Remember, I have already removed
a battery and four stands from the inside. To my surprise, they found room for two batteries. Though only just - look how tight a fit it is for this wire. The optics in the LaserCube are more
complex with an extra mirror added since there's no room for a third laser in the front. I guessed wrong in my earlier video where I thought the lower mirror
was a simple first-surface mirror. It is actually a more expensive, green
dichroic mirror reflecting the red laser beam. I have to say I'm not less impressed
by the LaserCube after opening it. Designing this for mass-production
must have been quite a challenge. With it assembled again, we can test the
show lasers on a laser power meter that my patrons helped me out with. Thanks! I will test each laser using two tests. A 6 seconds steady beam and
a 20 seconds moving beam burning a circle. It is not ideal to have a beam moving on the sensor but it's the only way to have a beam at full power
for more than 6 seconds using the LaserOS. Here are the results: As you can tell, the 1 watt LaserDock
is the one that performs over spec. Surprisingly, since it appeared to do
the worst in the CD case burn test. I guess that test isn't very scientific... The other two perform to spec after
accounting for internal losses in the optics. Here's an example, where you
can see how much green light is lost inside the LaserDock
from the dichroic mirrors. The LaserCube has a third mirror
and therefore more internal loss. After some important messages I will demonstrate some differences between the
cheapest and most expensive of the show lasers. A big thanks to all my patrons. I am glad to see the support
from more and more of you. If you want to help me keep
going with the videos too then check out my Patreon page. Link is under the video. Let me quickly show three differences between
the 1 watt LaserCube and 2 watt LaserDock. First one is the obvious: The 2 watter is much brighter. It's not that easy to see on a recording though. Both lasers overexpose the camera and
your screen can't really show the true brightness. But here with the strongest, blue laser
turned off, you can tell the difference. The scanners in the 2 watter
are the 40K option. Twice as fast as the 20K
scanners in the LaserCube. For bendy lines and animations
the difference is not huge but for squares and straight lines
the 40K scanners are excellent. It's especially obvious here on the analogue clock. The LaserDocks with the 40K scanners also come with
the professional ILDA connections, if you need those. The last thing I will point out is the white balance. The LaserCube has a bluish white,
while the 2 watter is... white white. You can adjust the color balance in
LaserOS - just with brightness loss. The lasers are better balanced in the 2 watter but I don't mind they put that
powerful blue laser in the LaserCube... Thanks for watching! Bye for now.
