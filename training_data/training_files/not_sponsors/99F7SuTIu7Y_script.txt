there's vodka in this all right so this is gonna be one of those videos um one of those videos where you're just asking me why why am i subjecting you to this why am i subjecting myself to this well there's a couple different reasons first of all cringing at what we're about to see is going to be a lot of fun secondly we're all on quarantine I'm bored you're bored we might as well have a little bit of fun all right so I guess it's kind of one answer both questions but you can probably tell this video is not scripted but that's because this video pretty much just writes itself I don't know how many of you have seen this video from our favorite Caitlin Bennett uh Caitlin Bennett and her little butt buddy basically decided to go look for a Valentine date on a college campus oh boy what happened it's just so cringy it's so painful that's part of the reason why I didn't even bother scripting this be sure to check out my other video I've done I did feminist dating experiment goes wrong I did that a couple months ago so I figured it's about time we try out conservative dating experiment goes follow me at Hunter Ave alone today if you came up and said hey think you're really cute would you like to go on a Valentine's date with me right now wearing all this with the balloon the flowers would you say yes would you accept them I would not I'm not a fan of all the Trump stuff Oh rejected on Valentine's Day come on isn't that when the girls were supposed to be really really desperate would you go out with him looking like this no why not he is a trump supporter and I see that aren't you inclusive don't you know what it means to be inclusive it means you will sleep with anyone at any time this is pretty much the only argument Caitlyn has the whole leg are a new inclusive thing and look I understand that it can be really annoying how sometimes liberals will claim that they're all about inclusivity but the minute you say well I don't know about some of these liberal policies or I think I might actually kind of like Donald Trump they instantly turn on you which seems like a contradiction when they claim to be inclusive usually what people mean when they say they're inclusive it means that they're inclusive of certain identities things that you can't change so this girl could very well and I'm pretty sure she is inclusive of this guy because he's black that's not the issue here but she might not be inclusive towards his political ideologies I mean you could take this this whole life will aren't you inclusive thing right to the next extreme like hey you want to go out with my friend Ted Bundy well I thought you were inclusive godom am I inclusive I like to think so just not towards Trump supporters not particularly yeah okay see she cannot be inclusive towards his ideology while she's still inclusive towards the fact that he's black there's not a whole lot of hypocrisy here plus do I really need to say this I thought that conservatives are really saying this inclusivity does not extend to dating preferences this is just as dumb as when trans people will say that if you have genital preferences or something that that's somehow transphobic oh he can't make his own decisions cuz he's black boy for someone like Caitlin I'm surprised to see her pulling the race card so quick we're here at the city of Akron and we're making a very special Valentine's Day video for you guys ooh will you be my Valentine um not if you ask like that what was that you sound like the kid who's never even interacted with the female before maybe if you kind of you know a little bit of sweet-talking first like hey will you be my Valentine and yes the Hat stays on during sex would you go on a date with my friend Joel Patrick if I was like looking for someone really hypothetical they imagined that you're the only woman on the planet and I'm the only man on the planet all right would you then maybe consider going on a date with me while I'm wearing my trump gear why not because I'm a Democrat and you're good work good wearing on but it's Black History Month what History Month what we put seriously what does that actually mean Black History Month doesn't mean you like go out and like being a black person is that like the thing you're supposed to do how is that an argument oh it's Black History Month that's the time where we let black people do whatever they want it's like the purge for black people why did you go on a Valentine's date with my friend Joel Patrick oh no I won't lie I don't like you and I if he's friends with you I probably don't like him either I mean there are better arguments to be made but okay I don't know it's Black History Month are you gonna and what does that have to do with anything I'm actually black so okay you hate me but you don't know wait whoa whoa stop no one ever said he hates anyone he said he doesn't like Caitlin and so anyone who probably hangs out with her he won't be into her well if you're with her than ya make you a bad person oh if I keep standing here maybe well why don't you tell me why you don't like me do you like me oh oh sip it over here and we get the simpler please he's a trump supporter and I see them aren't you inclusive am i inclusive I like to think so got'em just not towards Trump supporters not particularly again she's inclusive towards the fact that you're black that is your racial identity that is fine but she's not into Trump supporters how many conservatives do you think would date a liberal probably like none of them which is fine it's fine to have these dating preferences the problem is that they're trying to invent some kind of imaginary hypocrisy here which just makes them look more desperate oh he can't make his own decisions cuz he's black I like how Caitlyn won't even let him talk Oh what oh he can't answer the question himself because he's black no oh I got it so amazing it's Black History Month in or not the Democrats are being racist guys look because wait how could she wouldn't go on a date with him cuz she's not in Trump I've actually met the president what four times now Lanie's I'll have you know that I've graduated at the top of my class and I met President Donald J Trump approximately four and a half times I mean look look that like look at her face here she looks so scared could you say yes would you accept him I would not I'm not a fan of all the Trump stuff okay that answer is completely fine that's a fair answer I'm not into the Trump stuff it looks tacky you're running around like looking like a fanboy honestly I think you could do the same thing if someone was running around with a bunch of Hillary Clinton gear or a bunch of Bernie Sanders gear look at her face she is like I do not want to be here I don't like you help me a date with him no thanks I kind of feel bad because I feel like for the black guy this is his experience yes pretty much asking every girl out go out with me please no thanks but why no thanks I think they might be running away though because they're scared I think it's my balloon this guy wants to talk about people running away while they're scared I have tried to debate him this guy I've literally had a debate set up and he backed out and Kaitlyn I have requested a debate with you like almost two months ago now I've reached out to you and I've still not heard back I'm still waiting the debate both of these people the other the one that says I love you these College liberals left us sjw's they never experienced love in their life so they're like love got'em guys ha you're freaked out by a dude with fake roses a bunch of Trump stuff and a balloon that says I love you coming up to you with a bunch of cameras huh probably cuz you did you're only 19 you've already been divorced these guys are like dude actually if you would go on a date with my friend Joel Patrick I would get if I was girl I was a girl look at this guy's face he's like dude III got it man yeah you're not gay I know it's it's okay dude oh I didn't hear hmm I don't know you went here will you go out with me for Valentine's Day gonna have to pass nothing personal nothing personal this boy just got so rejected nothing personal no girl that's as personal as it gets my friend yes yes let's restart let's retake this and this time you're gonna say yes it's Black History Month go out with me for Valentine's Day holy Sh this looks bad Sheila I feel like she just can't bring herself to even say it yeah you're a cutie you'll find someone don't worry very cute you don't worry about it does he know that this makes him look really bad right this this whole thing it's just it's really cringey because and listen it bothers me because I mean I'm coming from a right-wing background right like I've talked to I've I've associated with plenty of really smart really intelligent conservatives I know that there are conservatives that are extremely rational and really good faith but this just makes conservatives look bad not even bad like like offensive just so cringy go on a date and wait no please do you like pickup trucks and tractors too huh again this just makes conservatives look really bad and it's upsetting to me like I already said because I know plenty of reasonable conservatives I've spoken to plenty of rational conservatives and I know plenty of conservatives that think this kind of stuff is cringy and crappy and it makes the rest of the conservative movement look like a total joke and it bothers me because that's not the case there are some things that the right fights for that I strongly agree with and I don't like the Caitlin Bennett makes the right out to be this kind of laughingstock it's just ridiculous but all right guys thank you for watching I had a blast going through this video I mean it was definitely cringe of epic proportion thanks everyone for watching please give this video a like comment below and subscribe to the channel I hope you guys enjoyed this one I know it was a little unscripted but I had fun so that's all that matters thanks guys have a good one peace [Music]
