if you're new to my channel i quickly need to explain who the piano technician is i once put guitar strings on my piano and hired him to come over and find out why he's making weird noises it was haha funny and he cannot like the song but he didn't like what i did to the piano next time i put fishing line on another piano but i managed to accidentally pick his favorite piano brand made in the one factory he had his apprenticeship in yeah since then he hasn't answered my text messages but i learned my lesson new channel new me and that's the reason i didn't touch the strings this time but my keys are kinda heavy i guess we gotta call the piano pick i just wanted to ask you if you wanted to come over and tune this piano too okay what are you up to now this time i haven't touched the strings at all i can promise yeah but the keys are kind of heavy oh okay maybe i can play you something yeah sure [Music] yeah well we could book a new tuning so while we wait for the piano tech i kind of need to tell you something i used to have a sponsor here but i tried the product and i kind of hated it so i escaped the contract last second and the problem with that is that i don't have sponsor anymore and i kind of needed it because my next video has already ended up costing me two thousand dollars because it turns out that pro pianists are kind of expensive so let me tell you about the service i've been using so much yeah i've been seeing it a lot it's epidemic sounds and they basically license 95 of all the music and sound effects i've been using my videos for the last year and you might say matthias who cares about the background music it's not like anyone is going to notice any difference i contacted them and they sent over a special link which is shared.epidemicsound.com engineer with that link you get to use the license music for free for 30 days in your videos and you will at the same time support my channel for free because it's an affiliate link please let me know if you sign up because i will be in the comments section for the first 10 hours and i will personally thank every one of you who used to link in sign up but now the piano tech will be here any second [Music] right right then you have a ground too okay so maybe you can try to play something and see if you can okay yeah i know i know you said on the phone that you haven't done anything to the strings this time no but it's something else [Music] that's actually kind of interesting i know it's like a like a harpsichord almost right so you've done something to the hammers probably how do you know that's my that's my guess from the sound oh oh yeah should i open it maybe think a bit more what would you put if you were me i mean maybe you wouldn't put anything but if you did a hard question because you're full of surprises um i think there's two tools either you have replaced the hammers with something else or you put something on like the tip of the hammer or something like that i got like a million comments saying you should have just oh no i almost spoil it okay maybe maybe you should check okay here we go what what is this you can open the whole piano thing oh what is this it's it's hammers it's literally hammers yeah that's clever i bought them from klaus olson oh that's that's it took me like 300 hours to make that video yeah that's like [Music] that's you nailed it thank you i can feel right away that there's probably some problems with the action because there's so much more weight yeah on these hands [Music] yeah you don't know hammer club is not about beethoven right i think it's no i don't know it because i know it's really really hard i have a classical pianist who's going to prepare it and come over on wednesday i think this is like compared to yeah the other ones my opinion is that this the sound of this is going to be useful as a virtual instrument be more useful than it is in reality because the action really feels strange i thought so too like the repetition is like it takes a half a half second like you can't like [Music] like it's so and it's so that might be a problem when she plays something difficult i think the loudness doesn't come across on video isn't it really loud yes yes like i was surprised how loud it is yeah it's very attacked projective and attacky [Music] wait what is that is that a brand no no that's an old wait is that the piano technician at uni before me yeah it's not sometimes oh baltha lechner i know him you do yeah maybe i should call him and ask him i don't know what to ask him but but he tuned it or did he he probably he tuned it probably he put the tag on after a tuning like flexing yeah like showing off i usually yeah i usually leave my business card some technicians have stickers maybe he should engrave it next time so no it stays forever i think once once i've seen a technician to carve in their name and the date of the tuning into the iron frame that's maybe i should do that no no can you just take one second to check this piano i i don't think you will be as impressed though yeah no no don't open okay just play through right but we don't have to make it a big deal ah oh it sounds so bad in comparison to the other one it's not in tune so yeah that's not a good okay can you guess what this one is these drinks yeah yeah well if there's but this one is like i have all the strings for this one because ernie balls send out like some extra long really yeah oh that's that's awesome i mean it has some special like a bell like something yeah it's like a celeste almost so how are you are you going to tune this like a regular oh you're going to do it's a trap for piano text [Music] night okay if you can pick anything to change like the hammer part yeah like do you have anything in mind that you think would actually that you would want to see maybe like i don't know a knife [Laughter] well it would be interesting with something very soft in contrast to this one maybe like if i make molds of thumbs make them realistic so you can slap without it maybe [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's not most easily played i don't know about you but i don't think i ever seen the piano like this happy before okay i have to tell you something i'm really in the future here because i already had the two pro pianists here to play the piano and i never told them about the hammers before they were here so that's the next video and if i were you i would really hate to miss that video because i wasn't subscribed and if even that didn't convince you let's make a deal i will answer all the comments in this video for 10 hours if you subscribe to my channel enjoy my discord so the discord is really like behind the scenes for my videos and me asking you for help about everything so if you're into that join it and here's the rest of the relaxing q a with a piano tech enjoy do you recommend my viewers to become piano technicians themselves well yes i i would it's a it's a fantastic job i think in my opinion i love my job and so i it's i i recommend everyone who is curious about being a piano technician to be so but you have to consider also like it's it's it's difficult and and especially to learn to tune in a good way like it's it's not just something that you can learn yourself i think like you you have to you have to really educate yourself and um and study to be a piano technician it's just you don't need a perfect pitch that's like do you have perfect no no no no it's it's one of the most uh one of the biggest uh what do you say um myths about this yeah anyway that like so many people think that oh you need to have perfect pitch if you're a piano junior and yeah so like i don't even get asked that people just say to me oh so you have perfect pitch it's like no yeah i mean i need comments about you having perfect people yeah i'm afraid that some people that are interested in yeah and they thought so i was like maybe i should become a piano technician and then i realized wait i can't hear the difference between a g and a c chord do you ever wonder why i do a lot of this like goes on in your mind because there's some some questions you just don't ask yourself that is one of them don't pick this man's brain i i think for myself often [Laughter]
