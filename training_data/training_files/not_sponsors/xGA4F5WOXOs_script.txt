[The lyrics that will appear is the meaning of the song, not the literal translation] You’ve lost your way like monsters in vain You have my attention, call me insane You’re a mess (You know I didn’t mean to) (You know I didn’t mean to) It’s a troop without mercy (Don’t show any sign of weakness) Everything is not as it seems So this isn’t it Why don’t you think about it again? Shatter the night, make no sound mix down So they won’t notice us tonight Blame it all on me Because I’m the one who started the fire Don’t try to avoid me The world is different from me, break the boundaries Call me a villain so what Call me a villain so what Sorry not sorry I’m a bad hero yeah I’m a bad hero Sorry not sorry Whatever they say I’m not guilty Yeah I’m a bad hero Sorry not sorry Break the friendly image Call me a villain so Aish... Whatever Pick one of the answers Gotta pick me or not? The answer is right here, don’t annoy me Don't wanna talk I’m gonna climb the pyramid They're gonna be asking just how I did One-way ticket, that is no-way Gotta make a choice. Pain or gain Maybe you want me The bad aspect doesn’t leave any room Well, there’s no real reason Numb your emotions You’re born with it Call me a villain so what Call me a villain so what Sorry not sorry I’m a bad hero yeah yeah I’m a bad hero Sorry not sorry Whatever they say I’m not guilty Yeah I’m a bad hero Sorry not sorry Break the friendly image Call me a villain so Sad to say I’ve never felt so alive I’m messed up it can only be true or lie Maybe I was born to be bad In this hard world We only have one choice… villainous Play a last bittersweet symphony Keep going... Call me a villain so what Call me a villain so
