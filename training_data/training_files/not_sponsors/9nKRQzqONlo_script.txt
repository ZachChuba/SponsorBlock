This is the 2nd feature with our 'innocent' Yubin unnie*~
*Older sister (used by females) in Korean Yerihan Bang Part 2‚úå 'Yerihan Music Box' corner~ We have to cheer for each other (because no one's here) (Too much...üòÇ) (Calm down plz...) You said you'll give us pro tips on how to stay without getting drunk at parties Is there such tip actually? I always add... water and ice together in alcohol (Enlightened) This is for those who want to stay at parties but are lightweights or for dieters out there (recommendedüëç) Fill up your glass with ice Add soju (2) and water (8) in 2:8 ratio! That's almost non-alcoholic - Right...!
- But you can still feel the party vibe! - That's how... you often drink...?
- Yes yes! When I want to stay for a long time at parties! It's not always good though! A stranger could think you are a heavy drinker lol You said 'Bad Boy' is your all-time-favorite song by Wonder Girls Do you happen to know the choreography...? - (I do I doüòâ)
- Oh, you do! I know 'Tell Me' too~ (Summoning the 13-years-old choreography)
(Timid) Tell me... Tell me. Te-te-te... LOL (Unnie is in charge of embarrassmentüòÇ)
(Ddu Ddu doesn't know how to feel embarrassed) (You down for a dance?) Come out, unnie! (This is the ‚≠êpoint‚≠ê) (Ddu Ddu goes Ooh ooh~‚ô¨) (Unnie goes Ooh ooh~‚ô¨ too) This choreo is nearly a reflex for me (D√©calcomanie Wonder X Velvet) (Y'all remember this dance, right?) Te-te-te-te-te-tell me~‚ô™ (Hehe) (Please tell everyone this performance is happening right before your eyes~) (a.k.a Stan)
(Yerim is all over Wonder Girls) We'll now start 'Yerihan Music Box' Which song will you introduce today? Although we got hyped with dancing, I've brought a song called  By Heize 'Things are going well'... Hmm? Sounds like it's perfect for your situation - Right?
- Yeah, I know~ I've been active in the entertainment business and things are turning out better than I expected The song's meaning is "We broke up, but I've moved on and am doing really well so I don't think about you anymore" The ex doesn't bother her anymore! So she's kinda like, "I'm sorry~" lol Let's listen to it~ ‚ô¨I think I'll be fine even if you date another woman‚ô¨ The song is exactly like what you describe, eh? LOL I can hear all the words now lol - Things are going well
- Wow, going too well actually (Hmm... You must be watching this, eh?) Q. What's the best thing that has ever happened to you after your debut? I think it was when we won the Best Music Award with  in 2008 (I know that feeling...) That standing mic! (during the speech) (‚ô¨ Nobody_Wonder Girls) (Reminiscing the 22 years old Yubin)
The memories are popping up~ And I'm here with one of the best artists! What's going on?! As a person who knows all of your tracks ever since your debut!! Remember I said I love this song... (‚ô¨ I Tried_Wonder Girls) I honestly know all the lyrics... (Unnie is touched....‚ù§) I literally know everything! (Our innocent unnie is touched over something trivial like this...‚ù§)
THANK YOUUUUU üò≠üò≠ A true! stan! We should meet each other privately too~ - Yeah of course! I'm always cooped up at home!
- Eat avocado togetherüíï (+1 Another unnie has been added in Yeri's Unnie Collection) (Pop quiz) Do you know this song? (You think I don't know...?) It's Not Love? - (Late) Ah~ It's Not Love~
- I know everything! (Proud for getting the right answer before an actual Wonder Girls member lol) (She's even on top of the accompaniment)
Bam bam~ Bam bam bam~üéπüé∂ (Surprised) - (Unnie, I'm your true fan, eh?)
- (You really areüëç) (‚ô¨It's Not Love - Wonder Girls) (Ddu Ddu is embarrassed for singing the song right off the bat) People say things turn out well too, of course but bad things happen too in life Q. What do you do when things don't turn out well? First, I just sleep and wake up! on days when I have a lot on my mind I mean, it's not like things will work out even if I hold onto it So when I sleep and wake up, my head is organized and think 'It wasn't even that big of a deal' while blocking all calls... and things like that LOL When things don't turn out well, that also suggests you are most likely fatigued too~ so I think you need a break I'm someone who keeps on holding onto problems to solve them! I think... I'm trying to avoid those situations now Recently! If you can share this with us~ Q. Have you ever felt upset recently? Things are a lot different now as I'm a CEO compared to when I was an artist in a big entertainment, right? It's upsetting how things don't always turn out the way I want to be... I want to carry things out perfectly but since I'm by myself, there are things I miss out on and that's pretty upsetting but everything else is fine! In 2007... In 2007.... Wow... Debuted in 2007 and... Whoa... (Yerim, who was 9 years old at the time, is surprised by the number 2007) Q. Are there any words of advice or encouragement you would like to give to Yeri? After talking with each other, I think you're fine actually! If you happen to have concerns on your mind, tell me immediately! Oh wow! Can I really do that? Since we aren't in the same company, I can tell you about various things, right? - Reach out to me anytime! Plus, you are doing great!
- (Ddu Ddu is touched...üò•) I got her number! Hehehe (Yerim is really a successful stan‚úå) Let's go grab some avocado unnie! A big NO NO to girl crush~ Our innocent yaya! (lol) UGH! THAT'S SO EMBARRASSING!! Q. How did you feel about Yerihan Bang today? I think I've seen another side of Ms. Yeri I've only seen her cheerful sides as the youngest member in the group but she's very shrewd and smart (A master(?) of calligraphy...?)
I love this 'Innocent' calligraphy too! Will you honestly hang this in the CEO's office of rrr entertainment...? (Approved)
I will! By my seat! Just like this! Everyone, this is how Yerihan Bang takes another leap... Yuri from SNSD (Girls' Generation) visited last week and today, I'm with (Wonder Girls) Yubin! So I'm thinking like.... Ooh! I guess I'm kinda special? LOOOOOOOOL I'm starting to think I want to be a great unnie and an exemplary senior for my younger artists in the future Am I old too(?) (What are you saying?!)
No no! You are still young but I just want to give you a round of applause for learning this alreadyüëèüëèüëè Today is kinda like 'Compliment Yeri' day~? Then, for today's Yerihan Bang with Yubin, it's now time to say goodbye! I'm a streaming DJ Yeriüíú and I'm a special guest, a.k.a CEO Yubinüòé - Shall we say Ddubai? (Ddu Ddu + Bye)
- Yep Alright, 3, 2, 1~ Ddubaiüëãüëã (Yerihan Bang bent on preparing a special edition!) (Let's greet together!!) (Yeri's body remembers everything...) (A true family! Members of Red Velvet)

(Weekly Yerim‚ú®) (Behind-the-scenes of Yeri's cover song) Everyone, guess where we're right now?! Hehe Hint: Soft lighting Hint: Soft lighting, a guitar, and a computer for workstation Look at that recording studio vibe~ Today, I'm with my guitar instructors Orori and Suhyun who my fans already know~ - Hello~
- Hello - One of my acquaintances!
- Right lol (Orori / A composer and a guitarist?) (Orori / A composer and a guitar playing...) (Does various things)
I guess I can say I dabble in various things... All around (Destiny)
He happens to have a recording mic today - so... we're here to trying something~
- Yeah... A person should live productively, right? Stay tuned~‚ù§ You always carry that around and film your life everyday? - It's called a 'daily life camera'
- Amazing~ Don't edit Suhyun's face~ He has to be on camera~~ (Monotone) I would love become a celebrity AHAHAHAHA (Warming up her beautiful vocal cords)
‚ô¨Just like how I feel yeah‚ô¨ Warming up! (2nd warm up) Is there a mosquito in the studio...? A mosquito? (Yes... You...) (Testing her beautiful voiceüé§ after fully warming up) ‚ô¨ And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing ‚ô¨ - Gotta use a mic, eh?!
- Yep Well then, should we go for a round as a test? ‚ô¨ When you hold me ‚ô¨ ‚ô¨ And kiss me slowly ‚ô¨ ‚ô¨ It's the sweetest thing ‚ô¨ ‚ô¨ Best part~ ‚ô¨ Oh yeah~ - Mics are seriously important... lol
- Is it... Because of the mic... Your voice is clear and crisp, eh? (100% satisfied!) (I think I'm pretty good!)
We're ready now~ I'm so happy with the mic... I'm glad I put it here We tried filming it before, but we didn't have a mic (Recording with a mic is a huge fail...)
I sang really far away, like all the way at the end but it's so much more fun today! UGHAAAAAHHH!!! The lyrics... :((( (Getting herself together and trying again) (ERROR) (Exchanging small mistakes here and there lol)
Again~ UGHHHHH Hmm hmm... LOOOOL We both know when the recording is screwed LOL Exactly, I've sensed that just now :) (‚ù§Yeri's Beautiful Voice‚ù§)
