roller dice you win very good here's another one of those video things that I make I know we've all asked ourselves the age-old question which would be worse to have as an enemy a 50-foot tall 200 ton lizard from ancient earth or a guy with a lot of money well here at rune smith.com /youtube we did a research to find the answer so let's do the thing where you watch the video I made about it the first thing I wanted to do is break the illusion of D&D mechanics because that's some [ __ ] challenge ratings are a joke and whoever wrote storm Kings thunder delivered the punchline with liver laughs just look at this now look at this now that credibility has been shattered we need to answer the question of what danger even is a thing that causes harm okay cool that's very clarifying I personally believe that harm comes in more forms than just cuts bruises and being turned into a two-dimensional object under the foot of a giant lizard harm is pretty much anything that affects you negatively we've got sickness poverty unwarranted hatred ignorance a big nasty scar from that time you fell over on a scooter and almost lost half of your bad stuff there's a lot of it out there and it comes in a lot of different shapes we should know this is a dying timeline for sure imagine if we threw a Tarasque into this mix I don't think too much would change honestly through all we know it there could just be one in the ocean right now it's 2020 we have VR and we've only explored 5% of the ocean that's a little scary assuming that a noble could pose an equal threat regardless of the parties level let's look at the destructive ability of a Tarasque these Titans have every defense imaginable against adventurers for spells if it has to make a saving throw this thing is twice as likely to succeed and able to ignore up to three spells completely it's also got immunity to non magic weapons and other classic damage forms armor out the wazoo insane vitality and a big toothy muffle of stinky breath the amount of damage at Tarasque and eel per turn is at most like a hundred and eighty four hit points or 56 at worst which is enough to kill a bunch of adventurers and leave behind only the barbarians and then it can swallow those barbarians oh that's cool digestion starts immediately this four story tall Godzilla would without a doubt be able to destroy my hometown of like a hundred and thirty thousand people with little to no effort and eat everyone here I think you could call that dangerous but two things that a tarrasque doesn't have our friends in high places and a high IQ he's a big old dummy with no friends and you can just call him a loser and he'll probably die of dehydration after crying so much but Nobles are a whole different story clocking in at a whopping nine hit points these nasty little things can cause more damage in one month than Godzilla could in its mortal lifetime in order to earn their namesake a Nobel has to exist in a societal system whose structures has laws law enforcement and public obedience these tools in an abstract way make Nobles much larger than Terr asks and allows them some form of immortality the authority that a noble has as well as their connections to other Nobles gives them freedom to start far-reaching Wars spread misinformation leads to mass death and even outlaw adventurers with strong skills and deception and persuasion they can convince a party to join them or start a slander campaign to ruin the public opinion of adventurers forever so I'll pose the question which is worse in the long run everyone hating you because of a lie never being able to find a new quest to go on because no one will pay you poor being digested by a big lizard for 6 to 18 seconds I think the nail in the coffin of this argument for me is what happens once you defeat one or the other if you manage to actually kill it to Rask you go down in history books as one of the world's greatest heroes you gain the favor of the local area for as long as you live and you get some cool materials for a new set of armor if you slay a noble you get put in jail and all the negative actions taken by the noble have persisting effects and there's a high probability that one of their many friends is more than happy to take their place but what if a Tarasque were to go up against the noble they are siege monsters they're too stupid to understand speech and a little too big to put under arrest I think it wouldn't be a very even match and I'd bet at least 36 mario coins on the big lizard honestly my real point here isn't to throw chez to people or say that these are absolute facts but I think what I wanted to prove is that danger and difficulty are not sliding scales it's a subjective thing like a big game of quartz parchment shears like how a barbarian can kill anything unless they're feared because then they can't move up to it and they can't attack or a paladin that can kill about anything without fear but can't handle moral dilemmas or how a bard can win over an entire town but dies from a baby slapping them don't use challenge rating find out your party's kryptonite and sprinkle in monsters that have it I really like city of mist a game that has a 1 to 6 difficulty scale that you can apply to pretty much any route of beating your opponent and you can have several like how a famous bard would have a wound difficulty of 1 to 2 but a persuasion of 5 which means they're easy to kill but very very hard to get on your side or if you made their dirty laundry public on a scale of or so they just vanished like a bad meme my final message take this to Rask and throw it at an adventurer bye you
