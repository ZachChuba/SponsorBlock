website or online store make it with Squarespace I've avoided talking about this franchise as much as possible I don't want to help beat a dead horse the dead horse being Marc Webb's vision for Spider Man and the person beating that horse being sony avi arad to set the tone for this video I now present to you a real email exchange between Nick Shore and X Sony chairman Amy Pascal about what should be included in the hit film the amazing spider-man 2 hey Amy just a couple of Rando thoughts from 35,000 LAX to JFK a rising trend we see with Millennials are the really extreme forms of experimental exercise like Tough Mudder a sort of filthy triathlon the Color Run and even things like hot power yoga veganism etc Millennials will often post quote NBD on their social media after doing it as in no big deal also known as quote humble brag wondering if Spidey could get into that in some way he's super athletic bendy strong intense and it's all NBD to him of course EDM electronic dance music is the defining music for Millennials wondering if there's an EDM angle somewhere with Spidey his movements are beautiful would be awesome with the killer DJ behind it I hate this snapchat just launched a story functionality which is sort of a quote day in the life of me told in a series of snapchats that expire after 24 hours it has a very VIP quality about it since invitation only getting invited in the Spidey snapchat circle would be a huge [ __ ] getting invited in the Spidey snapchat circle would be huge and very buzzword of E and cool Oh so this is what we were dealing with ideas like this or what Hollywood is really looking for but behind all that behind all the snapchat filters and Studios desperately trying to reach the general audience behind all that is a director a director with a vision a fantastic director who got dealt a [ __ ] hand that director is named Mark Preston Webb I love Mark Webb he made a film that helped define me as a filmmaker and a person 500 days of summer that movie made me feel something so deep so profound and so human Marc Webb likes humans that's what he cares about telling human stories telling stories that are about people growing and changing you know what good spider-man's stories are human stories human stories about Peter Parker growing and changing and that's what Marc Webb set out to do tell a grounded lower-budget human story about a flawed boy turning into a Spider Man and you know what in my honest opinion he almost succeeded you dumb [ __ ] that movie is the definition of uninspired where's spider-man fall for once I agree with you the amazing spider-man one is a mess of a film with so many Abhi's in the kitchen that anything that could have been fresh newer meaningful was seemingly cut out for the sake of a skateboard montage and a giant [ __ ] dinosaur then why are you making this video on the movie you [ __ ] hack Jesus calm down I'm still trying to get sponsored here all right I'm making this video to talk about one scene or rather one character arc that I think really works so instead of being that typical fanboy who rants about bad renditions of beloved characters for 30 minutes I hate being negative all the time so why don't we take a look at a fairly average movie and try to find something that's great about it the amazing spider-man opens with a flashback where a young Peter goes looking for his father literally they are playing hide and seek I think this seems kind of funny considering the entire film is actually about Peter Parker searching for a father figure he gets bit by the spider trying to find closure with Richard Parker he loses Uncle Ben because he takes the father and mother he has for granted he creates the lizard by trying to fix doc Connors arm rather men dr. Connors broken piece and doing this Peter is also trying to fill his own fatherless void or his broken peace and in doing all of this captain Stacy another father figure loses his life one might say that the amazing spider-man is about voids and filling those voids one might say the amazing spider-man is about fatherhood repeats daddy issues one might also say that this opening scene of the amazing spider-man is a metaphor for Peters character arc and motivation a young Peter Parker goes looking for his father you're overanalyzing again Am I the opening of a movie should be a metaphor for the movie itself and this scene is a demonstration that this scene is Peter Parker looking for his father and in a very real way this movie is a about a kid who goes out looking for his father and finds himself so this Peter Parker has daddy issues okay what do daddy issues do to a person what does abandonment do to a kid well this Peter Parker starts to the film a [ __ ] [ __ ] he's irresponsible he's got that early DIC oh I'm better than everyone mentality he skateboards down the hall like a real hardcore mofo he's got a chip on his shoulder and he ain't afraid to show it the point is he's selfish Peter Parker starts the film completely and utterly selfish I think the movie loses a lot of Spidey fans when Peter is still this selfish prick after he dons the costume we as audience members often associate the donning of the classic suit with the completion of a character arc which is true most of the time this is not the case with the amazing spider-man after Peter makes his wearable basketball he's even more of a spider prick he tortures the car thief and laughs about it the entire time tells this cop to go [ __ ] himself forgets the egg shows up late and dirty to Gwen's family dinner causes some beef with captain Stacy at said family dinner and is pretty much only spider-man so he can find the guy who killed Uncle Ben he doesn't like cops he doesn't like Authority his ego has gone wild he has no intention of helping anyone other than himself like I said selfish spider-man's motivation isn't guilt at this point it's vengeance vengeance on the guy who killed Uncle Ben and vengeance on everyone who ever made him feel small why do you think he tortures this car thief it's the bullying victim becoming the bully it's the kid who gets basketballs thrown in his head throwing back that's not very spider-men like or heroic yeah and like it or not that's kind of the point that's why captain's say she says things like this she's hunting down a bunch of criminals that all look the same like he's got some sort of personal vendetta but he's not protecting innocent people mr. Parker Peter's not protecting people he's not doing anything remotely heroic in the film knows it he's not acting like spider-man not yet at least and the amazing spider-man Peter Parker does not become spider-man here he does not become spider-man here he does not become spider-man here Peter Parker finally becomes spider-man on the bridge after being called out by caps taste for being a really good prick and a pretty shitty hero Peter's forced to check out what the hell is happening on this bridge turns out the lizard is having a bad day and is throwing a tantrum that's endangering the lives of all these bystanders just trying to get home from work the lizard the antagonist of the film then puts spider-man the protagonist in a situation that forces him to finally start acting like a hero I'm pretty sure it's the general consensus that this scene is the best one in the film it's definitely the most emotionally impactful scene it's definitely the most spider-man scene in the amazing spider-man so this kid jack is giving off some very familiar vibes he kind of reminds me of this other kid we've seen in the film before oh right Peter is saving this boy spider-man is saving this little boy and what gives this boy the courage declined towards Spidey the mask the spider-man mask the idea of spider-man inspires hope and Jachin gives him the motivation he needs to try to save himself there haven't been many moments like this in the film seeing spider-man as an inspiration and not just some douche with daddy issues who wears spandex and what happens next who'da spider-man bring the boy back to his father spider-man reunites this boy with his father spider-man gives Jack something that Peter can never have again Peter acts completely out of selflessness for the first time in the film and by doing that by finally acting like the heartfelt sincere Webb had we all know and love he's finally able to call himself spider-man [Music] god Garfield really does pull off some seriously good acting with just his body movement and voice there's a reason that this scene is one of the few beloved ones in the Amazing Spiderman duology this moment on the bridge is the birth of spider-man and everything he stands for and you can see him the moding through the mask and he was realizing that he's never gonna have that moment that that that moment it was something that was taken from him and you feel the weight the sort of emotional weight of of what it is to be without a father in this world now he's shedding that and becoming the spider-man that we all know and love and fulfilling his destiny this is the kind of character centric storytelling the film needed more of this is why spider-man is not only an inspiration to Jack but to all of us taking our broken pieces and pain and using that to do good to inspire others to do good Peter will never see Ben again he will never be able to get closure with either of his father's but Jack will watching Peter go from a victim to a vengeance seeking victimizer to a hero is a pretty powerful arc an arc that people seem to ignore I just wish there was more of that I'm willing to bet there was deleted scenes are like cockroaches for everyone you see in the blu-ray there are a hundred more hiding in AVI rods office waiting to be seen so I guess what I'm trying to say in this short ramble is that underneath this mediocre writes keeping general audience appealing studio film there's a beating heart full of good ideas and passion for character focused storytelling it's honestly pretty heartbreaking to think about what could have been the bits and pieces we get of the Peter and flash relationship is fantastic and real the Peter and Gwen scenes are so real the conflict between a caring man and a distant Peter is a great dynamic a real emotionally honest dynamic notice how many times I use the word reel there that's because marc webb keeps things real he keeps things honest people behave like people and like I said before marc webb cares about people that's his greatest strength as a filmmaker i really do believe that a sony had let marc webb make an actual marc webb spider-man film starring andrew [ __ ] Garfield and Emma freakin stone it would have been something special that is still talked about to this day so thanks mark thanks for caring and thanks for trying sorry you got [ __ ] by sony from 35,000 LAX to JFK brand your career your life today [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
