comm / polyphonic to get 30 days of membership for free if there's one thing the Beatles did well it was write love songs in their early days they topped the charts with simple pop tunes about love and that was a message they carried throughout their entire career and over that time the Beatles evolved and changed the way they wrote love songs they experimented with lyrical conceits and pushed their musical boundaries all in the name of singing great love songs so how did a group of teens from Liverpool go from writing songs about holding hands to writing love songs that will be covered by Frank Sinatra and Ray Charles let's take a closer look love dominated the Beatles early work in fact every original song on their first three UK albums was about love or heartbreak and these songs took on love in a very particular way the Beatles were writing for a teen audience and this was reflected in their lyrics they were innocent songs often with a simple conceit look at something like love me do the roots debut single [Music] I love you that song talks about love in the most basic sense loving a partner and staying true to them it also sets the stage for a trend the Beatles carried throughout their early career writing to a lover in the first person the Fab Four wanted to create a connection to their audience and so they didn't write love songs about loving a particular woman there are songs about loving you their female listeners this is evident in the song titles PS I love you all my loving I want to be your man and it wasn't just the album's the Beatles singles followed the same pattern look at I want to hold your hand it's a song written in the first person and it presents an innocent PG version of love holding hands by their third album a hard day's night you could see this trend changing though that album has a song that seems to be a response to I want to hold your hand if I felt cuz I've been in love before and I found that love was more than just holiday ham musically if I fell is a big step forward - it was one of the Beatles first true ballads something that they would go on to perfect later in their career instead of a fast rock and roll song it's more mellow playing up the emotional vulnerability of the lyrics a hard day's night also featured can't buy me love a song that retains some of the Beatles earlier trends but also starts musing on the value of loved enough materialistic this tool would set the stage for some of the Beatles great love songs down the road by the time the Beatles released their next album Beatles for sale they were drawing from folk and country which contributed to the album's sadness out of the 8 originals on Beatles for sale five are about heartbreak including I'm a loser the song is indicative of John Lennon's growing angst and depression the innocence of early love is disappearing as the Beatles discover the complex web that is romance while Lennon is the dark Beatle he's not the only one whose love songs grew sambar on 1965 s help Paul McCartney penned one of the greatest heartbreaking love ballads in his career yesterday all my troubles seemed so far one thing that makes yesterday stand out is how it uses simplicity to hint at complexity like with their earlier love songs yesterday's lyrics don't go into detail about the roses they just describe vague happen [Music] this allows the listener to project their own sorrow and their own past on to the song in doing so it creates a song that's far more complex than a detailed love story could ever be the complexity of love brought on one of the great transformations in how the Beatles wrote about love as they entered the middle of their career they started to write about love as a broader concept love was no longer just romance it was a more powerful force on rubber soles the word they sing that love you at the same time the Beatles were more willing to write sex into their love songs as well Drive my car is much less sterile than their earlier love songs the titular phrase being an old euphemism for sex the sexuality and spirituality of love collided on the Beatles next album revolver by the time revolver came out the psychedelic movement had exploded and the Beatles were in the midst of a transformation no longer a simple pop group they had been experimenting for the last few albums and now we're knee-deep in psychedelia lyrically they had also branched away from love singing songs about everything from sleep to drugs to taxes but still revolver had its fair share of love and breakup songs the love songs in particular were influenced by Eastern music and philosophy in George Harrison's love to you he sings about the spirituality of making love this is a sentiment echoed by John Lennon in Tomorrow Never Knows Lennon's belief in the power of love has grown to the point that love is not just important love is everything when love girls past just two people it becomes an incredible force for change and the Beatles truly believed in the power that love had to change the world George Harrison picks up this thread on the next album sergeant pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band though that album only has a few songs that could be classified as love songs one of them is within us [Applause] influenced by Hindu philosophy George Harrison posits in this song that love could save the world and this idea carried on into the Beatles next great love song all you need is love for many this is the pinnacle of the Beatles love songs it's a beautiful utopian image that encapsulate the feelings of 1967 Summer of Love alongside triumphant horns the Beatles sing a simple message evolved from their repetitive love songs years earlier all you need is there's a clear path from love me do - all you need is love love carried the Beatles to these Heights love was the great driving force behind their career but of course all you need is love wasn't the end of the Beatles career and while it may have been the height of their faith in love it was far from the last love song they ever wrote a year and a half after all you need is love the Beatles released the White Album another drastic shift in their career despite being a double album the longest of their career the White Album is lacking in notable love songs perhaps the most powerful is Julia a simple love ballad which works as a romantic song but was actually written by Lennon about his mother [Music] the beetles have stepped away musically and lyrically from the grandiose statements about the power of love they're returning to their roots with ballads about love between two people but this love is informed by the power of love as a concept in the late stages of their career the beatles put together a diverse set of love songs including some career highlights on abbey road one such track is I want you she's so heavy which breaks love down into its most raw form desire it takes a simple thought and repeats it ad infinitum creating an endless desperate love that climbs to an unresolved climax the B section of the song talks about how love can make someone weigh heavy on your thoughts [Music] [Applause] like their earliest songs I want you as a distillation of Rob down to acetyl pure thought another love song on Abbey Road takes the same premise attraction but goes in a different direction in doing so something becomes one of the most romantic songs of the Beatles come [Music] in these lyrics Harrison channels McCartney's yesterday he paints a universal picture by staying vague it's something is smile something in a moment that builds this love everyone can relate to that because of course there's something about everyone's love that made them fall in the first place musically Harrison pulls from the great love songs of the past in fact he wrote this song with Ray Charles in mind and then of course there's the end while most of this song is instrumental it finishes you topics love was the friend Harry been to you by looking at the Beatles career channel [Music] [Music]
