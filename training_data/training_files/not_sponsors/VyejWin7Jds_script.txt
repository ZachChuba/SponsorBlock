go watch Hicks it's like one of my favorite videos that I've done for a while but I thought I would show you something else that I bought yesterday that I didn't put in this hole I'm just eating melon mmm just to give some context I have broken two of my Bowl plates now my pink Bowl plates they've just smashed on me I don't actually know what happened I was eating I'm one of them either day and I noticed a massive crack in it and then the whole site just came off so I've treated myself to some new ones just the ball plates though I'm not fine like place or balls or anything I'm just buying the pasta dishes so I got these ones from Marks and Spencers which I I hope every single time that I go in I just think they're so pretty the white on the outside and that is a perfect perfect Bowl plate size and I eat everything on a ball plate so I got four of those it was 20% off home wear this weekend which was amazing these were eight pounds each so I got however much that is offic mom's getting lots of pure box out for friends to root through because they're coming around in a minute before we give lots to the women's charity so we just waited for Bev and Rebecca to come round now I'm not sure what time they will be arriving I'm not getting out of pajamas today but that's alright [Music] good morning boys come on let's get you some tuna just some tuna good morning guys I didn't really vlog yesterday it was a little bit of a failure but we just had a chill day but when Rebecca came round to have a look at Pierre box he took some things at home for themselves and that is pretty much all that happened I did not leave the house which was lovely it was Easter Sunday and got an egg this was till 1:00 which I'm happy about because that means I won't eat a crazy amount of chocolate but today mom and I are actually going back to Ikea because I want another one of the lights that I bought is I want matching bedside table lamps I thought always going to use it in the living room but I actually would like to use it as a bedside table lamp so I'm gonna buy another and then we're gonna go to Primark see if there's anything and if there is I will do a Primark haul when I get back to Brighton but yeah today's my last day well I guess I'm gonna have to pipe my case later and everything let's go [Music] maybe I'm not the one that you betrayed [Music] my finger no Nelly please love

chocolate buttons which you're probably gonna melt in the car if it's hot then I've got this granola which is so nice it's got like little bits of pineapple and stuff in and got three melons some of these Kabuto gluten-free chicken parts which are my favourite but they're actually 10 points which is kind of crazy so I would try some of this I saw my friend Lucy do a spawn for them son oh I don't
