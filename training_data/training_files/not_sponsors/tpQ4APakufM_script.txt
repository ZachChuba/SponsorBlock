as i've said many times before the fact that runescape gold is a valuable real-life currency means that intricate scam rings pop up that try to swindle players out of thousands of dollars worth of runescape gold today we're covering one of the more malicious advanced scams i've seen since the scam targets small twitch streamers who have archived their footage we'll get to see literally every step of the scan make sure to leave a like on this video and subscribe if you haven't already it's confirmed that this scam has been attempted at least 10 times but probably many more i don't know how much total gp the scammers have gotten away with but let's stop that now as i said before the scam targets streamers with small audiences these targets are high level and clearly have big banks the targets i've seen are doing raids with at least a couple billion gp when step one of the scam is initiated that comes in the form of a request for advice it seems completely harmless since the streamers are small their chat isn't super active so the scammer comes along and asks if the streamer can check out his raid setup and tell him if it's good enough yeah i'm gonna check the setup right now actually did you whisper to me so you're rocking the void setup now this is what a regular gyazo link looks like and this is the screenshot of the yazoo link whispered to one of these high level targets notice the whispered link has gyazo.nl it's a fake link that can grab your ip address if you aren't using a vpn this step can happen a long time before the rest of the scam even days before it's important to remember later that now the scammer has the streamer's ip address and can illegally ddos the streamer disconnecting the streamer's internet and therefore interrupting the runescape session before we get to step think a lot of you will enjoy now step two of the scam is the scammer usually on a different twitch account asking the streamer to stake a small amount of gold for him usually 10 mil the scammer can be insanely persistent even when the streamer refuses five times in a row uh no felkay i don't stake there are a lot of debt streamers out there if you want to watch them feel free to but personally i do not stink i think you'll have more luck finding somebody i'm saying like you can find another streamer yeah my bad man i can't i refuse to go to the arena i know it's your money man but unfortunately i can't get your account up bro you know if you want a steak you gotta you gotta put in that grind man if there's literally one active viewer asking for a long time in the chat to stake for him i can see how a small streamer would eventually give it and each example i've seen it's the same level 62 account that trades the 10 ml when the streamer finally gives in username geechee so the target goes to the dual arena and someone in on the scam challenges the streamer to the 10 mil duel notice in the clip the account has already challenged the streamer before the streamer starts auto chatting the 10 mil stake this can go on for a few rounds with the scammer in the chat asking to stake another 10 mil or double up if the streamer wins eventually after two or more duels like this the opponent's tentacle whip breaks during a stake did his tent just break when a tentacle whip breaks you get the kraken tentacle back but the whip is gone here is step three and this is the part of the scam where things get too good to be true it should raise red flags the opponent whose whip just broke immediately challenges the streamer again he pretends like he doesn't notice his tentacle whip has broken in doobie dobby's example the scammers in the chat start saying they think it's a broken staking bot in other versions of the scam the opponent says he's drunk and starts misspelling words either way the chat starts egging the streamer on encouraging him to chuck his bank against the opponent who clearly has no whip his tent was literally broken what a shame the other guy had broken whip i don't know why he would call he has a broken whip what do you mean that's so free he wouldn't have accepted but he does want to stake in fact he puts up 1.5 billion gp with no whip but the opponent does have another weapon a gilded scimitar who would ever stake 1 billion gp rune scimitar vs tentacle whip it seems like a free one bill and the chat says so but there's one small detail these streamers aren't prolific stakers they just came to the dual arena from doing raids during most high level pvming you have auto retaliate off just like doobie dobbies does here fortunately for doobie dobbies his friend had already fallen for this lure and people in his chat also started warning him about the scam so he didn't lose any money here's footage of a different streamer who wasn't so lucky he wants to remain anonymous which is why the footage is cropped the same process happens ichi wants him to stake for him and trades him 5 mil he stakes the same guy for a while whose tentacle whip eventually breaks this time the streamer's opponent pretends to be drunk this streamer even tells the guy where'd your whip go get your whip as the scammer puts up 2.8 billion gp eventually the streamer is convinced by his chat to put up 1.1 bill the streamer double checks every setting and that his opponent's whip is broken for five minutes the opponent has a dds but special attack is turned off finally the streamer hits accept on the second stake window and that's where the stream ends the scammers ddos the streamer right as he hits accept and then they enter the stake and since the streamer's auto retaliate is off the scammer pokes the streamer to death with his dds the streamer's internet turns back on later and the stream starts up he obviously logs in without his 1.1 bill super sad to see within 15 seconds of his stream starting back up one of the scammers who is in doobie dobby's chat even asks did you win i was curious about the guy who entered doobie dobby's twitch chat warning him of the scam and was able to get in contact with him he said he had broken up six of these scam attempts so far and the scammers had been trying to dox him repeatedly for doing so luckily he has a vpn now going forward scammers are very clever and may edit the process of this scam after this video to confuse you or make you think you are in control of what is happening i would never try to anti-scam people based on a video i make if anything fishy or too good to be true ever appears in game i would highly recommend you to simply walk away pop worlds and add that player to your ignore list or ban them from your twitch chat i did have my own ideas on how to anti-scam these guys though although i didn't go through with it for example it would be very easy to write a script that sends the packet information required to change your auto retaliate to on without actually clicking the button or showing the interface kind of like how auto prayer switchers work so then a potential target that knows the scam could turn their auto retaliate on and likely win the stake with their whip even though they were ddosed obviously because i've made this video don't try that and it would be against the game rules that would be fighting fire with fire although i did try to anti-scam some other scammers at the dual arena this was a much more small scale and it was sent to me by a guy that i'll call jay shout out to him i'm sure most of you know now about the low-level maple shortbow scammers that basically give you a maple short bow and some rune arrows and try to stake lots of money against you even though they're way lower level since you can't use the rune arrows with the maple short bow you lose you try to anti-scam them they change the settings of the duel to scam you in some other way you'll likely never trick them and i wouldn't recommend trying but they're so eager to scam people that there was an opportunity to make some gold so i found items in the grand exchange that had an official price higher than what they were actually going for at the time obsidian plate bodies were going for 1.1 mil in the ge but were actually selling for 60k less than that so i brought them to the arena without any cash i was immediately challenged by some of the bose gamers but said i didn't have cash only items if you're persistent enough they'll just buy the items off of you for the ge value so you can pocket an easy 500 or 600k each time you get one of them i did this four or five times in an hour before they caught on and felt pretty proud of myself make sure to leave a like on this video and keep your eyes open for potential scams in game
