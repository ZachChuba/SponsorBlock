today I wanted to share with you a little experiment that I've been conducting over the past few days there's been a bit of a discussion in the warzone community recently about the advantages of playing on PC with a controller and why do people do it it kind of doesn't make sense right well the theory goes that if you use a controller on PC you get all of the advantages of PC but you end up playing against lobbies of mostly made up of console players and so I wanted to test this and see if there's any truth to it but first though how would you track the lobbies and figure out who you're playing against well there's a website called Cod tracker and this allows you to search for a player's name see their stats but also more importantly a history of the matches that they played it and that's what I used to gather my data manually counting players and which platform they were on so I plugged in an Xbox controller into my PC and queued up for 10 trio's matches with Phil turned on each time entering the lobby and then quitting the game ten times in a row and then I did this again ten matches in a row but this time I used my mouse and keyboard as the input device I also tested some mixed input lobbies too with a couple of friends in trios and quads because I know that people would ask if that made a difference as I've heard plenty of people suggest that you can get into easier lobbies if you have control the players in your party and then after that I looked on Cod tracker to check my match history and recorded how many people in each of those lobbies were on PC and how many were playing on console with a controller I'm going to share with you the results that I got and I think there's a couple of surprises here and before we look at these let me say that this is in no way conclusive and it's a very small sample size more testing needs to be done these are just my observations from 50 different matches also I don't know if there are any other factors affecting this like skill based matchmaking or ping so the data could be skewed because of that anyways here we go then so in 9 out of the 10 matches I was playing with a controller on PC and queuing up for trials on my own I was in lobbies heavily dominated with console players most of them had fewer than seven PC players in on average that's around 5% of PC players per Lobby over the 10 games very low there was one anomaly though where it put me in a game with 52 PC players still the minority there but across the board it's obvious that there is a pattern here if I used a controller on PC queuing on my own it put me in overwhelming majority console lobbies and before you ask go try it yourself if you queue using a controller on PC you can't unplug it when you're in a match and start using the mouse and keyboard it doesn't work and it forces you to go back to the main menu and leave the game to change your input device or you can just plug your controller back in to continue playing so Infinity Ward and Raven Software clearly thought about this and people potentially taking advantage of it beforehand next up here are the results of me queuing for trios on my own with Phil turned on with a mouse and keyboard on PC 10 games in a row for a direct comparison and it's 53% PC players across the board that's 10 times more PC players per match one of the games even put me in a match with 66% PC players the story starts to change a bit with quads though when I asked my friends to help and we made a Lobby that had two controller players and two Mouse players six out of the ten lobbies had more control of players in but you can see that four of the lobbies actually had more PC players in but only just so in this kind of Lobby setup on average over ten games forty six point eight percent of the lobby were on PC what if you shift the balance of a lobby into the favor of controller then does that mean that I had more console players in my games well in this data set I had two controller players in my lobby and me on Mouse queuing for trios this actually gave us about 56 percent average PC players in every lobby and the highest with this set up that we saw was 100 PC players in a lobby versus 50 one console players and finally what if all of the players in a party on PC use a controller what happens then well as you can see it's an obvious shift away from PC with this setup five percent of the lobby on average were on PC and remember that includes me and my squad in fact there was one match where the only people playing on PC were just us why is this interesting to talk about there and why should you care well of course it's subjective and that's up to you but to me it's interesting because it throws up some questions about how this matchmaking works and what are the consequences of that it appears that before anything else though it will prioritize your input and speed so then with this knowledge based on that small test that I've done I would say that if you play by yourself regularly and you're already good on a controller let's say you've played console shooters for years or you were a pro player whatever playing on PC with a controller would be the most efficient and comfortable way to play and a lot of people in fact already do this so if you've got three or four excellent controller players together in a lobby all playing on PC with a controller they would be put in an overwhelmingly console based Lobby why do this then well first up some people just prefer controller that's fine but if you play with controller on PC you still get a misis the same as the console players do something else you get is a higher field of view which means that you can see more on console the warzone field of view is locked to a tee and can't be changed on PC you can go up to 120 and see just so much more in these examples here I've recorded you can clearly see how having a bigger field of view would reveal way more information on the screen and show you targets that you wouldn't be able to see on console you also get high frequency 240 Hertz monitors and higher frame rates meaning the gameplay is way smoother and responsive and you get to put your graphic settings on low so you've got better visibility there's so many advantages to playing on PC with a controller versus a console player on a controller it's a different world what have I taken from this though and what feedback would I give well based on the games that I've played here and the results from them it's obvious to me that there is heavy input based bias with the matchmaking if I use a controller I'm Way more likely to be paired with and against more control the players regardless of if I'm on PC with all of the advantages that we talked about but if I use a mouse generally about 50% of the lobby we'll also be on PC and the other 50% is made up of ps4 and Xbox players the quads results though were quite different and when looking at that data if you've got a mixed input pre-made Lobby it appears to be attempting to evenly distribute the players across the board 50% PC players 50% console and I guess with cross play enabled that would be the fairest way of doing it however there are going to be some anomalies I've looked at lots of different match histories and for myself personally I've had a few games works 90% console and 10% PC and I'm using a mouse as such sometimes in pre-made quads or trios when you're using a mouse you will get into a lobby dominated by console players I would assume because the matchmaking is having difficulty matching input and skill and it starts to prioritize speed instead and if you get into one of those lobbies and you're in a premade squad who are sick on mouse and keyboard you will probably have a really high kill game in that Lobby as for the trio's results when we were all playing on PC with a controller that's where I see the biggest advantage for those players versus the lobby of console players because it's consistently grouping you together with them honestly though I don't think this affects that many players in the long run primarily because most people on PC are using a mouse and Infinity Ward are definitely protecting their console players here by more often than not bundling them into lobbies together as best they can but when you start to introduce cross play in bigger game modes like quads things start to get a bit more complicated and difficult to balance so there will be the occasional bloodbath from time to time ask for comments on using a mouse it would appear that once the mouse is involved in your party that you're playing with if you're using it or someone else in your party is you are way more likely to have a lot more PC players in your Lobby usually half of the lobby and you will have tougher and more challenging matches I would import writhing out for yourself though if you've got a PC you up by yourself or with some friends or using controller and see how the game feels I mean we've done it a few times now and it's a completely different experience much more chilled and the fights tend to be longer and more drawn-out don't just take my word for it though do your own testing and see what you come up with something else that barely anyone we'll be affected by either this could have an impact on the war zone competitions that are going on at the moment because if you are in a squad all playing on PC with controllers you'll most likely be getting into console lobbies versus other teams who may be playing in mixed lobbies or lobbies using a mouse meaning they're going to go up against more PC players and have more challenging games could be something to think about with that said that's it for today folks I hope you enjoyed this one and do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below with such a big player base do they need to be that aggressive with this matchmaking and could it be more random should all of the PC players be put in a lobby together as much as they can even if they're using a controller would that be too unfair to the people who like to use control on PC or maybe they could be competitive if they're a good player against people with mouse and keyboard let's hear your opinion so you can like it subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one
