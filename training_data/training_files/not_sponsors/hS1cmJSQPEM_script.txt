so we're coming back at you from CES 2019 where a sous brought the CES show to us this is the Zephyrus s GX 701 the latest in their lineup of hyper thin and yet super powerful gaming laptops you might not be able to tell from the outside or from its weight or even from the inside unless you're like some kind of electronics engineer and/or you know this heat pipe design means anything to you but this is gonna be one of the most powerful gaming laptops out there we're gonna show you all around it and our CES I'm standing [Music] so from the outside the new Zephyrus inherits a lot of the traits of it 15-inch predecessors it's super thin you've got your exhaust ports here here here and here because there is a lot of heat to dissipate and you've got a actually pretty ample selection of IO with the one thing that's notably missing being an rj45 jack because the thing is quite honestly just too darn thin to fit it but there are some really cool new additions that are obvious before we even open it up so while it does have a power in Jack it can also accept right there USB type-c power up to 65 watts so that means you can actually top this thing up on the go or at the very least extend your gaming time by a little bit another thing that's really cool here is that they have made some not too obvious changes to the thermal design they're not strictly speaking new to this generation of Zephyrus but they're definitely worth mentioning so these fans here are now made using a liquid crystal polymer which is presumably to make them like super mega hyper thin and the shrouds for them have been redesigned as well so right here they've got like a dust collection chamber so you won't gunk up the fins of your heatsink and they've added up a little pump to it let's just say they've got a little lip on the bottom that keeps here we go typical Zephyrus fashion that keeps the cool air that's being drawn in from this flap that opens up at the bottom when you open up the screens from mixing too much with the hot air that's coming out here and here because it wouldn't do you a lot of good to exhaust the hot air if you just sucked it right back in now let's get it opened up and this is where things get exciting these bezels are hyper thin so even though it's a 17 inch display the laptop itself is crazily actually not that big and there's a couple of options there's a 144 Hertz 1080p version and that is gonna be obviously for the gamers out there but even not quite because it's Pantone certified so you could do some light content creation on it and they're gonna have a 400 nits peak brightness HDR display with local dimming so that's right 400 nits peep redness right so yeah good try now one disadvantage to this thin bezel approach that you might have picked up on is that I tried to launch the camera happened oh wow it doesn't have a webcam so a Seuss's rationale here is that most gamers don't care about the webcam anyway so they went so far as to not even include a crappy one down here but to rip it out entirely assuming that anything you could build into a tiny little bezel or anything like that wouldn't be acceptable anyway and they might as well just ship a standalone webcam and it appears that it mounts that's the standalone stand for it well you know what I've had enough of your crap Jeff ah it goes like that oh look how much of your screen it covers can it kind of bite onto it like that okay so it's an imperfect solution but it's better than nothing you know which is quite literally what you have if you don't put this on I've been informed it is at least 1080p 60fps so now let's talk specs this little puppy is equipped with a 6 core 8750 h our particular model has 24 gigs of ram for some reason and you can get it with either a GTX tensa 2070 or 2018 max q did I say GTX the first time damn it so this thing is equipped with an RT X 27 T which I don't know if it's equivalent to the desktop version because Nvidia won't tell us a damn thing about it or a 28 Emacs Q which I also don't know a damn thing about because Nvidia won't tell us anything about it so I don't know how neutered the 28 Emacs Q is although presumably if Asus bothered to do two SKUs it's either because Nvidia their arm behind their back or because even with the max-q variate the 20 80 is still at least a little bit faster than 2017 either way what we know is that you can turn our TX on and have glorious 40 to 55 FPS gaming on this machine and there's a few other extras so the keyboard backlight is now brighter than ever this wheel right here adjusts the volume and oh it has a 50% bigger battery yes my friends Asus used a bunch of the extra space they have down here to put a 76 watt hour battery in this thing so now you can gain for even a little bit more over an hour on battery fabuloso now in fairness to a soos it does include the same GPU switch button that'll actually trigger an entire restart of the machine and switch between g-sync discrete graphics mode and optimist mode where you can't have G sync but our testing on those FSM yielded something like 54 minutes of battery life in the PC mark battery test even in optimist mode so I'm still not expecting this to be like you know the machine for meetings at the office or whatever unless your office has very very short meetings anyway what do people expect it doesn't have Thunderbolt no no Thunderbolt I disapprove but I pretty cool go check that out at the link below as well so don't miss any of our CES nineteen content I think the rest of it will actually be on the show floor so the lake see you guys there I'm gonna like warp in between this video and the next one to Vegas and by subscribing to Linus tech tips
