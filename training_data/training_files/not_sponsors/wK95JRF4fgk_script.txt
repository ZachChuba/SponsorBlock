what's up guys I'm random Frank P back with episode 192 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best gaming setups give you some ideas inspirations for your own setup I know I kept you waiting a bit it's been a few weeks don't worry the series isn't dead its back who's just watching it up with some other content literally episode three you're switching it up so we're back the room tour project see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out let's kick off episode 192 this episode link for you in the description down below first up we have kaigu with the setup with of you starting off the episode strong with a hell of a good rhyme regardless but that massive you know that huge just window there set up right in front of it just gotta be real cool to overlook all that so checking it out he's going with the single display on the relatively smaller desk here to save space it's a 27 inch from viewsonic and I'm thinking the custom wallpaper configuration most likely with rain meter and stuff like that now checking out his peripherals the keyboard is the N pro 2 wireless mechanical keyboard with those putting key caps for that RGB glow the mouse is the logitech g502 light speed wireless and I'm really diggin this extended mousepad he has it has RGB and Wireless Qi charging built-in pretty cool then ask for audio is headset is logitech g930 3 Artemis spectrum with this little kind of mood moon lamp if you will over to the PC this is the NZXT the H 510 case and inside that Intel i7 6700 K CPU with the aig oh I go ego whoever you want to say in t 240 I see ai yo got 16 gigs of China and z/r GB RAM on a gigabyte motherboard with the zotac GTX 10 80 TI graphics card looking really nice and clean on the inside props with a nice build and then right next to the setup here's a nice little entertainment center spot for you know console gaming and stuff like that see the switch the ps4 Xbox all that there on the 46 inch sharp TV so a really cool little gaming corner he has going on and again just a killer view this is pretty built my man next up is bro burg in holy loud this is a nice all across the board this is first off a completely custom made desk so everybody wondering where you can buy that Marvel you can't cuz he custom made it so props for that and the really clean triple monitor mounting job looks like it's floating great job on cable management and behind all three of the displays he has the amber light to extend the color that's going on on his screen to just add that you know back lighting behind it which is going along to whatever he's watching or gaming this is a really cool job hooked up to an Arduino kits I actually did a video on this in like 2014 maybe maybe even 2013 I don't know a long time ago before I was even doing like tech reviews and it is as you can see pretty dope so let's actually get into the beef of the things I can just ramble on about how clueless looks all day for those three monitors they are each the lenovo think vision p24 cue so there are 24 inches of piece and man just look at that desk can you build me one this is crazy now down to the peripherals for his keyboard it's the logitech k7 40 with logitech g502 and his headphones over there in the corner the Sennheiser are 175 Wireless down to the PC inside the fractal mesh fic case is an AMD rise in 2700 X CPU with asus rog Strix 470 f motherboard 16 gigs of tried NZ r gb ram and a power color dragon rx 580 graphics card usually you know I would be opposed to putting the PC on the ground but since you have a gorgeous desk like this that is just insane I wouldn't also put this underneath so bro burg my bro this is a crazy gaming setup that is just like something you would dream about now we've got MS games with the RGB all around here and what's really cool about this is it features pixels pretty much everywhere because that is a massive 49 inch Samsung monitor for the main display and there's also that one on the left side the vertical 25 inch ultra wide from LG got the crazy RGB PC banana leaf or light panels on the wall behind it and this is just straight-up color now checking out the peripherals for the keyboard this is the master op alt which has zillio svey two switches and some nice artisan that stuff as well that's going along with the glorious pc gaming race m√°talo mouse on the Godspeed RGB mouse pad by novel keys and then for audio we have the corsair avoid pro RGB wireless headset with the courser st 100 RGB headsets and then like clockwork over to the RGB PC this is the corsair 5 70 x RGB crystal case in size an intel i7 9700 k cpu with the coarser h 115 i pro RGB AIO with 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance pro RGB RAM on the Asus prime z 390 a motherboard and the MSI Marty X 28 II gaming extra Oh gravity art hell of a build hell of a setup mixed with all the terms like the RGB and pro that's marketing for you but if I were to think of RGB Pro in my hand this is a setup that would pretty much come to mind coming in hot is Alan P with the triple monitor setup that somehow still manages to look very organized and clean so big props for that and there is a lot of really cool stuff going on here so for his main display it's a Samsung CR g9 yes a 49 inch ultra wide which is what we just saw any last set up but it doesn't even look that big here so that gives you you know an idea of the scale of how big this setup is the overhead is a 49 inch 4k LG TV and the vertical monitor on the left side is a 34 inch ultra wide from LG man oh man good job on the cable management as well as the mounting job overall down to the peripherals the keyboard is the eagletech kg0 11 with the razer deathadder mouse on a glorious extended mousepad for audio he has the bose companion 3 series speakers you could see in the back and what's not pictured is the ath m50x headphones now over to the PC the fantex enthu luxe case we have an Intel i7 4790k CPU with the coarser h100 a GTX a i/o 16 gigs of HyperX fury ram on an MSI z97 s crate edition motherboard an EVGA GTX 1080 TI superclocked graphics card gonna fry that all clean white IC build and to show some of his other hobbies in his setup right behind it is this massive case showing off all these collector's edition you know figures and stuff like that so tons and tons of figures here on display looking really cool in those cases as well as a separate you know area of the house for his other collection of shoes which looks nuts as well so for a gaming room you have the crazy awesome looking gaming setup with tons of figures right behind it plus the shelves on each side of the set up a nice bay window and damn Alan is bringing the heat then last but not least is a very unique setup that goes all out with the dedication to that war theme at the camo the helmets the masks the guns Cartier we could say is pumped for some modern warfare coming out less than a week and you know he's gonna be playing that there's just no BS going on here when he said stand the game he is a hundred percent lock in and against the dedication here you love to see it you love to see it for the display it is yet again the Samsung crg 90 another 49 inch Auto ID I don't plan this it just happens for the peripherals kind of tough to see but see Razer BlackWidow chroma keyboard with a special little GI branding there with the Razer DeathAdder chroma Mouse more that camo netting to fit him with a theme and that all continues even over to the PC which looks straight out of a camp itself this is the Corsair Vengeance e 70 case inside has an Intel i7 7600 K CPU with the enter max T 40 cooler 32 gigs of a data XP gz1 ram on asus rog Strix b 250f motherboard an msi RT x 2070 Ventus GPU the gas mask the phone just little things that you add to it just really helps you know contribute to that theme even underneath for is footrest it's an ammo case come on who else is doing this much attention to detail so I set up before and I'll say it again dedication 110 percent this is one of the best you know themed setups that just goes all in and it literally makes you feel like you're in a military camp you're gonna shelter somewhere in the heat of battle just trying a game and that's just the overall experience then I'm you know feeling from here so good job man alright
