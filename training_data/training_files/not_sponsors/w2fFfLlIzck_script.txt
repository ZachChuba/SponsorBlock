the Corsair one gaming system is basically like the pistol and halo combat Evolved it's small and understated and totally overpowered now you might be thinking okay Linus yeah the one was pretty cool when it came out two years ago but what is it done for me lately how does it merit a reira view well since you asked although these two look very similar on the outside the internals had actually gotten a complete overhaul this one is rocking a liquid-cooled core I $9.99 hundred K and a liquid-cooled r-tx 2080 ti so let's find out how Corsair did that after I or Android device use offer code Linus to get 25% off at the link below [Music] before we go any further I need to talk about one area where Corsair totally dropped the ball here see the fins here on the original model they are slightly above the fan grill meaning that when you stroke them the one sings you this wonderful little tune as for the new one hold a ruined but seriously the build quality and design on display here is still fantastic every single part of it just feels so solid and in my opinion this machine just doesn't have a bad side it looks great in basically any situation from a professional studio where desk space is at a premium to the computer room of a well-off gamer where the addition of RGB lighting is sure to impress children of all ages now unless you have a particularly keen eye the old one and the new one which we'll be calling the deuce from now on to avoid confusion look nearly identical the front i/o has been moved down and expanded the headphone jack here is a very welcome addition and the side actually has a bit of additional venting cut into it but really that's about it for now getting around to the back ah ok so now we're getting somewhere the motherboard is clearly in a different place and it looks like the position of the power supply has also changed so let's dive in then and figure out exactly what's going on here so pressing this button on the back allows us to remove the fan from the top that's the one right so pressing this button on the back so how are you doing this so pressing this button on the back allows us to remove the fan from the top here you can see it's there yeah now it's unplugged it's a hundred and forty millimeters and takes care of the majority of the cooling pulling air in through the radiators that you can actually see on either side here and then exhausting it right up the top in our testing this results in nearly silent operation in many situations and even under full load the deuce is shockingly quiet with the two and a half inch hard drive and the quiet water pump competing to be an allow de store more like least quiet component removing these four screws then that's a marker thought I have my screwdriver in my pocket I don't removing these four screws then allows our sides to slide down so here here here and here this gives us basically unfettered access to the guts so with it open we can see that there are two distinct thermal zones so this radiator on this side provides up to three hundred watts of cooling power for our GPU and then this one over here which is actually a little bit smaller gives us about a hundred and sixty-five watts for the CPU now this dual zone design isn't new but courser has actually flipped around which side the components are on and one benefit of that change is massively better cable management like let's start by looking at the GPU here I love how they were able to get all of the cabling along the edge over here see this it's all tucked in there nicely rather than just sprawling everything across the components and as for the motherboard huh you can see the improvement on the motherboard side immediately because you can see the motherboard at all and the tubing to the radiators has also bench which is a surprisingly important improvement for anyone that might want to upgrade this machine in the future in the past when you were putting the one back together it was really easily to accidentally kink the tubing completely cutting off cooling to one of the sides not very user-friendly moving back to the GPU we can actually see here that the water block is only responsible for cooling the GPUs core with v RM and power management being taken care of by this actively cooled heatsink this is actually not the first time I've seen a design like this there were some older they were called uni sinks back when detectors did it and you were expected to kind of like duct-tape a fan to it there was like no official way to do it but it works really really well and there are a couple of reasons for that one it focuses all your cooling power on the GPU itself where there's actually a performance benefit to be gained and theoretically if you're a true enthusiast it's possible you'd be able to take it and then transplant it onto a future RTX 9000 or whatever the case may be as long as you could figure out some way to deal with the memory and the VRMs now we can't say for sure how easy that's going to be but we do know that compared to a full cover block that is specific to the card there's a better chance you'd be able to reuse some of your components well we can also say for sure is that we got some outstanding cooling results out of this setup here in 3d mark the deuce was expectedly within our margin of error for performance compared to an air-cooled card with the temperatures leveling off in the high 70s after 45 minutes of gaming so what that means is that you might not have a massive amount of headroom for overclocking or anything but it also means that you can expect full boost clocks indefinitely while your system remains quieter than basically any air-cooled card let alone an air-cooled card in a tiny chassis like this moving over to the other side I just I feel like I have to bring this up again how impressive the improvements in cable routing are compared to the old model routine upgrades will be significantly easier this time around there's not a ton that you can upgrade out-of-the-box since our config is already loaded for bear both RAM slots are populated for a total of 32 gigs the single to a half inch drive day is occupied by a 2 terabyte hard drive and the 480 gig m2 SSD is located on the back of the motherboard which is probably actually easier to access by pulling off the graphics card but the really interesting thing over here is the CPU radiator which is actually smaller compared to the outgoing model this allows the compact 600 watt power supply to pull in fresh air from the outside rather than recycled warm air from inside the system so that means that it can actually operate much more efficiently which contributes to the overall quietness of our machine and then back to the size here Corsair claims that they actually managed to increase the cooling capacity since the new layout has a smaller rad but one that allows more air to be pulled through it so let's see how that works out for them actually looks like it's pretty well so our core I 999 hundred K stayed right at a blistering 4.7 gigahertz and games even after giving it plenty of time to heat up the coolant and our temperatures managed to hold comfortably around the mid 70s under a full synthetic load you will end up sacrificing some clock speed dropping down to about 3.8 gigahertz on all eight cores but that's actually what we expect from the CPU when Intel's power draw specifications are followed and it is an absolute beast so once again in the spec view perf productivity test the deuce throws up numbers that are nearly identical to what we saw from our open air test bench with the only real downer for productivity being the lack of an option for 10 Gigabit Ethernet which if for being honest is a must-have for professionals that are working with large heavy files like the 8k red footage that we deal with around here overall though the story remains the same the course r1 is able to give you the performance of a top-of-the-line gaming system in a compact package while somehow managing to remain quiet cool and sexy but of course with great design comes great cost and that really is the biggest downside of the deuce which starts at three thousand dollars for the i-140 with the better equipped I 160 that we've got here weighing in at an eye-watering thirty-six hundred US dollars so let's put it aside for a second and change the subject a little bit this is the MS I tried index it isn't liquid-cooled the build quality is fine but not exceptional it's bigger it gets a bit louder under load and it has half the RAM but it also reaches a similar level of gaming performance and costs one thousand US dollars less and it gets worse for the one in Corsair zone lineup you'll find the Vengeance gaming PC that we reviewed recently now it does step the performance down a touch but you still get a two-year warranty and you save it $600 not to mention that there's better upgrade ability and that's ignoring the option of building your own PC which I guess puts me in sort of an awkward position doesn't it because the deuce gives me like a great big nerd rection and I think a world where everybody had one of these would be a better world and Corsair deserves that stacks of cash for the engineering work not to mention the design work that has gone on here it's just that at this price you do need to have some serious disposable income to drop on your dues speaking of disposable check them out today at LM GGG / p IA - - we'll have that link below so thanks for watching
