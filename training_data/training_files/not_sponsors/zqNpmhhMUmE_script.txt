not ruling out signs Joe Brady is offense coordinator who I thought would get a lot more looks you know because the trend Kliff Kingsbury gets a gig Matt Lafleur gets a gig Sean McVeigh gets a gig these young brilliant offensive minded guys from whether college or the NFL are getting his head coaching gig Joe Brady who made Joe burrow the most impressive quarterback in the history of college football that that is not just saying like hey there's Joe Burrell guy is the most impressive I've ever seen oh that's real highest completion percentage most touchdowns most effective offense in the SEC history I mean this Joe Brady guy single handily came in and earn Joe Burrell forty million dollars I mean I mean it's just and you would think with the world in the way the NFL is that you would want this because they ran a little RPO as well the way the NFL is training you would have thought that Joe Brady would have gotten a lot more looks and he was his name was even mentioned four things seeking now back to the magic and I think Matt rule was sitting back looking at this whole thing he was like believin Browns aren't gonna interview this guy Giants aren't gonna talk to this guy they're not they're not even Cowboys aren't even gonna look at this guy you say that sounds good to me thirty year old guy who just flipped the SEC on its frickin head I'll bring him in to Terrell ina which I think does mean by the way that they're probably gonna get a new quarterback I think if you unless I might be able to do some real good things with Cam Newton I mean I mean that is a decision that's gonna have to be made and I don't think they're all out on Cam Newton but I do know that if they do release Cam Newton they get 19 million more dollars for a team that looks like they're gonna have seven years in a patient owner to build however you want to build Cam Newton can play for another seven years easy the guy in the future I don't know we're gonna find out I think just Joe Brady higher was a good one but now Matt rule has to figure out who's gonna be the leader of his defense
