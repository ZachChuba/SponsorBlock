in a bit three warning they haven't seen this episode yet and let's get started okay the episodes title is a nod to the 2014 Tom Cruise film edge of tomorrow live die repeat based on the graphic novel all you need is kill the movie is a kind of a cross between Groundhog Day and Independence Day with cruises repeat deaths during an alien war resetting his day within a time loop much like Rik in this episode the opening scene at breakfast Morty cyber stalks Jessica's gross funeral selfie Instagram name Jessica hashtag Nana life hashtag Yolo hashtag Instagram ah ah and wearing a necklace she got from the Jimmy Buffett theme chain restaurant Margaritaville ever since last season's finale Rick is now at the bottom of the family hierarchy having to now ask permission to take Morty on an adventure Morty would you please accompany me to for boat Jalan Prime for death crystals definitely some foreboding wordplay there with the planet named for buh jewel on prime a place we can buy death crystals that give you foreboding premonitions the opening credits tease some new shots that may or may not be an upcoming episodes this season there's a giant monstrous Morty head and a space battle who's shown up another promos we've seen this season a robotic morty fighting snakes maybe these are the snakes that Rick hides in a tube dude trick people into thinking he has magic powers there's also a shot of rick fighting a jacked old dude wearing two rings maybe there's a plan o's reference in the works there there's another giant morty and then the family hiding from a two-headed goose might just be one of the joke throw away one so they put in there rick and morty weave through an asteroid field similar to Han and Empire Strikes Back and notice the asteroids have this inner indigo tinted glow the same color of the death crystals presumably these asteroids crashing the surface of what results in the geodes where the crystals can be harvested morty touches a crystal and gets his first glimpse of his infinite possible deaths which show up again again throughout this episode is filled with fun Easter eggs if you look at him let's break down each of these scenarios that we can see more deer each is up for a book on a library top shelf and falls off the ladder similar to his death in the Roy VR video game morty gets fried in electric chairs surrounded by some interesting looking characters morty gets pinned beneath the dumpster by the bully morty skills off the cliff wall that we saw him climbing in the season 4 trailer morty gets his head caught in an elevator automatic door gets decapitated this elevator descends the floor down morty jokes on spaghetti beside a greedy boab morty drives a tiny orange car gets crushed by log similar to the death in the scene and final destination too similar to the premonition plot of this episode morty checks out girls flirting at a party and accidentally drinks something toxic the bully slams Morty's head with a fire extinguisher Morty and rick drive a car off a cliff like Thelma & Louise morty jumps off a building it gets chopped up in helicopter blades already opened some Russian dolls it ends with a grenade blows em up presumably a nod to the show Russian dolls similar time loop structure Morty's flesh melts away into a skeleton morty walks on the beach and gets hit in the head by a coconut morty and rick spill a barrel of acid and the car splashes it on him the bullies stabs morty through the mouth with a pole an older morty smokes on the toilet and then clutches his chest a younger Morty uses a toilet but then gets sucked into space morty tries to defuse the neutrino bomb from The Vindicator episode but it explodes morty eats a red berry that causes his head to inflate red and pop the bully crushed his Morty's head like that mountain did to the Viper and Game of Thrones Morty clutches a fence and fries and a nuclear blast a reference to the t2 Judgment Day seen an older morty looks at his phone while crossing the street gets swiped by this truck it's a Servine Institute truck I'll go back to the rickland time episode ironically a dealer truck hits a human this time morty falls down the stairs more to get stabbed while on a knife-throwing board morty gets weighed down underwater morty gets eaten by the bird-like creatures a fruit peel and from the ABCs of Beth episode tiny Rick runs across a giant computer keyboard and the tiny morty doesn't make the jump Morey ODS on heroin and dies despite trying to be resuscitated by his lover morty gets stabbed by farmer Rick from the tales of the Citadel episode the bully impales naked more down a showerhead Morty's bully chops his head off and another one the bully stabs him with an American flag morty opens an egg and gets attacked by an alien style face hugger morty dies of thirst in the desert the bully cuts off the side with a garbage bin and the bully freezes him in a cube of ice and then although if you were of them.we to get glimpses of Rick's future deaths which are also pretty interesting Rick gets his head squash between two tree trunks Rick gets crushed under a hydraulic lift it looks like a more t-test burster burst from Rick's chest another alien reference Rick gets assimilated into a mutant morty head mass scuba Rick gets eaten by this giant angler fish monster maybe a nod to the unseen Rick lantus mix up adventure Morty and Rick fall down a cave onto a rocky surface Rick drives his ship drunk and hits a traffic light Rick goes into a giant play-doh shaped maker Rick is tied up and burnt at a stake cocoon Rick is eaten by one of the giant telepathic spiders from the Rick's must be crazy episode Rick is eaten by trolls it looks like pickle Rick is eaten by a dog giant Jack squanch from the wedding squatches episode rips Rick in half Rick and Morty get crushed in a trash compactor just like the one on the Death Star in the first Star Wars film Rick gets murdered by a robot version of himself and both Rick and Morty get swallowed by a giant flower now Morty struggled to fly the ship causes Rick to die in the crash hallo Rick tells Morty how to clone Rick notice that the cloning machine includes the yellow cyan and magenta colors of a color printer Rick's mind wakes up in a clone in another reality I axed this protocol what are you doing with my clothes okay I'm you I took my own clone bad offline a couple seasons ago Rick is meta Lee calling back the episode Big Trouble in little Sanchez in which he killed off his clones Rick realizes that this reality and most of the alternate ones he goes to are fascist it actually makes sense that the fascist universes would be the ones that kept their clone protocols given the whole Nazi genetic experiments that they did fascists Rick and fascist Morty carried German Luger pistols and their logo is a sort of swastika formed by cross trenches the time travel stuff box is updated each reality to become dashes time travel stuff shrimp time travel stuff and wasp time travel stuff and fascists rick has a photo shaking the hand to be now fascist president with the note thanks for sterilizing China kind of a callback to last season's finale when Rick called out how China owned the White House know about that deal breaker China doesn't piss on the White House well why would they I'm sure it was expensive there's also a hidden meaning behind the whole character of fascists Morty but before I card accounts today okay back to fascist Morty this character when you read in between his lines place out kind of like an analog from the writers point of view of the most toxic of their shows fanbase think about it that's just Morty hates Rick for being too political fascist Morty pines for a vague good old days but only talks about what he hates and he admits that he only really likes mr. meeseeks any screams later Rick makes another reference to the hole alright fringe of the fans and dropped the Hitler stuff lost Morty's been on some crazy message boards Rick kills fascist Morty on this adventure with gearhead aka Rivoli oÂ´clock burg jr. from the Morty night run episode and when the meeseeks kills him they all die silently in space as real space deaths terrifyingly are Morty ignores the protesting Haller Rick's they carry signs we're here we're Scheer we see through you go clone you're Rick we will not be ignored stop walking through us and there's a Berkley Hollow Rick who carries a legalize it assign Rick responds in a shrimp universe that is also fascist honestly you're doing me a huge favor by being shrimp instead of fascists what this is shrimp dimension includes a Nazi style Zeppelin shrimp SS officers and shrimp German shepherds in math class as always mr. goldenfold's blackboard is filled with amazingly stupid notes babies come from space 1/8 equals I'm tea dick thing another one with VIN diagram bubbles dick 1 s plus 1 s equals to asses m to the a power equals T to the H power Morty has detention along with Korey be behind Morty is a notice forbidding flossing no flossing and then outside the psycho bully references Pixar's KOCO but morty brushes them off just go with the flow creepily either intentionally or unintentionally morty is calling back his assaulted by mr. jelly dean in season 1 go with the flow you die tomorrow no matter what it's what bullies call a fait accompli fait accompli is a French term meaning done deal it's something that has already happened by the time those who are affected by learn about it Rick responds again as a teddy bear but also fascist of course it's too fascist dish nope the lab is filled with Nazi teddy bear regalia with old Nazi metals and other Teddy clones incubated in the background Morty's bully fight includes this bully who actually saw into something Rick it this way comes episode getting beaten up by Jack trick and Jack's summer so excited kind of looks like an older version of Randall from recess and on the wall behind them is graffiti the initials E and H a nod to the director of this episode Erica Hays longtime story artist for the show police arrived on the scene obviously this is a nod to the anime Akira in which Tetsuo like Morty this episode becomes an unstoppable super soldier who transforms into an amorphous blob when he's consumed by his own desires using Rick's weaponry Morty turns the cops into meat cubes with legs he sends a legion of me six on soldiers rips apart their DNA melting them turning them to ash one of them Cronenberg's a nod to the season one Rick potion number nine episode before making a great gas lighting joke the news anchor says will we all fall to his deadly touch the episode before this the season 3 finale showed Rick having a technology that can kill people just by having them touch him Rick calls back that with jerry later this episode in his trial morty wins over the judge voiced by sherri shepherd by following the death crystal to stammer the final words of her husband I will always remember our time in Peru he loves you little sparrow this is a nod to another time loop film arrival in which will spoiler warning for a rival amy adams uses her understanding of the future to save the world by telling the chinese leader of his late spouses final words Nancy Grace comments on the trial and notice the news ticker at the bottom no matter how you pronounce La Croix you sound stupid judge of Acura boy case commit suicide center for suicide prevention calls judges death tragic but judges shouldn't believe in ghosts in the sports bar watching this news there's a banner for these squatchers a nod of course to squanch there's also jerseys ross 47 and smith maybe as in jerry smith Morty Smith that's Smith 21 in Time Square this billboard for trover saves the universe a game co-created by Justin roiland other banners show Corp America owns you a cologne called not sweat an energy drink called energy juice with a similar pink wave design as turbulent juice in an ad for the Broadway musical Avenue Q Rick responds again in the wasp dimension wasis being the most [ __ ] the insects of course but not fully fascist we eat our prey alive and when we don't we lay our eggs in their eyeballs so that our young can feast on their brains when they hatch when you're born that big an [ __ ] the least you can do is have a little empathy the wasp family horrific Lee feeds on the caterpillar version of mr. goldenfold and then they return to Rick's lab where Rick finds his BA Glenn BA Glenn's were the toy puppets from the 80s and early 90s and a Kirkland Costco brand red meeseeks what do you want in our premiere episode 4 explain last week writer Ryan Ridley actually revealed to us that a red meeseeks was a longtime pitch of his I always pitched let's do red meeseeks for these kind of inside takes again be sure to subscribe to our Rick's plane podcast feed don't tell me you gained sentience and tried to take over what there's some AI racist accusatory eyes against my book Isaac Asimov wrote among many things I Robot a story about AI robots who turn on humans and they find Morty in the desert overtaken by ferrofluid in the sinister outgrowth they free him but then it takes over hallo Rick gives them a corporeal form turning them evil and the wasp Rick takes him out exactly as he foreshadowed he would the end of this episode wraps up similarly to the pilot episode of the series Beth and Jerry scold Rick for taking Morty on a dangerous adventure last time it was mega seeds this time death crystals Rick gets out of it leading to this hundred year rants jerry pronounces akira and anime in annoyingly over compensating attempts of a japanese pronunciation turning our son into an Akita i don't want to see any more anime stuff Rick and Morty's closing rant is crashed by summer who's heckling Rick discovers via playback summer is referencing doc and Marty the crude x-rated Back to the Future parody that royland made for channel 101 that Rick and Morty was very loosely based on and in the post-credits scene morty learns the future of growing old with jessica that he steered toward was a lie but she only wants to work in hospice for the lonely people no one in their lives hey Morty quick favor cover me in gasoline and spiders fine yeah I'm in wasn't my first pitch but hey not gonna waste this opportunity and the post episode tribute is for Mike Mendel longtime emmy-winning producer of The Simpsons and Rick and Morty who sadly passed away this past September the recent season premiere of The Simpsons was also dedicated to his memory how does this Rick and Morty season four premiere rank among the other season premieres Rick shank redemption a Rick alone-time and the pilot
