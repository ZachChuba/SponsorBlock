[Music] hey guys I wanted to show you this really quick just got twelve point six point two I'm not sure if anybody else out there has it yet but just looking at the new update this came in last night just in this parking garage and so I wanted to go through some of the things that it says so it says the Tesla toy box has been redesigned to make it easier to view and play simply scroll through the toys and it just associated controls as before to access the Tesla toy box tap the toy box icon from the application launcher and then looks like nearby charging sites the charging list has been improved to easily filter out near by charging sites based on max power simply tap the charging icon on the map to filter by selecting associated lighting and then dashcam improvements dash cam is now easier to set up after plugging in USB Drive tap control safety and security format USB Drive to format and create the associated folders in the dashcam note formatting than USB Drive also delete any existing clips so that one actually is nice because I remember when I first was setting up my USB stick for whatever reason it took like 13 times before it actually worked and that was with going through the proper steps on macintosh windows it seems like it's a little bit easier to do but even then I plugged it in to our surface and didn't want to work out and then backgammon improvements made it more difficult it looks like it says the playing back backgammon against your Tesla net is now more difficult the most difficult level has now been trained with twenty plus million games challenge your Tesla to a game you know and then it gives you the update there so this one it looks like it's just you know dash cam improvements the charging sights and toy box and games I'll be interested to see what other improvements have been made just because usually they hide a few things in there with how it's driving as you can see the previous notes at first I was excited I should have taken a screenshot of it but when I connected to my Tesla actually showed me that I had more range than I actually previously had and so I was hoping that that was going to be the case that it would have more range it was showing two hundred and forty miles which would have been a significant jump as you can see but that must have just been a glitch when I opened up my app but yeah I wanted to make sure you guys saw this and I'm going to test out some of the places I've previously driven to see how the improvements are so one thing about the twelve point six point to update that I'm noticing is it's been keeping me in the lanes a lot better it's not hovering as much the other thing that I I noticed and I don't know I think you guys could probably tell right here well that did that weird speed limit ramp though it's I'm on if you look at this my mom long car lengths behind but it keeps going to like two to three car lengths and it's never done that so like it's not speeding up to stay at the pace of the person in front of me as well as it usually would which is kind of interesting I've never had any of the updates do that before and I know this update said that it was mainly for the toy box which I'll show you really quick so you guys can see that so this all they did with it they took away the little drop down as it being like a hidden easter egg but as far as the autopilot like look at this this is definitely not a car length away from the car in front of me and I don't know if it's heavier traffic and it's actually just gotten better at the algorithms in order to keep people space oh this is new see this is the good thing about the Tesla being so advanced this is a new split this wasn't here yesterday so this just barely changed in here and since it's got so many sensors and it doesn't slowly rely off of the map it makes it so can hop over to this new section of freeway just fine handles it like a champ but yeah so still in the other updates I would be a little bit closer than this to the person and maybe it's a car length and I'm just making things up but that's just one of the things I've noticed so here's another example I've got it in autopilot right now it's set to one car lengths and then like look with this latest update it's definitely two to three car lengths back and you know hi granted it's at the 40 miles an hour but that was from coming from a stop it alight and then going and then it lets it get three car lengths away from the car and so this is just documenting a couple more times of what I was talking about what if they had some type of safety precaution that there it's making them do that for or something it definitely feels like the safety that it would have put on like autopilot within city limits but on the freeway but that's weird because it's it's very it was perfect before in my opinion I guess not perfect but somehow it Rosie so there's it's accelerating so see it's got this gap and it's gonna keep this gap see how much bigger the gap is getting so we're not at forty miles yet so it's not the speed it's literally the gap that it's wanting to keep between us for whatever reason but it's frustrating to drivers behind us frustrating to me as well you [Music]
