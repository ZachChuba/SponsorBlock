I'm here to film a video Today, with my guitar teacher He came to film a video together Today's mood is a little bit.. Like one-sided love… No, not like one-sided love It's sort of… I can't fall in love with you It kind of feels like that The emotion of the song?
The mood of the song? I hope it gets delivered to flover Ms. Gochujang (Jiwon) just dropped by I was on her behind video before Well… She returned the favor ROFL I knew it Today is… To look pure and innocent In order for those who are watching this To get that feeling I've dressed up hahaha (So embarrassed) I have to go work now Bye~ Finally last monitoring!
