[Music] welcome to another Microsoft Flight Simulator video this is where we bring you all the news and updates on the development of this new flight team so if you're lazy like me you don't want to troll the net to get all the latest updates this video is for you Microsoft Flight Simulator will be a multi-platform a flight simulator for the first time flight simmers around the world don't have to build a NASA type computer to run the next-gen a flight sim this CMAT will be available on xbox so in this video we'll be discussing your which Xbox will run our Microsoft Flight Simulator and which one will give you their best bang for buck in a recent times the team at Microsoft Flight Simulator have released its PC specs for its new a flight simulator we now have a good idea what PC hardware you will need to meet the minimum the recommended and ideal specifications to run this on your PC and yes to run Microsoft Flight Simulator its optimal level you will need to hand over some serious cash to get the perfect sim experience even with this next-gen beast but what does this all mean if you are an Xbox emo you can't exactly install a new GPU into your current Xbox to increase your frame rates so let's tackle the first myth out there do you need to buy the new up-and-coming Xbox series X to run Microsoft Flight Simulator absolutely not Microsoft have confirmed its new next-gen a flight sim will be coming to Xbox one and for the 47 plus a million Xbox r1 users out there you'll be able to fly from your local airport and check out what it's like to fly over your house we've been saying all of that will the experience be worthwhile swimming on the next-gen flight sim with an old xbox technology Xbox one or was released back in 2013 just think about it it was the same year that the Apple iPhone 5s was released but what if you wanted to buy a new Xbox today instead of spending all your hard-earned cash on a new PC the 1s and the 1x are the bigger cousins of the original Xbox one both through some incremental updates from the Xbox one that was originally released seven years ago and of course we have the ninth gen Xbox series X to be released in late 2020 and let's compare these three consoles against the PC specifications that were released by Microsoft Flight Simulator just recently so let's take a look at the Xbox 1s that was originally it released in August 2016 its CPU has eight times custom Jagger cores at a 1.7 gigahertz now if you're going to compare that around abouts to an Intel chip it would be round about a a 3-course 6100 in my opinion if we looked at the GPU on the Xbox one s it has a custom 1.4 teraflops at 914 megahertz GPU if we compare the nvidia gtx 770 which is in the minimum specs of Microsoft Flight Simulator has 3.2 teraflops at 1046 megahertz although Microsoft Flight Simulator mum ramp is 8 gigs and hard drive space is 150 gigs the Xbox 1s does cover that but it falls way short in the CPU and GPU and minimum standards Microsoft have mentioned this a new sim will be available on Xbox one but in my opinion if you're even and running it on a at 1 s you will have to have all the sliders turn and down to the minimum and this will be assure a downgrade of your perfect flight sim experience moving on to the Xbox one X which was released in November 2017 this Xbox was a built weave 4k native in our mind and it packs a punch when it compares to the 1s this console has enough hardware punch to be a most entry-level PC kids nevertheless the Xbox one X CPU again is an 8 core custom Jaguar with a 2.0 1 3 gigahertz if we compare that to a reasonable PC experience you could do the same with a arisin at 320 200 G which doesn't even make the recommended PC specs to a run Microsoft Flight Simulator what about a GPU the One X has a 6 teraflop at a 1.17 2 gigahertz which is a much improved GPU over the 1s but a Radeon rx5 Eddie has a 6.2 turf loss which should be able to do the same job as the one X GPU the Microsoft recommended specifications require at least a Radian rx 590 so in the GPU standards we fall short again the Xbox one axis does have a 12 gigabytes of gddr5 memory but the recommended specifications are for Microsoft Flight Simulator is 16 for the PC so we've been saying this the Xbox X CPU comes close to the recommended settings but it's RAM and GPU fall well short of this making the Xbox 1x missing the recommended settings and disappointingly sitting in between a minimum and a recommended specs for PC build from Microsoft Flight Simulator wow would you have ever guessed that in the holiday period of 2020 the Xbox Series X will hit the market bringing all it's nice gen technology and it's muster to blow all the predecessors out of the water but will it be enough again let's talk CPUs the series X has a 10 cores at two point eight gigahertz the raisin 720 700 would be a good comparison which has eight cores and a 16 thread ship running at 3.2 and it can be boosted to a four point gigahertz which meets the CPU ideal specifications for microsoft flight simulator PC build the Xbox Series X GPU is a whopping 12 teraflops at one point eight to five gigahertz this would be a good comparison to an RT X 2080 super that has 11.1 teraflops or an RT X 20 atti at fourteen point two teraflops on the AMD side of things they've ready in five would be also a good comparison again and meeting the standards of the ideal specifications for Microsoft Flight Simulator the RAM on the series X is 16 gigabytes of GDR 6 ideally the PC specifications that we are requiring are 32 but it does have a one terabyte SSD and we only require 150 it does seem that this anticipated Xbox Series X has enough underneath the bonnet to run Microsoft Flight Simulator at the ideal level but the Xbox one X NS will fall way shorter this mark all in all I will say that Microsoft Flight Simulator will be optimized to run on all these Xbox consoles at a decent framerate but it will come at a cost of graphical detail we been saying that this is merely a comparison video with a bit of guesswork added I would love to hear in your comments below what will you'll be running a Microsoft Flight Simulator on PC Xbox and R which one we still have are more questions than answers when it comes to any news about Microsoft Flight Simulator and Xbox such as we don't know when it's going to be
