[Music] I am very stressed that is a very good so I figured that I should be something creative and fun to de-stress I change into some comfy clothes and decided spend some time using Skillshare to do creating a fun thing and stuff I hope I could offer you some tips to be stressed and avoid getting stress in the first place with this video let's go already fun and creative like trying plants hair lettering and realistic drawing okay I'm trying to talk about stuff stress is really tough and Gentile onion really easily and yeah managing it can be tough as well so here are some tips that might help you alleviate stress and maybe decrease the amount of stress you get first off it's nice to let go of your stress by doing something else that isn't stressing you out of course if you have a deadline to meet try meeting it first but if you absolutely cannot handle it at the moment to take a break it is okay take that moment to get a drink of water splash some water on your face and breathe trust me it makes a lot of difference after that try doing something that really shows for a set amount of time often times time ends up flying away from us and that just adds more stress so it's good to set yourself a limit I ended up doodling and drawing and lettering for about 30 to 35 ish minute try something creative like doodling or writing during this time don't worry about 15 perfect or anything it is totally okay to make mistakes all you have to do is try something different or give it another go I tried lettering with watercolours for the first time and yeah I made a lot of mistakes it didn't look like I wanted it to but that was okay I tried new things I learned what it was like and it was fun my personal destress method is to brew a nice cup of tea and sit down to do something that I like such as doodling journaling or playing video games some people like to exercise which is great and healthy for you and that also relieve stress so you could try running or just a quick brisk jog around your house or maybe do some stretches or maybe some yoga positions in your room or try doing some push-ups set up whatever you like some people like to play music whether that be listening to nice calm music or playing music themselves like on the piano or violin or whatever instrument you practice either way something you like something you like to do something that using is fun some people like to release their stress by talking to other people about it and that's a great method to sometimes my stress can be a little bit too overwhelming for me to talk to other people because I feel like that's just too much sensory input sometimes so when I feel like that I like to write out my feelings or type up my feelings whichever is most convenient for me so you think I doing that too you might feel a bit achy and your head might hurt when you're stressed and that might mean you need to get another jug of water usually when I'm stressed I forgot to trace water and that result in terrible terrible headaches so drink that water it's good for you just make sure not to drink like 15 or 20 glasses or something like that because it is entirely possible to get sick from too much water some people also like to eat their stress away and that's their new century unhealthy yeah a bit of dark chocolate or that slice of cheese tea is lovely but don't overdo it when I'm stressed I like to eat carrots or bell peppers or something healthy and crunchy like that since the crunch and the feeling of it helps me focus on something else other than what's stressing me out I don't know if that helps you but you might like to try that out all right now get them to some avoiding stress your mindset and your perception of stress can respect what you feel like if you think that something is huge and terrible and you can't do anything about it then your stress levels are going to skyrocket instead of thinking about something in a negative way try to frame it in a way that's more positive people also tend to focus a lot on themselves and if you make a mistake or something like that you might think that the entire world noticed but in reality everyone is so wrapped up in themselves so chances are they didn't even notice it will probably only notice it if you draw too much attention to it so please don't stress too much about that where there mark procrastination only makes your stress worse so if you don't want to do something don't avoid it there is no way to get out of it so just sit down and get it done as soon as possible you'll feel a lot better once you're finished with it also get your sleep sleep deprivation to make your stress levels even worse than they already are and make you super tired during the day no sleep equals no fun please sleep sleep is very important for you hope this helps and thanks for watching remember to hit that Bell thanks for all the comments in the last video explaining it to me pink skies and -
