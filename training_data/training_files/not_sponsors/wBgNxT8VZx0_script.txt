good luck and i'll see you there greetings from the jail cell of the ham hideout welcome to episode three of all or nothing and if you guys actually haven't watched episode one or two make sure you get caught up there's a link down in the description also a card on screen easy access to those if you haven't seen them definitely get yourself caught up swing back to this one but let's get on with the video i stated in episode two we will be sending the easy clue scrolls and to be honest guys i am already freaking out because there was a deboer in the high-risk world by lumbridge she was walking around we want to do a bunch make some money ultimately my goal is to get my construction up right now get rid of the money so i don't have it but i want to get more before i full set in construction you know risk it a little bit have some fun oh super quick super quick clue now like i said before there's only like two we can't do because of the defense requirement so um yeah but this one we could teleporting a fellow door is a huge mistake though um am i really gonna walk there though i got to figure out the best teleports to use i definitely don't want to teleport fally right in to multi-combat which is why i never carry foul or teleports that's why in episode one i wasn't using that to kill cows all right this guy's definitely got the casket no yes no i'm kidding i'm sorry i'm sorry ally ally hook me up hook me up are you kidding me what so i'm really gonna deck myself out looking for a ring of wealth five definitely going to get that i forgot it could tell you right to the grand exchange a safe telly don't think i could really rely on it when i'm getting attacked uh because i need to right click a green exchange also just stacked up on wine because i forgot the ham guards are actually going to hit us as we're doing it and of course we want to keep my hp topped off so i don't get specked out bought too many but they are ridiculously cheap which is why we have the cheapest food and so the most expensive and best food that we can get in the game okay i know for a fact someone's gonna roast me for calling sharks one of the best food in the game i know there's better okay stop it youtube comment section don't you dare who's this oh good luck oh i want to wish him good luck damn it check this out first of all i'm an idiot because i forgot i need some space so we're probably just gonna drop some of those and say screw it um right now we are in this weird like bedroom area of the ham cult and genuinely i don't think anyone's gonna find us here and even if they do i'm going to see it happen so i actually feel a lot more safe now this is going to be where i'm going to send all my clue scrolls there he is there he is there he is there he is there's the deborah i was talking about he knows i'm there he knows i'm there now [ __ ] the ham caves dude they they kick you out sometimes when you fail my dude was waiting there oh i know what i'm gonna do to get the falador i know what i'm gonna do the skills necklace yes i mean i'm spending so much money on these clue scrolls but i could also just you know sell this back when it lost his charges um the mining guild takes you right outside of it i'm pretty sure um yeah yeah it's not it's not the best teleport by any means but it's definitely one of the most effective um in terms of closeness and not dying another falador clue scroll guys but we got the casket let's see what we get oh man come on i wanna hit big i wanna hit big i'm so sorry i said some weird things about you before man please make it better luck now he hates me he hates me he hates me there's nothing else to it he hates me all right this is the casket this is the casket what do we get what do we get is this casket number four in total oh how much is that oh yes yes yes yes it happened oh we're selling this i don't want to be walking around with this that is that's not good we don't want to bring any attention to ourselves yes 226k let's go looks like this is gonna get the cash back to 620k let's buy some more supplies and keep up the grind oh my gosh this account is no longer fun this is stressful holy [ __ ] guys i'm telling you the whole lumbridge area is swarmed with people trying to kill me all right guys next up we're going to do some mahogany homes just because the the clue squirrels were incredibly stressful and i think this is going to be a good way to train construction for not too much money the goal here is to kind of spend the cash back um let's oh you can't close the door damn it i like to close doors in this account because it makes me feel a lot safer but the ultimate goal is to get a really nice house eventually uh right now i just want to spend the cash jack but eventually i want a really really nice house so i can have all my teleports in there because look right now right now i have five slots filled up with just teleports and i would like a lot more but if i can have just one house tab that i can telly home which is safe in my house and then go into any house portal hit any jewelry and just get anywhere i want so that'd be really really nice to do so um i've actually never done mahogany homes before i have some steel bars and normal planks i don't know how quick this is bob in north east varrock no one in their right mind is gonna pk somebody trying to do mahogany homes right i mean how much xp do we even get i think we oh well i mean i definitely enjoy seeing that um i know you get like an extra xp boost after you do the contract so let's see how much we get or let's let's just see what level we get to after our first one hopefully it's okay uh we're actually downgrading here my guy wanted normal [ __ ] cabinets and tables nice dude oh snap ate construction okay okay i quite like that sick and we can get our task right here dude i walked up here and i saw this hat and i i i almost logged out no joke almost locked out dude that that's wrong and there's 20 construction that means on to the next tasks the teak ones i'm so dumb so i bought tea planks when i need oak planks i sold them right back and i made 3k a merchant now fellas i'm merchant now i'm not even trying to and we are on our last home let's see does this get us to 50 yes it does 50 construction guys i didn't get attacked once super super chill it's actually very easy if you take the back roads like look where i am in varrock right now um it's a lot of the rooms up here in varak as well and falador all the houses are out of the way host cities no one's really there so it's super super chill but guys we have that 50 construction so let's start building that house and uh buy those house tabs because that's ultimately why we did this in the first place and one of the best part about this is we didn't even spend that much money check this out still 331k um it did take like four hours to do all this so it's much slower than actual construction especially when i need to go back and re-buy the skills necklace the ring of wealth but you have to do right now actually and just keep replenishing the teleports over and over because i can't bank of course all right the portal chamber is going to be expensive 100k oh no right we have to do it we have to do it oh that's horrible that's actually really depressing thankfully i did mahogany homes because i would have been fresh out of cash we actually have the materials to build these frames so let's build them up right now we also have to build a quest hall where is it okay 25k not bad this is going to be for our glory so let's pop this down boom build and lastly we want to build a chapel 50k yeah that is my cash jack completely completely gone 52k well we still got these we could sell so it's a little higher but also we need to buy the materials to also make some stuff but that really shouldn't be that expensive okay let's sort everything out welcome to my crib guys so so far we have a lumbridge teleport in the portal chamber we have the amulet of glory and we have the altar all super useful things now my portal chamber is looking incredibly incredibly empty the limitation here is that i don't really want to get my combat up so right now it's not really giving us too much of a benefit but once we get higher combat we could definitely start clearing some spaces in the inventory i think for right now i'm just going to get 45 magic so i can put a portal to camelot i think this will get us one combat level uh i'm like slowly creeping up i know i'm playing with fire here but uh the whole point in this was to save inventory spots and this will save us one of course as our stats go up and our magic goes up it'll save us a lot more in the long run this is more long-term planning but i definitely want that one inventory spot saved now all right guys so like i said i'm going to go for that 45 magic and then stop there i think that'll only get us one combat level at least i really really hope so maybe maybe an extra one just because of an hp level which i'm not too bothered about so hopefully no more than two combat um yeah deciding to kill the obsidian guys simply because it's a very weird spot that i don't think anyone's going to be walking across and it did say that about the clue scroll spot at the hand place and i got attacked but um i got scouted there so if i see anybody we're just gonna tell you out and leave and i just figured the obsidian guys also because of their drops i mean i can get lucky but i'm certainly not expecting anything and i'll be cape would make her cash check like 750k plus holy crap i just got the the obby knife i don't even have my drop thing on how much is it how much is this 62k i can't wear it of course uh wow that is that was unexpected guys yes yes yes yes okay now it was worth coming here i'm totally happy with that and there's 45 magic you guys know exactly what that means let's get the required runes and make that portal still a decent amount of money on the account which is amazing to see let's see let's add that camelot portal and there we go and of course the great thing about camelot is that we can teleport and it's safe here we have access to the bank as well so this will probably be our go to bank like it kind of has been already and we can sell these camelot tabs and free up that inventory spot also we are 37 combat a little high but that's it for training combat for now i definitely do not want to go any higher than that next up i want to focus on some questing there are a lot of quests that we can do that are going to get a lot of xp really quickly for these skills i mean we are one in a lot of them so let's change a few with that actually first we're going to start with the museum it's not a quest but get 900 nine slayer might as well so let's go do it what his name is dfs target did you see that did you see that i have to be careful i have to be really really really really careful all right i believe that's all of them and that's going to be oh nine slayer nine hunter very easy stats so it turns out we need 30 fire making for the sea slug quest and it's actually very very easy to fire make i'm gonna save so and i can simply buy logs keep them noted use them on the bank or unnote them like so um but i actually want to get 50 because winter's hot is a 50 requirement i don't think i'll actually ever do winter's hot but so is desert treasure and of course eventually i'm going to do that quest so figured might as well just go right to 50. and there's our 50 fire making so now we're on to questing for real and that is the seesaw quest complete on to the next one ooh 24 fishing forgot about that that's why i did the quest that's a huge trip i had to destroy my looting bag to be able to get in there because that's some runes in it and whatnot but it's not too big of a deal now if i did this quest correctly i shouldn't have gotten a combat level boom and look at all those juicy juicy stats still 37 combat total levels shooting on up all right admin there we go what do we get what do we got 15 mining i actually need 10 for the night sword quest but let's do biohazard first because we're already here and smash that out plus we need it eventually and there's the biohazard quest and there's love and crafting from the murder mystery quest totally forgot to record when i finished that quest now just to get that smithing up incredibly incredibly quickly 1 to 29 smithing there we go guys the total level is now well over 500 i think we had some great progress in this video so i do hope you guys enjoyed episode three of all or nothing and i will see you guys in the next one in episode four take it easy
