hi friends and planet Earth deity it is Friday May 17th the Wahby body mine remains the child's soul today we're gonna be discussing that's truly angelic initiative I need to sign a set of real goddamn cans and I'm not just talking about Jamie's welcome guys how y'all doing it's been a minute I'm here I got heartburn holy [ __ ] this video you're about to watch I'm not really sure the direction to take it what I am gonna do to start is to just simply explain what happened and how we ended up at this point or about a month ago I reached out to Jamie and Lynn of the angelic initiative via email edit the original style of the video was intended to be kind of documentary s for the most part I was just gonna let them talk there wasn't really gonna be much commentary so my video was set to release first on May 12th Sunday May 12 and they said alright the first day we could even post would be the 13th then this happened what's this you asked I had an accident with a piece of glass took a large chunk out of my thumb I had to get stitches I spent a good portion of an editing day in the hospital any kind of movement of this hand at all would stretch the skin and cause pain long story short I said okay hey we need to push the video back to our next post Nate which again would be a Sunday after you following so far we said we're gonna push it back a week and if they could hold off just one week as well not a not a ridiculous request you know judging how I got my goddamn thumb torn off Jamie over here my sweet that's true Jamie wanted some of our footage we're trying to work in a friendly collaboration with your team we've been Curtis Lee holding off posting episodes with blobby at Dennis's request if you can't explain it in a way that makes sense to me we're gonna go ahead and post our first webby episode in the morning so basically now what she's saying is we have our videos ready to go we're gonna post this unless you give us the footage the subject of the email is deadlines I love that they're now setting deadlines on my video I flew four people across the United States filmed everything and now they're putting a deadline on my video keep in mind I had no problem with their put them posting the entirety of it I'm not hiding anything I wasn't gonna edit this to manipulate them in any way I want them to post the unedited footage but it ruins a lot of a hype when they all the footage nearly ten days before my video was gonna come out again we weren't okay with this we felt that this was complete [ __ ] there this is I mean flat-out this is just bullying us at this point if he gets the footage of us by 5:00 p.m. we'll continue to give him the courtesy of first posting we would have the right of first posting we sent her the raw footage and we even said this we said if we post first I will send you my video fully edited for you to review and sign off on just so you know we're not trying to manipulate you in any way Jamie had a problem with that of course you're [ __ ] in now here's where she starts getting frustrated she's saying we already rearranged our posting schedule twice last week to accommodate Dennis's changing schedule what we had we allocated one week after filming with you one week to edit this video and we simply asked for a week extension due to an injury if Denis can get me the footage of the other two cameras before the end of the day all just the posting schedule so he can post first this Sunday this is where [ __ ] gets crazy we will not wait beyond then so she's basically saying we're not gonna give you the time you're asking for I know that you agreed to let us review the video even though you don't have to all that but uh [ __ ] you Bobby we're gonna post this [ __ ] anyway here's the theory that I've heard well why be they they saw you were disrespectful when you were filming and now they don't want to work with you so they're saying [ __ ] off let me read you this we understand that Dennis is the comedy business and he'll be poking fun at us in the video we've always understood that as long as he's not lying that's okay well Jamie I got some really [ __ ] bad news for you sweetheart you're the liar and I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna go through all these [ __ ] emails until you realize that you didn't see that one coming through the grass did you I'm gonna go through all this [ __ ] they were they knew god damn well why we were coming we were coming there to have a good time poke fun while keeping it somewhat respectful okay I'm about to hit you with some honest dick we did this and many other things because it's the right thing to do and given that we humans kill are killing the planet here she goes to see this is it that you'll see this in the video she's gone now now that she's talking about angel [ __ ] and in the earth and the planet you can't get her back you will see these emails just digress just go into these schizophrenic tangents just get ready for them okay cuz it's gonna happen we're actually trying to make a difference for the world in this crisis time is that funny no nobody's laughing at that aspect of these videos you lack self-awareness I'm sorry I'm going in on you but I'm [ __ ] pissed this was a lot of hard work that you tried to snatch from us you really did and you're gonna try to smear my team and myself publicly we'll get to that I tried Jamie Jamie and Lynn I tried to not to not go in on you guys you should see the first cut of my video I cut out a lot and I kept my mouth shut but I'm not gonna now cuz you couldn't it isn't likely that your team will get another chance to work with Archangel Gabriel in this lifetime that's great pretending that Gabriel doesn't exist doesn't make him go away what are you talking about lady I asked for a week cuz I hurt my thumb actually what are you talking about Jamie I have no clue I know we said the video we'd have the video this week we're gonna need a week extension if that's cool with you guys you're [ __ ] with [ __ ] well be you can't control I'm sitting here like what I so know I mean I will post all these publicly so if you think I'm missing something I will you will have the right to read them I will blur any daxing information not that I have to but I'm going to out of respect for them so I again I attached the video I said hey listen here it is I also want to make sure it's clear our posting date is the 19th it was originally the 12th but it had been adjusted to the 19th due to my injury you read through these and they're just on a different plane we post every two days we will post on schedule immediately doesn't give a [ __ ] what I just said Denis has four days to get his video uploaded before them your window of opportunity to post ends on Tuesday she just ignores what we're saying doesn't give a [ __ ] we have okay this is this is one of my favorite lines that Jamie dropped on me out of any of the emails we have disrupted our viewers enough Jamie Jamie I'm this is gonna hurt to hear and remember we agreed you don't like liars we like comedy we don't like liars Jamie I hate to be the guy who says this but you don't have any viewers do you remember Jamie how many views your videos had before I talked about y'all when I reviewed your channel that video had two views and I think that was me oh my god god damn [ __ ] I'm since what are you talking about the angelic Initiative episode a thousand and eight two views oh well maybe it will hook in 13 views 20 sit now listen I'm not [ __ ] on a small Channel [ __ ] on okay she's gonna sit here and she's gonna say her there viewers are disrupted enough [ __ ] what viewers oh I'm attaching the third they just keep sending us their like here's the next video we're gonna post now here's where again we're just trying to explain it and it feels like we're talking to a wall our original posting date was set for May 12th but due to my injury it was necessary to extend the date a very reasonable request we have all the requested footage ready to send however see here's where we didn't want to give it to him we knew they were gonna post anyway so [ __ ] them why would they get our really really good footage Jaime why would we do that here's the ultimatum okay I said also if your video is released first this will greatly change the direction of my final edit you're looking at it boys none of this was in the final edit you think I was gonna do all this [ __ ] nope there wasn't even gonna be any additional commentary like this whoever's running the show over there you [ __ ] up Jaime clap back this is between Dennis and Archangel Gabriel it has nothing to do with us it's like they're just not reading the emails karma is real and the poltergeists still know how to find Dennis Jamie is that a threat Jamie I swear to God is that a [ __ ] threat that's not very Christian of you I don't even need to say anything that just makes you look kind of stupid since we left we've come to enjoy wubbulous his team has been incredibly rude we're trying to overlook it because they're so young and probably just don't know the standards of Business Conduct we are reasonably sure their mothers would not approve of their behavior I don't know I feel like Loki threatening somebody is is pretty rude and not very business of you Jamie although I would know your mother approves of what you're doing because she's had you brainwashed for many years now we no longer recommend having any dealings with Webby or his team well the same goes for you [ __ ] the thing is is this kind of [ __ ] right here that you see this is super inappropriate business conduct did I do this no I'm standing here now not only defending myself and my image but my team you're gonna just go public with this [ __ ] with nothing to back it up well then yeah I'm gonna clap back you really really brought piss to a ship fight why would you do this to yourself his team has been incredibly rude well this is all the correspondence by the way between my team and her I have all of it here I'm the only person I see being rude here is Jay being firm is not being rude if Dennis wants to post first he has plenty of time really you know how long this [ __ ] takes that's interesting I don't two views I don't know if I could have made it any more clear what we're gonna do if you don't give us a week you really caught up on this lying here and the only thing I see here is you lying about our team being incredibly rude the first webby video is what's currently scaled to the post another complicating factor is that we're at the end of this this is funny we're at the end of season five and the start of season six they have seasons they have [ __ ] seasons to the ship I remember when I first got out of school I didn't know yet how to handle business communication I'm not upset with you his team has been incredibly rude but now moving forward that there you have it guys that's the drama like I said I'll be releasing the emails for y'all to read so I have edited footage now from a couple of sessions they haven't released and that shit's still good you guys like this [ __ ] look at that that's true [ __ ] Whoopie body-mind that's true baby that shit's so good go check that out at [ __ ] meta thread boys new merch is available right now you could probably tell this is actually a new day of filming here and before we actually get into the the footage from the interview ID I made a discovery and I kind of I felt like it was important enough to talk about I was just looking stuff up about the Angelika initiative and when I did I stumble upon Jamie's old Twitter and her old YouTube she still uses this Twitter but of course now she uses it exclusively for angelic [ __ ] but if you go back you get these tweets and and the scary thing is just a few years ago Jamie was completely normal my Halloween costume is a tired girl this is less than five years ago ellen degeneres dresses like a young man I hope my future daughter marries my body is ready for you Nick Offerman why don't she retweeted gilbert godfree's joke about ejaculating penises the [ __ ] was funny I'm actually worried for Jamie now Jamie was normal and now you you can't even have a conversation with her I don't know what's actually going on behind the scenes but from an outsider purely speculating her mom is controlling her and I think and and I'm worried for her this is from her old YouTube look at this I bet you won't even recognize her [Music] she's just normal just a normal kid what happened Jamie what happened how do we get the old Jamie back and sad it's actually sad I never thought I'd say it but I really do feel bad for her this these are her favorites from her her youtube she used to watch a bo burnham all the same garbage we used to watch hashtag save Jamie dude the [ __ ] six this is from six years ago dear God if you if if you exist please send another hurricane take my youth but please don't let Disney make more Star Wars maybe she was funny Lin's doing something Lin you know I don't know what's going on Jamie was a normal young college girl with with a bright future and and and that was taken from her hashtag save Jamie I can't say any more all right lever my health roll the video [Music] when that makes it look like you have a very strange oh no no no no no no no she was holding her recorder in a really goofy way we have it's very very strange penis is that what I guess yeah Lin got that dick thank you so much okay we are good so whenever you guys are ready take it away spirit collectives and that's where the disconnect has been happening in this society that's true and that's why we're making a lot of mistakes Bobby participated in an experiment that was being run by the Archangel Gabriel and probably didn't know he probably didn't know did you know that no I don't even know what that means I think it's Gabriel yeah I actually do it's Gabriel and he's known as the Archangel Gabriel in a lot of in Trivandrum so he found some guy who was reasonably psychic who he could get through to and just you know just kind of pulled your string and you did what he wanted which is good actually that's a good thing good for you I'm reasonably psychic yeah you're psychic you would have to learn the skill but you've got it's like somebody who's got good balance and they can become a gymnast exactly you know people say that her eyes are they talk about my code she widens her eyes and what they're doing is they're they're having such a hard cooking guys upstairs Epps tears they're having a hard time seeing into the world and so sometimes they say basically you've got your eyes closed open your eyes bigger open your eyes bigger and it's not like I can hear those words in my head I'm feeling like that but you get the ceiling up and now open your eyes big so here's the deal humanity has already murdered more than 50% of all of their life on earth this is scientific consensus we're not making up these numbers that's not it's happening now it's happening now it's happening now we've got to change and there was some question what hobbies do you have hobbies hobby we're trying to keep humanity from destroying all life on Earth the time for hobbies was so long ago that time has come so to answer that question no we don't have hobbies Gabriel still right Gabriel is still around so don't ya a good time okay what is a karmic record hard to emphasize strongly enough to get the fullness of the disagreement but they're trying to come to an unanimous consensus and so they're letting him kind of like hang himself is what's interesting himself he's got some statistician who has spoken on film before in denser dimensions such as this one in which we're having this gathering with psychic people on planet earth sometimes have awareness of and are able to access parts of so are you trying that but I don't know what you're talking about I'm listening to Archangel yeah yeah yeah yeah he's super yeah did we do something wrong we don't think so and so all those angels who Gabriel was such a jerk to are now enjoying his moment of discomfort go back to the karmic records it really would be more effective to just try to build a better karmic record do you show your crush to us yes I do I do in in your cool and uncool trees video you said people are crazy and don't ask the right questions they don't want to ask the right questions so they ask wrong questions and therefore get crazy answers that's true I want to know what are the right questions the questions we ask and who we ask them of determine the choices that we make what am I going to have for line what am I going to do tomorrow and to instead ask what am I supposed to do tomorrow what am I supposed to do gets us thinking about doing the right thing and that's why we kind of live at some as much of a distance from society as were able to keep and do the work that we're supposed to do back in 2009 had a good friend who was dying and she was going through chemo and her hair was falling out so we shared our heads together actually her husband shaved our heads in his laundry room you know and we were both bald for six months until she died it's not Peter dying or Vikki dying or comment on because they're already dead it's not Alan darn he's dead really it's happening now you seem to be having a hard time keeping your focus on it you seem to be pretending just keep on doing what you're doing so maybe it would help us to shape your head again and also people you know I don't know if you noticed but they do not react well to women with with shaved heads it doesn't go well and so there's always that shocker times and we were supposed to awaken people through teaching energy healing but to some work people don't want to awaken why not why don't you think oppositional defiant disorder I think attitudes are contagious and and it's I think it's in the the cells it's in the grass and the trees and the rocks it's in everything and so now what are we supposed to do if I will usually if you say if I were gonna die tomorrow what would I do what I would do is eat ice cream you know so baby not a really cookies what we're doing what we're doing is actually really simple because we've had years and years of training and so what we do is hold the energy portal stretch through the clouds of the dead people get are kind of like a tube like an access tube up out of the clouds as high as we can reach then we just do whatever they say to do unless it sounds like that's a crazy idea something's dangerous have they asked you to do dangerous things oh yeah like what sometimes they will say something that they don't know is dangerous because they want us to accomplish some goal and we we have to say that's really dangerous and then they'll say oh don't do that holder guys so the their corrupt is corrupt can be and then they do send in the poltergeist and the poltergeist will knock things off high shelves and they will throw stuff at us and the branch breaks right there have the power and then we've learned how to it's like find the one who's skulking away there there is right there this Galka this morning the dismembered rabbit what they were talking right upstairs was there's this morning we had someone coming to the house and repair guy because some older guys really break so much I does and now we've learned to do a lot of repairs ourselves but back then we weren't so handy and there's a repair guy coming and we were both around the back of the house doing some yard work and the guy comes around looking kind of shaken and then we walk around with him and there's a half a dead rabbit lying in the RT said do cats you have cats we said no he said okay so your dogs now sterile dead you should know they're all dead we don't have them at the time Baxter wasn't living with you said so how'd it get here polarized absolutely just go into interview mode because we're because there's no more what to my audience watching they a lot of people will probably think this is just who we is there anything that they want to say to my audience well while we still have them here we're not trying to convince you of anything go live your life you know try to become better people if if you don't want to become a better person then do you want to think about what that says about you I don't hear anything else really friends if you don't think that this is true then why don't you find something else to do with your time a lot of other videos to go go do something else I'm serious it's okay it's okay this is a way to connect with God if you don't want to do it that's okay right off you go shoot don't leave just yet though now you can ask whatever you want and I don't worry about you don't have to worry about being respectful because they're what it's I don't know there's somebody's okay hold up you know if anybody gets disrespectful when we've gotten them on a lot right get out we're done right they're not on the line right I don't think not officially we haven't requested them they are presumably listening in because there's this feeling that you get right there 100% they're listening and they're watching so just this is just for stuff to like help my audience get to know you guys a little bit better so how old are you two if you want to ask I'll be 61 in two months yeah I'm happy almost birth a happy almonds I'm 27 and a half how did you guys get involved in spiritual healing my brother died in 1990 January in 1990 he had had already a death and they coltd his heart and brought him that so we were wrong as it turns out we don't just die when the bodies die because it's definitely watching and to clarify we come from a really scientific family a very medicine based family doctors my dad's a surgeon my sister taught in a medical school she's written a textbook on the cerebellar and my other sisters an ICU nurse blah blah blah I was a mathematician she charted rocket trajectories from NASA the major was in kind of chemistry accounting you know so three weeks after he died I was taking that junk mail to put it in the recycle bin in the laundry looked out the window and he was standing outside the window and he had played practical jokes on me all his life and so this is like a really good one you know he had scared the bejesus out of me and I'm nothing like coming back from the grave yeah sister got him he died in tax season she was a CPA as a partner in this a good partner and a CPA firm so he would come and he would sit in the passenger's seat in my car and how I would know I'd just be driving and then like all the hair on my arms their hair on that side of the body would just start standing up it's like wow yeah he was such a unique person so there's just that had to be him it wasn't anybody else and then one day he was he said you're just missing it you're missing the whole thing and he and he turned sideways and disappeared which you can do when you're dead and then I had just been paying attention to him and when he turned sideways and disappeared I paid attention to what else was there it's like oh wow this is a really big place oh boy after about two and a half three and a half years something like that they said okay you're not doing the work you're supposed to be doing in the world you're wasting your life sell your practice and so by the time got out of there I was really good and sick and I was disabled sick for seven years but only disabled for two nothing worked Western medicine had nothing to offer and then I tried these alternative therapies you know started to slide into the freaky friends you know you know one here once you're trained in psychic and you know what's going on it's like well you know that past life snake bite that is not helping so first things first let's get that trauma out of there like when you pull a sticky thing this starts this right you know is that something that can be done like now what do you mean would to demonstrate to my audience would we be able to pull a trauma strand out of an emergency what did you say he just asked if you pull or drama strand out I mean if if we're willing it's up to you we can give it a call do you have been your pain you had to have pain tightness pressure discomfort if there's something to you a symptom my do I that's real yeah do you want to tell we all have TMJ most comments psychic psychics what can I say depends it depends we know that this past life trauma is not helping your TMJ we're gonna get this past life trauma out will that be all that's necessary to solve the TMJ obviously our eyes but it might help if you want to get out that trauma that's lodged like right there by the jaw the only way to actually do it for real would be to merge him with your energy body and again we're not really doing it Oh me I do you guys want to merge in now that's what I'm saying I'm not gonna do without your permission because that's gross right yeah merging you have to get consent yeah agreed yeah that's gross consent is how Jamie I would be honored for you to merge with me all right just happen no oh no no that was a handshake I see that was I like this it's a hole in the ground I have a friend he might Clare went to college with and we studied abroad together and I liked him a lot and you remind me a lot of him yeah okay merging the energy bodies together more deeply softening my own energy body there you go merging in there we go those really good guys upstairs who are looking out for whoopee who really want well people live his deaths and he live the life that he was born to live there we go drawing the focus to the front of the heart chakra so do you aware the chakra system something you're comfortable with seen Naruto do you know what that is that I know it from that awesome okay we're going to start to open up the front of the heart chakra I'm gonna start to open up the front of the heart chakra coughing it's just a really common reaction to energy starting to move there we go you've never had energy work done huh no okay okay great and exhaling out the back we're just doing a very quick opening process just so there's some current moving there we go feeling the guardian angels real close all right now ha all right now we're going to start to move back through time energetically and this is the great part because it's like we can crank back through all these lives mmm and then out the top of the head hmm how you feeling good you okay yeah how's your jaw good how is that for you well this is what I do for a living so yes thank you didn't see that coming did you okay oh so we have a question from my audience if you guys ever seen the George Lopez show well no okay forget about that one if you had to stay in a one by one box for it for an entire day which ones I won I don't mean in one foot how small do you think I am Michael Raymond I got a meditation cushion I'm fine I'm yeah just a cushion are you single Jamie I really don't like to talk about my personal life but no okay [Music] this is again from the audience regarding grass when you guys speak to grass and trees how exactly is that working who are you speaking to in that sense let's make a quick clarification about who's talking and so we're not talking to grass or trees unless I'm wrong somebody upstairs is so up there so they through you talk - yeah - that ship flew and they're saying come on friend are you going to join us in trying to re-establish this upward shift that's a schefflera and that is speaking so somebody's talking to the schefflera I'm going heads up friends will you join us in reestablishing up a flow maybe people like to pretend that we are a lot more important than plants are and so it's goofy that big guys upstairs would want to talk to a tree when why wouldn't they want to talk to me a human can a plant be a jerk and not listen oh definitely sure just like you not saying you're being there's so many studies scientifically documented studies on consciousness of plants and people want to argue with consciousness of plants a sound they sound ignorant when you guys like mow the lawn do you feel guilt guys oh you did that for us it looks nice yeah just like a graveyard now well and it is it's like the little toads and the grasshoppers and one time this was so hard oh he's working my desk faces a window and we said alright we're just really we had a lot of Mon a long long time because it was winter and the rest wasn't really growing we've got to do it and so we called them in and then there's these grasshoppers started flying at my window and they're saying stop it stop it make them go away oh [ __ ] what am I supposed to do here we have these little rock borders around our beds and the grass grows in the rock borders and what we would normally do is just spray it with roundup but there are things living in there and we can see that it was wrong to napalm the Vietnamese in their homes can't we right and so how is that any different would you say a toad is the same as like napalm in Vietnam poisoning a toad how is that different way person I'm asking you yeah I think it's no different we do have shirts and hats for you guys just because you can take it you can throw it away I will wear it for yard work yes we know we actually doing a lot of yard work so that's a good thing I mean this is no I did not expect that how much was this mic like oh like $14 do you think I could have it as a keepsake yes we just got a new one for my 8 million dollar horse I work with very very expensive they rates urban resources do they today Kentucky Derby not to get too personal but like do they pay well what you do $70 is what we charge it's for a horse for a 45-minute healing session that's a good hourly rate I'll say this is the part of the watching yeah meta threats thank you guys alright you can go on the fallback if the interview is going well you can go it's like the chatting yeah you're like so my subreddit has some questions for you like like my fans sorry like my Patty and questions for you oh you even noticed it I like your Crocs you guys's shoes [Music] okay this chair is struggling we have those are start don't you [Music] hi friends Jamie McGonagall here it's Monday July 28th today was an unusual day today we woke up at our usual time we drove from our temporary assignment living to New York City where I have been living it was the first time that we had returned there since we both left our homes and we went back to get my things so we could bring them here and sell them to let them go and a few of my dear friends from my old life I contacted to let them know that I would be coming back for just a few hours and this was the first time that I had told them that I wasn't coming home
