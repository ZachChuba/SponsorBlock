Whats up guys Today we released a video called "Gamers React" And you might not notice this, but it's actually a very special video because it's our first virtual production Let me explain Welcome to my chambers We got this quarantine situation going on We can't gather, but I can still write pieces What can we do in that situation? What kind of piece can we make, where people can't gather? Well, lets do a parody of our "Visual Effects Artists React" series Except it's video game characters talking about, I guess, what they learned from their experiences I figured, you know what, why not learn Unreal They put a lot of energy into making it specialized for virtual production "Sam, why are you making a video with Unreal Engine?" "Why not just use Cinema 4d and Octane, cause it's way higher quality?" First off, thank you, for asking that question There is a huge difference between making a 3D animated... helicopter [Helicopter noises in the background] There is a difference between a 3D animation and a virtual production And if we wanted to make a 3D animated video, we would take a very different path The whole point of a virtual production is to lift as many practices and techniques From a traditional real-life film set as possible and then apply that to your virtual world "Ya say you wanna to make a virtual production, kid?" Well, I got the tools for you, check it out First, we start with Unreal Engine It's free! Wow!
Holy cow! Done! Install that on your PC Next up, you want an iPhone Sorry Android users, the iPhone is way better for this kind of stuff First off, what do we got here? Oh man, whoa, is this a facial tracking application? Yeah This is from Epic Games, Unreal made this This is their official facial capture application, and it works really, really well It lets me record all my facial expressions and translate that to a digital character Don't judge this app by my results, Because you still have to be good at making a really good facial rig for this to even function with But this app is dope This is top secret beta software, but I think by the time this video gets released this will be public You're also going to want your iPhone Because if you want to control your camera Unreal and Epic Games has already made a virtual camera app "Are you psycho?" Yes, I'm psycho, I'm psycho excited for this project Check this out, I got a virtual camera It's tracking all my movements with my camera Do you see that?
Look at that This is nuts So now I get an angle down here Or I can get an angle up here Do you see how crazy this is? Cool, well that is checking two things off the list I can take my sweet real-life acting skills and apply them I can take my sweet real-life camera skills and apply them "What's the last step you may ask, Sam?" Well... A $20 Thousand Dollar motion capture suit [Laughter] *A $20 Thousand Dollar motion capture suit I love the Xsens suit, it has been working really well These might look like actual pajamas, but trust me, you do not want to sleep in this Basically this allows me to translate my physical body movements into the game engine and capture a performance With all these tools though, I don't have to hand animate a single thing It's not a virtual production if you are sitting there, like, tweaking all the stuff all day, it's like, no "What does a production entail?" A director, a camera man, some actors, and an environment When I'm done wiggling my body around and moving the camera around I hit cut and it's there The data is captured and I get to use it "What about the environment?" In doing a react video, in our style, well that takes place on a couch, in our studio So thankfully recreating that was super, super easy I needed a nice couch 3D model, but then I also needed a 3D model of our entire studio And thankfully the guys from Leica came by our studio last year And we got a pretty robust, full on 3D scan of our entire space That all I had to do was optimize a little bit, for real-time, and then drop it right in It's a little low poly, but it's okay, because we are never going, to like, fully see the studio in focus It fits, you know, it feels like we are in the studio now That's it, that's the whole environment Jake: Sam Gorski, right? One of my best friends, okay, a man of high intellect, creative passion I really love what he is doing, with this whole, process that he is getting into He's doing all this, to circumvent some of the problems you face as a filmmaker I think that the thing that he didn't realize is that all these problems that he is experiencing could be solved With today's sponsor, Squarespace Problem number 1 Filming locations and environments  that aren't always possible when you have limited budgets or limited access to locations Using Squarespace's beautiful award winning templates, you can pretty much build any type of website that you want So, problem number 1, huge problem Viola! That's pretty much solved Problem number 2 When you are working with a small crew, dealing with actors can often be difficult, when, you know You're also trying to focus on the creative process But thanks to Squarespace's multiple contributor's tool He can allow different people from his crew, different levels of access to his site Problem solved Problem number 3 Sam is still very much dealing with the COVID pandemic, like everyone else in LA Well that doesn't allow him to go out with a whole ton of people, filming a bunch of stuff, like he normally would do Thanks to Squarespace, they have done it again Through their simultaneous posting tool, Sam can make one post on his website And that will automatically format and go out to his other social media profiles, like Twitter and Facebook Problem number 4 Dealing with all the equipment that you have to deal with, on set, as a traditional filmmaker Can often be a nuisance or just, just downright painstaking Squarespace's traffic overview tools are not painful or a nuisance, at all And lastly, everything Sam creates on his site has one click portability off of Squarespace You own everything you post on there And of course they have 24/7, award winning customer service, if he ever has a problem I hate to solve all the problems around here, but somebody has got to do it And if you guys are interested in solving your problems, in your life, consider going to Squarespace.com/corridorcrew And you get 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain Isn't that great? 10% off It's a beautiful thing Green Lantern is... his limits are only his knowledge of Military history That is his only limit It's like, "Oh, this AA gun from 1942" So part of the fun of the VFX Artist series is we all gather and we kind of riff on these clips that we're watching It's not scripted, it's totally improvised, we're all just there, you know, explaining what we're seeing So we wanted to make sure this video had a very similar feel to that We would hop on Discord and we would basically just riff on it, for like an hour or so I would take all that improvisation and then I would basically make a script That was the foundation for this entire piece Once we have our audio we would edit it, it would kind of sound like a podcast, basically But I used that as the blueprint for everything I'm about to do You can basically make a timeline, in Unreal, that you are going to animate all your stuff to And you can drag in your audio tracks and see the wave-forms right here It's pretty nuts So now that I've got my audio files, we need our bodies to move, we need our faces to move And then, once everyone is moving, we film it So, I put on the motion capture suit And then I basically Power Rangers it And I do this, I'm literally just doing that while I'm listening I'm syncing the stuff for each character, for the entire piece, we are just using Niko and Clint's voices So, from there, we open up our facial capture application Oh wow, look at me go It looks good, but certain expressions... some break it, that's my fault here But, now I have to do this for every take, for every character Niko: "Sam, tell us a little about what you do"
[Mouthing words] My lip sync is really good... Why? Well, it's because I've listened to this scene like a hundred times by now It's really hard to just drop yourself into this scene and like understand the rhythm of all the dialog Now I've recorded a face I can basically take that file and I drop that onto my character here Now, we have a character talking Once I do the body capture and then I do the facial capture What I'm left with, is basically the equivalent of the rehearsals, so to speak Everyone knows their places Everyone knows their lines We still need to whip out the camera and film the dang thing This is my favorite part, I've taken off the motion capture suit, I'm not lip syncing anymore I don't have any more work to do My camera work is being transferred into the sequence "How would you film this scene?" Well, probably a nice punched in angle, like this We would probably zoom out a little bit Get maybe, like a wider shot, that has all three of us on the couch Since I'm not key framing stuff, this is all captured I feel like there is this really natural organic element that you get to see here Like having this really fluid handheld camera in a virtual environment I think it is pretty trippy to watch And what we are left with, is a piece of footage It's like we're offloading footage from a camera, at that point All we need to do from there, is to take it and edit through our different camera angles And get our cuts going So the end product here, it's not necessarily the most 100% realistic thing But it wasn't designed to be We knew it wasn't going to be 100% photoreal We knew the animation was going to be a little jankey But the thing is, that all these things are kinda in place, now, for us to improve on it And hopefully make it look a lot more realistic Because there are some pretty crazy things coming out for Unreal I want to take a moment to personally thank the guys at Unreal Because I was able to get in touch with them, but some of them helped me step-by-step Get a lot of this stuff built out and answering my questions These guys are very passionate about getting stuff like this working, helping creators find and create workflows They see the promise in this, which is We have an opportunity here to create a new style of content People can create things that would have been completely impossible if they had to do it on a real set We're working towards this world, where your creativity and your film-making skills are the only things that are going to hold you back It's not your budget, it's not what actors you can get, it's not the kind of environments and locations you can afford It's just simply, "What's the story you're trying to tell?" and "How creative can you get with it?" And that's pretty cool If you guys are tired of listening to me talk about how I made this video and just wanted see it Head on over to the Corridor channel, right now, where it is live If you wanna see more, using these techniques Let us know, because I would be more than happy to pump out the craziest videos for you guys Maybe every two weeks again Hey, don't forget to follow us on Instagram @corridordigital And if you are really into virtual production, and wanna see what I'm up to Because I'm posting junk all the time, head over to @mechaforce on Instagram Where I'm pretty frequently posting pretty cool tidbits of projects like this, that we are working on Also, if you don't want to miss cool videos like this, and you don't want to be left in the past Using real life cameras, don't forget to subscribe
