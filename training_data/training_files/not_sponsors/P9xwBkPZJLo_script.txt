make your next move with Squarespace you know the older you get the more difficult it becomes to discern what the right thing to do is like when you're a kid you just do what your parents say son I just gotta talk with your sister do you hit her did you say hit or hate because every day bro that's wrong don't hit your sister and as you get a little older you develop a conscience and you become a real boy I cannot believe my girlfriend cheated on me I'll just move on unfortunately you are also born with this natural inclination to be terrible [Music] let's go give a knuckle sandwich yeah the point is even when you did the wrong thing you knew that it was wrong things were a lot more black and white back then don't steal don't say mean things don't hurt people but as you grow the situation's you find yourself in become less black and white well son what do you want to study in college oh well I really like writing writing I mean sure so that's a great hobby but it's very hard to make a career out of it I guess what I meant was what are you gonna do to make money your problems start to be a little more complex and there doesn't appear to be an easy right or wrong thing to do in any given situation by the way I did not draw this problem from my real life my dad was actually very proud of me when I decided to go to school as an English major isn't that right dad that's right son proud of your little YouTube channel thing thanks but anyways the point is as you get older it becomes hard to discern right and wrong should I try to become a writer doesn't want to disappoint nine family do you perhaps you should try something a little more practical and you should do what without are passionate about wait I thought you were just saying that I shouldn't become a writer I am so confused what problems just aren't as black and white as they used to be so as you get older how do you know what the right thing to do is because obviously the worst case scenario of all time is for you to make a bad decision that you end up regretting I've really enjoyed getting to know you this last month yeah it's been really tight it's time to commit as Kurt something your girlfriend you just start to think is there a right or wrong like yes obviously you shouldn't hurt people or kill people but like a lot of things seek to exist in this weird gray area it's strange should I take this job should I move should I go see this movie for the second time in theaters even though it's probably a waste of money good thing it was a really good one nobody is going to be directly harmed by the decision I make but I still want to make a good decision what does such a thing even exist or is life just happening and you make the best of it somehow finally something we can agree on these are Cape standards of right and wrong or just not based in reality precise you don't need some arbitrary standard of morality and make sure that you're a decent suit indeed exactly oh he's gone and don't worry you and I can make this up as we go along here's what I think I think there are things that are objectively good and objectively better and you learn those things when you're young because it helps inform the tough decisions you have to make one year older but I think the best advice I can share is this it's okay to make mistakes because if you're actually trying to do the right thing you can course correct if a decision you make ends up not working out so well see you can't be afraid of failure think about all the decisions you have to make in your life the chance that you're gonna get every single word right is wrong but just because you make one bad decision and that doesn't mean that you've ruined your life see now now you have a choice do I learn from the mistake I made and then make better decisions in the future or do I just keep repeating my mistakes because that my friends is a bad decision please stay tuned for slash count that squarespace.com slash Cal hey guys we just wanted to say thanks so much for always watching our videos it really means so much to us and a huge thank you to all of our patrons who make what we do possible you know we're always trying to find ways to bring in money for our channel and it's great to know that these Josh what does that what have you done not like this this fall on CBS looks really funny ok please do not watch this show please I beg you please God please do not watch this show please please
