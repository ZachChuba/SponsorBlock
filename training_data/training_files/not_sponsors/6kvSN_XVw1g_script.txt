this video is sponsored by raid Shadow legends in today's video we are exploring spray-cheese what's it made of what's inside the can and what can you do with it [Music] [Applause] we've got spray cheese here you've probably had this before at least if you live in America if you're not familiar with this this is one brand of spray cheese and we're gonna be playing with today here's the basic idea we have 12 cans of spray cheese we want to take some of these apart see what we can do with them and generally just find out what weird experiments I'm cookin with spray cheese so we've got our liquid cheesy product down inside this can and then of course there's some form of propellant it all comes out this nozzle you push the nozzle to the side and our cheese is extruded very commonly eaten on crackers or celery which is you know right just water real crunchy now let's a new player program courtesy of the dev team see there I do want to know before we actually start destroying things I want to take an unopened can and see if it's actually got eight ounces of cheese in here how much of that is actually propellant how much is can wait how much is actually cheese all right American flavor total weights ten point three seven ounces that's rip the cheese in the can of course directions for best results remove cap hold applicator tip close to food press firmly and move slowly across food surface doesn't say anything about shaking or not shaking I don't think it's liquid enough to shake so I'm gonna go with not shaking all right let's see how much Jesus actually [Music] okay 8.36 I wonder if that's where that 3/7 was coming before I wonder if that can is about two ounces kind of must be one point eight seven where's our hacksaw hey go for it just in case I don't think there's much pressure oh there's some pressure pressure well now there's a hissing noise yes ding okay now I got to throw it back on the scale and CEO and lost about point zero four ounces not much [Music] okay so it looks like the pressure is behind that and just pushes it up so check us out now inside the cam much cleaner than I was expecting we were looking at this rubber stopper here and you can see the other side of the rubber stopper right here so that makes me think that you are right that that that is where it's pressurized so they'll have it full of cheese and then they'll pressurize it through that stopper and then when you're opening this it just lets the pressure push that whole plunger and all the cheese forward I think you wanted to try something with that I did talking yeah Holly wants to try burning something weird well the cheese does burn it doesn't melt in part well you are using a blowtorch might be different in like a saucepan because it is melting - it's nothing I'm just shocked to see how fast it scorch I shouldn't be I'm using them that gas torch but that looks like the worst entree anyone's ever ordered at a restaurant plate full of slightly burned liquid cheese or like if you're going to a holiday party and you say you can bring a cheeseball when you show up with this and then you stop getting invited to parties mmm it's warm and tastes like burnt really does taste like burnt so I think we can safely say it does melt this is not a good way to do it way too much he all ones all right stopper so repellent and cheese are separated so I don't think there's any worry of cheese flying out but looking at the shape of the stopper on this one I don't know if it's actually gonna be something we can pull out in fact I can try just pull on this I might need to switch for needlenose pliers here nope oh that just pulled right through all right let's try it on a full one whew that left quickly Wow guess there's no reason to expect it to do anything different that's that makes perfect sense yeah so now let's cut the top off again I mean it's not gonna but let's see how much we can actually spray out of it now I bet none yep none happening as expected none happens well let's chop it open mmm cheesy yummy try and get as many metal shavings out of here as possible it actually has the same consistency as Delita [Music] also I just want everyone to know that the smell of cheese in this room right now is overwhelming now we're gonna see what happens if we put some easy cheese on a plate and then vacuum it I don't think too much is gonna happen because as we've seen all of the propellant is separated from the cheese itself it keeps it from being too bubbly and hairy here goes 3 2 1 I don't even think it's a wiggled that hasn't changed nope back in the movement for those curious all of the air is going back down in that nozzle and it's just sort of a jet hitting our very wobbly plate so that's what all the movement is the cheese itself seems entirely unchanged I saw nothing nope it didn't I don't think there was a single change well it didn't do much in a vacuum chamber how about like Renee tree Oh that'd be fun crunchy cheese with liquid nitrogen you can make frozen most things okay well this is fun I think it's shrunk okay [Music] freezer burn careful it'll burn your tongue yeah and then it tastes like cheese consistency it doesn't surprise me it's kind of like dippin dots it's like a stick and then it's just like cheese all right next thing we want to try [Music] we're now going to try drilling a hole into ez cheese container and I'm gonna do it up at the top which I imagine means that all of the ez cheese will start spraying out how fast are strong I don't know we've used this drill to drill holes into silly-string before and it still has residue all over it from when we did that so hopefully this will keep the drill safe alright now you he's keeping the drill safe alright I feel more cheese protected alright go for it I got a bit that sprayed more energetically than I thought it would when it comes out the nozzle it's pretty tame you actually sprayed it over the fence that plate got like a little whirl because it was spinning the drill still got covered in it somehow and we managed to spray that at least 15 feet [Music] you got something on your head on my head glad I had the hood we did actually go over the previously went over the fence oh it did that almost got your car and I'm like 50 feet you almost hit my car almost say that's at least 40 feet that is way farther than I thought it would get my car by a foot yeah so we drilled a hole in one can and it shot across the yard and into the front yard and that was amazing so now we're gonna try chopping one open let's see what happened because we like to break stuff three two one exploded very clean though [Music] oh I like it delightful wonderful now we spray out the rest and I try and build the Leaning Tower of Pisa all right I'm just I just really want to smash it guys I want to know if we can like mold it I don't think we can but I want to try okay that's just fine I make like a vase there I'm gonna make a cheese base to hold some cheese dip can you sculpt with cheese unfortunately yes you can I don't recommend bringing one of these to your next party I do guys that's not all you know we've always got more for you to see if that box if at the top we'll take you to our latest video and that box the bottom is what YouTube thinks you should be watching next hit this bottom in the middle to get subscribed to the club so you never miss out on the fun don't forget to ring that Bell and we'll see in the next one talk to you then [Music]
