emperor tiger star be sure to subscribe to his youtube channel and watch his map video on the same topic silhouetted by the flames of hundreds of burning oil wells the shattered remnants of the iraqi army make their way north along highway 80 toward basra vehicles of all kinds from tanks to technicals clog the road forcing swarms of iraqi soldiers to weave their way through the traffic on foot demoralized hungry and exhausted they have barely escaped kuwait with their lives above them however an american ac-130 orbits the area like a bird of prey after those are iraqi vehicles proceed to engage over only now do they realize they may not have truly escaped safely firing [Music] before we continue let's turn the clock back seven months on august 2nd 1990 iraqi forces acting under the direction of president saddam hussein cross the border into kuwait you might be asking yourself why saddam invaded such a seemingly trivial country the answer lies mostly in saddam's own poor decisions namely the protracted iran-iraq war which had exhausted iraq's economy and forced the country to take out billions of dollars worth of loans from kuwait and saudi arabia unable to repay saddam asked kuwait to forgive the death they refused to exacerbate matters kuwait was exporting more oil than it was allowed to as a member of opec the organization of petroleum exporting countries by june of 1990 the price per barrel had plunged to around 17. costing iraq billions of dollars in oil revenue around this time iraq also publicly accused kuwait of illegally drilling under the border and siphoning oil from them predictably kuwait and the foreign firms working in the area dismissed the claims this alleged theft of iraqi oil was a major catalyst at least officially for the invasion that occurred one year later in addition to the aforementioned oil dispute saddam also invoked iraq's traditional territorial claim to kuwait arguing that the country was merely a product of british imperialism in 1922 british high commissioner of mesopotamia sir percy cox had unilaterally set the boundaries between iraq kuwait and saudi arabia and in the process he gave away most of iraq's coastline although iraq was unhappy with this arrangement the issue of kuwaiti sovereignty lay largely dormant until the start of the gulf war with all of these grievances it was only a matter of time before war broke out for his invasion saddam mobilized a hundred thousand of his best troops in contrast the kuwait army consisted of only 16 000 soldiers and many were on leave at the time of the attack the element of surprise ensured that effective kuwaiti resistance ended within just 12 hours after which saddam triumphantly proclaimed that kuwait was now the 19th province of iraq although his army was in good shape and could have easily continued into saudi arabia and seized its valuable oil fields saddam abruptly gave the order to halt for now conquering kuwait was enough as he had shown the rest of the world that iraq had become the preeminent power in the middle east nonetheless iraq was not the preeminent power in the world and it wouldn't be long before the major powers intervened on behalf of kuwait and saudi arabia in anticipation of this saddam employed as many as 600 000 soldiers to iraq's southern border over a period of six months within the same time frame the american-led coalition assembled nearly 1 million personnel on the other side of the saudi border as part of what was called operation desert shield during the preparation phase the iraqis decided on a strategy of protraction seeking to turn the upcoming showdown into another vietnam they would prolong the conflict to turn the american public against the war and dictate the decision-making process of president george h.w bush's administration [Music] from a military standpoint the iraqis grossly underestimated the advances in technology since the vietnam war and did not consider that many of their soviet-made tanks most notably the t-72 were obsolete against the vastly superior american m1 abrams even worse they failed to correctly predict the nature of the war according to norman cigar a research fellow at the marine corps university saddam assumed that much of the fighting would occur at close range so the coalition advantage in long-range weapons optics and electronics would not matter meanwhile there was a mass exodus from densely populated areas as ordinary iraqis raced to escape the impending hostilities yet as late as january 16th 1991 there were still people lingering in baghdad for those that remained life continued with some semblance of normalcy even if it was plagued with an uncomfortable tension pulitzer prize-winning author rick atkinson describes the situation in baghdad on the eve of war say for an occasional vendor peddling oranges and dates baghdad's soups or bazaars lay empty shops which in recent months have been overflowing with spoils of war from rolex watches to armani shoes were now shuttered and padmocked that night january 16th 1991 the coalition launched a massive air campaign marking the start of operation desert storm the bombardment was directed at both tactical targets such as radar stations and strategic targets such as infrastructure and electricity surrounded by the explosions of bombs and missiles and with the nation's air defense systems completely worthless against the coalition's overwhelming air power the residents of baghdad steeled themselves for what would be the most trying period of their lives up until that point over the next six weeks iraq's infrastructure and military were devastated paving the way for an eventual ground campaign by mid-february baghdad was in disarray according to atkinson the war had reduced the city to 19th century probation basic services like running water electricity telephone service and garbage collection were no longer functioning and gasoline was in short supply in short the air campaign profoundly affected the quality of life in the nation's capital on february 24th 1991 the coalition launched the ground phase of operation desert storm which consisted of a two-pronged assault into kuwait and southeastern iraq outgunned and outmaneuvered iraqi opposition rapidly folded during their advance the coalition took huge numbers of iraqis prisoner most of them were young men who had been drafted into the military by the 26 only two days into the ground offensive coalition forces had broken 26 of 43 iraqi divisions in kuwait knocked off balance by the speed of the coalition's advance the iraqis activated their contingency plan which involved withdrawing from kuwait and destroying as much infrastructure as they possibly could in the process as they retreated iraqi forces torched over 600 oil wells some of which continued to burn for months however before untold thousands of iraqis could completely withdraw the coalition managed to cut off a portion of their retreat it didn't help that there was a bottleneck on the main road specifically highway 80 leading out of kuwait city gained the nickname of the highway of death because of the sheer numbers of vehicles destroyed by coalition aircraft on the night of the 26th the death toll is estimated to be around one thousand with approximately two thousand captured however up to eighty thousand iraqi soldiers may have escaped the trap at this point only a handful of saddam's elite republican guard divisions stood between coalition forces and complete victory and in spite of their much-wanted fighting ability they were no match for the fast-moving american armored columns on february 27th american forces destroyed over 150 iraqi tanks and armored vehicles in the battle of 73 eastern at the cost of only one bradley infantry fighting vehicle that same day american and british units destroyed 1 000 iraqi vehicles at the battles of norfolk and medina ridge although president bush announced a ceasefire on february 28th sporadic fighting continued for another week specifically near the ramila oil field iraqi forces offered token resistance as coalition forces swiftly closed in around this time iraq decided to sue for peace on march 3rd 1991 six weeks into operation desert storm the two sides met at sofwan iraq where they formally agreed to a ceasefire all told iraq suffered 20 000 killed 75 000 wounded and 80 000 captured during the gulf war in contrast kuwait experienced 16 000 casualties and coalition losses were just over a thousand many of which were surprisingly due to friendly fire the war did not oust saddam's regime it was feared that carrying the attack to baghdad would have made america look like the aggressor and the united nations council only enforced an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and imposed economic sanctions on saddam's government moreover the u.s wanted iraq to have enough military capacity to quash kurdish and shia uprisings which could have been detrimental to its allies in the region like turkey and the gulf states indeed when rebellions broke out in iraq after the end of hostilities the us did not intervene to thank god for the longevity of his regime saddam commissioned the creation of the blood quran supposedly it was written with 27 liters of his own blood possibly more to correct spelling mistakes whatever the case saddam was sanguine about his prospects despite the crippling economic sanctions and infrastructural damage sustained as a result of the war ultimately saddam defied the western powers and their allies for 12 years after the end of the gulf war until another american-led coalition finally toppled his regime in 2003 off of your first purchase of a website or domain [Music] [Music] hello
