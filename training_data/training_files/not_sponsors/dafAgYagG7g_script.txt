hello everybody and welcome back to another weekly recap in the weekly recap I'd like to go over any news related to the old school runescape community this week this week we did get a Content update including some well-needed changes add to the grotesque Guardian also in big news I am now recording on a yoga ball so if I kind of sound like I'm oscillating up and down a bit that's probably because I am as besides the content update I'm going to be going over any community news as well as anything else I think is interesting in the old school runescape community this comes out alright let's get started now today's content update was called crotas Guardian changes and monkey backpacks it's a pretty small update overall and it's pulling more things from poll number 71 the poll is pretty big and this is only a few changes from it it seems like currently with everyone's still working from home we're just getting a very minor quality of life update every week I'm glad they are still putting in the effort to make sure the game is continually getting updated okay so for the grotesques Guardian changes there are a few things the big complaint with it mainly is that the kill times are just way too long so they're doing a bit to try to fix that today the lightning that transition phase when Don flies away during the fight has been totally removed and dusk will become attackable as soon as dawn begins to fly on top of that the crow test guardians are no longer going to be invulnerable during the transition period and both of the Guardians are going to reach their new place faster and just transition quicker so it's a pretty minor change but what to see how much it actually speeds up the kill x or not now a couple of people were asking this week about the tradable granite dust that did not end up getting pulled yet or passing they still want to do more research on that okay next up here we have Monkey backpacks and now once you've finished monkey ban this - I can talk to a new npc named Baba woo it was gonna be located outside the a patola agility course and from now going forward it's gonna start tracking how many times you completed the agility course and this is gonna start awarding different our Rhys kins of the backpack once you reach certain milestones for a hundred laps you're going to get the Cramton monkey 250 you're going zombi monkey at 500 mile monkey at thousand laps are gonna get a skeleton monkey at 1500 you're gonna get the Crockett Jr and at 2,000 you're gonna get the Prince monkey but yeah if you've already been at end of a Petula Julie course well you're kind of at a Luck and the final major update this week is the Lumbridge anvil for gin lumbridge now contains an anvil for lower level players to try out smithing now this anvil will only work for bronze items so nothing above that it's just a beginner anvil unfortunately the lumbridge Ian's aren't especially technically advanced so you can only Smith bronze items okay there's a couple minor changes here at the notable ones first up here are the Dark Mage in north of edgeville now has a separate stock of runes have for Ironman players I'm not sure if that's the case anywhere else but that's kind of interesting and beyond that it's pretty much all bug fixes so that's pretty much it for the content update this week now last week I was gone for the actual game update I'm gonna quickly go over it again as there's a few pretty important changes here now the gauntlet is finally getting a few pretty major changes to it the chief among them is making it a bit more streamlined and a bit well easier had the first big change here is to the crystal staff which has had this max hit increased significantly making it probably a more viable weapon have filling vials and cooking food in the gauntlet will not happen in one tick additionally if you have learned the Barbarian smashing technique it is now enabled in the settings menu now the inner square rooms for the gauntlet are now going to be a lot less randomized making it a bit quicker and streamlined to go through the deme bosses are now going to be much easier to find in both versions of the gauntlet and they're now going to spawn in six of the twelve highlighted areas they have now reduced the number of resources required to update the armor front-loading the bulk of the cost to the early phases of the mini game and not the latter now on top of that the crystalline han Aleph has actually had some new indicators added for their attacks making that a lot easier to visually see what is coming there's a new animation and a new sound effect right before it changes attack styles which is going to make it visibly a lot easier okay so that's pretty much it for the gauntlet a few other minor changes here at the mythical max cape has been added at the game you can now create at the mythical max cape by combining the mythical cape and the excape it's got a pretty badass name and looks pretty cool in my opinion so there are a few pretty notable changes to the new death mechanics toxic items will now allow you to choose how many charged items to use when recharging that way you don't have to fill it up to max every time have certain keys and I automatically protected on death to ensure that you are not stuck outside of an area without a key Ava's a tractor and accumulators can once again be lost on a PVM death previously that was not the case and there's been a few base value changes to change what's actually kept on death to items like the herb sack the seed box and the eternal Slayer ring okay this week we actually finally got a profanity filter for some of the more heinous words out there most things are still not gonna be censored but obviously stuff like racial slurs and other extremely offensive words are now filtered by default and you can't turn that off anyway that's just a quick overview of last week's update and that's it for game updates this week and as far as community news pretty much everyone was talking about Soulja Boy playing old school runescape which i think is kind of cool I always kind of get a kick out of seeing celebrities play runescape kind of humanizes them in a way do I think this is RuneScape's huge break and probably not but I think it's cool regardless and one thing that didn't actually happen necessarily this week but the vaad is finally up word is a runescape battle royale I don't really watch much PvP but this thing was so entertaining has pretty much like a dozen content creators participating in the battle royale private world all hosted by Evie escapes so huge shadow to him he put so much work into that video it's absolutely insane I think he put more hours into that video than I have literally been alive my entire life yeah super enjoyable highly recommend going and watching it there'll be a link in the description go check it out it's like an hour and 40 minutes of prime content honestly that's pretty much it for community news there wasn't a whole lot this week one kind of other thing I wanted to talk about not exactly related to old school runescape there's actually change to youtube coming that I thought you guys actually might find interesting in late July they're making the change to the add structure for videos you no longer need to have a ten minute video to qualify for mid-roll ads the new threshold is eight minutes so if you see every content creator now going down to eight minutes um one second that's why honestly I just wish they'd make no requirement for it or at the very least they wouldn't purposely punish your video for not having mid-roll ads I'm not sure how most people feel about it but in my opinion it's not really about the money it's just about the visibility if you upload a five-minute video with no MIT roads it 99% of the time will do worse than if you have a ten minute video with mid rolls it's just the way it works it's unfortunate but I hope maybe this is a positive change and maybe this get rid of the requirement altogether okay and finally here I want to do a quick recap of this week's Q&A a lot of interesting discussion points this week first appear we are getting a new moderator their name is Maude Alena pretty awesome to see the team expanding so quickly it feel like we get a new mod every week ok first appear could we get a new transmogrify option for the mole pet to turn it pink maybe you could pay for it with gold and nuggets most of the mods really like this and they kind of wish they'd done it a while ago will you ever decide to continue the quest line for contact it's kind of just a roundabout question on whether they're going to add many foes they're not sure when yet but they are obviously going to try to do it at some point can we get an update to vork at to make it in line with how solar works right now or while you're learning the boss you don't have to pay as much as a death reclaimed fee up to 50 kills they have considered it and but Zora was kind of an exception because that's the way it had been for five years also vork hath is much easier to learn so it's probably not as necessary would you guys's thoughts on skilling pet thresholds a threshold being once you get to a certain drop rate without getting the pet you would have an increased chance of getting it and not super keen on adding that technically there is actually hit threshold once you get to 200 million experience you have a 15 times a chance of getting a pet drop have you ever considered just adding a skill but letting the community choose which one and pulling that no they wouldn't ever consider doing that well did you like isseta to come out this week I know it's going to be coming out on the 15th or maybe the week of the 22nd they're gonna have a much more clear roadmap on the updates for 2020 and when the releases were coming for the rest of the year could a quick travel option that'd be added to the spirit tree unfortunately there's actually no space left to add a quick travel option could we get the option to charge crystal weaponry or Armour permanently similar to the blade of Sal door they are considering doing something like that but they're probably gonna have a larger crystal armor update in the future so it'll probably take it in with that what are your thoughts on the new HD clients they do have a statement for that we will be engaging with the HD devs privately at the moment there are no authorized HD clients but stay tuned will you ever add the ability to auto clean herbs similar to unfinished potions or anything else has something they've actually been discussing a lot recently and probably could end up on a pole very soon we've been getting a lot of endgame content recently are there any more plans for more mid game content yes they are aware of that there's love the space currently for fixing up old content and a demon game content they do admit that probably the biggest gap is between mid and end game content and they would like to add a bit more diversity can we get rid of the strength experience you gain from doing it puru puru yes they're pretty keen on removing it there's no reason really to prevents killers from doing puro puro they're pretty positive about that considering that there is no runefest this year when will the announcements happen it doesn't seem like they're planning and doing a full online version of runefest anymore so they're not quite sure when they will come up with something though can you give us an update on what will happen to the remnant caves they have decided what they want to change with it they want to do it in different stages however they're plenty on rebalancing the drop tables which is probably going to involve making it less profitable they might be changing the cave layout or making it above ground but they're gonna be going over that in the next few weeks and finally here it has there any more thoughts on making the granite does the tradable it's something that we're thinking of doing but ultimately decided against is it would greatly changed the metaphorce layer and could make the experience rates way higher anyway guys that's gonna be it for the weekly recap a bit shorter but well there wasn't too much to go over I still hope you guys enjoyed it if you did always appreciate
