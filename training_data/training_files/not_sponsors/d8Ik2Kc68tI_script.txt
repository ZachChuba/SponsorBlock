these and geez i'm super satisfied hey guys and welcome to this week's pvp challenge we have a really exciting one for you guys today it's gonna be a banger i could already feel it if you guys like the 1000 blowpipe shots or the 1000 trident charges this one is going to be right up your alley it is a thousand barrage casts and of course barrage hits multiple enemies so the strats are going to be vastly different from those episodes now we are doing specifically ice brush casts and in our room pouch we have a thousand casts that we have now we decided to specifically stick to the code i want so we do get actually 15 so effectively 1 150 casts we actually get but the runes are 4 000. we decided to stay away from the toxic staff of the dead to not let venom be any part of this tools must be dropped so tools aren't allowed unless you get it as a drop guys you cannot take it from the bank you must get your own food there is absolutely no starting food in this challenge and it is not timed you can take as long as you want you can use your materials after the fact but all materials of course need to be dropped by a monster you casted ice barrage on and we cannot use any form of luring the monsters in except for punching so if you want to get a crowd of monsters together you can punch it one time you can't use darts that is way too much damage punch the matches around you cast ice broad set is totally fine but you can only get one punch on the monster and guys let's hop right into it but before we get in today's video we are first going to talk about today's sponsor raid shadow

log on good luck and i hope to see you there hey guys welcome to the 1000 barrage casts episode we are ready to get the show on the road and we have the code i want and pretty much max mage i think the only thing that isn't max is my mages book here but it's just magic attack uh everything is super pretty weak to magic as it is so i just want that magic boost i think i'm maxed out on that look and i agree to use the code i want and not use the staff of the dead the toxic one to poison everything just to keep things a bit more straightforward and more focused on barrage than poison and whatnot so this is the setup we are going with throughout the whole thing there are a few methods here there's a few routes we can take but i want to try to get some like hybrid slash tri bridge setup with melee weapons magic decent food maybe some knives and stuff and the first monster that i can think of off the top of my head that would work fantastic is dust devils you get food the ugg thank you kebabs mithril bars hopefully for some for some knives possibly and a mystic staff which works great as a melee weapon and a magic weapon so that's how we're going to start off this episode killing some dust devils and we're going to see how long it takes to get some of this stuff and just play it accordingly i feel like we're going to eat through barrage runes here um i don't know how fast it'll be so let's go check it out and see how quickly we can get all this stuff bees and geez a thousand casts of ice barrage and then we fight it's been an interesting one to plan this one i think i've come up with a pretty good idea most of my ideas involve having npcs in an area so we can maximize how much damage each one spell does so as you can see we're here over at the uh the ice trolls and that's because they drop sharks we don't get food for this challenge and i really want to get the food together first so i'm going to try and get myself 28 sharks here and obviously the the guards will be helping us as well so uh i don't have to be consistently casting on each one i can just try and do damage to a few and hope the guards finish them off so that's what we're gonna do let's get into this so i think we're gonna protect from range we're gonna chuck on a beaut heart and then what i am gonna actually do is i'm just gonna go ahead and take this off just gonna get the aggro of a few i know we can kick him just to get the aggro uh we have the aggro of you and then we'll drag these over and try and get ourselves an ice barrage off okay we got a kill there i need to turn this all to retaliate off because that's making it quite annoying uh if we can get this one here then we can get a three a four look at that yes beautiful absolutely beautiful and uh yeah we're just going to keep trying to clump them together that's the plan clump them together chuck the ice barrage in and uh and get some kills oh we got an addy full helm i will take it that's a slot to fill for the fight and there is our first raw shark drop six of them and we've hardly used any casts at all here that is not the rng i wanted if i was going to get something rune i've really wanted to see the roon kite shield and that is the same chances of the roon kite shield human human with that so guys we can get aggro by punching slash kicking nothing else um only because we don't want to do too much damage and darts and knives and blowpipes do do way too much damage so for these guys simply i think you just aggro them and then you run back and forth like so and it bunches them all together and you can do it really quick like that right all right cool 1000 casts everything's in the room pouch for that and then it's just a matter of wow doing that look at those xp drops guys and and of course we have the slayer helm on it's not our task it's just because um you need to have that so you don't get [ __ ] by these guys so yeah we will have that on crazy stuff look at this we need stabs we need bars wow that was like too quick holy [ __ ] battle staff no i was going to say first match that would have been sick we did get some chaos though nice ooh mithril bar it drops 10 mithral bars at a time also rune dagger they drop a dragon dagger so i definitely want that instead i could also probably kill ankus pretty quickly to get that poison it's only a four poison though is that even worth it i guess it's gonna be that type of challenge but you can't really have a solid plan because everything's gonna take a different amount of kills take a look down below guys we just got an adamant bar drop i believe that's one out of 128. it's pretty rare um i have no idea how many killed because the the drop tracker is very weird when you kill multiple dust devils in one barrage cast or on the same tick um but this is pretty much what we have so far no mystic staffs unfortunately but we did get that addy bar drop um let's see how many casts we're at so it's divided by four three six five two divided by four still 913 casts to go crazy yeah this is pretty slow so hopefully we're going to hold out get a lot of addie bar drops and a mystic staff and hopefully a dragon dagger too because that'd be pretty hype right peep the chat four addy bars again so eight adi bars in total and a dragon dagger in that last little barrage gathering so pretty sick guys we just need that mystic staff and uh we're pretty solid no food yet which quite sucks so i kinda wanna just settle for the dragon dagger uh we've learned in other pvp challenges that the mystic staff is actually better melee wise in in certain circumstances how i'm still trying to figure out but uh yeah the mystic staff has reigned supreme over the dragon dagger more times than the other way around so i really want this staff uh let's actually take a look at this real quick so let's see we're at oh okay now it's starting to really go down a bit um gotta divide it by four not two 853 casts left that's actually still so much i think that is all the raw shark i need yeah i think we got 30 royal sharks now that is awesome i'm not going to stay here any longer because the only other thing that i really wanted other than the addie full helm and the sharks was a rude kite shield but the chance of getting that is one in 64 and i don't want to waste all of my uh costs here currently use about 40 casts pretty good actually pretty good uh obviously the kodai does have a chance of stopping you from using runes as well so we probably did a few more uh casts than that but the uh the kodai saving us some casts which is really really nice yeah it takes us up to 30 sharks i'm also going to put some coal in that we got just in case um but looking pretty good there actually next up is neck reels now this is going to be a little bit difficult because we've got to kick them to get them all together and also i can't use like blood barrage or anything to get my health back so i'm gonna lose these worlds over and over again i know it but these are just so op they're so necessary uh i haven't told you what i was gonna do i am planning on going magic guys so i need death runes blood runes soul runes all that good stuff for these guys so that is what we are going for um all the rune items on top are just an added bonus but that's not exactly what i'm here for we're here to try and get ourselves like the battle staffs all that good stuff and of course as i said the uh the runes to cast the ancient magics so uh yeah we're gonna go through cast pretty quickly here but at the same time we should get some pretty decent loot as well really roommate helm as well straight off the bat just forcing me to go down uh down the melee route but this is the reason i'm going down the magic route i think it's just so so easy to get a decent like um you know rune setup together and i think if we go magic we will tear him apart he might have the same idea but it's so so difficult to get dragon hide together i think um it's so hard to get a needle in a thread another room chain body bloody hell um it's so hard to get a needle and a thread i think i just think this is the way to go so yeah magic's the route see what happens got ourselves an addy kite shield also got a room full helm uh we're getting a decent amount of bloods and deaths as well a few chaoses as well which uh i will probably have to use if i don't get enough bloods and deaths together but uh yeah they're really sorting us out at the moment oh my god mystic air staff roon square shield chaos runes death runes gold bars oh my god it's all going on here guys it is all going on here so you so we've got a sapphire as well so if we get some cosmic runes later we can get ourselves a recoil together as well oh my god yes i don't know i could also still get the food though i keep forgetting that i can get those ugg thank you kebabs and they heal 19. there are a lot of ways to get food but the best way is probably to kill trolls but with barrage that's probably a lot of wasted casts and like is it worth it you know but then again i'm seeing here that casts are being used up pretty slowly oh there's just so many ways to think about this that it's it's quite difficult to gauge what's the most effective method here you know but we'll just keep doing this for a little while longer right guys that that is it for the dust devils we have 797 casts left so still a decent amount but uh i'm wasting way too much time here no food unfortunately but the eight bars the dragon dagger we actually did get the fan braces no staff though no staff quite quite raging about it but uh next up i want to solidify just some food and get some prayer pots so we're going to head to the myanical monkeys i think that's how you pronounce them right those guys after monkey madness 2 those little monkeys that drop the prayer pots those guys that's where i'm hitting up next and they also drop bass 1 and five apparently so let's get some food let's get some prayer pots actually probably just one prayer pot see how quick it takes and uh we'll plant as we go so here we are guys barraging the monkeys they're actually quite annoying because they don't run up because they're frozen um wait hold on i guess i could kill some pick up the bass because it's coming in so quick i've been here for almost no time at all and there are just bass everywhere literally everywhere we also got some of this uh adam and arrows p plus plus and a maple short bow which i'm thinking like would that be better than knives the shitty thing about range poison it's half of melee so the p plus plus will only do three damage and they drop anti-poison i don't know if i bring that honestly i mean maybe i would right that was super quick let's tell you i'm out of here no i did not fill up the inventory completely but i'm not that worried there's many other ways to get food here also i would like to actually upgrade this bass um much better not the whole inventory but a decent part of it with some sharks um that's kind of what i'm thinking also i [ __ ] up with the salve apparently they're not undead anymore i watched a very old guide but as you saw i mean just ripping through them this really took like no casts at all look at that we're sitting pretty well right now we are getting stacked on death runes and blood runes and chaos runes even on the souls i've got 50 soul runes which i wasn't really planning on going for but 50 will do 50 blood raj casts so i mean blood brush is now viable i think i'll probably take the soul runes with me they are absolutely smashing it for me the neck reals only downside is we are going through our spells very very quickly um i've got my loot tracker up so i can see how many deaths and bloods i got so i can keep a track of actually how many spells i've used but um yeah it is going very quickly which is the only problem and obviously i want to go and do other things later on in the episode so i do have to start thinking about when i'm gonna i'm gonna leave these guys but uh right now they are just sorting me out on runes so nicely okay i'm about to run out of prayer um and to be honest i've got a decent amount of rooms got 307 deaths and 240 bloods uh also got ourselves 100 soul runes so you know a blood barrage is going to be super easy to cast we got easily enough of those so what i'm going to do is after this is done i am going to leave i'm going to do everything else i want to do and then however many casts i've got at the end i'm then going to come back here and just get the remainder runes i would like to get 400 deaths and around now i'm i'm pretty content on the blood rooms to be fair but 400 deaths would be really nice because then we could cast a 100 100 casts i think would be about right um i do not want to waste ah that's so annoying um so let's take chaos runes let's take the death runes where are they they're beautiful um so yeah pretty content on blood runes just more death runes is what i need but uh yeah we need to go and do other things so next up is we're gonna go over to the undead druids and i'm going to try and get myself a magic hammy just to get that extra magic uh bonus because i do want to be able to hit him but uh these are really going to sort me the uh the mystic air stuff is going to be awesome um so yeah it's time to get some gear together now oh well another thing the uh the roon square shield give no magic defense bonus so they don't give any negative which is awesome uh they do give a little bit of negative attack bonus but that's you know that's to be expected from maroon square shield but i can wear this and if he does go magic range or magic melee this will actually give me no negative magic defense so i can keep that on the whole fight which is really nice also getting ourselves that room full helm was nice because it doesn't give much much magic negative oh you are taking the [ __ ] piss what are you giving me well there you go not a lovely way to lovely way to waste a uh a charge right so i actually cut out the part where i embarrassingly forgot my spade but decided to do some barrows i don't really want to go magic this is definitely the best way to get runes but i figured we could also get lucky and get something else um but if i don't we are set for magic to bring some barrages for the final fight so i don't think i've been doing too much of this um i do think this will actually eat up cast so that's not the right player simply because oh of course derek tunnel because i am only attacking one monster instead of like nine at a time but i still do think it's probably one of the fastest ways to get runes um or i should say not fastest but most effective way to get runes so we don't even need to pray we're gonna oh yeah like we're gonna just destroy this oh my gosh this might be a lot easier than i thought i don't normally bring max mage and barrage to barrows so this should be quite interesting let's do this right this is the guy i'm nervous of you need to kill all six brothers for the best chance of getting any piece um so i hope i can hit him kind of effectively oh wait a sec okay if this is like really a waste of casts i won't do it but it seems to work okay now the question is should i waste casts getting a kc first few i'm not going to do it if the loots are absolutely trash then i will of course change that first chest uh could i even get bloods at 66 percent i want to say i could but yeah let's just set a few of these obviously for deaths chaos i already have plenty from the dust devils but um yeah again we'll just rock the 66 percent for now and if we really need bloods at the end we could just do like three or four trips with getting kc uh it's gonna eat through our [ __ ] casts but it's definitely the best way to get runes right the second chest coming on up let's see what we get oh yes it's it's chests like that that are just a humongous waste humongous waste oh right guys okay so kill any skeletons it adds like an extra 15 casts i guess per trip for three skeleton kills which actually quite sucks but there's the death rune so we're actually to do that for the death runes oh i meant to say blood runes but we also did get a bunch of deaths as well um so let's do like two or three more with the 88 and just a heads up guys whenever i cast a barrage spell it's actually taken from my inventory first but i'm keeping track of all the loot that i get from barrows so um that of course will be subtracted out of the 1000 casts but don't worry about how my inventory looks because that would just be very scuffed and it won't make sense from your guy's perspective but like i said keeping track of everything so we'll know exactly how much you've used actually i forgot we're going to be doing the temple spiders because they drop water runes very commonly and it's going to be really really easy to bunch them up as i'll show you in a minute i don't know how or where we're going to do it uh maybe here let's try here so if we do what we did over there hopefully yes we can bunch him up absolutely beautiful so we're just going to try and get a few together and uh they're going to drop water runes grubby keys as well which would be awesome uh we don't have as many as i would like let's try and aggro a few more i'll grow a few more beautiful and then yeah we're just going to do this bunch them up and then get ourselves some water runes because we need it for the barrages and then also get ourselves some grubby keys hopefully oh also i banked all my debts and bloods so this is an accurate representation of how many casts we have left uh yeah so we we are getting through them getting to the halfway point now which is a little bit scary there we go guys a gravity key exactly what we wanted to see and cosmic runes yes water runes as well grubby key so we can now actually uh we can now actually enchant a ring of recoil which is absolutely awesome uh nothing else too crazy there gravity that's huge that is so so massive um i'm gonna go and open it straight away actually guys because we could get you know blood runes death runes all sorts of stuff that could be useful so uh let's go and do that here we go come on something good something good something good uh oh [ __ ] beauty 200 blood runes it was deaths i wanted but we're [ __ ] sorted for bloods now i'll tell you that especially as we're going to be using blood barrage that does use four so that's really really helpful uh obviously uh that's going to be great uh then we've also got a super defense oh that is awesome an arranging part ranging pots not gonna be helpful super that's actually a really good one really really good one obviously we already had the sharks together so they're not a biggie but um those two huge very very happy with that so if we minus 200 death runes from there that's 1298 blood runes left so we have about 600 700 casts left um to get everything together so we're looking pretty good uh war rooms are the priority at the moment so we're going to be going for those mainly just got ourselves a weapon poison plus so i don't know maybe if i throw a dagger there rune dagger oh my god i didn't even see that i just saw it on the floor i didn't even know it dropped um so that oh that's a bit tempting that's a bit tempting not gonna lie guys we've got a rune dagger p there now might be worth bringing into the fight um to see if we can poison kins because that would be pretty awesome um on top of that i've just been thinking about the whole uh the whole rig of recoil thing i'd have to get a ring mould and it's not very easy to get one from a drop so uh we'd have to look into uh we'd have to look into how we could do that or how many casts we had left at the end if i wanted to do it uh because i'm not 100 sure that we could uh we could pull it off okay three more skeletons killed let's wait for that to pop up 88 come on i just want the blood runes now i just want the blood runes i feel like i'm gonna get lost in this cycle of doing way too many barrows chests but the thought of getting a sick ass barrows piece is just getting me feeling some certain kind of way so i don't know exactly what i'm gonna do um i do have to save some casts to get more food and probably kill things like neck rolls just to round out my gear but i don't think that i'll use too many casts so i don't think what i'm doing right now is too much of a problem but things have backfired before in these challenges so i don't know okay another chest coming on up ooh okay blood runes blood rooms blood runes that's what i like to see that's what i like to see you probably don't need too much to be honest though that last chest we ended up getting 43 blood runes from it and 70 death runes so not too bad we're at 163 bloods that we could use for a final fight um let's figure out how much we have so let's just include that really quick so two five four eight minus the five sixteen we got divided by four we have 508 casts left oh man i'm gonna set a few more because i'm feeling lucky guys i'm telling you one one item is an absolute game changer whether it's magicgear range gear or melee gear anything could help us any barrows item could help us win this fight all right let's open up that chest good luck on an item not even any blood runes oh man no next chest gl no blood runes why am i not getting any blood runes i just want blood runes i have enough but if i cast anything with blood barrage it uses four four blood runes fuming i'm covering the screen i'm covering the screen and i could see this hold on okay i can't see i can't see what i got i can't see what i got teleport to poh just get on out of here and uh let's see what we got holy [ __ ] 43 ah no item but more bloods i guess that's always good okay that is going to take us to over 600 water runes got a few more death runes there as well we did pick up a few more death runes uh just while we were doing these as well which is nice some chaos ruins soul rune stuff like that so adding to those totals as well uh we're now gonna head on over to the undead druids i'm just gonna get myself you know inventory ready we're going to head on over there and try and get ourselves a magic army because i think that's going to be huge giving us that 10 magic bonus if he does turn up in some d-hide because it is possible i mean if you want to go down that route it is possible um then we'll be able to uh we'll be able to sort of negate at least a little bit of dehyde by having a magic amion so uh yeah that's what we're going for you guys know the drill here if you've watched a few pvp challenges we've got an altar here so we can literally have augury on pray up and just keep on destroying these guys which is going to be really really nice uh got a load of food with me because they do use magic i don't know why i've done that i'm literally protecting from magic so i've been a complete idiot i don't need any of this food but uh yeah the only thing we need here is the magic ammi so maybe a grubby key would be nice another grubby key i'd take but uh the magikari is the only reason i'm here and i've just remembered they have a pretty decent magic level so we're not actually gonna be hitting every single time that's a bit annoying we have our first amulet unfortunately it's not the amulet of magic it's the amulet of defense either way i i'm gonna stay here until i get the magic amy it's only a one in twenty uh it's very very common um but let's say we use all of our charges here i will have an amulet of defense at least but uh yeah i really don't want to end up with that another amulet of defense i'm fuming we are really getting through these casts now guys 620 blood runes left so about 300 casts left now oh god it's getting close now it's getting close i still want to go and kill a couple more monsters to get some magic gear so this needs to pop up soon but this is the main priority so we will spend all our cars here if that comes to it but it really shouldn't i've killed 32 now we should be uh we should be seeing a little bit more or we can just see more back-to-back amulet of defenses like what they're the same chance as a strength army or a magic ammy and we've got three of the same fuming nah nah not okay not okay three amulets in a row none of the magic i hate this game so much sometimes there's a [ __ ] another one brilliant thanks so much oh man painful this is really really really oh it's it's just taught back to jagex no magic enemies brilliant thanks so much okay guys the last chest this is chest number 10 actually and after this regardless of what we get we're going on to different things so good luck us and we don't get anything that we could really use that chest unfortunately so barrows didn't do too much for us uh we do have some blood runes there are many ways to get blood runes so it is what it is though we have enough floods for the fight we have plenty of deaths for the fight let's focus on getting food so let's head to yahtzee so and we'll rush some trolls get some raw shark drops which we can easily cook it's our next plan oh gosh this is so scuffed i would say three is actually a pretty good amount to get together that's big hit oh my god oh that was my first kill where was that look at season two what the [ __ ] right i was not expecting that okay okay wow that was [ __ ] sick i'm actually really [ __ ] hyped hell yeah dude hell yeah oh where's that shark drop i think that's the last one oh where is that is it up here where the heck is it there it is is that 28 oh that's so sick so admittedly i wasted way more than i would have liked to but because those trolls are pretty much always in combat i really tried to make sure i was always attacking some because otherwise it would be just letting most of the npcs do all the work and of course that's not the spirit of the challenge so um let's see 884 divided by four we have 221 casts left uh we have our food even if we burn some we need a lot of inventory spaces for other things and also we have the bass to back it up um let's see that was totally unexpected i want to go to neck rolls sort of to probably round out some rune equipment i think you get a rune full helm pretty easy addy plate legs um then if i do that i could probably use those addie bars to make addy knives or something or maybe the maple shortbows better i'm a bit confused i hope the best method to do here is although addy knights have a really really really short range so if i barrage addy knife he might have range though oh my gosh it's just too much to think about but um yeah let's go to necros and i will see you guys there dropped us a grubby key though uh because i brought all this food with me i can't really open it yet i'm gonna get the magic happy and then we're opening the gravy key okay oh man okay that at least at least it makes me feel like i've stayed here a bit longer but we did get a grabby key maybe we can get ourselves some death runes that would be pretty cool um that's pretty much all i need now to be honest there we go amulet of magic [ __ ] last let's get out of here we got 400 casts left i can't believe how long that took took 41 kills that's ridiculous uh let's get out of here and telly just saved myself from telling i'm actually just going to smash the grubby key straight away because i'm not really too bothered about the sharks and stuff we've got enough and i can just drop these mantas if it happens anyway come on death runes blood runes again [ __ ] me i don't need any more blood runes uh more defense which is nice so we'll be able to make a whole defense pot a few more sharks as well um yeah okay cool so we got ourselves a decent amount of food together as well so we actually got a few bloods and deaths from the undead druids as well so we're actually down to 382 blood runes left so we're looking at about 150 nearly 200 casts uh left of what we've got next up i'm going to be hitting up the monks zamarak because they do drop the top and bottoms which uh give a prayer bonus and magic bonus so just an all-in-all pretty good thing here i don't think i'm gonna have to protect anything it should be hopefully one cast kills hits a [ __ ] nine course he does uh yeah hopefully one cast kills on most the kills doesn't even hit brilliant uh but yeah we need the uh at least the bottoms the top i'm not too bothered about because i could get it at wizards as well um but uh we'll see we'll see hopefully we can get everything we need right here that would be quite nice for the prayer bonus hey a one hit kill and the zombie bottoms beautiful uh i'm gonna do a few more kills here see if we can get the uh the top as well because i would like the prayer bonus um but yeah if not we will head over to wizards and get a wizard's hat brilliant love to see that back to back um then we will get a wizard's hat on a wizard's top as well if we don't get it here so for the neck rolls oh can i aggro all of them or is it going to be a bit difficult right there we go and then we come in this corner and the same thing like the dust devils i'm pretty sure where we kind of just go like this um i think that's all we need to do and then attack right oh yes that's it right so the two things we want is a rune chain body and a rune full helm um and if we get that we're sitting really pretty hopefully we get it pretty soon because the stuff really isn't that rare to be honest and as you can see we are absolutely destroying them and i guess that one isn't being attacked because these death spawns probably count as a monster of course and it can only attack nine at a time that's just my guess but i have no idea absolutely no idea either way it's super quick oh my gosh there's room chain body and i'm actually about to die we also got a rune med as well um i'm not sure if that's better than the addie full helm i got but uh we might just stop there because i'm definitely going through a lot of casts and i want to do other things the rune chain body was definitely the big big ticket item that i wanted to get so we're gonna finish off this batch and just get the hell out of here and i might try to go for um a ring of recoil because a ring of recoil is huge guys we know how crucial they are uh the rings probably pretty easy to get but the cosmic ruins and the other runes might be a bit hard we also have to try to get water runes too if that's applicable so it's gonna be a lot of uh fine-tuning this plan let's get that tuned up before we die right eat that i mean we're actually about to tell ya who gives a [ __ ] so we have 123 casts left actually technically 120 now because i just killed three goblins um and i'm not getting what i want i want a hammer i want a hammer and once we get that oh i just wasted a cast [ __ ] you stupid goblin you and your earth runes so of course with ice barrage you need water runes and i think this water wizard right here is going to be the best water rune per cast if i could kill this level 13 you know in one shot that'd be great um yeah water and sweet and it drops like 10 to 15 nope that's very wrong obviously i got that wrong uh we'll do a few kills of these and see how they work because it's gonna be so slow unfortunately the big monsters that drop it like 400 at a time or like slay your task monsters or bosses that will just strain so many casts that it's probably not worth going for and then you need to get lucky by getting the drop itself so i guess we have to hop to kill this as fast as possible but hopefully this uh pays out quite well in the end and yes we are using audrey to kill level 13 so we could do this and one shot him for 25 and get water runes okay i did a few kills and i'm not going to bother anymore because i've just realized that if we go to the wizards house straight away then i'll be able to get the like the hat and the top and unfortunately the hat is like a 1 in 42 so the chance of getting that's pretty low i might look into uh maybe doing imps for the hat depending on how we go here um i want to collect that implying so badly but i'm not allowed to um yeah the imp does do it a lot more commonly so what we'll try and do is try and get this wizard top asap and then i'll probably just uh start barraging imps which uh probably no one has ever done before but uh you know what we like being the first oh look at that it's multi oh straight away i've wasted the cast give me the hat give me the hat no there we go nice okay so we're gonna go in a barrage imps for 344 blood runes i've literally gone and got at 1kc what the [ __ ] okay i mean it's not crazy rare like it it's very common to get it from the end but there we go brilliant okay uh gonna spend the last runes i don't know what i did like i've got enough casts really i'm gonna have to work out what i want to do here okay so i've decided i'm gonna hit up the uh dungeon imprison us here and we're gonna go and kill water fiends the reason for this is they do drop a water stuff and at the moment we're rocking the air battle staff mystic air battle stuff which is a good melee weapon but i think i've got enough rooms that i'm not gonna have to melee him at all and uh if we can get a water stuff it means i don't have to bring the water runes which obviously uh that's gonna save an inventory spot so that's the reason we're going for it they also always drop a water room so i mean even if we don't get anything we do sort of get a few more water runes so yeah that's the plan uh we will see what happens i don't know what's going to happen i don't know how it it says it's common for a staff of water 1 in 21 but then obviously it took so so long to get the uh the magic um and that was one in 20 so we'll see or i guess we'll just do it straight away [ __ ] off what the [ __ ] it was the battle stuff as well it wasn't even the normal that's a one in 32. i'm literally trying to think of ways to to use these runes up now wow i cannot believe the rng there when in doubt and you need a slot filled help the the highway men you guys know how much i love the highway men they are about to take a big old ice barrage to the head if i can find one where is he where is he who's been killing my highway man there he is hiding in the trees give me that cape mate give me that cape at least we feel one more slot up um honestly guys i think i'm just gonna have to hit up um i think i'm gonna have to hit up the neck reels again and just get a few more deaths and bloods because i don't really know what else i can do to be honest that's actually feasible um so yeah i think that's what we're gonna go ahead and do so guys we have 307 water runes and 54 more casts to go this is 51 barrages that isn't really enough if i was just barraging but of course i have the blood barrage as well um so the problem is now is that my magic attack is pretty low and it's gonna be pretty annoying to switch from my armor to my lack of armor as in just taking it off it's gonna be pretty annoying so i'm thinking about bringing maybe the zamarock monks robes that you get from those monks in the underground pass you have a hundred percent drop rate i could probably kill it in one or two casts um and i'm not sure if i'm gonna bring that but i think it's worth having to decide after i have all my gear and then we're gonna send one more barrow strip because we do have enough rooms for that and then that is going to be the episode so hopefully we get some rng with blood runes at the very least on the last barrows trip so let's go kill that monk and then swing on over to barrows apparently they were removed here so uh i take that back completely looks like i won't be bringing any magic here in the fight so we have six casts left after we open this one so we'll probably spend the remaining at the water wizards and yeah that whole that whole plan with the ring of recoil actually was way more intensive than i thought so gl on the last chest and 78 blood runes oh my yes boys i'm [ __ ] hyped so guys here we are with the setup of course everything i'm wearing with the exception of the addy plate legs i got as a drop the addi platelets i just used three of the eight adi bars that i got all the runes i got from barrows and neck girls i would say is the two big hitters that got me all these runes i also went past the 307 water runes from those last six casts that i had i went to the water wizards um the soles are for blood barrage so i can do both types taking up a lot of space there but i figured blood barrage you know will heal me throughout the fight which is quite nice um and if he starts blood barraging me or even probably sooner in the fight i might just start arranging him a little bit decided to go with this instead of knives because i can poison him and i don't think range is going to be that effective for me because there's no dehyde aside from the black dehyde van braces so if he's ranging me i might just mage him back i think it depends on what weapon he has if that's effective or not but worst case scenario i could just poke him or just attack him like this again because we have the plus 32 range bonus which it is [ __ ] but i can't really get away with that with knives which is why i chose to go for the maple short bow um and the poison only does half of that for melee so the p plus pluses will only poison threes so i'm not really doing it for the poison i'm just doing it because i think it'll be the best overall but range is not going to be my main style unfortunately i kind of wanted it to be but it's quite difficult to make that happen unless i bring myth knives but again then i have to make sure all my armor's off when i attack and and if i ever have no armor on i'm chucking in barrages above all else so bit of a really messy setup bit nervous about this one because it involves a lot of switching but i do think this is a good solid all-around plan um if his was very streamlined like if he just went straight range or straight melee straight magic i think i could win maybe maybe i don't know of course everything is up in the air i will see you guys in the final fight [ __ ] me we just got some room boots i'm gonna have to look into the stats of those but um that is a slot we haven't filmed so we will take that a few death runes a few blood runes very nice um yeah we'll have to look into how bad they -11 magic are you taking the piss okay well we won't be using them will we oh wait it's because i've got the eternal boots on that that makes a lot more sense i was thinking [ __ ] me that's ridiculous okay yeah let me look at the wiki and uh we'll look into it so they give a minus three magic bonus for attack but not defense uh i'll have to see when i get all the gear on at the end we'll have a look um because i don't know if it would be worth wearing over the room full helm and then obviously i've got the wizard's hat to choose so we'll look into it we'll see what we uh what we can work with but uh we're getting very very very close here guys to the end a few of these obviously are ones i've just picked up so i'm monitoring that but yeah we're very close to uh to all of our cars being out here all right guys that is it let's turn the auto retaliate off very nice we are done we got a few extra runes here and there um do i want anything here not really and a roommate okay cool so let's go ahead and see what this setup is going to look like i don't know exactly what i want to do um but we'll see what i come up with before i show you my gear i've got to cook these sharks so let's go ahead and do that we've got so many in the bank as well i've got like 11 or 12 i got from the grubby chest as well so it's really not going to be too much of an issue here and to be honest i think we're only going to burn one or two anyway so uh full imagery should be pretty easy here there you go we burnt one and obviously we had those from earlier in the grubby key and to be honest we don't even need 28 because i'm bringing runes as well so we've got all the sharks we need let's get this cell together so here we go guys this is the plan i'm still not 100 sure on the room boots um just because if i can catch all my freezes then he's not going to be attacking me that often so that might change i'm going to think about it over the next day or so because we're not fighting for a day but that might change i might take the rune boots out i'm not sure but uh yeah so we got an 18 magic bonus with everything we've got on we've got all right defensive stats nothing too crazy but you know we're looking we're looking okay uh obviously we have ourselves the water battle staff which is saving us a water rune and also it is an all-right melee weapon 28 crush with a 37 melee strength so you know that you know could help a little bit if i do need to just bash him every so often but i think we're going to be swapping into the dagger which still gives a magic bonus of plus one which gives us a magic total of plus nine and obviously the uh p-plus is going to be doing five damage every 15 seconds to start off with then we've got the super defense which is obviously going to help as well with uh taking a few less hits and then we have so many casts so many casts and a full inventory of sharks so looking very very good here plan is to cast ice barrage ice barrage ice barrage ice barrage if he's done some damage to me chuck in some blood barrages but uh yeah just keep him away from me as much as possible good chance he's got magic as well it was a pretty easy thing to go for we will see let's see how kins is done i'm gonna make a last minute adjustment actually i'm gonna wear the room full helm and uh that's because if he is going melee or range i'll be able to keep it on it'll be great but if he is going magic i'll eat one food and i'll just take it off so yeah i'm gonna bring that rather than the blue wizards hat and we are gonna stick with the room boots so just gives our defensive bonuses a lot nicer looking stats um for this so there we go let's go and see what kins has done link linky boy a thousand casts actually probably a thousand one fifty because we did get the extra fifteen percent boost yes yeah yeah yeah but same amount of cast a lot of plans could have come of this you can go any combat style and here we are how do you feel i don't know mate i think i i went for i went for a different route i was like [ __ ] it i've got an idea i want to give it a go see how viable it is and and and here we are mate i'd say everything went okay for me but nothing was like oh that's unreal but it went okay yeah i mean i i had a few ideas to to go for like a a banger sort of plan but uh i guess i'll just say it you know i you probably could tell about my voice we we could read each other pretty well that it didn't happen but uh right um but it's not sounding too confident it depends on what you have man the fact that you're saying you've a bit of an odd plan i feel like it just depends on what each other did because i was definitely trying to counter plans that you might have had so that right so i tried to hit the whole spectrum so to speak i'll respect that so let's see okay cool you pick the first item and we'll start this reveal okay i am gonna go with helmet mate [ __ ] it let's see okay okay i settled bro did you and no i'm not talking about the guy in mauritania link okay i'm talking about the room wow cousin younger cousin wow how come uh i didn't have any casts left when i was going for it and just figured it wasn't worth it so interesting okay stand for the cheeky room meds this is backwards and i'm not i'm not liking it i'm loving it mate so far i'll tell you that i liked it oh okay i'm gonna go glove [ __ ] i didn't get any gloves okay i i mean i [Music] they were my first like 200-ish cast which took ages by the way they stack them up and they die so quick i use eight casts for like eight kills and i'm like oh my gosh they die so quickly yeah yeah okay all right this is now making me feel a bit better i'll take it i'm gonna go with shield kenz oh okay okay what's he got what's he got so we got two roon square shields but right we got this instead oh yeah i was trying to go for it i got the maroon square myself where did you get it from i got it from ice trolls yeah i thought he might do it i got two rude war hammers one cut i used a lot of casts so right okay um because yeah because i was just like they were pretty hard to stack i'm sure you realize that so i kind of got fed up and was getting barrages of two because kind of annoying to stack up but i did get the first kill link and skill first kill and i was like [ __ ] this season two [ __ ] nonsense wait what like where was the rng then wow so yeah yeah okay i think i know what our food is that i'll tell you yeah i i yeah okay debt sharks yeah shocked yeah okay uh okay cool cool cool uh my pick i'm gonna go i'm gonna go legs okay leggy boys [Music] what's he got what's he got interesting interesting okay okay um i actually like because my plan flip-flopped a lot where where did you kill those guys that dropped that monks uh outside the uh zmi altar right right one in twenty chance oh one and twenty because did you look at the ivan disciples yeah and they were being removed yeah yeah yeah so that like my plan just switched when that happened i'll tell you that well yeah when i saw it was like definite drop i was like sick and then i was like actually when i did the quest they got removed i remember so yeah yeah i'm too much of an old school player man you know yeah man knew what was going on though i respected yeah back three years ago apparently okay wow he's he's trying to say it's yours mine uh he's got the top then oh okay boots i don't have any boots room boots maybe right right you got it you got the reboot it's nice i did not get them okay awesome i actually got them i went i went for a second rendition of greater next because i had some casts at the end and got them then so that was pretty pretty nice i killed them super late super all right yeah that's why i settled with the med helm um right because i mean i i guess i'm going to spoil my next my next item well don't don't keep talking let's just reveal let's go let's go body okay i mean if you killed next for a while [Laughter] i think links ocarina is going magic anyone it's a slight like little link by any chance uh do you have a staff as well maybe you'll see you'll see we'll get there we'll get there so i got a rune chain button okay i mean this is looking great to start with i i have a feeling there might be a rune crossy coming um which it does worry me and uh and obviously obviously if there's some [ __ ] up bulks on there that i'm a bit worried but we'll see man is nervous i like it i like it necklace my necklace no necklace wow so so you you went full on magic is what i'm seeing here yeah you say it a bit i don't have a necklace so i'm assuming you killed the the i've got they're called the druids yeah and they had like a hundred and [ __ ] something magic defense so this is so much [ __ ] but obviously it's right by the old so i had augury on the whole time cool [ __ ] sent it fair enough fair enough um your choice mate i'm gonna go weapon uh i've still got one more thing oh right throw it on then just because i just have a weapon so all right put on put on your weapon that you think that [ __ ] counts my guy wasted a barrage to kill a highway man and he thinks it's a power move sorry i'm sorry i'm a weapon well i've got one more item dude [ __ ] put on that key [ __ ] off right uh weapon okay yeah if you think i'm putting on it first because you put on a cape you got another thing coming bro it's got a stack oh wow my guy went for the power moves interesting i'm assuming that's a p plus plus it's a p plus from uh temple spiders they drop a weapon poison plus and rune daggers right right right and you could stack them as well which was really nice cool i was actually like after i finished my trip i was like i was actually really stressed i didn't go to abby nz's i don't think that defense is too high they drop a rune dagger p plus plus the roommate limbs and i was with myself after the fact uh bit angry because i actually did get an any poison drop but i did not spring it okay well that's always good to hear but my weapon is this wow we're from drag dust devils yes is that your only weapon in this you maging in that [ __ ] and this you're [ __ ] nuts you're nuts you have issues what are you doing what trade with this oh wow you went to my annika monkeys didn't you yep yeah i looked at them i looked to them and i thought nah [ __ ] it actually all right i have my inventory minus the sharks we know we have sharks um do you have your inventory on you um i uh i do have this oh [Laughter] thanks thanks for showing that like my guy is like do you have any more weapons i forgot i just got any more weapons encapsulated by your [ __ ] weapons mate yeah i have my inventory other than sharks correct cool cool um so i went to my annika monkeys to get this which actually got really quick obviously pretty much wasted nearly anything um yeah i i i mean i've just done 99 magic last two levels on them like it's dumb quick how quick the prep yeah it's it's done quick i was like yeah is it worth a slot for a prayer potion i don't know so yeah that's why i didn't go there then i've well that would be in my quiver normally um bought this this of course i'd probably be wearing the shield as well so it looks a bit more crowded than it probably normally would be but um and then the room wow yeah wait throw something up before before i reveal everything super defense gotta grab a key got two actually interesting [ __ ] damn um uh do you want the blood runes which i'm happy about five eight seven nets i got a lot of death runes is that from that's for barrows you did barrows i was sending barros trips to try to hit that big ticket item of whatever i wasted like half my cast there right okay half my casts went to barrows case uh and then that he's got something he's he is that it sounds so silent and that's it you can see 28 free inventory slots unless i dropped it there's like an ags on the floor wow you bring it a lot yeah my guys go in just straight match yeah like i have this whole idea of maybe i should just go range poison and barrage casts like blood barrage i think that would have been the move but obviously i had no idea which way you were going yeah yeah yeah yeah so i went all around and i was like all around with blood barrage because i know you love blood barrage like maple shore but also poison um but range poison kind of sucks but i was like i could still you know throw it in if he's if he's maging he's got [ __ ] gear on i probably guaranteed a few hits here and there um and since it's a battle staff i had to bring the dagger for melee just yeah yeah yeah and i figured spec weapon since i was going all around i figured extra spot for a rambo spec if he's in magic gear so yeah that's kind of my overall thoughts man like please try bridging in a cvp challenge that's why i know right like all [ __ ] people like somebody somebody stop me right now okay wow i'm very surprised hey guys before we get in the fight just want to talk quickly about link's episode he uploaded the exact same time that this one went live as well over on his upload we did banks only well not just in the bank but the chunk that the bank is in on the minimap so wherever the bank sign was in the chunk picture we were about to use that entire chunk so effectively we all use the same chunks and uh formulate a plan to fight each other it's very similar to the fairy ring only challenge that we did not too long ago and you guys love that it's got like 115k views so we had to do it again this time with banks link bit nervous about this one um my guy's going straight magic over there i guess all my armor is just literally useless but of course of course i gotta bring it because that is literally the point of the reveals guys so link just give me like a few second warning and you can get your first hit man oh [ __ ] let me just sort my inventory oh [ __ ] dude i have so many runes let me bring my runes to the bottom [ __ ] me bro here we go kins wow are you joking are you joking oh [ __ ] i can't drop the room kite oh my god oh my god wait it doesn't matter because i'm not hitting anyway [ __ ] bro oh [ __ ] [ __ ] dude oh my god drop it oh there we go there we go yep [ __ ] [ __ ] okay i gotta sort this out what is he doing kids i'm so over this already oh my god right okay um right here we go here we go here we go let's get that poison hitting come on this is so garbage like i know it's maple but you have like and then he hits first try maple i forgot it was maple come on and you see that poison stack nice okay nice nice that's what we wanted to see kids whoo right let's do this how am i not hitting [ __ ] off wow wow oh oh my gosh that is a big speck you heard that train yeah wow oh god i hate this bro i hate this so much i'm really surprised how little i'm heading yeah dude i'm not sure why [ __ ] oh like that's what i'm nervous about right there yes big big barrage hits big barrages that's what we need cool yes what the [ __ ] am i doing oh nice [ __ ] come on come on hit come on hit hit hit hit hit hit now the spec potential from you is what's dangerous [Music] this is such a [ __ ] i hate this bro i hate this like you wouldn't believe come on hit the poison did not kick it did it good and and oh my god come on come on and and and hey come on yeah there we go i had a shark left [ __ ] cool [ __ ] how much food uh four five six seven oh okay i feel like that was the difference of all my [ __ ] inventory slots oh dude that speck that one crucial speck yeah it hits like a zero whatever and then my spec after that was a rambo like 17 18. yeah oh [ __ ] that was an intense fight did i that was good yeah and those last two dude like you sucked at hitting in the beginning and i could not hit at the end man yeah and the uh the maple shot by let you down as well oh my god dude yeah bro like so i i knew the poison was gonna be super weak on it so i was like okay let me just try to squeeze in a few hits it was not hitting got one hit you didn't get poisoned you run dagger one hit boom poison like like why why literally the first thing i did which i'm sure you know it just dropped all my armor i was like [ __ ] up instantly for me right right and then i i would let me drop my shield so the first like few seconds flustered because i guess with the alk value too high i was like oh god right now so that's why like you're screwing i'm not hitting i'm like like i'm not even fighting back yet linky boy congrats man killed it with the magic strat my head was just way too all over the place on that one i had no idea where you're going but uh gz man but guys we have another upload over on link's channel the exact same time this one went live bank square is only
