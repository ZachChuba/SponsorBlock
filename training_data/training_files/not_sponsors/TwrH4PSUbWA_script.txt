[Music] I'm sitting this video is brought to you whether you need a domain website or online store make it with Squarespace I got a message from someone the other day that said as someone with a degree in digital effects and editing your green screen hurts me more than the cringe compilation and hearing those words absolutely made my day to find out that I was causing someone that much grief without even trying I was overjoyed and because of this comment I decided to set up my actual green screen just to show you how much worse it could be this is me in front of something I'm not sure what it is yet but it's probably very poorly done and I hope you found subway and you're sick and so do you like comprised soul to enjoy this as much as I do but anyways much earlier in this month I put out a very blunt tweet just saying ask some questions and you guys asked you guys asked some all right 1300 responses do you know how many responses that is I would hope so because I just read aloud the numerical amount but if you don't the point is it's that it's a lot so why don't we jump into this mess where I answer some of the submitted questions with an obvious bias towards answering the questions from the people that I know in defining anything that might be followed by serious discussion with actual revelations about the content of my character to start off with blues dank asks why into that I say because I'm answering them in a video dumbass and Brandon wild pumpkin patch I'll have you know that when you say that's a good starting question you were wrong it is in fact not a good starting question in reality Henry is lucky that I'm even choosing to qualify his tweet as a question you know why because he forgot to add the question mark at the end does this criteria make me a hypocrite absolutely but it's much more fun to think of some bullshit reason to make fun of Blues wank and be consistent Elinore I'm Alex aka that guy that was in a Shane Dawson video once asked how many hoodies do you own and I never television aka that one guy that was in the Shane Dawson video once saw fit to respond for me with one of those old 1960s memes he used the over 9000 vegeta gift proving that he is indeed an ancient old man listen I would have let it slide if it was less than half a decade old Fraser but I do get asked this question a lot and a lot of people think that I'm just like tiptoeing around it oh he's always just gonna say that he is already you know it's a little bit of none because I would have expected so all people to be a little more sensitive about this issue but if you must know no I do not own any hoodies I am a hoodie and the fact that you just keep degrading me a sentient being to the level of some piece of cloth that is only meant to be owned by someone else it's really frickin dehumanizing man yeah it just makes me so angry I thought you would have understood out of all people Alex I mean you recently came out of the closet as a literal skeleton and it flipped the saying I have skeletons in my closet on its head because you literally would the skeleton in your closet I must say I do appreciate all of you guys who defended me in the replies to those questions it was very sweet and heartwarming Starr said that I'm pretty sure that's the equivalent of you keeping human skin in your closet and Liv was thoughtful enough to point out that owning people is illegal Alex anyways let's try to move on from that extreme bliss test do you are the same hoodie in all your videos or do you just have ten green hoodies in your closet I'm not mad I'm just disappointed not blade art head over tort to extreme blitz saying has he only got ten videos and I bet extreme blitz gaming thought he was real clever when he said you know you can watch hoodies I'm not gonna answer extreme blitz his first question instead I'm gonna pretend it doesn't exist and answer the second question he had about watching hoodies because I do get asked this a lot as well you see I've already managed to find somebody asking a similar thing by the Louisville Clinic asks do hoody shower like what's the lore there is a washing machine the equivalent to a human shower this is important information and this is a question I will get to momentarily so which is it then there's a sentient hoody take a shower like a human bite or do they dump their head into a washing machine and get spun all around like an eight-year-old driving a car I personally don't think my words could do this tale justice so let me demonstrate with pictures as well okay so allow me to give a demonstration this motherfucker right here this shit is me right right this is me right here and this is the washing machine yes I use a washing machine to wash myself okay so I go over to the washing machine right I'll plop myself inside the washing machine and then I go around and round and round and round and round and round and round and boom now I'm clean alright is your curiosity on how I cleanse myself satisfied No well tough shit go be the fruitcake Lea lucious do have a nose and I think this is one of those things that I'm going to leave open for interpretation there is a canon answer to this in my head but it's going to stay perhaps it'll be released at a later date or perhaps that will never be released at all scrubby absolute madman just ask them number two with the question mark next to it and this in itself was enough to give me a good chuckle but I think the thing that spawned as a result of it cannot be classified as anything other than an absolute monstrosity and reply to scrubbies tweet was a massive threat of people saying the number seven but with a different punctuation mark next to it it started innocently enough with somebody putting an exclamation mark next to the seven so we're still staying in the realm of n sentence punctuation but then somebody decided to put a period next to the seven that I can still deal with though I am getting very antsy now but then someone decided to put a quotation mark and it was all downhill from there the replies kept going until people started upping the numbers other people in individual replies separate from the threads started using upside-down punctuation the results were cataclysmic to say the least we had a couple blossoming comedians in the replies asking which left very funny guys I understood that reference and I liked it quite a bit he names tying and overriding stickler but I asked why are you so bad at games now for those of you who don't know tagging is a friend of mine in the situation he's referring to in this tweet is when me him and a couple others were playing stick fight you see I came to second place in that session as far as the number of wins we each had the only thing is I wasn't in second place behind tank I was second in place behind microwave who by the way thinks that I'm still mad that he beat me at stick fight and this is just patently untrue I'm fucking furious the best part about this whole thing though is that Tang is telling me I'm bad at games when he was the one in last place for there the entirety of that stick fight session nice try Tang McDonald's asked what's your favorite thing about YouTube and I would definitely have to say it's probably the people I meet making videos is cool but the friendships and share have established smell nice and all that so yeah of course I'm not gonna say that because that's some gay shit Trump's call asked what do you think of Wales and this question is a complex one because there are a lot of variables to consider are we talking about Wales in general because as a whole I think I could say I like them but if we're talking individually then I would need to get to know the whale that you're referring to before I make any judgements on them and then that brings up the question of whether we're talking about actual whales or fictional whales because I can give my thoughts on certain spectrum no whales I'm very indifferent to Moby Dick I think the well and flapjack is pretty alright if we're referring to the speech Wailord and Wilmer and pokemons I can definitely say that I appreciate them a lot I think they contribute a lot to the Pokemon games in the form of Borel and the fact that Wailord is technically less dense than air which means it could float on land I think literally Satan herself asked what is the box please explain and well basically the boxes so yeah now that I've explained what the Box this infernal room that I'm eternally trapped in and can change its appearance to whatever it feels like really completely out of my control is I hope you never have to ask about it again if you do I will probably just refer you here speaking of the box what a bad idea also known by their Twitter handle and I'll do it anyways I like both of those names they are a fairly big funny but anyways they asked did you make the net in the box pay rent and if you guys don't know what this question is referring to there has been a single mat that has somehow managed to insert itself or get inserted by something else into this box and it's been bugging me for a while I've complained about it on Twitter a bit it made surprise appearances and videos to fly in front of my eyes and annoy the poop out of me so some people have been asking what I decided to do was said that since it looks like it was gonna be around for the long haul to answer what a bad ideas question no I didn't make it pay rent because it's God it wasn't around for the long haul and you all were wrong Christopher Sean asked how did you come up with the channel name slaw so Oh hahaha this guy thinks he's funny me and slaw so upload a video on the same topic at the exact same time once and I just happened to make a joke about me being an unabashed and slasher ripoff in that video and suddenly I physically am slaw so very funny and as a matter of fact that just came to me one day you know I see a decent amount of people and the replies asking me when or asking me to literally rip a piece of my face off and by that I mean they're asking me to show what I look like without the mask on it is my face jerk wide and just because you don't want it to be you won't change that it is a couple of people also asked what kind of music I like listening to and/or what my favorite band is everything everything is probably my favorite band at the moment but the majority of what I listen to is rap and hip-hop some R&B every now and then as well no for the last question I'm going to answer in this video and considering just about how this whole experience has made me feel very likely the last question I will ever answer in my life at cargador asks how did floating hoodies evolved is it similar to a vampire squid with a thicker membrane and pigment giving it the appearance of a hoodie while under it or a number of tendrils used for locomotion and catching prey um I've got to say this is kind of a loaded question and despite me being a hoodie and all it sounds like you know more about this kind of thing that I do to be completely honest I'm not really entirely sure how I came to me but I'm imagining it's probably a lot less scientific than you think but like I said it does seem like you know more about this than me hey if you need a place to share your research it's
