what is going on everybody chris and stephanie here we are heading over to the first tesla service center ever built in michigan to do a model y test drive so we're currently in the model 3. uh but you had a lot of questions patrons had a lot of questions so we're going to try to cover those for you we're going to show you the process it's like a contactless kind of thing where you get in the car and fill out some paperwork and send them pictures and then you test drive the car we get it for 45 minutes and there's no employee interaction at all which is pretty cool so we'll check out the car see any differences between the model y and model three and we'll take it for a drive let you know our thoughts we've been driving the model three what like a year and a half now yep um yeah trying to accelerate too hard that camera is so heavy um and we'll tell you you know road noise comfort driving position stuff like that um if you have any questions about things we don't cover make sure you just comment down below and let us know but stephanie's like wants a model why so bad this is the mom car the cool mom car i guess we'll let you know if we're gonna trade in chances of that are pretty low yeah we're most likely not gonna trade it in because it's pretty expensive um and personally i'm excited for battery day i wanna see what's going on in september but anyway let's uh get there and see how the model y looks if you do end up liking this video please hit like and get subscribed so we'll see you at the model y all right that's what happens when stephanie holds the camera thanks for calling tesla hi um we're here for our test drive of the model y awesome at the clarkston location yes awesome um just go up to the porch okay and just like stand there and someone should be able to help you they told me to call so i don't know where's my mask and uh he's cleaning it now so disinfecting so far it's not exactly contactless they told me all this stuff would just be in the car and i wouldn't like i'd call and we wouldn't interact with anybody but i mean we're still not going inside or doing anything so i think it's fine right yeah so pretty good so far well i already love it and i want it i really like that wow this is this is all right it's pretty nice this is pretty amazing yeah i like the matte black handles yep is that because it's performance or is that just that's all the models i like that oh wow it's a lot higher up yet than the model three it feels way more spacious yep okay let's fill this out stephanie's filling out our paperwork uh so you take a picture of this and send it in but he just disinfected the whole car which is really nice we saw him going around wiping all the door handles off and everything so you know if you're worried about that going for these test drives they do that for you so that's really nice all right so doing the paperwork let's let's check it out so initial impressions like we're saying you're really impressed yeah it feels way more spacious on the inside than the model three yep a lot more headroom wow there's a lot kind of the difference is i'm five nine so i'm not all that tall uh it's average perfectly average height and uh i'm five foot six because i know you all are dying to know yeah so uh we'll have plenty of room but i think even if you're taller you'll have plenty of room so let's uh go around the car and i mean the doors feel bigger you're obviously you're higher up i'm not used to this i'm not used to the screens a little high because mine's lowered but it looks good the car only has 42 miles of range which is really weird i'm not sure why it's not more charged but that's fine checking out the outside of the car uh looks really good i mean that's subjective but nice and big way stay next to it so they can see you know like get a frame of reference so there you go really good um i parked it next to well stephanie parked it next to the model 3. so you can see the comparison there a lot bigger a lot bigger so that looks good let's open this up so that's power power lift yep a lot of good space what do you think more or less than your equinox [Music] looks like more to me we'll measure it i'll put numbers on the screen to where you could put stuff so like they're like 42 all right so 43 inches for the back there um oh yeah you can do with it too okay 38 and then so big area here way bigger than model 3. um yeah we'll put a suitcase back here so you can check it out and then you have an extra area behind that one which is nice so we got a nice big suitcase here so awesome you could probably there if you did the seven seater option rubber that they're coming out with oh then you would not yep there goes all that and then that's what it looks like in the model three so it takes up a lot we did a vacation so we we did a vacation and we had two of those in there and some other stuff but it was it was really tight so and that's not power you have to get your hands all dirty if you only want it to go up a certain height you can set the desired height and press and hold and then it dings and then it'll stay there all right this is one other question we got was does the charging port stick out and i mean i wouldn't have noticed but it does uh just a little bit i don't know how easy it is to tell um yeah just a little bit more than your model three it does okay so it does stick out more than the model three all right so we're gonna put the car seat in the baby seat um and pretend like baby's with us because in the three and even in the equinox when the baby seats in there you have enough room in the passenger seat but you know you can tell there's the thing behind just taking up a lot of room so so we're going to pretend we got baby back here i'm gonna put the car seat in and drive around all right i mean that's plenty like you could back up even a little more we're heading out so i have tons of room here even with the car seat behind me more than i do in the model 3. so that's really nice i wonder what software version we're on let's see we're on 2020.20.12. oh how's the backing up you can barely see yeah you can't see anything nope can you get this off of here so i can actually use the camera so there's kind of your views you have a camera i mean but i mean like i could see a car back there like if a car is following me on the road but it's not super super comfy happy view and it's kind of dirty right now so that's good we like them oh and it's a performance so um i'll take some sound oh my gosh yeah not used to the power um it seems way quieter well maybe not because we're not on the expressway when we were in your model 3 we were just on the highway so that's in my head right now yeah i'll let you drive it on the highway to be honest right now right now i wasn't expecting this it does feel pretty smooth actually do you agree yes um which i was disappointed we got a performance version i wish it was all-wheel drive with smaller wheels so it was more of a direct comparison but these are i think 21 inch wheels so theoretically they're worse you know than than smaller wheels that i have on my model three i have the 18s um but i think it feels pretty good yeah it feels really nice like hitting all these potholes and stuff right and we're up and we're high up right yeah you feel elevated so the glass roof back here wow it's awesome it takes up like the entire car so it goes from here all the way back instead of the model 3 it's broken up now to be fair when you're driving or even sitting in the passenger seat you really don't benefit from that at all like i can't see it or tell that it's like that um but i do have a lot of headroom because of it but that's the same as the model 3. all right this is gonna be a little torturous because it's 91 degrees out but somebody asked that we test the heat so well so this car has a heat pump in it which is much more efficient than a resistive heater that you find in the model 3 or s or x but it's probably not as effective now with it being 91 degrees out this isn't a great test because you really want to test it when it's like zero degrees out and see if it actually works but they want to know how quickly it would actually get warm because the resistive heater gets gets warm instantly so i'm gonna turn it up so as of now it's still cold it sounds like it's transitioning over so it's warm all right i'm going to turn it back down it's torture um that i don't it's hot yeah honestly i don't think that tells you anything because it's already hot out so there's hot air to use to make heat um but uh i would love to do a test of that at zero degrees though because i feel like it would take a few minutes for everything to get warm um but i don't know all right step on it just for a second just get on this part of the curvy ramp yeah but this is i'm getting on the highway is where you step on it we'll go a little slower first and so you can step on it performance but it's almost dead 37 miles of range left so 36 36 oh that's a little it's too scary i didn't adjust the mirrors either oh no that's not good okay so we're getting off the highway i did the noise test just with an app on my phone we had to be quiet so but i'll put the screenshots up the model why it says was louder um what did you think i know i just kind of ruined it but what did you think could you tell it was louder did it seem the same it seems quieter seems quite yeah i actually i agree with that um you just are trying to convince me that you we need it um it did yeah i agree it seemed quieter i'm just using an app on my phone so it's not that accurate but my model 3 was saying like i think 73 decibels and this was saying almost 80 which is a pretty dramatic difference and it did not seem like that to me i tried to hold the phone in the same place and we were going the same speed and everything so i'm a little skeptical of those results but we are on bigger tires bigger wheels thinner tires so so it could be um and maybe just the newness maybe there's less wind noise and more road noise some something like that and we're just not noticing okay so going back the other way just did the sound test again this is the road we would have been driving on with the three and it's still it's it's really elevated what what i think is happening is i think the wind noise is much less i think the car feels like tighter uh everything's you know a little tighter uh not letting in as much of that wind and probably the tires are making more noise now that i'm like thinking about it and that tire noise is less annoying than the wind noise um that's a good point that's what it is take control i'm taking control um i thought you were going over the line so yeah i think that's so you agree like now that it's probably the wind noise and what it was yeah well in the model 3 there's more wind noise yeah which this is a much newer car better produced my model 3 is 2018 so maybe you know not as tight with the gaps and everything i looked at the panel gaps speaking of that and i i didn't really notice anything we can double check them uh what do you think of the white interior do you like that yeah i don't know which way to go i forget where i am i really like the white interior it just makes me nervous wearing blue jeans that blue jeans can rub off on it and it can stain them blue that makes me nervous but i really like the look of it it's so cool do you a thousand dollars like the look of it if it didn't ever get stained maybe wow i do not a thousand dollars like the look of it but it does look nice there's a dirt road up here do you want to go on it yeah okay we got that's a good point we got to try out oh it has off-road mode how do we do that here it is off-road assist off-road assist enabled what does that even do i don't know but the traction control symbol is crossed out oh so let's give it a shot this is why you should be driving all right here we go off-road assist enabled oh no it's off oh because okay off-road assist enabled you can see there and we are on the dirt roads how does it feel let me give it some more time i do have to say though i have quickly adjusted to the rear view like i'm already i feel more comfortable with it already just getting used to it it's smaller than like my equinox of course but i'm already used to it i think it feels a little smoother maybe but my car's like you know almost two years old at this point yeah i i don't i don't feel that huge of a difference you mean overall three to y or just in this dirt road part i don't know because i don't drive your three very often all right let's switch pull over okay this probably isn't the best spot what the heck the mirror looks tiny is that it's not short and long it's it's tall and fat is that the same mirror as the model three because no definitely not that's weird i wonder if since it's a higher car i guess so and they probably did it for aerodynamics it probably helps well i mean not maybe not if it's taller but it look it's definitely closer to the car that's for sure yeah i'm a heck of a lot higher my model 3 i keep the seat all the way down and i'm definitely higher and then the other thing i'm noticing is the seat feels to hug you a little bit better what it's just gonna be so bumpy well do your best um the seat feels more cushiony did you could you tell or maybe not you don't drive enough i don't drive enough all right let's get off the dirt and get rid of these bumps okay so off the dirt the car is is more comfortable for sure just like the bounciness of the ride now i feel the road still and i'm sure smaller tires would be better but just from what i just came from driving the three here it's you're higher up it's more comfortable i'm surprised because i like the lower cars but i'm kind of liking this almost like i'm floating kind of feeling i don't know if that's the right way to describe it but that's kind of what i'm feeling is i'm kind of just like floating along whereas in my three i feel like i'm in a little rocket like zooming around um there's another y so people can see it driving going for a drive chris stepped on it and it felt like i was on a roller coaster like butterflies and your stomach kind of feeling just crazy that's performance for you the seat is all the way back and my knees are barely touching it so so there's pretty good space in the back of the car yeah like my dad could drive it he's six foot five and i would be fine what about like the seat comfort is it more comfortable than the three um first impression yes it's more comfortable than the three yes but but not much i don't i mean i would have to sit here for a while also notice this is very cool uh this uh plaque which you have in the model 3 is blacked out like the trim on the car so opening the back you can do from the screen and close from the screen of course and then couple buttons here for pulling the seats down that works well car seat was in the way never mind the car seat was in the way we took the car seat out there you go do the other one now go try to put it back up nope you gotta do do the other side try this side it was really heavy i was like surprised it's kind of hard to get it back up yeah that spring is super springy huh yeah that's not easy whoever asked about camping say you could definitely sleep in there and be comfortable do you want to sit in the back cause people were concerned about head room sure i don't know why though because look at it so people were a little concerned about headroom now again i'm not all that tall but plenty for me i think what people were concerned about was this thing but this is nowhere near where you sit now these seats do recline i don't know how though so these seats do recline a bit you can hit this button and then go back just you know an inch or two um but even here like am i yeah i guess i guess i'm kind of near it um so maybe if you're a couple inches maybe if you're six foot or more that would be in your way but then i guess you just wouldn't do that you would just keep the seat there and then now you have plenty of room so i i don't know i guess it could be a big deal if you're going to be back here a lot also these are different oh now it's like more of a clip mine's on like a little string that comes out and then you have that little light right there which i guess they had to move them because in the model 3 they're up in the middle and you don't have the middle there so now you have these lights here and then something that's super weird if you look at the seats here um rather than like i don't know how it's done in other cars but it's like a model 3 and they just put gigantic platforms here to raise the seat up so these are the exact same seats that go in the model 3. uh i don't think there's any difference they just put them on a platform so they're higher up because you're in an suv i guess um it's a little strange but but it works alright so i'll go first my final thoughts it's really nice um yeah your content is awesome i love your stuff oh thank you so much dude all right the tesla guy just came by he knew me from the channel that's cool it's like the first tesla person ever to recognize me anyway all right let's do my final thoughts on the y i do really enjoy it if i did not have a tesla today and i was gonna buy three or why i would go for the y i really would um for family life we got the dogs we want to do i mean we've done road trips in the three and we love driving with autopilot and full self driving especially now with the baby she has a lot of stuff you need to bring you know to keep her happy and healthy so it'd be nice to have that extra room i don't even know if we could do a road trip in the three with the baby now it would be really tight it would be hard if especially we're going really far i don't think we could do it so today i would pick the y over the three already having a model y already having a model three i don't think a trade-in is happening right now um we'll let i'll let stephanie decide uh he doesn't do the final decision here on camera but um my three is great the trade-in values that tesla's giving right now are not that great i know selling privately you'll get more but i just don't feel like doing that my car is awesome it's excellent i've had no issues with it uh and it's a little tiny bit more efficient because it's smaller our efficiency today was around 300 watt hours per mile but you know we're blasting it and all kinds of stuff so i guess that's not too bad but overall i i really like it i don't really see any problems with quality which i was going in looking for because a lot of reports of that and then also it's a test drive car it's going to kind of be beat up but final thought would be i would wait for september 15th battery day just to see if it's probably not affecting three and why but just in case i would not want to be buying one right now and then in a few months you hear like oh now the range is 400 miles and the cost went down you know five thousand dollars um that would be a bummer so i'd hold out for september but it's an excellent car all right what do you think i would absolutely want the model y over the model three um i always love being higher up and you are definitely higher up in this car it doesn't feel quite as high like in the back seat here quite as high as my equinox for example but i think in the front it probably is just as high um and i just like that feeling and i like the way it drives it drives like the model 3 and all the things i love about the model 3 are also in this car so it's like combining things i like in a car um in terms of model x um it's been a while since we drove that model x but the suspension on it was just weird like it felt kind of like like it was just kind of kind of wonky like a boat yeah um this did not feel that way at all like it sharp steering and it felt like more stable so yeah i would have to drive a new model x so they didn't close in five minutes okay we're gonna give this car back and then let's finish okay all right back in the three um yeah it's smaller in here definitely um and you're right the seats are cushier in the y yeah yeah yeah the my seats are more firm uh october 2018 build so these are the newer model three seats there were old ones that were really stiff so i don't know if they updated them again or not next we're going to test drive a model x a newer one because the one that we drove before was older and they were like hesitant to even give it to us i really like the model y i really liked the matte black handles like these are chrome and i don't know because they were matte black they stood out to me and it's like your first impression when you're walking up to the car to get in it it's like i liked it it's the ultimate goal we're going to end up with a cyber truck and a model y all right that's it model is a great car if you're trying to if you're picking new and you need the space i would go with the y if you don't need the space i'd probably still stick with a three um you know personal preference of course if you're trading you could do it if it's not like that big of a financial hit to you it's probably worth it um but for all your parents out there definitely go for the model y all right but it's sweet thank you for watching if there's anything we didn't cover if you have questions about uh leave them down below in the comments and we will talk to you down there so autopilot and i are happily driving [Music]
