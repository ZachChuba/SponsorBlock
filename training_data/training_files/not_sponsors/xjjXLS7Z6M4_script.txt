>> Modern Rogue, fancy box. [gasps] There's bullets. [laughing] Yes, what the hell's going on here? Is this an ice thing for ice bullets? >> BRIAN: It is. >> [gasps] Ice bullets! >> BRIAN: Dude, they're whiskey bullets. >> REX: Yeah!
[Brian laughing] [piano music] Quick note before we start guys, two months ago we told you
we were 90 percent done on Modern Rogue World Headquarters and we needed just that little boost to get us over the edge, so we announced the
formation of what we called the Founders Club. Nearly one thousand of you
beautiful, beautiful rogues showed up to make the impossible possible. We are fully running out of
the new production facility and we can not thank you guys enough. Your rewards are coming as
fast as we can get them to you, and most importantly, thank you guys, you elite fighting force of nearly one thousand beautiful founders. Alright this is a very special feel good holiday
Thanksgiving type of episode, we got a new something something
on the Scam Stuff store and I wanted to give it to our
resident whiskey sommelier, Daniel Whittington and get his take on it. Also, secretly this is unabashedly a secret unboxing video for you guys, but mainly, it's a gift giving video because we care about our friends
over at the whiskey tribe. I don't know if you guys have seen the new whiskey vault
yet, but it is insane. I thought the old whiskey vault was crazy, the new one is insane. [knocking] >> DANIEL: Come on in. >> Permission to enter
the new whiskey vault? My god this place is
ridiculous. [laughing] Okay, so I will give you the hint--
>> That's for you. >> that this is something whiskey related. >> Oh, okay. >> And I don't know, I'm
very pleased with it, we've been working on it for a while. >> Okay, that's for you. >> Okay, thank you very much.
>> Cheers. >> Cilantro. Do you have any guesses? >> With the shape? >> Yeah, yeah, give me a sincere guess. It's okay if you
accidentally get it right. >> I mean, it can't be a glass, it's too, so flask, I'm going to guess-- >> But you do know it's,
oh man, this is really good by the way.
>> I know, that's a blend from Lost Distillery's. So flask, maybe? It's whiskey related? >> Whiskey related. >> Okay, chocolates? >> They're whiskey related chocolates, that would be a thing.
>> Yeah, you've ever done, this is not chocolates. Oh, it says Modern Rogue, nice packaging. >> Yeah. >> How did you do that? I need to find your packaging guy. >> [laughs] Yeah. >> Alright, oh! [laughing] I know exactly what that is now. >> One look, this is things
to chill your whiskey, right? >> Yes, indeed.
>> Yes, it's bullets. Oh, that's amazing,
with a cartridge holder. >> So I know that--
>> Hang on. >> On our whiskey episode, oh and I guess there's more in there, too. >> Wait, wait, wait, yeah come on. Wait, wait for it. >> There ya go.
>> One. >> Okay, wait, so do you
fill these with something or do they just inherently
get cold as metal gets cold?
>> That's right, you put them all in the cartridge, you put them in the freezer.
>> The freezer. >> Right, and then that way they
don't water down the whiskey and I know on our whiskey episode, we talked about y'know, that good whiskey is whiskey you like to drink. >> Right.
>> And for some people, they like it on the rocks even
though it gets watered down. >> Well and in Texas you
sometimes want something that's not blazing high proof and warm when it's a hundred degrees in the summer. >> This is, this is what I wanted to get. >> Yes, but you don't want
to water down your whiskey at the same time, so chilling
your whiskey is a thing. >> Well because I was always feeling guilty
>> For sure. >> For kind of digging chilled
whiskey, because I was afraid, like I'm not getting the full flavor out of this.
>> No, no, no, no, no, there are times when I drink
whiskey with a lot of ice. >> Yeah. >> Especially in the summer in Texas, you just got to pour the whiskey accommodating what you're
about to do with it. >> Yeah. >> Right, so if you know
you're going to chill it and bury some of the flavor,
you have to pour a whiskey that can stand up to that. >> Oh, so if you have a more
robust maybe smokier, peavier-- >> Or a richer woody bourbon, then the chilled temperature
won't bury everything. Now chilled temperature
doesn't bury sugar, so it still tastes sweet. >> Is there, is there too much of these? Or I guess, again, I
know whatever you like is the answer
>> Well you need to drink with a friend. >> Oh, that's right! >> So I'm guessing I wouldn't
put more than two or three of those in there just for the-- >> Two or three a piece.
>> Here's the one question, though, I've got two questions. >> Yes.
>> One, >> Well, is this going
to shatter a Glencairn. >> Only one way to find out.
>> And two, when you take a sip, does it take a chunk out of your teeth? >> Only one way to find out,
we have to science this. Oh!
[clink] Oh, God, I was convinced it
was going to shatter then. >> I've been hanging
out with Rex too long. [laughs] What do you think, one or two? >> Let's see two. [clink] >> Okay.
>> And Glencairn. I don't know, I think
that might already be, oh, they're wedged in
there now, let's do it. >> You'll never get them out.
>> Try three. >> Alright, Alright. >> It's not chilled yet,
but here's the experience. >> Okay whether or not you chip a tooth.
>> It's significantly heavier. >> I found myself so nervous just then. >> About it falling down onto you?
>> Like the ice, you know when ice backs up, yeah.
>> Yes, and it clomps all over you.
>> Yeah. No, its not moving. Wait, let's get it
where it's, there we go. >> Not bad? >> I think it works. >> Dude, that's awesome. >> It's pretty rock 'n' roll >> It's awesome.
>> To have bullets in your whiskey glass. >> Well, it makes you just lean back and feel like you're a Colombian
arms dealer or something. >> Yeah. [laughing] Because who hasn't wanted to do that? >> Dude, I just wanted to say thank you for all you do for the
Modern Rogue, thank you so much, man.
>> Yes, cheers, and thank you guys. >> Sriracha. [laughs] [clink] >> DANIEL: Yeah. >> BRIAN: There we go. >> DANIEL: Ooh, that was sexy. >> Dude, I'm so stoked that he dug it, and I know it's a soft target, I mean Daniel will be appreciative
of whatever we give him because he's awesome, but still, to have like the sommelier
of the whiskey tribe be appreciative made me very, very happy. Oh, shoot, speaking of which,
