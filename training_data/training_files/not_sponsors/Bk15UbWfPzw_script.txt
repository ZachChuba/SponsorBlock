quick sidenote before we start my hold master's thesis was about how chemotherapy causes secondary cancers so I'm gonna link my thesis down below in the description box if you want to check it out if you do check it out let me know what you think I will also put an abstract just to give you an overview if you don't want to really read the whole thing and yeah on with the video so we all know that chemotherapy treats cancer but did you know that in addition to treating cancer chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy are also carcinogenic and that means that they can cause cancer so some types of chemotherapy drugs have been linked with different kinds of secondary cancers secondary cancers are new primary cancer so it isn't just a case of the patient relapsing this is a brand new cancer they are unrelated to the first concert that was treated and may occur months or even years after initial treatment the cancer is most often linked to chemo or myelodysplastic syndrome MDS and acute myelogenous leukemia or AML Mylo dysplasia is a blood cancer where the normal parts of the blood are either not made or are abnormal sometimes MDS occurs first and then it turns into AML and then we have acute lymphocytic leukemia or Al and that has also been linked to chemo chemo is known to be a greater risk factor than radiation therapy in causing leukemia alkylating agents such as melon and karma Stein keep the cell from reproducing by damaging its DNA and these drugs work in all phases of cell cycle and are used to treat many different types of cancer but because these drugs damage DNA they can affect the cells like those of the bone marrow which make new blood cells and in rare cases this can lead to leukemia the risk of leukemia from alkylating agents is dose-dependent meaning that the risk is small when lower doses are given but this goes up as the total amount of drug used gets higher so the risk of leukemia after getting alkylating agents is highest about five to ten years after treatment and the risk gets higher with um higher drug doses longer treatment time and higher dose intensity so more drug given over a short period of time and studies have shown that leukemia risk begins drys about two years after treatment with alkylating agents and it becomes highest after five to ten years topoisomerase inhibitors such as the top aside stop cells from being able to repair DNA on the top of as a drug that is commonly used to treat testicular cancer these drugs can also cause leukemia mainly AML and they can increase the risk of a secondary cancer as early as two to three years after the drug is given leukemia develops sooner after treatment with these drugs than the leukemia from alkylating agents most cases are found within two or three years of treatment and with our MDS occurring first drugs called anthracis liens are also topoisomerase inhibitors but anthracis liens are less likely to cause leukemia than the other topoisomerase inhibitors so the risks of secondary cancers following radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been established beyond a doubt but they're often dismissed as of little importance on the grounds that without the treatment patients would not even have survived long enough to even be at risk in the first place and this argument is clearly vie for a number of types of cancer such as Hodgkin's and several childhood malignancies and testicular cancer for some other types of cancer survival is very poor even when chemotherapy or radiotherapy is used in advanced stages and the issue of long-term risk does not even come into the picture so it's the intermediate cases that cause the most difficulty in establishing which way the risk benefit calculation turns out and the information required to make a full assessment is in many cases unavailable we do have an idea of long term risk and short term benefit but information is lacking on the relationship between the two curves after say like ten years following treatment so it's a little bit of a catch-22 this video is sponsored by domain thank you for watching bye [Music]
