[Music] some stories end before they finish the promising future adrift lost in the ether a tale untold grade out the annals of time see you begin an adventure with bright eyes only to be distracted and abandon your aspirations resigning yourself to closing out a chapter before it was truly complete that burning desire to see it through just wasn't there but sometimes unexpectedly a serendipitous moment can blossom blooming into a driving impetus it forces your hand it makes you come back and finish what you started let's take it back to the beginning it started how every story begins in rust with a sweaty gamer hunched over their computer in there like swimwear yeah I was on the server with my friend suspect we had spawned into the middle of a dark night so we got to farming and gathering resources to get started bunch of for a lot of stuff if you want to come over here where's over walled in misty area oh you hear that I'm gonna the spaz it was Southwest I'm riding the horse up there enough oh yeah brother [Music] yes I see you I see you I'm running for [Music] know your skills hurt me he's not gonna come out for a hot minute feels better Oh boys three of them yeah let's get out of here Oh getting the flip out of Dodge yeah hold on right a hot air balloon got the look well this big E is the low grade all right you ready to bark that out on the fly now free epic champion as part of the new player program now back to our story it will wither now let's get good got it all right I said oh brother suspect and I took to the skies in our conspicuous patchwork balloon I looked at the map and we decided to plot a track through the center to learn the territory being a little altitude is have some time up here oh look at this juicy we saw a large bass along the coast look like it might have some exploitable flaws okay let's remember that these Oh someone's shooting at us now I started playing some copyright music to set the mood so instead of getting the longer the-- the record company I've muted the audio and added some of my own sound effects bang bang we were taking sniper fire from the top of a large bass why are we going down we got away with our fuel starting to run low we needed a place to land we saw the sphere tank off in the distance oh this is gonna be a close one chief it would be a gamble but we might be able to get all the way there with a fuel we had oh it's out its out but maybe Oh Oh way too many Reds I'm gonna die that was almost spooky all the stuffs here we made it now to loot the chests at the top of the dome with some quality items is no actual jump just jump yes yeah I didn't think about it [Music] some good loot after grabbing everything we headed down and ran to the nearby bandit camp to recycle and gather provisions I'm not really conscious of my eyes I'm Manuel blinking for example right now everyone manually breathe you are the worst person I know he's gone off the right cylinder coming down please dead get icky yeah Oh eat a bunch of ah heck I'll just [Music] write now think about how your tongue is just like chillin in your mouth this little gamer up here look at him I got a bunch of stuff I can stack 12 but I think that's really flighty yikes you have no with better weapons and some raw materials we set back out across the map when we heard some shooting in the distance down below headshot up hit em oh we need to build this let's get everything good somewhere [Music] we were right next to the base we'd seen from the air this was perfect when a star when a star he's hit three times he's hit again here take his Python came into this area guns blazing the people living nearby would likely band against us we would need to either fight run or ally with them just down on the ground a shell of a rated base lay nearby with our inventories full we decided to rebuild it and secure it for ourselves [Music] let's gun down you see him out whatever maybe he saw us coming oh he's in the window he's in the window there were people in the base we had seen it was active they would know that we took over this tiny building and they wouldn't like that oh whoa why kill him I killed him he was lurking flashlight in this base up here there's a guy it all okay there's a guy up the hill Takami oh I see a headshot body hit him he's up the hill young oh this is the same dude the guy we had just killed was the one who lived down at the coast in that base we wanted to check out but this uphill bass was likely this gearless guys home but he hadn't interfered in the fight so we let him keep wandering what are you doing here are you not dangerous disease oh we met in the middle we like kind of kissed there it was the rust corn pad equivalent of when you have the spaghetti in both of your mouths [Music] don't they didn't see me they didn't see [Music] my kilts I killed someone but now even less [Music] I headshot him good yeah oh no I'm not a random double-barrel a pump guy it was the naked we'd seen earlier not so innocent now i respawned grabbed a weapon and race back to the fight damn here I'm gonna go bank these extra stars hue of this naked friend oh yeah shot me I'm backing up I'm back I got a bunch of good [Music] tickets are he's got hassium stop there you got it yes yes crossing one of these is gonna play that shot should I push up oh you could there's three of them up there right there oh yeah both right there oh I missed oh I'm down I'm down get him hit him [Music] fill this pan Oh make sure too far okay you said you got a boat uh yeah I gotta both nice yeah the naked who had killed me earlier had an L 96 a high-powered sniper rifle having this meant we could control our area with sheer firepower heat a silencer and a 16 X and they were all teamed I knew that the moment we left the server our base would certainly be raided we were a threat took in the silencer off this puppy I ain't afraid have a scope and everything yep my friend yellow yes but you tried before how does it feel yeah that's true here I pick you up some sniping at me oh I see I'm gonna kill okay hit him all the way up the hill 340 he's down Oh was a SAR red [ __ ] what is that I hit him it's just a random guy with a compound though hey nothing else to shoot with so just like pop classic card quick scope nice shot McMillan will be impressed sorry oh there's another decade base over there oh dude come here come here come ere Wilin come here look at this bye [Music] it's just oh yes suspect had found a base that just decayed with a decent amount of loot inside nothing crazy but this stuff would move us forward a lot and I had blueprints on this server so I could make any munition and explosives used or campin I'd be be grabbed as much as we could carry and went to put it away right outside our door oh yeah I was trying to be a sneaky boy too [Music] once back outside I heard the attack helicopter nearby Oh heli Liz I realized that there were materials to make ammunition as well as a workbench at the decayed base plans started to form okay I'm making a bunch of rifle ammo I'm gonna pull it I'm gonna pull it hit it okay hold it hold it let's do it this would be very dangerous but I had a strong gun I was gonna try to take down the helicopter I know I'm making a bunch I'm making a bunch I'm good didn't hit you know all right I don't know if it is either but if I can get to the freakin gas station we can do this oh good um oh my god okay I'm running back I'm up I just wasn't ready for that it broke the base i respawned and swiftly ran back I think we're not at the station I think we can we do it from the inside of gas station I realized that we needed the semi rifles from base to really do this I picked up my stuff went home and grabbed him crafted some more equipment for the fight we were finally ready here sorry sorry feet on the ground I think it'd be fun maybe literally the moment we're ready yeah the moment we were all set and equipped to fight the chopper had left the map unlucky yeah I'm gonna go bank we can build a new base - I don't like this base where it's gonna get raided regardless the kit is in order we're 100 scrap away from a q3 now we realized our little home would quickly be raided so we set out to build a larger and more fortified base we built it up over the next few minutes secured it and transferred all the loot over I'm gonna slap a box down in the other base camping that was very nice guy and a cheeky boy on our hands they got another box for our new home was built a moderately sized sturdy bunker base I logged out inside and suspect put down a tier 3 workbench and logged out as well objectives incomplete the coastal base and the uphill base still stood and the attack helicopter had escaped we fell into a dreamless slumber our bodies laying there unsure as to the fate of our flourishing little start well it was a couple days later totally unrelated my friend swales and Schley theon were playing together just starting out on a server when sleth ian found a partially broken base and some indicator they noticed the sleeping player inside had my unique streamer mode name so they shot me a message asking if they had found the ruins of my former home I was shocked I had forgotten all about it I logged into the server they were here he said it's probably me swales had managed to get some guns but I couldn't join immediately so they fortified my old base and gave me a sleeping bag so I could respawn about an hour later I came to join them fire let's just leave the traps off for a while they'd gotten some loot in the meantime I was ready to finish the story I had started a bad gash now so was there any loot in here what was the semen while I was away my neighbors had ended up raiding me and leaving the remains to decay this wasn't over I grabbed a kit and I was ready I had my bass back our friend ash also logged on grab anything dude we're actually just super generic looking we're gonna work gamer outfits okay Oh Ashley's making plays oh you're not in the hey Liam did not crash oh you'd fly the heli yeah because now let's go find whatever one that I'm interested well we were flying around I told swales about my experience on the server i retrace my steps back through places I had been before hop out brother don't over bandik him my incomplete missions from the first day and striking back at my neighbours were at the forefront of my mind he landed back at base banked our loot then headed out his morning came a bullet hello-hello jammie-jammie is feeling very nervous right now bad idea [Music] oh yeah he was not a bumpkin on our large furnace on in this base I have ladders we could just eat in there Oh stuff a big chunk of sulfur we could use this to make explosives that's no sign of the owner we all hopped out oh yeah oh okay nice nice hops gamers go back to foundation like their pathetic excuse for a base swales grabbed a mini heli and landed in on the coastal base to scope it out he's probably gonna crash it you could rate it oh there's somebody getting chased by a pig over there parkour Jesus there's a garage door open right auditor coming out of this oh yeah oh there was an open garage door here in the coastal base we could braid into this shooting floor and potentially get a lot of loot so I worked on baiting the auto turret now my friends had found one c4 earlier in an airdrop along with the materials we just got and we were well on our way to a raid I was on the way home to craft some explosives to get started when there was a boom oh yeah wait I think I see what base it is up the hill that's boys are they full one of them yeah up hill base was being raided this was getting interesting this guy I don't think he's with them with me closely there's nakeds all around let's push it let him do this thing all day return the breach satchel charges we could use for our rate oh there's an yeah okay in a no building no building the Raiders were dead inside here and there was no building block though they think guys okay okay coming up 10 I'm going around right one flow I'm dead I'm dead I'm once dead I'm gonna kill another one yep once full dead yep kill them oh this is that and placed a TC in the back area and went to check the loop it's her it out wait but like he never not much loot in sight but we had the satchels and be encountered - I think yeah let's take stock of what we have and everything my return to the up hill base had been fruitful with the satchels see for an explosive mo I was about to craft we were ready to take on the coastal base oh wait tilted in my life what's going on you just threw sus you just started perfect come on there we go yeah we use the satchel charges we got to break through the garage door leading in from the roof yep way got dropped there's another door to open below it we broke the boxes in this top room and here was some loot but nothing crazy yet we explored the hallways of this structure and decided next that we should take down these doors with the explosive ammo hmm that's a tricky angle I think I love this oh I see how you'd get it yeah get the angle nope hurts so good got it lucky with the turret drained we kept blowing in [Music] Oh oh this could be tons of loot weapons loads of components everything they make it here I'll fill up my inventory as well next we did one loot run home to put away some of the best items now we wanted to go even deeper in and we saw there was an exposed soft side wall I started to break it down when we heard the attack helicopter in the distance now I remembered my struggles with the attack helicopter so long ago now I was ready time for redemption everyone downstairs I hid it a bunch does anyone have spare mats it's two on the ground one in trouble I'm fine I didn't get hit my ache is almost broken anyone got an extra hey barn I hit it more going success we takin down the attack helicopter coming full circle on my past I'm up here we looted the helicopter crates and got an m249 I'm using that we easily blast it through the remaining portion of the coastal base using the explosives we obtained we soon reach the tool cupboard and claim the base for ourselves and we once again filled our pockets and headed home alright I think we need to get out of this base after resigning myself to a future unlived my friends had rekindled the excitement I had for this unfinished adventure a chapter of an ever growing book of experiences complete the
