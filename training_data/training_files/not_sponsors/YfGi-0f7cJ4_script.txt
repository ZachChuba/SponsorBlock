using the link in the description Reuters detonated a huge controversy in the Apple and security spaces yesterday with this headline Apple drop plan for encrypting backups after FBI complained sources what plans what encrypted backups what complaint what the hell I am Rene Richie and this is vector okay so first what Reuters is referring to as backups here is specifically iCloud backups there are still two ways to backup Apple devices to iCloud and locally to a Mac or PC for a very long time now and still to this day you can locally backup your Mac or PC and opt into those backups being password encrypted it's not a plan it's a checkbox and none of that has changed second based on reactions to the headline many people including very tech savvy people didn't seem to realize or remember that iCloud backups weren't quote-unquote encrypted I say quote unquote because the backups actually are encrypted but Apple has their own set of keys and can access them which is not unusual like at all there are a couple of reasons for that features and fail-safes I'll get to fail-safes in a bit but online storage not being end-to-end encrypted at the container level allows for additional features that can be highly convenient for the customer web-based access to single files within a backup for example including and especially photos calendars and contacts like you get at iCloud comm there are a few end-to-end encrypted by design storage services and services that provide options or local tools for end-to-end encryption and you can always upload locally encrypted files as well but iCloud is by no means unique and how it treats online backups which is probably why some people reacted so strongly to the headline given how much Apple talks about privacy and security some just assume it applies to everything now Apple does treat some data differently for example health data and keychain password data are end-to-end encrypted and Apple locks out everyone but you including Apple themselves to explain the France and maybe the dissonance I'm gonna flashback for a second many years ago there was a scandal involving celebrities and their private photos being leaked online many but not all of them came from iCloud backups iCloud was never hacked but if someone famous reused the same password as another service that was hacked or used security questions that could be looked up on Wikipedia for example attackers could and did get into them and Apple had to put a stop to it and fast no one but you should ever gain access to your iCloud account so Apple implemented 2-step authentication and the way they implemented it meant anyone using it had to write down or print out a long pseudo-random recovery key and keep it safe in case they ever forgot their iCloud passwords or couldn't supply the second step for authentication otherwise they'd get lock out of their own accounts and of course people being people they promptly turned on their to sa lost a recovery key and got locked out of their own iCloud accounts Apple was soon flooded with requests to help people get back into their accounts but without the recovery key there was absolutely nothing Apple could do the data was lost for all intents and purposes destroyed I've done a few videos about this already but it's worth repeating again always for most people most of the time encrypted backups are a bad idea precisely because if anything goes wrong and things often go wrong they cannot be recovered even a physical hard drive if it's encrypted and it gets damaged there's just no amount of recovery in the world that can get your data back for InfoSec information security people that's the whole point and they will always say to encrypt everything because it's better to lose than to leak data retention experts though will tell you never to encrypt those backups precisely because they've seen so many people lose so much of their own data unfortunately given the times we live in we've heard far more from safe everything than to save everything crowd and it really is critically important to always consider both sides Apple totally deserves some of the blame for this as well given how much publicity they like everyone else give to security and how little they like everyone else give to education about what should and shouldn't be kept secure internally though Apple learned that being extremists about anything including security is not only inconsiderate but actively harmful so Apple had to put a stop to people losing access to their own data as well and just as fast to do that Apple deprecated the old two-step authentication system and rolled out a new two-factor authentication system that was not only easier for most people to manage but would also allow Apple to recover iCloud backups for people if and when they lock themselves out but could still prove ownership of the account the downside to this was that because Apple could access the backups they were then legally obligated to hand over those backups in the event of a subpoena why would Apple make that trade-off for the exact reasons I just explained for the vast majority of people the risk of data loss is significantly significantly higher than the risk of data theft or subpoena in other words for most people most of the time the biggest danger isn't someone else including a law enforcement agency getting access to your data it's you losing access to it Apple the company that would rather just lock up absolutely everything decided it would actually be in the better interest of their customers to be a little less absolutist in this specific case this is why for the last five years or so iCloud backups have been encrypted but not end-to-end encrypted unlike almost everything else on iCloud Apple doesn't lock themselves out so they can help you if you happen to lock yourself out and of course for anyone not comfortable with that there was and continues to be the option for fully encrypted backups available via Mac or PC Reuters again Apple dropped plans to let iPhone users fully encrypt backups of their devices in the company's iCloud service after the FBI complained that the move would harm investigations this according to six sources familiar with the matter reuters probably means Apple devices rather than just the iPhone because there's very little chance the iPhone would be treated differently than say the iPad when it comes to iCloud backups now yes local backups to a Mac or PC can still be fully encrypted but those aren't as convenient and so people tend to be less consistent about them than iCloud backups that's why after Apple made the change from - si - to F a several people myself included understanding the risk of data loss still asked for the option to turn on and to end encryption for iCloud backups as well the question even came up in a Spiegel interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook translated by Google our users have a key there and we have one we do this because some users lose or forget their key and then expect help from us to get their data back it is difficult to estimate when we will change this practice but I think that in the future it will be regulated like the devices we will therefore no longer have a key for this in the future regulated here as in handle not as in mandated by law now reuters isn't citing that interview as the source but they are saying the tech giant's reversal about two years ago has not previously been reported and that makes reuters report problematic regardless of the source it hasn't been about two years since Tim Cook's interview where he clearly says Apple is working to end-to-end encrypt iCloud backups it's been barely more than a year not even 15 months if something as simple as checkable as the timeline is wrong what else may be wrong Reuters again it shows how much Apple has been willing to help us law enforcement and intelligence agencies despite taking a harder line in high-profile legal disputes with the government and casting itself as a defender of its customers information but does it though apples willingness to help law enforcement has never been in question through words and actions Apple has repeatedly demonstrated a commitment to obeying local laws including a willingness to help law enforcement as required by those laws this doesn't show how much because how much has always been shown to be much the hardline Apple took with San Bernardino and is taking with Pensacola is completely different in kind because data on servers and on devices is different in kind and legal requests and extra legal requests are different in kind apple's argument about devices has and continues to be that they are far more likely to be lost or stolen and therefore require much stronger protection silicon level encryption and that Apple can't grant access to law enforcement because that would also grant access to anyone who finds steals or otherwise gains possession of someone else's device in other words Apple isn't locking down iPhones to keep law enforcement organizations with valid warrants out they're doing it to keep criminals out the downside for a law enforcement is that they get locked out as well it's fail secure instead of failsafe the exact inverse of the iCloud backup situation and the exact opposite trade-off now I personally believe in and I've made a couple videos advocating that our devices contain so much deeply personal data that their de facto extensions of our persons and as such deserve Fifth Amendment like protection and exemptions under the law but that's me as far as I know Apple hasn't advocated for anything that extreme what Apple has done though is state that they shouldn't be compelled to provide access to data beyond the scope of existing laws that there should be no extra legal requests that's why when attorneys general and directors FBI demanded Apple create backdoors and break encryption on the iPhones in San Bernardino and Pensacola Apple said no but even before it got to those pay grades when Apple was legally asked for the iCloud backups Apple provided them both of those facts were widely and jointly reported there is no disconnect there no surprise no gotcha not unless someone deliberately fabricates one reuters more than two years ago Apple told the FBI that it planned to offer users end to end encryption when storing their phone data on iCloud according to one current and three former FBI officials and one current and one former Apple employee okay so this is where reuters report becomes really troubling again Apple is on record saying they will obey local laws but encryption is not illegal and the idea that Apple would involve the FBI in that type of process would be seen as an incredible violation of trust given their relationship Apple has crafted with their customers it would be too many a deal-breaker Apple's entire reputation is based on commitment to product and customer and whether that helps or hurts the FBI or anyone else's extra legal agenda shouldn't and can't matter product and customer have to come first now there is nothing on the record that I'm aware of that I can point to either prove or disprove this allegation it does seem to go against everything know about how in why Apple operates to the point where if I were in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign right now I'd be leaping up and yelling disbelief but that's subjective opinion not an objective set of facts I have had numerous off-the-record conversations over the years since this iCloud backup system was implemented and I've only ever heard that it was done this way 100% to help customers who had previously been locking themselves out of their accounts any benefit to law enforcement was unintended but also unavoidable the cost of prioritizing and preserving customer access John Gruber of daring fireball who has as good a sources inside Apple as anyone wrote my own private conversations over the last several years with rank and file Apple sources who've been directly involved with the company's security engineering is that men's sources for the Apple told the FBI that it planned to offer users and to end encryption when storing their iPhone data on iCloud bit were the FBI sources not the Apple sources and that it is not accurate since anyone who wants to keep everyone including Apple locked out of their data simply has to toggle iCloud backups off or like I said before use a Mac or PC to create fully encrypted backups the damage to Apple's reputation from backroom dealings like this wouldn't be worth it at all especially since there's no indication Apple has done anything to prevent iCloud backups from being turned off or to remove encrypted backup capabilities from the Mac or PC something that could easily have been done under the guise of dropping support for a legacy system Reuters under that plan primarily designed to thwart hackers Apple would no longer have a key to unlock the encrypted data meaning it would not be able to turn materials over to authorities in a readable form even under court order this also rings untrue to me I can't think of a single case where hackers have successfully gained access to Apple's iCloud backup keys in every case access to data has been achieved by gaining physical access to a device that has the keys or socially engineering or otherwise gaining credentials to access and restore the iCloud backup from another remote device an apple plan to enable end-to-end encrypted backups would only really thwart two groups of people the users who lose access to the own accounts as happened in the past and law enforcement agencies who want to subpoena the iCloud backups Reuters in private talks with Apple soon after representatives of the FBI cybercrime agents and its operational technology division objected to the plan arguing it would deny them the most effective means for gaining evidence against iPhone using suspects the government sources said I have no way to verify whether or not private talks really happened I suspect but cannot prove there's a ton of broken telephone going on here but if this sounds like something the FBI would argue it's because it's something the FBI does in fact argue all the time it's also not accurate governments now have access to unprecedented amounts of data about all of us almost all the time in some cases that includes cameras and other forms of physical surveillance in almost all cases metadata about who we contact when where and how reuters again when Apple spoke privately to the FBI about its work on phone security the following year the end-to-end encryption plan had been dropped according to the six sources so let me try to follow this two years ago Apple had this plan and spoke to the FBI about it a year ago they spoke to the FBI about it again but said it was dropped but that's also just about exactly when Tim Cook first mentions Apple was working on exactly this plan this means again the timeline doesn't really make sense Reuters could not determine why exactly Apple dropped the plan which is a really interesting thing to say right after quoting six sources about the plan being dropped legal killed it for reasons you can imagine another former Apple employee said he was told without any specific mention of why the plan was dropped or if the FBI was a factor in the decision now I personally can imagine many things including Apple legal being worried about lawsuits from customers locked out of their data even when it's their own damn fault that person told Reuters the company did not want to risk being attacked by public officials for protecting criminals sued for moving previously accessible data out of reach of government agencies or used as an excuse for new legislation against encryption but why not Apple already gets attacked by public officials the highest of officials and very publicly on Twitter for exactly those reasons it's not a risk if it's already happening and to end encrypting backups is also currently legal and Apple already does it for Mac and PC backups they can't be sued for that either at least not successfully Reuters they decided they weren't gonna poke the bear anymore the person said referring to Apple's court battle with the FBI in 2016 over access to an iPhone used by one of the suspects in a mass shooting in San Bernardino California all so why not pressuring Apple over encryption isn't just a risk for Apple it's a risk for the government as well because like we saw when they withdrew from the San Bernardino case they're actually scared precedent won't go their way as to new legislation against encryption appleís said they believe it should be a legislative decision they'll fight it of course because it's in the best interest of their customers and their business to fight it but as we discussed before Apple will ultimately follow the law and there is also no telling whether that law can or would pass overreaching information laws have been successfully defeated several times in the recent past Reuters however a former Apple employee said it was possible the encryption project was dropped for other reasons such as concern that more customers would find themselves locked out of their data more often which like I said at the beginning has been the only and exactly rationale I've heard from people at Apple over the last few years Reuters once a decision was made the 10 or so experts on the Apple encryption project variously codenamed pleaseö and key drop were told to stop working on the effort three people familiar with the matter told Reuters this I really wonder about it's possible those specific projects were canned but my understanding is that this is a discussion that is still ongoing at Apple and it's not atypical for several similar projects to be cancelled in favor of better projects that ultimately achieve the same thing that happens all the time Apple is a measure 200 times cut ones type of company and implementing a new architecture that keeps out bad actors but doesn't lock out account owners but also allows for end-to-end encryption that still is considerate and forgiving as possible is the definition of non-trivial and is absolutely something that has to be done right look at all the arguments we have on Twitter and in comments about what Apple can and should these same arguments happen inside Apple they're not a monoculture or a hive mind they're a diverse group of passionate overachieving type-a personalities with a lot of strong opinions about what should and shouldn't be done and how up to and including the highest levels of the company and everything from the articles that get written to the videos that get made to the radars that get filed to the author record conversations that take place help to inform and empower these arguments because everyone wants their opinion to win out and will take the best and brightest backup they can get to help make sure they win and stay one like without health data and keychain password data is end-to-end encrypted even in backup that's ultimately why I'm actually really happy Reuters published this not because that set off some needless panic especially from people sharing it without doing even basic due diligence or critical thinking before scaring people with ginned up controversy 'z manufactured outrage and conspiracy theories but because it's an incredibly important topic and it just may help propel it once again to the top of Apple's iCloud roadmap yes even as they're still struggling to fix up and finish everything from messages on the cloud to the last round of iOS 13 server-side iCloud changes which by the way if you turn on iMessage on iCloud and then turn off iCloud backup will still let you sink messages between your devices but we'll move the key from iCloud backup to your local device because this stuff is complicated personally I think it's critically important for Apple to provide opt-in and to end encryption for iCloud backups moreover on a data set by data set basis because contrary to the hype and to end encryption isn't always for the best in many cases it can be for the worst maybe I want my messages backup totally secure but still want to access my photos on iCloud comm I should be able to do that basically anything that would be more damaging and harmful to you if it were leaked and lost you should be able to encrypt it again Apple already does that by default for things like passwords and health data but you should get to choose other types of data any types of data that concern you and conversely anything would be more damaging and harmful to you if it were lost than leaked you should absolutely not encrypt even if you have the option that's the way I cloud backup works now and should still be the default because it's in the best interest of 99% of people and 99% of the time totally not an easy system to architect in a way that isn't unnecessarily burdensome or error-prone for end-users but totally apples job to figure out and I hope Apple does figure it out and ship it and soon even if I would personally never turn it on for exactly the reasons I've repeated here repeatedly not for me but for the benefit of every dissident whistleblower journalist oppressed minority person at risk or privacy advocate who would it's how we prevent our society from becoming one of those dystopian futures we see in and
