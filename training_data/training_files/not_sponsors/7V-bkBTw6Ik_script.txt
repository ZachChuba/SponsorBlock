Oh mr. gg now for those of you who don't know who mr. gg is mr. gg is a YouTube character talent well well well we meet again you see on April 9th I uploaded a video titled an ex predator watched my video with a very menacing ellipses to see two kings you know you can go watch that video for full context but here's the timeline you see a gentleman that appeared on the NBC Dateline show to catch a predator came across one of my videos where I discussed his bust pause and he decided to take down that video however he did not do so unlawfully I foolishly included about two seconds of his copyrighted music which I sped up specifically to avoid a copyright claim but unfortunately when the balls in his copyright court he can choose to either to claim my video and reap the monetary benefits or he can choose to take it down entirely and he chose the latter I sent him an email for some more information surrounding to take down and after no response I just cut that part out and re-uploaded the entire video soon after that video got age-restricted somebody tipped them off I wonder who that it actually got copyright claimed again but that was because I used the theme song from double-oh-seven it was worth a joke [ __ ] it anywho I did eventually end up receiving a pretty lengthy email response from the man who appeared on the show and took down my video and I only discussed this email all my patreon because I thought you know what I don't want to bring this mess to my main channel I just made one video about it that's that and now i've quickly changed my mind because youtube sent me an email dear mr. GG hey this is to notify you that we have received a privacy complaint from an individual regarding your content they linked me the video they were referring to and they even gave me a time stamp so i could specifically know who they were talking about and just as you would expect we meet again indeed and here's my response starts with just one click thank you guys mr. gg so when this privacy complaint email YouTube gave me the option to blur the face of the person filing the complaint using their little editing tool this would obviously be a quick fix of the problem otherwise after 48 hours YouTube would review the video for potential violations of their privacy guidelines and if they were to rule in favor of the person filing the complaint they could delete my video and after I read this email I honestly was just sick of this guy using every tool that YouTube has readily available for him to try and remove my content so after a bit of debate I refused to censor his face in the episode for a multitude of reasons number one this was aired on public television they had commercials for this [ __ ] there was one minute where America saw you in handcuffs and then the next they were watching a [ __ ] Pepsi commercial but I'm affecting your privacy they were advertising the next episode of King of Queens after you made the biggest mistake of your [ __ ] life what I'm trying to say is that this footage is very much available to the public back in the day in 2006-2007 TCAP was averaging like seven million viewers per episode and to this day on YouTube clips and reuploads of the stings amass millions and millions of views together I didn't steal footage from your personal iCloud I just pressed a few buttons and accidentally ran into your footage that's how easy it is to find number two that's it that's all I should need in my defense for this situation listen buddy if you put in as much work into your music as you did trying to take down my content you might have been able to cash in a few gigs at your local diner but since you didn't and want to blame everybody else for your problems have fun reminiscing about this shoulda coulda woulda man if Chris Hanson didn't catch me I would have been as big as John Lennon and I could have had all that teenage groupies the hoes would have called me John Lennon cuz I'm always in the machine so like I said I didn't censor his face and I did want to put YouTube to the test who would they backhand as an update it has now been almost over a month and my video is still on I was never given a confirmation on anything but I think it's safe to assume that YouTube reviewed my video and officially declared that I did not violate any privacy guidelines and for that I genuinely thank you YouTube he catch a lot of [ __ ] often some of it from me but I am very glad in this situation that the correct choice was made perhaps the obvious choice - most I'm just glad cuz I easily could have seen this going the other way now then I had mentioned that he responded to my initial email and that I didn't want to bring it to my main channel but with all due respect to my patrons and channel members I'm going to show you that video right now keep in mind when I recorded this it was all very fresh and this is a bit of an emotional response to all of this in the initial video on my main channel I was calm and cool but after sitting on his email for a few days it was no I was done with that but even with all of this I still do not condone a witch hunt I do not condone anybody reaching out to him or harassing him on my behalf I still have not named dropped him and I will not do so even in the patreon video he's not willing to let this go and that should have been made clear to me by his email but it's [ __ ] thanks for the content this video was posted to my patreon on June 28th 2018 and now you will see the email from a man who is still in denial over a decade later enjoy hello my fellow patrons as always you get a free patreon video on me every month this month's winner was an email from an ex predator that was sent to me so if you've seen this video on my channel then you understand the context of this situation if you have not I recommend you do it'll make this video flow a lot smoother for you now then this predator issued me a copyright strike right so trying to be civil in the situation from here on out this is what I emailed him hello Blanc Blanc I'm the youtuber whose video you recently took down because of copyright infringement I'm assuming you're going off to five seconds of your music played in the video I just wanted to double check because nothing is really specified on youtubes end I just want to know how to avoid any copyright problems from here on out would appreciate a response ASAP if not understood thank you mr Gigi and I really didn't expect a response but surprise surprise little email hit my inbox from the legend himself by the way even though it's a patron only video I'm still not gonna reveal the guy's name because frankly [ __ ] this guy I know I took the mature path in my video but after reading his response no you can blow me but like I said I'm not gonna say his name I'm not gonna allude to anything that might give you an idea of who it might be I'm not even gonna give the guy a nickname or anything like that it's just I'm not gonna do it you know because stuff like that would just be childish let's go through it shall we Michael so you want me to tell you where the infringement was so you can remove it and repost your harassment of me from an incident that happened 12 years ago Yeah right has it ever occurred to you that there are real people on the other end of your taunts so clearly he's telling me to suck one in terms of telling me where the copyright issue was which wasn't really a big deal the video was reposted without your shitty music and I'm not gonna lie it when I first read this I felt kind of bad I have a video coming soon to probably my second channel where I'm gonna answer his last question in that paragraph where I'm gonna go in a great detail about how I feel about this series from all angles with this kind of stuff I can't talk about it here it's a whole video so let's move on fYI I never in my life have I put ok grammar hello fYI never in my life have I put an improper hand on any underage person and never will do not condone this if you were a victim of child abuse and this is why you post these things then my heart goes out to you no one should be abused as a child I raised two wonderful children now grown up and respect fully the rights of children to be loved unconditionally without abuse oh so you mean you just respect basic rights of people in general that what you're is that what you're boasting about here I don't think these people should be hurt well that's a good guy right there he's this guy he's a good guy he doesn't want people to be hurt you know we we need more people like this guy [ __ ] idiot listen buddy I don't doubt you've never done this every guy says it so clearly you're not lying either way that's not the point the point was that you were going to it was all documented for our viewing pleasure regardless of what you say you weren't gonna do we'll never know Dateline stopped you all I know is you said some dirty [ __ ] to a child and you showed up with a CDR of your slow jams oops sorry does that give it away I thought this person was an adult I stated so under oath after waiting almost four years to go to trial to state my innocence let me stop you right there Pablo that does not mean [ __ ] being under oath is so silly to me it's such an old witch trials tactic it's so [ __ ] outdated haha you can't lie because God's listening you know how many people aren't even religious nowadays even more important than that you know how many religious people don't want to go to prison I would say most the rest of the paragraph is a knee-slapper check this out why did I know she was an adult this was a combination of many factors in the conversation but most definitely because she called me for brief times I never called her she called me who is chasing after who for [ __ ] sake it doesn't matter dude it doesn't matter you have not learned [ __ ] if I'm at Wendy's and a 13 year old whispers in my ear that she wants to blow me in the parking lot be the adult and say no you weirdo I don't get it he's [ __ ] this dudes like 60 plus he's [ __ ] still so once again referring to the phone calls he says the first was an obviously high-pitched fake voice the latter three the day of the incident in a lower register typical of someone 25 to 30 years old she knew too actions well she spoke like an adult I am a musician and have a good ear I can tell the difference between an adult and someone underage so I just played along with it my bad my bad my bad guys she was doing the latter three so I was like okay so obviously isn't a kid this is the latter three you know latter your defense is [ __ ] and here's why you said the first call took place the day of the incident meaning all your dirty chat leading up to the day of the incident you didn't know this was an adult because you didn't hear that latter three just yet said about right do you see the problem here fYI this conversation took place in a Yahoo California room not on MySpace's incorrectly reported by NBC people in that room were mostly in their 30s 40s 50s some people the time poses underage to get a hot chat taboos make good hot chat to some people also it's kind of like a role-playing chat is it if you want to pretend to be jailbait in a chat room go write the [ __ ] ahead you creeps if you're two consenting adults do whatever the [ __ ] you want as long as you keep it between you two but here's a question if this was roleplay and you were expecting to meet an adult why were you so nervous and hesitant entering the house was it just regular jitters before a night together out with an adult was the adult supposed to keep making that kid voice the latter three when you walked in because she did were you still playing along at that point so referring to the hot chat he continues mine was a case of creative writing yes I do write mine was a case of creative writing yes I do right that's like Logan Paul's apology letter for the suicide forest where he was like I didn't do this for the views I get view this mine was a case of creative writing gone bad coupled with lust blinding judgment yes I made a mistake and I freely admit that but the motivation was to go check out someone who I thought was playing a daddy game and get laid not to actually be with an underaged person and this is where I call you on your [ __ ] you say you admit you made a mistake yet you spend this whole email defending what you did which one is it did you make a mistake or did you not this is the horse's mouth this is what I was thinking any other accusation is simply not true there was no underaged person and there was no victim we all know that that's because Dateline prevented but had there been a real child on the other end of that [ __ ] chat room there would have been a victim I have paid heavily for this mistake I was on probation for three years with a number of unannounced visits from the police perform community service for a hundred and twenty days took 52 classes and wound up on the sex offender list yeah that's what happens when you do something illegal I'm sorry there's a justice system my dude in addition I lost my career of over 30 years lost friends and was completely humiliated in front of family and friends yeah that's also a thing that happens when you do something illegal people tend to hear about it and you get judged for it because it's bad and you want to add to this you can't possibly humiliate a person more than I have been humiliated this was the only time in my life I have had a run-in with the law nothing before this nothing after like kind of getting your point kind of not because you specifically say I can't humiliate you more than you've been humiliated so she did that just like belittle my video completely it's making it like Oh gives a [ __ ] what this random kid on the internet saying pretty sure prison was worse in your family neglecting you right no you care about my video okay give it a rest Michael I have paid my debt to society many times over I've been trying to move on with my life ever since and now I have to answer to the court of YouTube for the first time in human history there is a mechanism the internet for harassing people 24/7 365 until the end of their lives this adds unnecessary and often overwhelming stress to people's lives who are trying to recover and move on especially those who have already experienced correction by the legal system politicians now realize this victims of revenge porn realizes people who had a friend video them in some uncompromising position at a party and posted it realize this if the worst day of your life was on video I'm sure you wouldn't want it broadcast forever people commit suicide over these things anybody with a past is gonna deal with it constantly being brought up people still call cobia rapists people still call Ray Lewis murder that [ __ ] gratata guy Bryan Silva people people still talk about him sucking man dick this is broken and that's whether the allegations are true or not people don't give a [ __ ] the internet doesn't give a [ __ ] is it right I'm not gonna say it is but you saying you have to answer to the court of YouTube is horseshit I mean obviously if you read my comments you're gonna find people who don't like predators who don't like the men who showed up to do what they were gonna do if anybody is actively trying to directly harass you and [ __ ] up your life I apologize I don't condone setting a witch-hunt to these guys although I'm aware in some viewers eyes I may indirectly like call for it I don't want it that's why when I reply to your copyright strike I made sure to say don't want attack this guy cuz then I knew everybody would think Oh daddy Gigi wants us to go [ __ ] this guy up no it's not what I wanted now did some people go on your music and talk [ __ ] yeah but it was so little people every other nasty comment that was on there was way before I even posted a video about you I don't make these videos wanting you to apologize to the Internet or pay your dues to society I do it strictly for entertainment purposes just like t kappa t kappa center tainment To Catch a Predator is entertainment it's serious subject matter but why do we all remember the show why is Chris Hansen a meme because it's entertaining it's entertainment we like laughing at pervy goofballs getting busted and that's the same energy I try to bring to my [ __ ] videos just laughing entertainment I'm not trying to [ __ ] make witch-hunts I'm not trying to ruin these guys lives again and although I know I can be maybe held accountable for like a domino effect with these videos it's not my intentions do you think that harassing people on YouTube will look good on your resume stop wasting your time Michael get a life and do something productive and please refrain from adding meteor targets I've already been through the wringer many times over and that my patrons is the email do I understand where this guy's coming from yeah do I think he's learned his lesson over a decade later No so [ __ ] you for copyright striking me and frankly suck one of age [ __ ] now that is a good ending to a video Touche if you guys enjoyed this video please leave a like and subscribe because I have more content coming your way shout out to all my new [ __ ] patrons you guys are insane thank you so much and shout out to the channel members as well and also shout out to Sunkist by ASI for retweeting my last video tweet as always I am mr.
