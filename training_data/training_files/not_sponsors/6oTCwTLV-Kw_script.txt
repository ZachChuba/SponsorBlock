okay so I spent the past few days living the 16 inch MacBook life I've tried the i7 and the i9 pretty extensively this is the base model i7 and the fully upgraded eye 9 in terms of CPU and GPU now I don't want to do a technical review of these devices I feel like there's just a way better conversation to be had instead of just you know a breakdown of the differences and good things and bad things about this product I will talk about a few things upfront in terms of things that can help you make a purchase decision first the i9 is worth it if you are someone whose workflow or application can actually take advantage of extra cores like the i9 has 2 extra cores over the 6 core i7 it's totally worth this year they have better thermal performance compared to the previous generation it's a worthy upgrade it doesn't have perfect thermals it does still have thermal limitations but it's significantly improved over what we saw last year and even better than what came out earlier this year in 2019 secondly the GPU the graphical performance of these new ambi chips is quite solid rounding some benchmarks you can just see that these new AMD 7 nanometer chips just it's a significant bump in performance compared to the Vega 20 from the previous generation so if you do anything that's graphically intense like video editing I would just spring for that GPU upgrade now when it comes to performance on MacBook Pros it's always been complicated this is why Apple designs their systems to run off of USB C charging very few devices out there do it these guys are the only company to do it with a high performance Intel chip so there's lots of laptops out there that use like weaker u processors Apple uses their H processors like the Intel H processors and they still power their entire system off of us PC it might seem insignificant but there's two advantages to that first it allows a device like this to be charged with any kind of us PC power delivery adapter so as long as there's enough wattage it can fill up the MacBook Pro however slow it might be secondly it also allows a device like this to work on an airplane power socket like so the socket you see on an airplane seat you can plug this thing up to it and it'll juice up your MacBook the vast majority of high performance laptops will not work if you plug it into an airplane socket that's just the way it is they pull too much wattage the socket doesn't do it now the disadvantage to having us PC charging on a device like this is that there's a limit as to how powerful the components can be inside the macbook pro a lot of people are like why doesn't Apple put in RTX 20/80 into their MacBook Pros it sounds great on paper but they would be a terrible idea because now this system could no longer run off of 100 watts so now this whole power system could not work they would have to have separate power systems it's not what people want it's not what Apple wants that's why they don't do it and that's also I'm happy that they use these AMD chips instead of a more powerful NVIDIA GPU because if you put in RTX or GTX anything inside here you could no longer power it off a 100 watt use BC charger it can't be done no one can do it so what Apple has actually created here is the world's most powerful laptop that uses use PC charging and for a lot of people that connection is very valuable ok the keyboard finally running scissor switches thank goodness Soho I mean I've been talking about this for years right from the beginning I'm actually someone that got used to how butterfly switches felt but the reliability just always bugs me and it's nice to see that it's finally gone to a really classic and universally loved scissor switch and it also has a physical Escape key which is fantastic and it's also nice to see the return of the inverted T for the arrow key cluster I always thought it was so weird that they switched off of this orientation for the arrow keys to something that was specific to the butterfly keyboards even though their other products that the IMAX still used this inverted T so it's nice to see them come back to this but hardware wise they did a really good job this year the speakers sound fantastic the microphones are good the thermal performance is much improved compared to the previous generation it's still not perfect but it's way better than anything they've had before in the thin MacBook Pro so I'm happy with it if there was like I mean there's a few things I don't love I wish it had Wi-Fi 6 basically every high-end laptop that came out this year supports Wi-Fi 6 this doesn't and also the webcam it's still running 720p it also doesn't have face ID which is it's not the end of the world but it would've been nice to see on a refresh like this but overall hardware's good including the 16 inch screen I haven't talked about it because it's really not that special it's a fantastic screen but what do you expect for a 16 inch MacBook Pro but over the past four years we've been as a community of technological enthusiasts we've been really tunnel visioned on the shortcomings of Apple's Hardware because this MacBook from 2016 to early 2019 just had limitations that shouldn't have been there but now that they fix the hardware I would like to address something that has always been an issue with Apple products and its value is the 16 inch MacBook Pro actually worth its money because this is a very expensive machine it starts at 23 24 hundred bucks and can go up quite high and in the past on my channel I have stated that if you were someone that wanted to buy a MacBook Pro for use with Adobe's creative applications that it wasn't a good option like to basically go with half a dozen other options out there that were cheaper and better performing instead of the MacBook Pro but that is no longer the case there Hardware this year is good their pricing is fair for an Apple product and most importantly the way that adobe has tweaked their software to work with this new hardware from Apple is it's good they finally made something that performs the way it should so if you're someone that held off the MacBook Pro because of unreliable keyboards or performance that wasn't up to snuff I think this year's model is on point and also because of like this is a new design right they're gonna use this chassis for several years they're gonna because they sunk a lot of money to make this thing happen so don't worry about this thing being renewed into some new model next year it's not gonna happen they're gonna use this shape for a while you're good okay hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs we liked it subs if you loved it see you guys next time [Music]
