[Music] flashback it's summer of 2012 I log on to YouTube before I was cute and popular I see a video it's from a guy named Frankie on PC in 1080p sniper killer I like snipers I click it to game I've never seen it looks crazy huge map lootable buildings survival mechanics in a zombie apocalypse except the zombies are only small fraction of the survival the real concern is that guy sitting on that hill in a bush in a ghillie suit holding a DMR ready to unleash his rampage on a freshly spawned man to feel the euphoria of murder I'm talking about Daisy and not the standalone version you may have seen on the steam store I'm talking about the original Daisy the ARMA 2 mod that took the world by storm in April 2012 inspiring the next generation of survival in battle royale games this mod done did things no mod ever done did 1 million players in four months and I was not one of those million players see this game was the coolest thing I'd ever seen i binge Devery Frankie on PC video I could multiple times just re-watching the immersive adventures that this game brought I just wanted to get a little taste of it see I had an imac i couldn't play arma i just had to watch from afar dreaming of one day entering this world the darkest times of my life and then a miracle I did all the research I could and discovered a little thing that Mac users called boot camp I was able to partition my harddrive and run a Windows machine on my iMac and I was finally able to play ARMA 2 I remember spawning in for the first time it was surreal mostly because I couldn't see anything ARMA 2 is incapable of optimising itself the resolution was completely unmatched post-processing blurr makes it look like you're underwater so my entire first hour was spent googling how to fix this goddamn game but I'll be honest I can barely remember what I did yesterday let alone eight years ago so I thought what better way to demonstrate how good this game was and go bad I read downloaded it got some pals fired it up [Music] you [Music] I'm straight what yeah you're you're heading right for the building holy [ __ ] Daisy technically has three classes of players you've got the survivor which is what you spawn in as and then you've got a choice to make who are you going to be for the vast majority of players you're gonna pick the bandit guy who kills everyone on site okay are you gonna happen a guy just came up and shot me it's a zombie apocalypse you've got a lot to worry about survival is key but also people have stuff I like stuff I'm gonna kill him and then you've got the heroes the admirable man who went out of their way to help new players survive no one really does that new player interactions are what made Daisy so unique because if you ran into someone there was this tension that never went away we kept getting killed at balota airfield it's one of the most populated areas in the game we found some of the only heroes left in existence space crayon eater and pickle Rick we agreed to meet up with these guys see how heroic they really were how do you rank up to a hero because we like to think of ourselves as heroes and we want to do what you do okay so for the hero rank here we go [Music] how long have you guys been on this server Gooden playing hey hey I start back at the March and before that was back in like 2012 yeah it's around the last time I played one of the higher rank to bandit faith JOHN CARTER taking fire already I [ __ ] hate John Carter talk about a box-office bomb huh so this is one of our pieces holy crap dude payback not just fancy if necessary bro you guys will learn why come on in literally take whatever you guys got in here huh we hiding in there I know that's just a a wall of concealment we're the latter it goes to the nicer stuff down below yeah I got the eye for things like that if I was a bad guy that's the place I'd be looking is behind that [ __ ] concrete thing right there well you can't blow them open oh wait let me try do you want to join our Dysport Oh what what the hell is a discord wait we're on Ventrilo right now are you talking about like a voice thing I know we're very compatible your sister yeah I'm on Windows Vista I think

just be ready bogey 12:00 o'clock we've got a [ __ ] mountain goat looking at us I've got my hand on the joystick I really hope that's okay I like to pretend like I'm playing an Atari go ahead Papa he's playing with an Xbox controller uh more power to him I mean I didn't know this game could really do well with that I can't leader it works pretty well startin the backbone of the same I'm throwing up adalah thumbsticks he'll play Counter Strike global Offensive with an Xbox control and he gets mad me please competitive very smash of the controller what are we looking for yeah you're just screaming Adam nice point boy next see that the helicopter could talk what do you think it would say helicopter would just say Oh God my feelings to you pickle Rick oh I'm starting to catch

on steam will be able to get you on discord so that way we all could talk without having to hold the catwalk no we'll find you John Carter and you'll pay for what you've done let me try let me try did take out the car I Drive and realize you got like a Prius No visibly van I don't know all right I got a log now cuz I'm tired and I gotta wake up for work happy Father's Day I'll be around dad oh the proximity voice is hilarious with the 8 bit [ __ ] sound that tension between strangers the goofy interactions you're on your toes the entire time at any point you can lose everything these two fellas were great they're true heroes of dayz I like your little round glasses over there thank you I can't see I also just realized I didn't take that rat off of my OBS from streaming it's just Remy with a fire tiara I'll probably crop the scene make sure that's not just City maybe I won't maybe he just stayed there I don't know they only goes backwards that's the only way I Drive nitros on should fly out of nowhere oh it's almost like we're teleporting like every five feet or so like that's what it looks like for me after about a day on that server we went and found a fresh start Oh how's my golden revolver look holy [ __ ] oh my god [Music] see the zombies in dayz are interesting they come off as pretty terrifying at first because of two things one they run the idea of zombies is a shitty thing dead people mindlessly wandering around looking disgusting and decayed their only objective is to just bite real people and zombies are generally thought of as these walking wobbling disgusting things that you kind of just want to you know not go near when they're walking that's cool just go around it but in dayz when you get close to one of these wobbling [ __ ] every single one of them quickly demonstrates that not only can they run they all competed in track and field in high school and won like every competition the second you get close to these guys they let you know they usually beeline away from you to gain momentum and then sprint full force with nothing but very rude intentions which leads me to the second reason that they're terrifying I want you to listen to this for a second and tell me how you feel I don't know what kind of person was able to generate that sound with their mouth but I hate it and that sound has layers to it because not only are you now getting chased now you're exposed because the best way to know that somebody is sneaking around is by seeing one of these zombies go berserk luckily the mechanics of ARMA 2 are the saving grace of survival idiot people expanded on the dayz mod' it was mods of mods the one we delved into was called epoch I was kind of just doing everything I mean I was I was fishing I was wood cutting started to feel like I was playing a different game the most fun part of these servers were the AI missions there's AI at these locations to take them out and there's usually like a loot crate at the end you know we we just tried it out a few times okay oh my god I got a headshot oh my god from 90 meters one shot oh my god dude if so many cars to six you can't wait oh my god they have a ghillie guy one of the man's like a giant shovel on his back or something what I know is it can't tell if I'm even getting close that ghillie guy oh I shot him right in the dick oh my god what was on your face just now
