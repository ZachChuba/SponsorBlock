YooJung: Hello, Kiki! The last filming day of [Cast: The Golden Age Of Insiders] Kiki, kiki, Kiki cam~ It's my last day of filming. (The joyful filming site will be released~) This is SooMin. SunYoung: Ki-Ling, I'm SunYoung who plays SooMin. YooJung: Where are we going? SunYoung: To eat Jjam-Ppong. (They became one by Jjam-Ppong) SunYoung: Jjam-Ppong with YooJung! (Expressing she is Ki-Ling) YooJung: SunYoung is real 'Ki-Ling'. Anyways, we are going to eat Jjam-Ppong. SunYoung: Bye bye~ (A filming site full of their high tension) (The bugs have gathered near the lighting)  (YooJung struggling with the bugs) (YooJung_Shadow Boxing_vs_Bugs.mp4) YooJung: I want to spray pesticide too. (I'm not going to leave any of them alive) (YooJung getting in a mood as soon as the filming starts) (Great_Actor_YooJung.mp4)  YooJung: Please introduce yourself. HwiCheol: I'm HwiCheol who plays HyungRae. I'm practicing some dances occasionally. (Real 'Ki-Ling' number 2) YooJung: Start! (A sudden check of 'Picky Picky' dance) YooJung: You did not even see our video. After asking my manager, I'll give a dance lecture to you. (Camera) (Being tossed) (Short lecture of 'Picky Picky' dance) YooJung: Yes, that's right. One two... Good. (A sudden 'DAZZLE DAZZLE' dancing) YooJung: Oh. That's... (This time, a short lecture of 'DAZZLE DAZZLE' dance) (A broken 'DAZZLE DAZZLE' dance)  HwiCheol: This part is so fast... YooJung: You have to raise your arms like this. (Meaningless dancing skills despite the one-point lesson) (Another broken 'DAZZLE DAZZLE' dance)  HwiCheol: I'm not this bad usually.  YooJung: You mean it? (YooJung teacher teaching the dance step by step again) HwiCheol: You should have taught me those points. YooJung: You are the one who did whatever you wanted to. You are not a bad dancer.  (You can do it too) (His dancing is improving(?) by YooJung's lecture) YooJung: Three, four ... Yes! (Reset) YooJung: Just do it like this. DAZZLE DAZZLE.  (Success!) (A voice calling 'Kiki') YooJung: Say 'hi' to the camera please. (Self-introduction of staff members) (YooJung getting a lot of love from staff members) YooJung: Good. (A sudden interview time with SunYoung) SunYoung: I'll ask you some questions. What's your most memorable scene? (YooJung becomes happy by just thinking of 'Cast') YooJung: First, the crying scene I took today, and there is a scene I took with SooMin (= SunYoung). It's a scene which we sat on a bench and had a talk. SunYoung: I'm SooMin.  (SooMin_is_real_'Ki-Ling') YooJung: I like that scene too. 
(A cute reply from YooJung for SunYoung who is 'Ki-Ling') (YooJung playing alone due to the delay) YooJung! (How to use the waiting time 1.mp4) (Sending her heart) (How to use the waiting time 2.mp4) (YooJung is surprised) YooJung: I'm not showing in the camera now, right? (How to use the waiting time 3.mp4) (A disaster brought on by being overly engaged) (YooJung is back to YooKyung again) Okay, we will go with this one. (Interview back again) SunYoung: This is a second question. What is your most memorable episode? YooJung: There were too many bugs, and I was trying to get in the mood. So I took a deep breath seriously looking at SunYoung's hand. And she was doing like this to get the flies out. It was so funny but I managed to hold in my laughter. HwiCheol's word of 'Im YooKyung, you are so charming' was funny. It was impressive. SunYoung: How much is the synchronization of YooJung and YooKyung? YooKyung is somewhat delicate and somewhat annoying type. And I'm somewhat like her. SunYoung: Are you an annoying type? YooJung: Yes, because I am sensitive,  and in the past, I used to compare myself to others  and asked myself 'why am I like this?' YooJung these days got more confidence compared to YooKyung. Also, like YooKyung found herself, I found myself too. SunYoung: That's a real insider.  YooJung: Yes. This is a real insider. (A deep insight of real insiders) SunYoung: If you say a word to YooKyung, what would you say? YooJung: YooKyung, you are so precious just by your existence, and you deserve to be loved. Don't compare yourself to others.  Love your inner side and value yourself. SunYoung: What would you like to say to precious Ki-Ling? YooJung: Ki-Ling, I'm YooJung. Thanks you for giving me strength to film. Thanks to Ki-Ling, I could finish the shooting well.  Thank you for your support. I'll try hard to show various aspects, so look forward to me. Please be with me like now. Fighting. I love you. (#Surprise) (#A_moving_moment) Congratulations for having a leading role ~ â™ª (A surprise for YooJung who worked hard) YooJung: What are all these? (Video is not playing on a repeat) YooJung: I think I might cry. This is so sweet. (YooJung trying to calm down) (YooJung crying) YooJung: Well, today is the last filming day. I had concerns about 'acting' for the first time, and I thought about whether I would be able to do this,  but during the filming, I thought I made a perfect choice of doing it. With such good people and great memories,  I was so happy that I could have such great experience. All the staff members and actors, thank you so much. Thank you for loving YooJung so much.
