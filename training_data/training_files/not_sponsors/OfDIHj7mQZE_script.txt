[Waiting room in Hong Kong, UMJI is holding her self-cam.] Why is this camera here? Oh my I want some steamed egg. I want to eat some steamed egg. She wants to eat some steamed egg. SINB. Steamed egg~ Spray~ Want some? No, I'm fine. My fringes are so messy. [Admiring UMJI's marvelous features.] Time to fix my lips~ I originally planned to use an apricot color But I've just decided to apply it on the insides. My lips are finished~ - I'll fix your mascara once, alright?
- Okay~ Wow~ UMJI acting all cute holding your self-cam~ Hey, I can't act like that right now. Because I'm getting my mascara fixed. I don't think this video will be shown. [But surprisingly it was so pretty that we had to show this video.]
- That's it? Wait Ah I want some steamed egg! She wants some steamed egg, everybody. Let's see if you're pretty. You are pretty [A pretty girl is filming another pretty girl who is next to a pretty girl.]
Even though the lights aren't nice, you look pretty. How can this be? - Because the person who is filming has a pretty heart and face..
- How is this possible? Wow so pretty! Wow! Look at that.. Really, even without lights, you're so pretty. Really? Thanks. - Let's see~ Your face looks really balanced. I mean... What I thought was, - Uh huh.
- Very posh. Oh~ You mean yourself? No! I mean the one who is filming. Oh really? Today you two look very posh as well What's the most posh point for today? The most posh point is, This natural hairstyle. - It looks like I did nothing to my hair.
- But honestly I like your hair length very much. - That's right!
- Oh this? - Yeah.
- It's pretty. I liked it better when it was shorter than this. I told you then. When we were promoting 'Flower' - That length was so pretty..
- But when I saw my full body as a whole, my hair length was too long.. - That's what's cool.
- Yeah. - But I still like this length also.
- Yeah. UMJI's number 1! Congratulations~ Excuse me! Number 2! [Suddenly she is called as number two lol]
She's not number 2 Why am I number two? - I picked you as number 1 for who I'd want to stay with in a desert island.
- Oh~ What did I tell you the reason why I picked you as number 1 was? - Why would I like to go to a desert island with YUJU?
- The reason is because I have a strong life force - You learned well..
- And even in bad situations - I have a positive energy to change that into laughter.
- Nicely done! Nicely done! [Proud]
- It must have been memorable.
- Really you said.. You said it correctly. For example, even when waves show up, others would be in despair - But I would play like I'm in Disneyland..
- That's what you... - That's an example you gave at the end.
- That's right. Now I'll go for another interview.. Oh it's really heavy.
