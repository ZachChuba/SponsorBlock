ladies and gentlemen welcome to be map this is amazing and I am so excited and I can't wait for everyone to see how silly you look not me what just like you I haven't looked at you turn around Wow it's amazing it's so good it's so yeah dude I have been asking for a bee map ever since the first 1.15 B snapshot hen's I'd the man the myth the legend making it happen making it a reality so here we are and I'm excited as always discount off your first month of server hosting and you can do things like play B maps out do you sting me why do you see you cause you stink get care okay that's right then don't work no I didn't know at all I forget I forget the direction God dang it oh right here it all blends in together it does blend in now entering the hi I can't wait I can't wait I want oh that's where I am myself [Laughter] nothing you have to worry about it's it's all fine okay so so these are bees in Minecraft which I haven't dealt with I can't believe nice bees do unless you punch them then they get mean red eyes dude and it's bad so gold swooped at me gold plates turn on bridges of their color iron plates turn off bridges of their color and their color is the surrounding bounties block yeah so alright oh and it is a two-player specific map so requires both of us to think together so we're never gonna pass this so now you get to bring me over right you to bring me over right you know on the on the one that responds the bridges presumably it oh you just break yeah it's chill don't worry oh oh that was that was level zero a play dude have you have you experienced honey blocks I have no idea what they do dude check it check it check it so you see over here I could jump to this and it'll slow my descent and then I don't take fall damage on the bottom honey blocks are dope they're the dopest they're the best disc okay where are we trying to get to there's my overwhelming amount of information here there's a lot going on right now okay there's do it can you bounce it bounce off hook okay no you can't bounce off slime unfortunate oh this is over here okay so read there now I've created a red somewhere yeah it's uh it's across from the red dispensers and so now I can get over to here and I can activate blue okay so it whenever you activate a new one its senses what I add I undid the red one oh you undid red yeah yeah yeah Oh open for me so I think I can Oh does that mean does that mean that - no no no blue is over here and it leads us to wait wait wait do we want to deactivate blue don't don't don't do it yet do we want to activate green yeah okay so blue will stay on I don't think you were supposed to get down I think you need to go be up with red oh because the whole two-player thing right yeah yeah I was like why are you coming back down but then I'm just gonna roll with it but yeah no I think you I think yeah but is there a reason that red had to be deactivated no exactly so I could go oh no you need to deactivate green can you deactivate green for me no don't deactivate red turn red back on okay then well then we got out of don't deactivate green I just I said just deactivate red okay leave green turn red now okay okay and done okay now deactivate green without doing anything else don't deactivate anything but greed you think this is so much easier than you think then did it you did okay now I can do yellow what does yellow do nothing over here that I can see I'm trapped by oh no there's that okay if yellow is unlocked anything because I have a deactivate on yellow up here and I feel like that okay I kind of have got a spot on yellow I need green turn back on okay so you need you need to work your way to green but yellow is fine for now don't need to have it deactivated I I'm on a safe block so you can deactivate yellow oh okay well now I can't get back up to yellow but hopefully it's not a big deal okay so I actually yellow needed to be deactivated too because fine you specifically said it's fine after you fell okay come back to the very beginning okay all right all the key here is communication okay so red red needs to deactivate red all right so turn on red for me and then go do green yeah yeah wait I can't maybe I can I can't I can't get back over you have to go turn on green okay sure thing cool can do I can't get over that okay yeah Green is on so now I can get over there and you want register okay yeah okay now you can turn off green for me you won't you want green green and green only turned off yeah yeah okay there's green okay now now turning on yellow uh-huh go do your yellow thing and just tell me when yellow can be deactivated uh yellow can be deactivated okay sweet now I need green on all right I can do that for you I can do that for you I'm out here dude I am turning green on boom okay and then this apparently turns blue off yeah I think it unlocked well we needed to sweet can you can I get back to blue from where I am uh what do I need to what do I mean I guess I guess this is the only thing you're fine you just run back and go up the staircase all right sure yeah okay because we have new diamonds very cool and then that resets everything okay level two so the diamonds are our final goal dude it's crazy what happens this is a true-to-life reenactment of what takes place inside of a beehive they're all just yeah just trying to figure out the puzzles dude that's all it is and they just do you know what blue turned on yeah it turned on this right here and I can now turn on red from it and now I can turn on blue okay yellow lets me get over here and now I'm back out here with blue still on that doesn't do anything let's see is this where you are up here I'm up here yeah yeah okay but there's got it so I wonder if we can get up to there's got way something Oh clever I didn't see that I need red off I can do that for you I couldn't do that and then then I read back on yeah can I do this jump or do I just I just have to go back around okay it's fine I can do this I can do this I know how high it was how dare you disrespect me like that I can turn green on nice that green means go so I'm gonna go and then I can go over here ooh but then any green off and yeah nice and then a green on green on yeah yeah dude and then and then okay this can turn yellow yellow off yes we do oh okay and that finishes us oh that's what I'm talking about the plays are strong where's that diamond exit it's an excellent question when I don't know the answer to i I did see it at a place oh it's over here yeah we can access it there's gonna be a level though oh he did it he did it he did it you want it you want a cruise you want cruise here what is this huh it's the best sound ooh isn't it good lovely your face just want to look at your face man that's the third time today you've said that to me only your face dude it's his face that's a face look at that red look at that red go turn on I didn't do anything I was already across the thing are you follow it's easy enough to just get back up there I can fix this there we go keep it okay wait hello yes are you experiencing conundrum right now okay get ready to hit read it in in three two one go nope you really [Music] surprised roles for her roles yeah okay okay okay break the red all right yeah three two one go nice oh wait oh no wait can I can get up here though right yeah okay cool so now uh break red and now run back and turn on red oh wait wait I might be able to can I make this jump I don't think I make this jump I might need I'm yeah I think I need Fred back on cool it's just a lot of running back and forth you know it's not a big deal not a big deal there you go ah yes that is good okay so now I have the ability to turn on red so you might want to go and wait where do we go from here is the question oh right they go to blue yes oh my goodness that's a lot of blues and reds oh and I could turn off red from here there's not much going on down here I think the this map the way this looks is it's mostly sending you across the way and working but I don't know I can turn on green green green on would be good hold up wait is there stuff there's a lot of stuff happening a lot going on yeah there are a lot of bees the bees were trying to guide the way dude I just have to listen to the bees oh oh can you wait oh god I don't know if that's what I want do I want that mm no I'm just wondering if I want to turn on green or do I want to turn off red can you toggle red real quick turn it off okay now if I turn on green how would I do that oh I don't know how I would do that that's so there's a lot happening right now it's overwhelming my senses wait there is a blue that stretches like way across there is that something important hold on no I can't get over there though holy cannoli I know that you now get over here it feels like I should be somewhere it does feel like you should be somewhere but I don't know where exactly cuz there's like a lot happening didn't you say that you had the opportunity to turn on red yes maybe it's I'm supposed to come up there with you and we need to do the jump again so I do with it Oh probably nice and then okay you do all right and you count down three two one go nice and now but now we need to turn it off Oh Oh which I can do I can do oh okay that works too but I can turn it off over here so we're good okay and then turn back home for you turn it back on yeah wait where is it oh it's back over here hold on hold on I think I'm red right there wait oh yes but problem is how I get there can you not jump onto the black uh I don't mm I don't think I can do that I don't think I can do that you might be it can you do it no not even if you were good could I could I do it I don't that might be too hard I mean I'm not sure it's a fight it's a four-block it's a four block but it's one over which I don't know if that's possible oh my god dude oh my god oh boy there's is this green is what green no that's just a black block which I don't think there's a dispenser here which I would be able to jump up Oh lost here okay I did not realize that I can I can do that for you I can do that that's an iron not a yeah I can do that for you okay that I didn't do anything because I died it turns green is on is this a yellow maybe it's a yellow maybe it's a yellow huh Oh God I don't think I can make that jump I will I'll try though I'll try and get us back to square one cool sorry it's - you need to step back oh yeah two one go nice okay and now I jump over to here and now I need to have red turned off which you can do if you go over to other place okay so that turns off red boy but how do do you God good day there's got to be something to this freaking thing right here but I don't know what it is okay something round in black square what is it though I don't know the answer I have to find out it is my desk zine how did what cuz I par chord you know what why don't you put me in a park or oh my god okay I need red turned on which it is now and I need if we need to do a timed red turned off so at three two one off oh my god you did it perfectly and I jumped over in screwed up but you nailed it so turn red red on red on I can't do that Dave [Laughter] [Music] well okay can you you can come up here right uh-huh yeah come take a look at this yeah this is the whole conundrum that I was facing I mean it's not that conundrum is we just gotta be able to do it because it's read that read under here and then on to black and then but you know order to jump from red to black II need to have red turned off and then we turned green on here and turn green on and then we need to turn red back on and then jump to the blue and then wait but that means I have to make that oh my god that parkour jump must be able to be made both ways oh my god oh my god he would he would go and do that main parkour jump that's so mean that resets both of us if I fail it wait wait okay sorry I can't believe you done this to us so if we got to wait Green was on then I could jump over and then go over to the thing and then I don't know where yellow is but yeah I would have been know hypothetically would have been great oh why the black block is there wait wait but really he's saying the black block is there but it's supposed to not be a possible jump I just I just out parkour the mapmaker oh my god dude this is legendary now I have to do it again yeah and I have to do it again you're amazing absolutely legendary hold on here we go dude I got a freaking aah God dang it okay there we go did it again okay sick we out here at I got you though don't worry cuz I can come over there probably maybe alright and then I can I don't is there a black one to disable the black but either way we can do the green disablement yeah so I need green turned off yep I can do that for you there we go and then I need green turned on okay I can do that for you thank you and then this allows me to get to here which turns off yellow turns off yellow but yellow is not on anywhere and then I can come down over here and yellow like if if yellow we're on that be useful but it's not so this none of this is useful okay but if we turn off blue I could get up there I think okay we need to turn off blue and then turn off red I'm gonna be able to go way up I can do both of those things okay I mean we might as well give it a try be able to get to a new part of the map so blue off first done and then red needs to go off hmm okay don't mess this jump up ya idiot no beat get out of the way B it's frickin bees in the way on this jacket okay we're good now can you turn on red if I drop down back to the original spot well I mean let's access a new part of the map we might as well alright ah blue eye blue over here oh we win that unlocked something I think thank God we have to we have to get up to there I think the the door is up the yellow oh boy is it yeah I think we redo like now that we've unlocked that we don't go back up right and and and so we kind of work our way back because I think that yellow my guess is that it's over in that corner by that across the green at the very corner I wish I had zoom to be able to look over there but it would make sense the question okay so we have to do the coordinated like green red thing that resets us if we don't get it so yeah okay so so let me see how am I gonna get you up there my mate I guess I'll head on over to here and yeah okay who you might have to do a little parkour action though no no no oh it's okay I think I messed it up anyway so I'll go back to the beginning and I can do the parkour it's fine okay so so red is on and I need green off okay so you need to ring off and now I will now at the time a red turn off so that's where do you have a David regulate I have a red disable medicai we have to just we have to time this and it's got to be right okay so you're gonna go on go right right three two one go and I'll jump oh why did you do it like you were actually doing a countdown we didn't need to rehearse counting down numbers I know how that works okay I see I see where we made a mistake and I I'm gonna be honest that one was on me I'll take I'll take that okay and we wait wherewhere do we turn off blue uh blue is that island that I was on when I screwed us all over the first couple of times oh right it's yeah over there mhm mhm because I was gonna say one of us could at least like stay up but mmm we're good at this yep all right I'm gonna try I'm gonna try it parkour again here we go here here we here we go whoo oh my god I made it that hen Zoid say why is that block there if you're not supposed to parkour it okay so we're gonna do a red so no practice countdowns you're gonna go on go and it's good when you countdown it's a real countdown okay are we good I'm ready all right three two one go Oh nuts rip okay well I guess I try the parkour again see if it works good luck okay oh my god I'm so good nice nice okay green which I can do all right here we go here we go did I did was I too early too late we did I it was a little late okay um all right all right three two one go oh we did it oh snap here it's really oh god we got to do it we have to do it again with red turning on make the parkour jump oh my god no pressure and then there's gonna be one more cycle after that of the same I think red oh wait no I missed the jump but I can't wait I can turn on red I can turn on red from the start yeah yeah okay okay oh yeah and if you're at the starting platform then you should we should be able to do it we're good we're good great alright three two one go nice nice nice okay and now it's gonna be off no no I'm not hitting anything I'm just I'm gonna tell me what why are these bees in my way all right I can turn yellow on oh my goodness you did it alright I really have no idea what the the black ones are for wait but Green is off now and you needed green to get over to the pot I can wear yellow is there a fine I can fix that okay okay I can fix that I'm still down here and I don't know if that's gonna screw us I don't think so okay okay so if the yellow is on and then I can come over here okay I mean it's swinging off but I can I can do that yeah and now green is off but you you need to let me over probably or does it Matt does does it not matter oh yeah cuz I need green I need green to be on from here yeah but it's okay because red is on so you can you can go back you can even let me over because now we have your where am i where am I going uh justjust head over to the the one over here the one over here where the red on is all right this is good times we got this alright and three two one go nice and now I come oh wow dude it just lets me over that's an amazing revelation okay no Tarnoff II just in case and then we need to go have green turned on oh right I'll hit you up with that dude green means go okay and then I can go over here yellow is on so I can come up here and I can turn yellow on and off and I see the exit but wait what's all this Hey okay okay yellow is blocking me right now so I can turn yellow is there a way for me to get somewhere oh maybe you can disable I'm I'm working towards a green yeah probably wait but no you need to be up here too how the hell am I supposed to get you up here what how does things escalate this far between 2:00 and 3:00 okay so basically you've got or one of us has to do that and get across this green going over cuz that turns on a green as well holy sweet mother of God so we maybe you have a red toggle no I don't have anything up here except for yellow so I'll have to go back to red and send you across like I did I don't know what's the difference though of what so I was wait there's a red over there what is that red that's the red that you walked on and you turned blue or you unlock the Oh God oh there's a blow line there's a blues blue gets me across over to you there's another one over there Jesus man wait was there um Hey oh wait can you can you go back to this green one there's another there's a pressure plate yeah yeah what's what are you talking about what's up just right here what can I help with mm-hmm all right so red and then uh so you're gonna disable red thread and you jump onto the black one okay so I turn red back on but you need to then there's a second jump after that right yeah I just like what am i doing differently than what you you've already been up here that's all my but I didn't I went down and I didn't take the green across and so that's where a crossed gotcha so that's where okay I think the difference is okay so turn off red in three two one go okay got it and then I need to turn red on them yep okay but this is it where will it knock you off if once that turns on so you got a it will I have to be midair yeah yeah all right I'm ready in three two one go okay you got it and now let's see up here freakin bees are there two quotes that's where I yell about the bees okay let's see yellow is on and we want yes we want yellow on actually yellow isn't done right now so turn it on oh okay oh no but green I Green is not toggleable right now and we need green on if I'm gonna make it over to that other spot yeah I think it had to be it had to be doing the the jump back info way oh no cuz yeah if I go down then that yellow turn is a way for me to get over places yeah actually yeah yellow did turn on way to go across to where that that is a green toggle I think over there I do see I do see a new bar for yellow that we didn't have before or okay I think the bad thing yeah I think I come down now I don't think there's a way to get across to that corner from here unless we plate does turn green oh yeah you need to take the yellow over there mm-hmm so we need to work with the yellow somehow to get across yeah okay okay so how do I get on to yellow is the question there's a red oh so we needed red on so you go back all the way to where I was when I fell and then you'll take red across and so this one right above me is what I didn't what I didn't have him what I didn't okay so but I need green to be toggled in order to be able to get to yellow right and so I've got to get up there well uh mm unless I can make the jump unless I can make a jump well you you can turn oh I can go I can go back right now okay yeah cool all right you so I turned that off yeah and you turn red on countdown oh all right three two one go and then because yellows here now I can get up here with okay cool so now so I was good good there these are just blues that are already on so now we need to turn green on which is where green keep going oh right greens right over here now I'm gonna investigate this other side that you didn't go to before as well so this is this is a that's a yellow toggle right here that's yellow yeah okay we're not gonna want to hit that yeah of course okay so I'm gonna go over to there oh that's why okay so that's the problem is there a green toggle up here there's a yellow there's a green on at toggle and that's what's in the corner the problem is we need to have green I almost I need to be able to disable yellow and then turn yellow on is the thing cuz that's that's why I can't get across let's see we both yeah we both need to be you have a toggle up there for both yellow on and off right well yes but if I turn off yellow right now and I go across I can't go any further I need yellow to be toggled back on so it's like there needs to be either you need to go all the way back there to the turn yellow back on okay and then I come over there how a good point greens on and I can't get to agree maybe I mean I guess I don't need green on I know but you need did I drop you no no no but I'm saying like you can't God dang it dude God dang it's okay don't worry I can fix this oh I can't I can't believe you've done this I can make this I can make this no I can't well this this means we keep yellow on okay and we and we just do another I mean you'd be jumping up to where I'm coming back I'm coming back so we have green on we have yellow on wait okay is there a disabled for the black I don't think there is okay I think black is just permanent permanently okay so disabled green and basically you need to get up there without me falling back down I need to make the jump every single time yeah cuz we figured we figured that out we figured that out because remember there's the yellow block now that's on so as long as like we came back down and that doesn't that doesn't that doesn't do it no doesn't do it so I just have to make it every time you like it cool cool okay all right so three newts me off alrighty and yeah so it does help and here's why I thought that okay so anyway that's hence attends oh it's a in there so red needs to go off right yeah but in time yeah of course but I was just read off as the next step so right alright give me a countdown you can jump from the blue on platform to the flat area with the yellow booster yellow blue on platform okay so I see that - the flat area with the yellow booster okay so I think that's he's talking about oh I almost punched you he's talking about this platform right over the the know the okay blue on platform - OH / - there see in turn red back on so you turn red off and then you so he's saying he's saying over this way I think and what oh oh okay right right right because I see I see okay I get it that makes sense now that yellow is activated okay cool so basically you just have to do things twice and it creates a subtle difference all right or several dozen times in okay you know we have to do this we had to do that section twice okay here we go let's do it okay ready to turn right off yep three two one go nice done okay hey ray turn right on uh yep absolutely okay do not mess this one up okay good good good much easier much easier all right so read on is the next one yep okay okay ready 3 2 1 go made it nice and then it's a read off again yeah no hang on yeah it's gonna be read off okay I'm ready to go three two one up okay made it cool all right let's hope I make it okay good good all righty all right you set yep three two one on nice all right and is it off again I know no no and then yellow turns on and then yellow was on reap so I'll turn on great I don't but we need green on now huh I can do this I can do this okay I can make that happen this is what we needed there we go okay all right we're all good I can't believe you've done this wait are you stuck no well I mean I got a I gotta make this jump right okay I mean that's it's a pretty straightforward jump I believed in you okay okay that's green back so if now we need you what are we what are we doing now I need yellow off wait oh no no no no no so that's why you have green on nope oh oh so I turn my ring off and now I come over here that's where we're at okay yeah yeah and now green on three green on yep okay oh my god we did it and now I have a yellow toggle to bring you over to the yellow off oh yes oh my goodness well that was easy whoa I just didn't expect that we had to do that part over there twice in order to make the map work Oh oh my god oh my god I think we stand on a pressure plate each probably we did it we did it okay the Queen Bee offers you her eternal gratitude do you accept for yes take the right door for no take why would we not accept you not take gratitude gratitude seems like a right door then right yeah dude yeah I want the Queen B's gratitude what if it's
