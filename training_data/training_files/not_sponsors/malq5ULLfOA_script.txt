let's see what the card does around this bit shall we so it's going it's crossed oh it's across the lane it's crossed the lane and it's still going welcome back everybody to tesla driver i hope you're doing very well and i hope you've been okay during this lockdown period i haven't been able to record obviously but now i am able to record because we're able to go out and drive for a lot more reasons and i can now film my journey so today what i thought i would do is show you how is autopilot and full self drive currently acting in 2020 we haven't driven it for a couple of months now and uh there have actually been a couple of updates now in america there is a new update floating around where it will stop and start at traffic lights for you which is really cool but also the animations have now changed so the animations for people and for bikes and stuff have changed in america and it actually gives the person on screen a direction of travel and it smoothly animates their legs and stuff it looks pretty cool sadly we don't have it here but obviously as soon as we get it i'll make sure to show it to you now this is a journey i've done quite a lot on autopilot before actually it was one of my first videos i ever did on the channel in the tesla model x if you want to go back and compare it and we're gonna see how does it compare now obviously we've got four self-drive visualization so you could see there the arrows on the road were looking really good uh it's showing the double lines as well there which is working really well and we can bring it up a lot faster previously i could never go over 40 down this road and it do it okay whereas now i can actually go at the full 60 speed limit if i wanted to and it would do it absolutely fine this is always a big issue for it it's kind of a tightish bend going up a hill and the car previously used to dart around a little bit but as you can see now absolutely no problems at all showing the cards on the other side of the road as well actually showing them nice and early as well i have noticed that it seems to be picking up a lot more stuff on the visualization this can be interesting the car breaking nicely okay so it came down to 30 there so we lost 20 miles an hour it was quite a hard break but it was definitely the sort of break it needed to do to make sure we were safe there so this bits actually changed since the first drive you can see now it's a 50 here whereas before this used to be a 60 all the way through so you can see the car doesn't change its mind it still says it's a 60 that's because it's still not picking up these road signs ahead of us and it's just going with what the gps says and again previously here this never never did this area now you can see that the pavement's quite tight and everything here it used to get way too close to the pavement and it actually used to dart in here let's see if it does it no you can see now it doesn't do that at all and it brings us through really safely so all they need to update on that bit is the speed limit and to be able to pick up these new active speed limits which apparently elon tweeted previously that they have almost got sorted and here's a really big one guys elon tweeted this morning that he expects for self drive to be valued at a hundred thousand pounds when the full version comes out it's currently on sale at like four or five thousand pounds and he's trying to say that that will be worth a hundred thousand pounds when the system is complete so so far so good this bit of road absolutely no problems i wouldn't have had to bring it off myself here at all um oh interesting okay so we're now going on to a road with no road markings and let's see how the car fares with this it's done this road loads and loads of times before so it shouldn't have a problem with it absolutely no problem look at this this is doing it really well i've got my hand on the wheel just in case but that has done this incredibly well and it's sticking to the left-hand side with with no i'm not even worried about it at all but obviously we're coming up to a roundabout so i'm gonna have to take control myself let's see what it does here then so we've got some we've got some pylons in the middle of the road that i assume it's gonna think of cones yeah you can see it's thinking of them as cones there and then what's it gonna do here we do we don't have right away but we should go around this pole and you can see absolutely not gonna happen there that is yeah that is still something so again even though there's cones there the car not slowing down for it yet it's it didn't see that at all it did not see that at all and it was just happily driving me into it which is uh really quite bad actually i'm having to take control here as well because there's no lines on the road and now it says it will drive but i'm not too confident here i'm thinking it's going to break oh okay well actually we went to the right hand side of the road there so you can see as soon as we get off the kind of main roads we start having problems again uh but this is something that this car is gonna have to work itself around one day is roads like this with lorries on them this corner here used to be a little bit too much for the car so when it previously went around this corner it did break on and off so if we go under 49 i'll be getting the same kind of experience but currently it's actually sticking at 49. oh we've got something crossing the road no squirrel oh god it darted back thank god for that so no problems there the road does split here into two so let's see i assume it's going to pick the right hand side it has picked the right hand side which is quite good because that guy was on and off the road on his uh lawnmower and i don't think he even realized so here we go again it's not breaking for any of these for me uh in the uk yet it's not bothered by the traffic lights it's literally just showing them i'm gonna bring it down to 25 and let's see let's see what the car does around this bit shall we so it's going it's crossed oh it's across the lane it's crossed the lane and it's still going okay i'm just gonna put my hand on oh okay it's slowing down it's trying to go left so sorry right it was trying to go right down there but we actually want to keep on going straight on so it crossed the lane there without me saying i actually did keep my foot on the accelerator because i i felt that the car was gonna stop so i thought let's keep it going again a nice tight corner but you can see it's slightly swinging out a little bit too wide there so i had to bring it back in myself and again here autopilot not wanting to not wanting to turn on with all of this stuff around it this here for example is a really really tight corner that i just i don't think the car is going to be able to do i'm going to bring it all the way down to 10 and see no you see that there is about maximum amount that was about maximum lock there of the tesla that you just saw it really isn't it isn't a big lock here in the uk it doesn't go very far so we've got kind of um a one-way road here that hopefully it should go down quite nicely because there's quite a lot of lines yeah picking up the cars picking up the cones doing well here i'm hoping it's just going to follow us straight up here as well which it has done is it going to pick the left lane no it's going to pick the right lane so we'll just sit behind here at the lights this gives us our first good look at lights though so you can see here again it's pretty hard for us to see the light up at the top left and the car can't see it it knows it's there but it doesn't know what color it is so it's going off of that one light over there for colouring so on roads like this i know that it just won't squeeze through here especially with the car on the other side of the road even though that car is parked it wouldn't have squeezed past there and we would have got some really weird kind of braking okay so here the road markings do disappear slightly there's like one in the middle of the road there and it is sticking to the left-hand side of the road which is good it's picking up the bins as well of course on the side of the road is it picking up these pylons yes very very slightly it picked up one or two oh interesting it breaks very hard there for that person so even though that person was on the pavement it breaks very very hard for it thinking that potentially she was on the road or it was going to be a problem of some sorts again no problem around these corners we do hit the limit still for turning so that is definitely one thing i feel i'm repeating myself but it is definitely the speed uh being able to change the speed and slow itself down by itself this person slightly is it going to pick it up no it didn't pick her up actually picked her bag up as a cone did you see that it actually i thought it was going to pick her up but it in fact picked her bag up as a cone is it picking this cyclist up no didn't pick the cyclist up however it did pick up and show the bin is it going to pick up these cones yes of course picks up the codes no problem and again coming up to a red light it's not going to stop us so i have to pull it back and stop ourselves however you will see there is now a nice line on the road where the car would stop uh which is pretty cool so it it shows you where the line is where the car's going to be stopping and actually it's picking up a couple of bollards there it didn't change to orange it went straight to green again so it's still not going to be changing to orange just yet and here it's really tucking hard to the right hand side of the road now it's going back to the middle i think because it was a very wide road it was slightly confused so we've had some a-roads we've had some town slash city i guess driving there and now we're going on to the motorway for a little section of motorway driving so again we're coming up to the red light it thinks the stop is all the way back there interestingly enough which it wasn't so we would have actually stopped way way earlier now this is the real test coming up for it on the motorway here so navigating autopilot is on and we've got a kind of a junction coming up where basically it needs to stay in this lane so we need to be in this middle lane and then the middle lane actually chops off into two lanes and it needs to take the left lane now i have never and i repeat never successfully done this in this car so what we're going to do today is i'm going to let the car do everything i'm going to do exactly what the car tells me to do so if it says to change lanes etc etc i'm going to do it and we're going to see if the car can in fact do this junction it's never been able to do it before it's right next to a tesla service center here in bristol so let's see so it's asking us to change to the third lane and i'm actually i'm actually not gonna do that because that would make me look like such a douche i've got cars behind me and around me and if i just sat in the third lane yeah that wouldn't be the coolest looking move so the ford ranger's coming and so is that lorry actually okay here we go now now we can change into that third lane that skoda was whizzing through so we'll go over now into this third lane and you can see here from the signs it clearly says we need to be in that middle lane so we're the m5 north we need to be in that middle lane there the car says that we need to be in that middle lane as well so again we're just gonna let the car decide when we move over okay it's asking us to move over now so let's get ourselves into that lane this car is coming across but that shouldn't be a problem and it's actually asking us now to get into that first lane or at least it did for us it's still arting us interesting so are we meant to be in that first lane or aren't we what is the car deciding to do here it's still not 100 sure we've got someone coming down that left lane anyway it's not a lorry it's a vw same admissions as a lorry but hey um it's still asking us to get into that left lane so let's let's do it let's confirm the left lane change even though i know specifically categorically we need to be in that right hand lane here so you can see we're going m5 north the midlands gloucester and this is not the right lane so if you look here on the light lane on the right you'll see this is where it splits into two here and we should be following that forward we should be where that forward is right now and we should just be doing that but currently it's asking us to stay in this lane and we're still staying in this lane it's slowing us down so that's brought the speed limit down but we need to get across here like now like now there we go now it's asking us okay so it's not sure i think about that little fork area and basically instead of giving it a go it's putting us into lanes where it knows that it can just like actually change lanes rather than navigating it itself so again hands off the wheel completely here just so you can see 50 miles an hour i normally do this about 60 ish so 50 is really not hard let's just make sure it doesn't conk out on us okay so it's speeding us back up here 55 now at 60 miles an hour there's no cars over there on the left and it's still it's sticking at 60. so this here is indicating left which is very strange no idea why it's indicating left this is actually one lane now so this turns into one lane let's see what the car does the cars brought us over to the left and so far it actually that was very oh okay so he's flashing us over there so i think we've got speed cameras up ahead uh so we've got to be we've got to be careful i'm pretty sure there's gonna be speed cameras up here but that was actually really really smooth no problems at all and you can see it is art against the lane change so i think it is slightly confused it does want us to get into that lane slightly too early or it's a little bit too prompt for it but yeah that actually did that really really well we're coming off in just under a mile to supercharge so let's see how this brings us off the motorway here and see what it asks us to do you can see that it's actually pre-conditioning the battery for supercharging so it is getting itself all ready and excited to get supercharging and even though we're only 0.7 miles away it's not asking us to get into that left lane yet it did just put a line up there there we go so now it's putting that line up for us and we're in that first lane and so i have done this a couple of times and again it is it's fairly successful but it can be a little bit hit and miss let's see what it decides to do when it decides to slow down there you go so you can see here construction detected it is slowing us down though we're going down to 60 55 50. oh this feels so slow 50 okay sticking at 50 here and it's just going straight oh speeding us up 55 and yeah now it's going a little bit wobbly taking us over to the right hand side here and what's it going to do is it actually going to take us around this corner let's go let's go it is it's doing it it's doing it you can see though big speed bump no problem crossing no one's here and there we go the car is driving us very nicely into our destination so there we have it everybody there is full self driving after lockdown our first drive since lockdown what do you think let me know is it going to be the 100 000 option that elon says it's going to be or do you think it still needs a lot of work i still think it means work i can't see it ever costing a hundred thousand i can't see anyone ever paying a hundred thousand for a self-driving car so let's see how it goes thank you all so much for watching until the next update don't forget drive safe
