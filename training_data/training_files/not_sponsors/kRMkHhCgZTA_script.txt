hey what is going on you guys this is mr no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new loot video for you all today so today i bring you loot from 24 hours of barrows starting at kc 2889 and ending with whatever kc we have 24 hours after that the goal for this video is to see the prices of each of these barrows items that i do receive as you can see the torx plate body was the very first of this video and after each item i do receive i will price check it for you guys so we can see the current price of barrows items in 2021 and really test the hourly rates here see how much profit we can make while using a trident all the cost of those supplies will add up i'm sure other than all those barrows items that we can expect we will also be getting a lot of elite clue scrolls it's very common from barrows and we will complete every single one of them i'm not gonna be transforming these elites into masters for this one i think it's just easier to see the loot from elites since most people that do barrows i'd imagine are average combat and most of those players can probably do elites rather than masters i did receive a nice 200k elite clue followed by a 500k master clue to start off the video and then ironically on my next elite which was an average 100k i did get another master clue so i never really seen that before back to back there which led to my first mimic leading me actually to 19 mimic kc overall never had a third age item from one of these mimics i know that you do get an extra roll for the master clue which is always a good bonus and i did unlock a new collection log item the samurai casa beautiful roon light plugin showing whenever you get a collection log item from any clue scroll or anything in general really did come in handy for this video that plug-in because i was missing an arum's hood to complete this barrows collection log which is crazy to think because we're almost 3 000 chests and still no aram's hood however i did receive a rune spear from that aviancy and following that i got an 84k elite so i guess it's all not too bad but the next barrow's chest was a verox flail the next item in this video not the best one to see if you're looking for a weapon you're probably going to want to be seeing the dhx or guthan spear which hopefully we will see throughout this video but the main goal really was for the collection log arum's hood that was the item i wanted to see the whole time certainly not these tourag hammers but they do look pretty nice just like that uh lovely hydra pet that i had out looking at these barrows chest with me shortly after the taurag hammers i guess jagex felt like giving me another plate body which was a back to back draw back-to-back torx chest so that's really nice i rarely do see a back-to-back chest or double chest anything like that but through 3000 barrels kc i've pretty much seen it all so there is that the gear for this video was pretty simple just a set of full melee and mage void i use mage void with the trident and i use the whip as well as the dragon dagger for arums and i even use the trident on carols too that's kind of how i do barrows then managed to get a scarf there for the collection log and following that another elite clue scroll was really seeing a lot of elite clues throughout the making of this video especially in the beginning and even towards the middle and end honestly i was just getting really good rng with those rewards from them though not so much very average so far but about 70 chests and here we are with an arum's robe skirt very nice reward that is definitely what you want to see here any arums pieces the rope top the robes skirt as well as carols top and then dh body and legs those are definitely the most expensive barrows items right now and that arum's rope skirt alone is almost 1.3 million so it really does help the price check and we will throw that in the barrows tab with all the other items i did have to recharge my trident shortly after that and i was using the runes that i got from barrows to recharge my trident the only thing that i buy was just little scales which are not worth pretty much anything right now i think they're about 100 gp each they used to be 250. so if you do want to do barrows right now the toxic trident you will save a decent amount of money but you really don't need a toxic trident for barrows all of the brothers have zero magic defense and you can hit through them like butters so you can bring any magic for that we did receive another mimic though from an elite clue scroll another master reward of a top hat this time 422k my 20th mimic overall really nice to see that collection log pop up but it'd be even nicer to see one that was worth more money still no luck on those clue scrolls but back to the barrow's chess though i did receive a carol's coiv shortly after i returned and if you are curious as to what those things are in my inventory the green things a lot of people were asking me about them while i was streaming this and they are essentially just strange old lock picks you can buy them in the grand exchange for about 70k 60k these days and you can open up any barrow's door that you are unable to access so in other words you can get to the chest within seconds as soon as you enter the crips and that's exactly why i buy it i really feel like it's worth the purchase and as you can see here on screen 3000 barrow's kc has been accomplished and man i wish those lock picks came out sooner because those would have been done much faster leading us into the carroll's crossbow though which is a nice item current price is only 132k but i do see it going up once they nerf the blowpipe in the future so maybe hold on to that one after the carol's crossbow i was rewarded with the guthan's war spear which used to be the most expensive barrows item at a record price of i think seven or eight mil at one point maybe even more than that but nowadays it just sits at around 300 to 400k even this dh helmet on screen this used to be the most expensive barrows item in the other runescape and that is only about 200k so yeah things do go down over time it just kind of happens too many supplies not enough demand guthan's helmet was uh same story but again it is decent to see items i mean it's always a good feeling to see barrow's items and you always get that rng with clue scrolls as well so don't count out barrows just yet i think it's the same as zola you know a lot of the rares go down over there but it still has elites it still has mutagens and a pet and things like that personally i would love to see a barrow's pet but i don't think it's ever gonna happen because then a lot more people would come here and there'd be so many more barrows items in the game so who knows what the price would go to then but it would be a great collection log item and all the barrels i've done 3 000 chests later i was finally able to get a skeleton champion scroll from these skeletons i think on average per barrels run i kill three skeletons to get me to 88 uh loot potential that's just how i've always done it you can always do it different ways though so that means i killed about 9 000 skeletons to get that so that's really nice um i just was really surprised to see that following that we did get a torx helmet and yet again another tour eggs plate body and then of course carol's did kill me at the barrow's chest that's what you get when you don't bring any prayer potions whenever i would have a tunnel if it was ever carols i'd always be afraid but in that rune pouch i have entangled so if it was any other brother i'd usually be okay and the special attacks would always take care of arums but just be cautious of carols especially for you hardcore ironmen out there the super combat sip was really assisting with arums though and i do recommend that as well as an imbued heart for anyone who can afford it it really does increase your magic level and that does help here but again it's not 100 necessary finally we did see a dh body 900k from that and before that it was just a carol's coif a lot of these barrels chests they can be pretty disappointing sometimes you just open them and see mined runes and coins and i understand if that makes you never want to go back again barrows has certainly seen its more popular days through the years i don't know if it's ever going to get a resurgence of popularity if they ever do some barrows extension i'm sure you can see some more popularity coming from that but other than that we will just have to wait and see so here is the last master clue of the video 1.7 mil and that was a great way to end the 24 hour session it's now time to do the price check see how much we made in this time unfortunately no aaron's hood for the collection log so we will return one day the overall loot from the runes and the bolt racks and coins did come out to be 13.4 mil and that was all after using three different times to recharge my trident so you just gotta factor that into the runes there so we have 13.4 mil in all the runes and all the barrows items do add an additional 4.1 million definitely seen its better days so we have 13.4 plus 4.1 with an overall amount of 17.5 mil from 24 hours of barrows if you do add in the three mil from the clue scrolls that would bring us up to 20.5 mills so almost averaging one mil an hour at barrows that's not terrible uh it's not quite what i want to see but at the same time if we had better rng we would have made more money 287 barrels just done as well as all those elites and masters means we were averaging about 12 an hour which is not terrible considering the lock picks as well the total supplies with the lock picks the scales as well as everything else did come out to be about 2.5 to 3 mil so overall you're gonna see the same just about 17.5 mil from these 24 hours that is it for now guys what is your thoughts do you think barrows is still worth it in 2021 would you like to see a barrows pet what is your thoughts on barrows let me know in the comments section below i hope you guys enjoy the video and until next time mr no sleep out
