welcome to another video with me your host Sean why do I do this anyway we just got back from LA and when I say just go back at me like over a month ago I work seas I was supposed to do this haul video before egg type my inktober video but I ended up having to catch up an inch Oba organizer zine as well as post the video because I wanted like the video and the seed to come out at the same time I was very like that was a personal stress that I put on myself and said this got pushed back because I had other client work to do to move on - so now here we are a month and a bit later so when the stuff isn't open because I was like just a pristine I can't open it I've been waiting to read some books that I bought for a long time this is an LA haul but it's not just like stationary and paper goods of books and fashion and candy which it will be that but it's also I wanted to do some knowledge as well so I will try to remember to put the time stamps for each little section below so if you don't interested in something you don't have to watch it because the last thing I want is for you guys to be bored during my videos I'd rather you just like get what you want from the videos and not dig - all the rest I could probably not just be like oh yes she is talking about things that I don't care about you know what I mean you know what I mean so if I don't for the time to remind me so the first thing that I knew I wanted to do when I went to LA well I had let me explain there's this illustrator that I love and she has a Chloe brand her name is Tuesday Bassett she makes a very sighs diverse range of clothing they're very cute colorful sassy flattering they're a little bit more expensive than the average peril because they're ethically made they use deadstock and materials from California and Japan so I think their weight is very minimal so when I knew I was coming to LA I knew the first start was Tuesday back in LA it's like Rinku because I already wore everything but that's okay first I got this ring of T is that what it's called I love the colors I love love-love-love primary colors in case you hadn't noticed already in my work and in my vlogs and every other touch point of my existence well-fitted comfortable really soft with a lovely blue collar and yellow piping and I fell in love with it and so the creme de la creme did today and can you say do not expect to get this dress because I'm not a huge fan of bright green but when I put this on I just love the way it like made my skin look and made my body look so this is the turf diner dress it is so freakin adorable I'm not a huge fan of flowers but I just love the way this looks I love that it's not just like a cute little flower there's like like what does it call her baby was like she is that you use to cut flat like plants and stuff I love the plant sweepers of this job so I could attest to that I feel like I don't super super love my body all the time I did not have curves in the right places so this really like adds to that because it's like an a-line dress if it's a really nice link like it's super comfortable super fun super bright and super different as well like I really really love all the details so if you like the look of these two things or you're interested in checking out more all of the links to everything that I show you today will be down below the next thing that I bought was from oh crud I don't remember the designer because we just we just wandered past I'm gonna put the designer here because I don't remember Bing Bing Bing who spotted this pair of black shorts rocker suggested I try them on I was like okay but I tried it on it was really nice and I came out rocket was like I like that and it made me just feel so good that we both were like wow this is sick but he sure to like my feel good shot I think they're really really flattering like shorts for me are very difficult because I feel like they get very boxy around the crotch but these are sick next is the best pop books and stationery so let's see this is like not as serious buy but this is one of the only art materials that I bought we went to the Getty Museum oh we actually met someone that subscribed to me that was working at the Getty BZ that that rung me up for these two the lady that served us at the Getty Museum Gift Shop hello thank you for watching my videos that I really really show your support and you were really lovely I bought this tiny little paint set that I found it was 99 cents it's obviously not great watercolors it's for kids but I thought it would be funny to do like a little review I don't have a feeling that it's gonna be just a talky kind of like the dyso ones where it has that kind of chalky texture next I have a concept planner what's a concept planning you ask let me refresh my memory by looking at it because I haven't oh it's so cool okay so basically I'm super super super goal driven we got this from Poquette oh and Picacho is a brand that rock and I have both stocked online for like years I'm not I'd be kidding wandering around get a bubble tea being cool we like look at this were like wow and then we looked up for this I'm like oh it's the store that we're obsessed with that we've never been to ever and I ended up going to this concept planner it's like a weekly planner it's not dated it has like little check boxes a list at times that system works really really well for me and at the start of the week it also has like a goal section at an ideas section I don't do well with stuff that's really stylized or cutesy I just really really like clean design where I can just draw over the top I'm excited about it I haven't even looked through it yet so no brow press is one of my favorite publishers they do a lot of graphic novel slash picture books a while ago they've released a magazine studio dream I saw it online Straley is far away from everything so shipping to Australia from anywhere except for New Zealand is  like I love this but I can't pay $60 for a magazine like looking at it now it is a magazine but it feels very book like and the quality of printing is beautiful good each spread is like a different artist and their interpretation of their dream studio let me just have another quick look so I can tell you the right information because I don't want be spreading or a miss illustrator see things a bit differently they dream of their ideal work spaces the way most people dream of their ultimate holidays it might have both endless shells with every color of paint or it might be more in the realm of a giant jellyfish parse of mushrooms it does an island with skies full of rainbows is it realistic not really but West speaking of dreams hit and in our dreams out jobs are inspiring and then we don't have to do any tax returns so daughter country it is freakin divine I love oh is this era oh my god IRA's in this so cute shout out to era do you know who that is baby I'll show you after she's an excellent illustrator there's love things that are congregations of lots of great illustrators that aren't many publications that do it well so I was really really excited to get my hands on this when I found it in a bookstore near where we were staying oh it's so beautiful I can't handle this anyway I don't want to like close to myself to have a heart attack on camera so moving on next we get to the Adobe MAX portion of the shopping trip Adobe was lovely enough to send me to America and at the end of a day max on the last day they have like a little design such a market and illustrators that speak in Illustrated's affiliated with Adobe sell their stuff I think this is the perfect place to spend all of my money this one is from a friend named joy Lee she's a Sydney based designer she's super super talented and she deals a lot with cultural identity so she created this print that went kind of viral it's who's your token agent and basically it's like a little flow shots you can find which token Asian character you relate to most I'm pretty sure weird it kind of viral on BuzzFeed but it's so sick Thank You Jai for letting me have this I'm putting it up in my studio you should definitely click on a pillow to figure out which token Asian to you and like it's just so funny that I was like an Asian person we have very few role models and very few like people in the media to look up to and the people that we do have to look up to their characters freaking suck I got a background Asian which is surrounded by a horde of attention-seeker that's totally understandable why you'd be the complaining mopey mediocre performer who never seems to get forget the right to voice their injustice sin at all but we was talking about and I think the best one to get is the cold-hearted Asian I think that one's the only one with a little bit of dignity definitely recommend visiting joyous store and if you can't afford to buy anything definitely go check out which token Asian you are because it's a super super funny she's really really clever and she's a really really bright future ahead of her I didn't know who this guy was but I thought his prints were freaking cute so I was just like yeah I'm gonna get them sure what's his name Christopher okay so these are some prints by Christopher Lee that all scream prints I think he's always a little set of two I just thought it was so adorable very in line with the work that I make and so I wanted to get it as like a reminder for the action I want my where to go and the feeling that I want people to have when they see my work this one I just love for the colors I think it's really really really gorgeous and it's just like a Godzilla fighting of giant Lobster I don't really get it is that a reference I don't know and this one's James and the Giant Peach a because I'm a big Roald Dahl fan he's like one of my favorite authors from my childhood that I would read over and over and over again and be because page I'm obsessed with myself the pages I don't know if that's not the city cuz I'm not literally a page the style of these was really really cute I'll put his work below and I'll link to the prints as well you should check him out is really really really cool cuz I've already got so many amazing patches I have this idea that I'm gonna start ideally a bond to a denim jacket I don't know if it's ever gonna happen I don't have the denim jacket yet that I want to add them onto but I do have a lot of sick patches so I thought I'd continue the theme of doing that and buy more these two are from DK ng buh they're like designers that own a studio together and I've seen them to speak a couple of times I didn't get to see them this year because they didn't have enough time but they're really really really talented to go check out their videos on how they work on illustrator it's gonna say the level of detail and like texture they create with vector images so I thought I'd just support them because the color schemes are really nice I don't know really really adorable this one came from Christopher Lee's the artists that I showed you just before I really like this texture I want to make some totes with like this backdrop so we have this I got this for free from a booth I don't know what it is but it's really colorful and I like if I can imagine on the back of my imaginary jacket that I love so much next we have Aaron droplet woohoo okay so Aaron is someone that I've seen speak twice at Adobe MAX off to see him speak lost he just gave me such good vibes more color thought this was appropriate because you know how I love color I got this because it's got rocket on it and I really really like the colors pretzels because I freaking love giant pretzels who's to say this isn't a giant pretzel I really like the cinnamon ones but we can pretend I got this emotional creature patch I think his girlfriend or such Beyonce I think she made this Erin dropp'd is a logo designer but he also has a company called field nuts you may know of it already I actually wanted to get these mustard ones but as I was reaching for it the guy at the front line I appreciate so be reaching for it and they were the last one he was like sorry and I was like okay so I got this graph paper I'm super super obsessions it's like gridded paper thing right now I don't know why but I just am and the outside that made it would I think which is crazy but basically he began this company I think there's a lot of people involved now but he always still has like a part in designing little parts of it and last but not least his book I was really wanting to get this last year but I didn't get around to picking one up when I had the chance to buy this book this year I just I knew I have to basically this is a book of pretty much everything by Aaron Joplin and he is an excellent logo designer I'm always quite enthralled by his casualness and the way his attitudes towards creating is so passionate and so joyful and it's something that really sparks inspiration to me but yeah this book is sick it has like his entire career in it I think that's one of the impressive parts about his prolific Ness I don't know if that's a word but yeah I haven't looked into this book so I can't tell you much but it has stuff about the things he's inspired by I know he's inspired a lot by old design and junk that he finds and the kind of graphic design that's lost in time because it isn't recorded I love learning about the wait are the creative people think because it's so different and I love hearing about people that I advise journey because it makes me feel excited about my own journey I know it's quite kind of selfish but it's natural to just kind of relate it back to you that's all the physical stuff that I have for you next up is the dead didn't brain stuff I gotta get my laptop cuz I put them all up oh we have the stuff I took away the brain stuff I took away the knowledge I took away from Adobe MAX so I compiled like a big notebook full of notes every time someone spoke I was like so into it I wanted to be able to retain everything I could and not waste the opportunity of being there at Adobe MAX and being around all these talented people and so like I wrote so many notes and I've condensed them into like my favorite takeaways let's just do it in alphabetical order Adam J Kurtz is an illustrator artist author glue blah blah blah bleep a lot of things he does everything he's very very cool I like the way you think I love like the perceived naivety of his work but actually it's it's very very clever there's this something to be said about having digestible design and did a digestible art and I think that's something that we have in common it's it's very like digestible by the masses and I I really respect that don't worry just make the stuff you like this one really resonated with me because it's an attitude that I hold dear as well I think a lot of people get carried away with seeming serious and like whether they're going in the right direction whether they're on the right path a lot of people ask me how to find this style but I really think it's about doing the stuff that you love and you'll find like your path and your style I think it's it's nice that he has this sentiment of like don't worry about it just do stuff just make stuff just have fun and I just really really really like that and I agree with it completely make personal work a priority because it is so freakin important in figuring out the stuff that matters I know personal work is important but I think this year I've really really prioritized a lot of commercial work maybe less prioritizing him a bit maybe subconsciously pushing my personal work down in the racks I think I just needed that reminder too about the importance of it all being afraid to fail or sell out is unnecessary failing are you really failing or are you learning a lesson and selling out are you really selling out or you being able to pay your rent so you can do the stuff you truly love we all die so just have fun this is something that you put at the end of his talk it was so funny because we were in this like huge coal and he's like we all die he's like I'm gonna die you're gonna die she's gonna die you're all gonna do like yelling like you're all gonna die it was like echoing throughout this Convention Center and I was like it's someone gonna arrest us right now like security would be like who is this person why are they saying this over speaking I think it's a nice reminder and it's very easy to forget that life is super short even though it's the longest thing we'll ever do it's really really short so we should just have fun while we're doing what we're doing at least everyone else speak before but Annie Atkins I hadn't seen speak in person and if you don't know Annie Atkins is a graphic designer fulfill she basically helps directors create very fully formed universes through graphic design she would say was like she makes the stuff in the blurry backgrounds so stuff that you don't necessarily know but is super super important to the authenticity of a film she makes that probably one of the things she's most famous for doing is working with it where's Anderson I know she worked on grand Budapest hotel and I know she worked on the Isle of Dogs film as well even the smallest details are important and there is charm in the imperfections I think this is something that I got from her entire talk not just from what she was saying but also just her work it was insane like the level of detail that she puts in and in terms of accuracy and materials use really really inspired me it inspires me to include graphic design to tell a story or to authenticate like a world that is in my brain I already feel that the smallest details are imported which is why I put like three million facts on the text in my vlogs you know what I mean like there's a certain blurriness and like I think a stroke on the font that I use sometimes I find myself being like why do I spend time doing this no one notices but at the same time hearing her say that really really was like who cares be inspired by a real life a misconception that people have is that you can't reference real life or you can't draw from reference imagery and I just think that's wrong I think that a way to make your work believable and the universe in which your works it's in believable is to reference things that people are aware of Annie Atkins showed a bunch of like amazing examples I will put her talk below please check it out but of of just like for it isn't in a sandwich shop and the the hand-drawn size that someone that clearly wasn't a lettera had written but it was so perfect because it was so imperfect and that goes back to the last point to but she when she wants to create something and make it make it believable she takes from real life next we have Aaron droplet so era droplet was the guy that did the book the patches field notes and I think the thing I got from him the most was his overall like joyfulness and hope we're very lucky to be able to do what we do and I think that was the most amazing thing that you can get from his talk it is our job to make the world a more beautiful place that is just amazing it's late it's just like it's just such a nice way to look at it especially at a time like this where there's a lot of dirty things going on it's nice to have the skills to be able to brighten up the world a little bit be generous with your skill set this is something that I need to do more of seeing what we do is seeing our skills as something that can be gifted enjoy the process we are so lucky to be able to express ourselves in such a colorful way that to be able to create the things we do this is just another example of the gratefulness that he has for being able to make it's humbling because it's like yeah we're so lucky and sometimes I forget that even though I love what I do sometimes I forget that I'm so lucky to be able to just wake up roll out of bed go and draw a picture and obviously there's more to my job but it's it's like essentially I get to be creative and make the things I love everyday know a lot of people are able to express themselves in such a visually joyful way or express themselves so eloquently it's such a a widely enjoyable medium and I think it's important to remember that we're lucky to do that last but not least we have Jessica Hache so Jessica he is a artist letter a typography I'm not really sure what she classifies herself as but she's like a lettering goddess essentially she's the lettering lady it was interesting though because her talk wasn't necessarily super focused on her work it was focused on who she is as a person not just her as a designer an artist and letter of who we are in this moment is not who we'll be in five years I know I get a lot of questions about how to find your style as if it's like an endpoint when it isn't like we will constantly be evolving and remembering that is so free because it takes the pressure way off so who we are in this moment is not who we'll be in five years try to get to know yourself outside of what you do for work this one is a huge one for me currently because I feel like my identity is so tied up in what I do I spend most of my time thinking about illustration working on my own illustration enjoying the work of other people and the creative industry and being proud that I'm a part of such an incredible industry and so I want to get to know myself outside of me as an illustrator I think there's like a lack of balance in my life right now it's very skewed towards work as the main thing and so I think it will be important for me to figure get better in capturing your process in meaningful ways she was doing Brown refreshes and not a lot of people knew what that was so she was looking at brands logos and kind of tidying it up like making it better making small tweaks that would then make it a successful logo and she did this for a few companies and then she shared her process on her blog and that led to her audience being like wow this is great and clients been like oh we would love this too he had like side by sides of of the logo and her logo and would circle things that were different capturing her process in a meaningful way and sharing it in a way that was intelligent digestible finding the interesting parts of her process led to her getting more work and led to her being able to pass down knowledge to her audience which I thought was really really nice I mean like why waste all the hours that we spent in the studio just to have one final product why not do those hours have a great final product and then be able to share the journey that you took to get there cuz I think the journey is the stuff that I love reading about most and I love learning about most I think there is immense value having transparency with your clients and your audience I think what she was doing here was it was after the Braun refresh when brands one of these again and again she would outline to them what she was going to do like oh here's all the things she was gonna look at she was gonna look at kerning she was gonna look at ligatures she was gonna look at lion weight she was gonna look at form play and she had it she had big paragraphs of what these things meant so that to people that aren't in the industry or didn't know about lettering or typography they could understand the value in her work sometimes people underestimate the amount of work that goes into creativity and creative jobs all you need to do is kind of be like this is actually all the thought they put to it you're actually paying for all of the work you're not just it's not just an imaginary number that I've thrown out they're trying to swindle you it's legit a very thoughtful process and it's worth every penny essentially all we do the last bit which it's amazing next we have them too though the lolly part I mean should I say candy bar okay okay you ready yeah do you know what we're gonna do can you guess I don't know how this or maybe we should introduce you okay this is Nate you're like outlet for graphic design is through fairy floss and I think that's so interesting yeah would you like to allow I have a fairy fossa business basically it's the best I've addicted to it yeah I feel like every time you come over I'm like Nigeria you bring it under mic further addictive drug dealer but Nate loves America he do like my only friend that's like obsessed with it like me and like obsessions you choose you're like the only one who knows like about America I brought us back some stuff is that what you knew was gonna be when you called me this morning I didn't know that but I was like what could it be in the shower I was like mmm it's probably that come on no sorry look at these if I'm editing and I see like you look yell scream and I'll call you in scream at when I was going on say what he wanted me to get am I still don't love how you could look you had one request what was it mint no I don't mean to orange lifesavers they like these minty hard rings like peppermint but with orange sort of like tic tacs in like a chore people and I was like yuck because for me or I go back to I only picked them up like one oh why did you buy them yeah because I went to Target and I was leaving American target it's a friend did you know American target is not affiliated with Australian target I went to American target that's where I got things I know that's where I found these anyway you name was like oh they're everywhere and I went to no they're not because I literally went to all these comedians as all these supermarkets I like looked everywhere for these because the only thing you asked was like I need to get the brother as I'm a bad friend I could buy them I went to a record target finally and I found those I won't like it I promise it's okay I can have them yeah these are for you for the rest like the rest of packet fee for the rest of your life you don't ask for anything else for me hey Ripper and it's like hop on down here and it's like how you know like we ran out have one I see the individual I like the speckles I don't know why I like it what I bring this away I'm gonna put some good stuff in here we fitted wait what do you give this out of ten I'll give it oh but like I don't like to be one of those people that writes things out of ten I think nobody gives things tenants I don't know why do they not like why would give things a ten if it was amazing ten times ten I'm so excited was just like I was worried I wasn't gonna go back to America because I all right die so Oh cuz the guns and stuff like just died in general double bubble so if you tried cakes like hubba bubba it's kind of like that but they have their own spices in it in stuff it tastes like it's like a trademark thing why didn't i that but it's pretty good i think you're a good person to do this is because like you are in a confectionery type company do you read up on this actually I don't like how hot it is it hurts your jaw when you eat it yeah cinnamony can you break this way you know thinking me okay like Ernie's in cinema nice the best but bubble blowing bubble gum is big league chew ya know the tattoos mm-hmm it's like an ax pouch it is like cross shredded I remember when you meant to me because you're doing this taste test of everything in Vegas I love that and that must have been before we met it wasn't because I met you a day after I found your Instagram account I met ah Finders Keepers maca I didn't know who Sean what but I just found your Instagram I was like fairy floss that's cool it's pretty and then I saw you like going to buy ski but I was going anyway and I was like I'm gonna get some fireballs I was like you feel like you were like this and therefore the person seven you were just like you put it on your snapchat story and then I was like oh my god you met Sean I was like hooked and then I looked up and then I went back to you and like you told me that your Instagram Pamela I don't know why would anyone say that and I know I know Nate and I are big fans of Bon Apetit the channel and one of the things that she made in her go away yeah Claire one of the things Claire made in her gourmet versions of junk is it gushes huh I've never tried yeah I've never tried it either that's why I bought them gosh your school snack they're in the same room as like fruit roll-ups I was disappointed look I think I would be disappoint look at the package I thought something would explode out of my mouth yeah when every video I've seen they're both sort of things stuck together wow that's like like Holograms little but it's just princess rainbow oh yeah this is why I like hanging out with you cuz he analyzes all the design element anyway we got strawberry splash or tropical flavor I don't know just weddin habit oh dude I think these exploded no that's how they are that's how they aren't everything see isn't that kind of yeah yeah yeah that's car I start eating a pimple I thought I was gonna be well liquidy though cuz when Claire made it she injected like paralyzed juice I have to say I feel like I would like if it was more like her rebo nabarro is good and then I wish the liquid was really liquidy so it really flowed out I can do a lot I kind of like taste but you like it they are renovate our candy they are not a school stress yeah there's no gelatin and we'll make some baby oh yeah jealous I'm free that's why they not come have you had there's a ball Hot Tamale Mali's yeah I don't I love them I don't love you don't cinnamon suck my mom does I know that you do when Nate like wants to think of new flavors I always just be selfish and tell him cinnamon is divine I love every I like it because it's different cinnamon is nothing in failure not in handy I love it because the more you eat the more spicy it get it just by the way on your tongue I look hot mmm it doesn't linger I love it do you like the texture hmm Chuck jelly base alive oh yeah get a bit job for me all the things I love you to show you I got these because they're in Seinfeld I'm pretty sure I've seen that doped-up yeah no I haven't had them fantails this is basically fantails I do like Fanta except less chocolate and not even a fun quiz on the outside me she's like hardly any chocolate to talk about quality though you know we're gonna like do people know it doesn't use a cream cheese chocolate it is but doesn't taste like her she choked it tastes like advent calendar chocolate admit it it does sound how's it better mm-hmm you don't like caramel caramel are you judging the chocolate chocolate I don't like bad chocolate and to me it doesn't taste like Hershey's I like Hershey's chocolate I don't like a chocolate yeah I can eat it it's like a stinky chocolate do you agree why does it taste like that anyway also you know how coffee's roasted and then that's a bean and and chocolates arrested and that's a be why does coffee taste so bad and how's it taste so good it wants you have to have warriors maybe do I know you do I have to why because it's in America why would I get Oreos when we tried them before because exactly that surprised me have you had sour patch kids no it's fuzzy Iowa yeah have you had them angry watermelon berry blaze that's a people flame it looks sad Oh lot of stuff over there is like genetically modified oh my god hurry up and eat the whole thing eat the whole thing how to Barry well I had an apple um interesting sensation the water melts pretty fluffy this one is like once you swallow and your tongue hits the goal of your mouth it's like you know what is once you have another one another one who the spy screams - to scare my news now murder look like regular sour pumpkin it looked like they got wet maybe you know flap different sad children it's getting hotter and hotter a good bad sugar what makes it hot it'll be the flavor contains heat sensation may cause mouth irritation excessive consumption is not advisable Oh once I have sows killers and my tongue started bleeding because I ate two packets I am so glad that you brought you have no idea they're two more things okay I feel bad I should have gotten more like shaping up both of them that's cause it's similar where did you find these did you go to Walmart or Target target warm up no close your eyes a lot of no I'm not Wow because I can hear okay these are cool oh I've had these these are so good they're very good have you had no I love you're gonna laugh he's a really cool I thought when I pick these up I just picked up any another person this and then I walk down the corner was like Mickey Mouse obvious how cool is it and laborious okay one thing I would say about Oreo though if they made like a package like a chip packet filled with just the cookies that would be my dream we try this ingredient sugar of course your favorite cocoa it's like very low on this list which is we after cocoa - just corn syrup which one you attract better since we have do you haven't had this cake when over to America I bought these the last I bought like six or eeeh wait I'm says if you have these now why I so like I haven't had them in two years I like this I mean I love white [Applause] you don't see anything this is like it like secured thing right ah excuse me where's the Oreo Oreo I paid for three wines tiger Sam Mills oh we have to get milk I see I like American Oreos because they think I'm really gonna try out this time everything's getting smaller everything's getting less they cook you pick up our cream is like it doesn't you probably can't see but it's like to the room how does it like that our creams like waxy hmm there's a softer has more flavor to this my name is paper I like it that's good you better get dinner off this we better not eat the whole packet because I'll feel sick after the 140 calories for true cookies you know what sucks 10 tons of one cookie per serving I eat a whole family packing one good where's the 50 calories each here in America they're 70 which is honestly what this is what Oreo used to be have you noticed the design too low I have I saw this great reason I went to America I was going to go to Walmart I spent $300 of all mountain snacks I had a 70 kilo suitcase I think because I have higher expectations for this cuz I love cinnamon buns this is very good I mean it's pretty good surprise me and fight dummy thing you're like the lifesaver come seems like a lot all right I've had them applause yes you have no I have yes you know I haven't yeah you have Wow as I was hearing you offer them to me no I didn't Rock ain't the rest of the bag no wallet no that's what that wasn't life Sam

how about well maybe though but I love like second-hand nostalgia like they used to make Pokemon we fix with sultanas in them Pokemon weet-bix wait wait wait do you do pokemon i had pokemon cards i didn't know how to do anything with them like the games yeah of course okay in 2000 I remember vividly when I was a kid they would have Pokemon themed cereal but it was just like wait vixx with raisins in it yeah anyway you unplug anything cool you didn't go and see what I do at home I'll put a link below that fluff gram on Instagram you might be disappointed I have to say oh I should explain because okay I don't really like Freud plus it gets like really gritty and gross but this is so soft and sweet and the flavors are so good no I didn't like notice that until you said it wing basically basically the Machine fills up with sugar yeah you just take it out but when you'd like mass-producing it it's like you wait till it's completely full we like pick it out a little bit by little bit so like any grains are like going to the model not just the texture the texture is a big part of it but the flavors are so good oh I can also plug something else p50 you should go watch the video on Nate's channel that we make his island if that why you did this could he did that video oh well I'd already gonna get us stuff to taste but I was really entertained and watching our other video watching our video I want to yeah but like other people like asking me where do I put everybody I'm really happy cuz of my audience is like stop asking me that question because they realize that I'm just hopeless thank you for you said you should call home no how could be so much it's not heckling it's like it's like remove this do this make more stuff do this and it's good actually I do it cuz if I give you like too much to do then you'll probably like achieve more doing that than being like here's one thing to do you know but why are you so with my task what's the word taskmaster do you think we should move to the US because shipping to America's so expensive I think I want to spend half of my life in America how old are you planning on moving to [Laughter] know if it's like how long is that though because I couldn't easily be like I don't know I was just thinking driving here cuz I like to think about it so much like I feel guilty that I haven't gone back cuz I'm like I'm gonna go every year I want playing every year yeah what you don't wanna go by yourself I would go by myself then go it's not that I never have the time like I could make the time but it's just like you should do I have no idea why I didn't get a bed I literally didn't get a bed until last week I've lived in this house for two years and I have only I lived on I slept on the couch for one of those years and then in like in maybe like April I bought a mattress I did not know this about you so you wouldn't want to be anywhere else tape I don't think I would move to America you said you want to live there and half my life that what is also six months of the year let's move you know just like I don't know be over there for business like have to be there Allah I don't like you pay that to the point where I don't fantasize about it New York yeah should go you just have it you deserve like it to have a break every once in a while it's probably good for you debt creatively okay anyway I'll go check out next up because it's also like genuinely I'm biased as a non friend cuz I hate the guy it's amazing and also you should go watch our video it's like huh why is it so long by the way it was pretty good I watch it two times yeah I actually did too I've like to just left it on I love it anyway bye thank you so much for watching this video I hope you really liked it I'm sorry if it was
