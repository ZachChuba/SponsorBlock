way back in 2017 I once made a scathing review over popular YouTube animator Tim Tom and after posting the video I didn't think much of it afterwards but of course sometimes things have a funny ha-ha hehehe way of happening now this is the story on how Tim Tom when I got here in this hotel room owned by Disney which happens to be next to a convention center full of other youtubers but this video will mainly focus on this guy I spent a good chunk of a day hanging out or in this case end with a surprisingly tall Tim and in majority of the time we are exchanging feedback and helpful advice to one another and because we look so much alike I decided to wear red so you wouldn't confuse us but before we get into what we talked about I must warn you that the end of the video there will be a contest for a drawing tablet so watch out but watch in for today's sponsor skill share skills shares a maybe next year two years ago at the beginning of the review Tim Tom and I actually well-spoken DMS which is something you should never do when trying to resolve an issue considering that cadence and even tone and words are not translated well and taxed right off the bat I made a negative impression on him and he made one on me which prompted me to start the video like this thinking about doing a skit in your video regarding it I'd actually prefer that you didn't make a video about me please when you read my thing or whatever instead of instead of reading it like a normal person you're like actually prefer a funnier if I did read it like I actually think that would be funnier moving along when I started to do these critiques and reviews I actually had to go through a lot of trial and error the worst thing I did was trying to find nitpick some people's contents and then blow them out of a person just for a video and that's what happened when I talked about his titles and reveal okay we need to completely change the title to like no good guy oh let's just hit play no it's the head like two five minute market and still be talked about your biddies no I'm talking about video titles apparently just that another issue you'll see is how I didn't understand how something entirely worked and if I just did more research and shortened it the critique would have actually been well worth while people usually take these out when they're done applying shade onto the drawing and leaving them in seems a bit lazy yeah so so we had like the Aldean uploaded to the website which had like the the breaks between the wells and you were like we spent three minutes you spent three minutes talking about how appendages perfect yeah but despite all that I was actually surprised that Tim time would even talk to me after I treated him so badly in that review I gotta tell you I never would have thought two years ago that right now we would be sitting in a hotel room together watching this video hey things happen this is the most surprising thing that's happened to me in a long time I never would have thought that I'd end up here me neither - in California and after seeing Tim's newer content he's even speaking to his music producer I can safely say that he's gotten better and here's the clip or two to show the fact that he has backgrounds animation and the sink public speaking is one of the most common fears so you may find that shocking some people spend their whole year waiting for their favorite holiday Christmas Halloween Arbor Day I need reliable updates that we're not gonna make our quarterly targets and I won't get to keep pretending this is a business but going back to back then at the time the end made Stuart own community was growing at a surprising rape and I went in at the beginning as well so meant when they were improving their content I had to work on and improve myself and my content but time goes by and people change and I actually feel more part of the community than I ever did before which is part of the reason why I went to VidCon and 2019 you [Music] besides meeting timtom I met other people as well so for a brief summary VidCon Choi 19 was alright says most the time has spent with my friends Connor Ishmael Austin Joel and George around California I met some nice fans animators and a few people I once made videos on along the way I also met Jayden animations as dad and he was quite nice to talk to moving along the memorable part of the trip was the food one the notable locations was Pollo Loco where me my friends got breakfast there one day and it was great and another place I'd recommend looking for food is the area of little tokyo near los angeles we went there because our friend Austin went to meet some voice actors for a Netflix show that he likes but the line was a bit too long for us so he just headed out to the other shops in in the area so Connor Ishmael Jo and I just headed on down to this game shop and I found some nice import games from Japan as you can see here I got them for the novelty however I wouldn't roll out me making something for my second channel with them finishing up the trip we ate at this place and then I headed down to the airport I spent about 6 days in California but should have stayed more to enjoy the sights sorry that was a bit short but if you want a more detailed report just head on down to Connors and Isis discord server and we could talk as I mentioned before it would be a little more engaging if we just have a group call on the server this trip counts as a tax write-off because I put it in the video that's how it works right then you look into this [Music] understanding the people behind the pen does give me a better appreciation for the craft but also helps me critique better reviews must be insightful and helpful to the creator so just nitpicking details like how this specific frame looks weird won't be as help for powerful compared to why using an XLR microphone is better than using blue Yeti and watching the old review of Tim Tom with Tim Tom you know I see progress and improving over time yeah clearly improved or I mean I do think that pretty much every video has been better than the last joy so forth so isn't perfect but stuff like this just motivates me to try better and well be better in acknowledging your faults and working on to improve them helps speaking of helps I helps you watched out for the drawing contests because it's here I've noticed on my discord server and Twitter page that a lot of people are using their phones to draw the prize of this contest is the gaol - 620 which not only connects to a computer but actually connects to a phone so the contest rules goes as follows the topic draw a comic with your OCS secondly the contest will end and the winner will be announced on August 25th 2019 so you have some time to make it look good thirdly when you submit your comic be sure to tell me what medium you used such as phone paper or whatever and then follow me on Twitter and at me when you're done so I can see it also subscribe to my channel but that has nothing to do the contest double special thanks to Tim Tom for helping reach out to me and actually well talk to me and change my mind a few things that was cool of him and regular special thanks to viewers like you thank you and I'll see you next time so have a great [Music]
