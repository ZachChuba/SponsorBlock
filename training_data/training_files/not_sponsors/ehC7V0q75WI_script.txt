for 10 weeks 20 runescape content creators will be competing for a massive prize along the way they'll face never before seen challenges brutal eliminations and a couple of twists welcome to the gilanor games [Music] welcome back to challenge number six on the second season of guillenore games so far this season we've had five challenges and so far five different golden apron winning teams the level of competition this season has been phenomenal congratulations to you all for making it to the halfway point of the season i'm feeling good right now currently golden apron wearer finally got the win last week it's time to start streaking all the way to the final i would love it if we just took home every single week from here been a few bridges last week may have shown my sneaky little head i'm over this alliance solo mission and his alliance team virfo zulu are our own thing now we don't have any friends it's all about getting the win all about getting those aprons today's challenge is something that i'm incredibly excited for you'll notice that we're standing near the lovely city of lumbridge the starting place for every new account made in runescape and in just a little bit you'll all be on new accounts as well today's challenge is called total level recall all of you are going to be making brand new normal accounts starting on tutorial island your goal is simple gain as many total levels as possible in one hour you'll start off as a free-to-play player but if you'd like you can find me in the lumbridge courtyard where i'll have a bond three stamina potions and a ring of dueling to give to you from there it's up to you to figure out the best way to gain total levels over the course of the hour the team with the highest combined total level on their accounts will win the golden aprons be safe from elimination and get to send one team straight into the banning we and a great product the issue is the possibilities are endless it's all about coming up with the most creative best way to get the total levels and give you the advantage over the rest of the people there's not a clear cut meta which you can just kind of think of on the spawn follow go ahead and make your accounts and we'll get started good luck [Music] so when you've only got 10 minutes to figure out how to get a lot of levels and you don't really know what you're doing it's very difficult not a lot of time to plan something that's potentially going to send you out the door i kind of just go into shock every time you announce something because i know we have no time to think about it and it's like all pressure's on and it's like being called on by the teacher to answer something in front of the class except if you don't answer it correctly you get expelled the highest combined total level in one hour wins today's challenge your time starts now way out of the game here doing all right look at us oh we just need to remember what we do as soon as we get through uh can you guess which name i am perhaps only if i see it something to do with skill specs i'd imagine buy skill spec i find it incredibly difficult to theory craft on runescape it's not my forte i don't really i've been doing the same thing on runescape for like the last six years i don't really add or take away anything to what i do i basically had to trust in solo's big galaxy brain game knowledge yeah that's good because we're right near each other so we can stay with each other through the whole way really that should be the plan so if one of us gets stuck like at least we're doing the same thing i was kind of happy about it because i made a lot of new accounts but getting skill total levels so i guess straight off the bat the first thing we thought of was which quests are going to give us a easier levels waterfall that's instantly 60 levels we might die into the fire giants quest is going to be the strategy for sure oh mate we're smoking look at us this is a rank one two right there boys who can get the highest total level from scratch this is such an interesting challenge so many different routes you can take let's go our second correct let's see where sweet white super soup tutorial island smashed it i'm the first one trading soup i've got my bond i've got my staminas and i'm flying straight into pay-to-play oh come on ah he's the legend just pickpocket the man wearing the bridge to five feeling as well our main consideration was how much money should we try and make to be able to spend on skills obviously time making money probably not gonna be training your skills but you can buy stuff on the ground exchange and then try and get a massive total level we also looked at doing a few quests to try and get the highest total level possible okay okay he just gave it to me nice nice nice i got my mom can i trade him yeah easy money baby so the plan was to get the 10k from stronghold security because that 10k can be used to get a few herbal levels if you find making levels fletching you name it and also to buy quest irons panicked i'm panicked our plan for the first 10 minutes was to grab our staminas run to the stronghold of security grab the 10k and then go do the daddy's home quest daddy's home gives you 26k worth of supplies after finishing it as well as 9 construction levels so not only would we get a ton of cash but we'd also get some construction levels and we thought that was the best plan i got the bond i got my i got my bond as well our plan is to do a bunch of quests and maybe spend the rest of the time buying some stuff for the ge and training our skills up hopefully ending up at the top unreal rs yeah that's him we had a plan written down we had a lot of questing in there and uh selling the stamina pots at the start and we thought we were had a really good plan now if i want to convert it it's going to be 464k i knew it was that i knew it was that that was big time oh well looks like that's big time so the game plan was one of us was going to be a member and the other person was going to sell the bond and share the money little did we know what as soon as you trade the bond you buddy lose all the bloody money that ripped the sale in our ship to start off with so we were flapping around the start dude okay i'm trying to talk to this kid maybe there is no teleport bro is there teleport i don't think there is tutorial island went pretty well plan now is to go to the stronghold security i had a genius idea of mini game teleport into soul wolf and that got us ahead of the game okay tell us about the soul wars on the mini game telly do you think that works yeah it actually works it works i got it as well so we started yep and then teleport with the vampire directly i think it's the last option to get the teleport stuff i'll work a little more where can i do it and then yes yes yep cool [Music] let's go to edgeville what are you doing click on the cross i just stamina that 80 run and i'm booking it this dude's walking off realized i hadn't unloaded my staminas so i've lost stamina jimmy flies past saying nice run so already i'm two minutes in i feel like i'm gonna be honest i need to buy a plank times 10. an absolute certainty we've got to do the waterfall quest it gives 30 attack and 30 strength that is 60 levels that's so huge on an early account we're also looking at ways to make money now the obvious choice is the stronghold of security but we think we might sell a stamina do daddy's home get some construction levels and then get 25k worth of supplies from the crate i might die oh my nah oh my god i just got hit six yeah i got ahead of fire no way i died alex are you serious alex dude just kidding i'm alive he's such a he's so i mean i might die i've got no food i'm not gonna lie to you i'm not gonna lie i might actually die he can hit seven can't he oh i made it jesus christ i'm doing pretty quick here i'm not even gonna lie to you you know me i'm i'm very experienced in the stronghold of security i've come first out of thousands of people like quite a couple times so i know my way through that maze it turns out i went the wrong way oh i think i've just gone the wrong way did i go the wrong way you'd think that with torvesta having rushed this stronghold 20 30 times as he loves to brag so many times about he'd know the correct like path to go three minutes into his run and i hear him go wait wait i've gone the wrong way what do you mean you've gone the wrong way for this three floors just three paths just go i've done this thing 20 times and dead my mind and i've gone the wrong way you can't make it up so you said no 10k just five yeah if we do daddy someone we just sell the supplies then yeah virf's only doing it too yeah he just left after uh after the five i'm heavily wondering if this is worth it with the money from the quest but we get but i'm gonna get the 5k and that's it yeah definitely [Music] [Laughter] about 12 times [Music] oh my god i'm fine i'm walking back i have no run energy this is a disaster what happened i should have bought like super energy pots at least i ended up only getting 5k out of the stronghold because i didn't want to go another level i had no more food and because of not getting the final 5k i didn't have enough money to do daddy's home so i had to start selling staminas and that ended up costing me later when i didn't have any run energy left it was an absolute steaming pile of poop yeah i've done it love that 16 already all right daddy's home dude oh we get a crate full of stuff and i can sell that all on the g for money oh my god i've got house halves and nails and how much is this going to be worth the ge myth nails were bowling okay got 25k right now daddy's home is done everything is going perfect right now we're just currently enchanting rings of recoil at the grand exchange to make money and also train our magic levels up for potentially doing some combat related quests later on so we're making money we're getting stats we're doing really well right now so far with me in solar mission and the reason why we've been working so well so far is that i'm good at following instructions his instructions are great he's very concise easy to get along with so he'll give me instructions i follow them and it's worked out really really well so far oh my god he's telling me about his life as a carpenter i don't give a about you i hate this guy i'm just forgetting items like i just don't have the items i need i don't understand how to get things there's like these weird-ass planks that only exist by taking some you find in a bag to the plank maker the sawmill he tells you to yourself and you run back and you fix things and then your nails i can't break in the nails dude i don't have enough nails left oh no this is a disaster i broke 18. barely complete the museum i think we put it off more than we can chew the thing is it obviously took a long time getting the 10k but look what we can do with that 10k we can complete these easy quests we'll see we'll see we'll see we'll see and then towards the end once we figure out if we kind of can't request we can literally just spend this money on like buying stuff for crafting okay uh what do i need and teleporting to lauren nothing i guess so the plan was to use the money from daddy's home to fund our magic training and we'd basically just cast spells on random things as we'd go along anywhere and eventually uh the plan was to do fight arena fight arena gives a ton of attack and thieving xp i believe you get just about 43 levels from completing the quest and we thought this is perfect because we'll also get magic xp during that and you get money from the quest oh where are my mind runes i didn't bring my mind runes bro neither did i oh my god okay go castle was quick quick quick quick quick get your mind no clown walls to get your run energy oh it's fine it's fine so we'd gone to witch's house originally realized we couldn't kill the witch's experiments with the hp or the runes that we had or the food that we have so we went back got more runes like we spent a big majority like when you only have an hour 10 minutes is a lot of time and we're going we're spending 10 minutes going back to varrock getting runes getting food trust me trust me we'll be fine trust me i've i have heard that one before i've done the the waterfall quest 30 40 times on accounts before never once have i been one banged by the moss giants i've already gone all right i've been one bangs i've done this quest three million times in my life i have never once been one banged oh death i've got a time challenge and you're trying to speak to me man's got to get his earned back we got nothing left either of course not only do i end up getting one banged by the moss giants dave also gets one banged by the giants they've stupidly left his teleport outside the cave entrance because he's an absolute doughnut so he had no way of getting back so i was stood there waiting like sitting at a duck at a tombstone waiting for this guy to come back so we could try it again like i've never been one banged in nearby 15 years i've never been one banged coincidentally both of us get one banged bollocks eyes what a rigged video rigged video is  usual at this point of the video we thought we were done we had no progress we were dead multiple times i was walking because i dropped my hammer couldn't teleport back it was ruins what major are you like 15 um currently 17 but thinking bear in mind we've got to get xp from doing which is house 30 minutes left holy but we've got gp part of the reason we sat there in chanting rings was because we were thinking of ideas what makes these challenges so difficult is we have literally 10 minutes before we start to think and get a plan out of nowhere so this time allows us time to think about our next move plan out some quests to do plan out some stats of train and really just get over the shock factor of having the challenge announced and instantly going let's focus on just like getting some skills in the bag by cooking and fire making yeah i don't think we have time for everything i think we should do waterfall over the night sort yeah after witch's house we should just do waterfall i think yeah and then use that money and just and then we can come down here and do it if we have time after we sold our staminas we very quickly realized that we are not going to have enough time to get everything done that we want and we have to start shedding off some things so we can get as much done as possible this couldn't have gone any worse we've been last here oh actually we could have teleported away can't i don't think you need to get the stuff from out oh i've there's no way it's me i've never been killed i've never been killed i've never been killed during this quest oh me you've got all my runes as well i can't even carry on [Music] honestly at this point i thought it was all over it also didn't help that i died a second time when i went back into the um burial chamber luckily it wasn't too bad because i already had the game knickers on i could tell i bought straight back run over but still it's a good two three minutes out of the hour which is a lot of time the end of the day holy this is taking so long to light one log are you serious bro yeah i like a request we're carrying questions like this is i'm not entirely sure we've left ourselves enough time here to do the waterfall quest it's absolutely essential that we get this finished i think the penny is starting to drop but we are running out of time right now all right i've done it going for rock i'm 30 attacking um you you you've just done the opposite of what i've told you aren't oh my god like do you get going get going get going it's fine i'm it gee it's fine this is what i don't get you're clever but you're so sh it's because i'm rushed and i'm panicking that's what it is i just get  king don't give me that bullsh it's a game calm you man right it's done it's done it's done it's done it's done right i'm coming back [Music] honestly i'll be happy if we do like everything we have on our list like i thought we'd have a lot of time left after we finished everything on the list but i'd be happy if we just get the list done i hope everyone else is also just melting no way no they're thriving everyone's thriving everything's going according to plan no one's having trouble except for us okay bro i'm actually gonna die should i just leave there's a no safe spot should i just leave well you're gonna have to we can't do it i'm gonna go ahead doric's quest real quick  dude all right so we're 30 minutes in we got nothing done [Laughter] well actually we have nine hunter and slayer i'm not gonna lie and tan tan mining i died what i died for the skeleton doing druidic ritual i died to a skeleton oh okay okay well i'm on the first wave i'm using these casts and i haven't eaten anything yet either so i genuinely think we're not gonna get this done out bro i don't even know how to say i swear to god i died bro i don't figure out how to stay spotted i died like a two on the first form i don't even think i inflicted any damage on it before dying at that point we're just like bro like what do we what are we even doing here like what are we doing here so we left like we had no place being in this challenge so we just left okay yeah i'm not even going to bother doing the hard work i logged out bro ah whatever you know we've had our first set of hiccups a diet or a skeleton and then i was like okay we could we can do this let's just keep going there's like no come on don't give up and then he he ends up dying to the witch's house boss so i'm just like you know what like should we just call it a day we've got 60 minutes the other teams have been super efficient and we're here dying to skeletons and witch's house for getting runes and everything we might as well just log out at this point oh my god [Music] 15 minutes holy sh oh i think we found this oh i'm starting to think this might be a bad idea yeah we just sell everything and then use the money to train i just i'm trying to think about how long waterfall is i don't think waterfall is worth it to be honest we can probably even with the teleports and running north and all that or plan was to do a combination of questing and skilling but it was really uh chaotic and it was really hard to plan all kinds of things went through my mind and i was kind of like brainstorming while doing the thing no big mess ups i would say just not plan the route correctly time wise yeah so i got eight magic levels and 14 whatever levels that's that's 22 levels we got pretty quickly i'd say okay oh nice we got the run energy while killing the thing i honestly think it might be better to just go to the grand exchange and buy raw scaling supplies with the rest of our money like raw shrimp raw or bronze bars and just send it like i think that's actually better than completing monk's friend at this point just about every time stoop announced how much time we had left we freaked out and we had no idea how we were gonna do the things that were on our list so instead of completing another quest i just decided to liquidate my entire inventory so after selling all my supplies i decided to buy raw shrimp to get that cooking up and then i decided to buy logs to get fire making up we go we made it halfway into the gill in our games and messiah cooking sardines together [Laughter] unbelievable ended daylight everyone's sweating i bet they're not even communicating look at us we're just relaxing cooking we're just relaxing we're in sync uh to be honest it was a little bit depressing we were we were sat at the g together cooking sardines they was making the fires i was cooking the fish and we were just kind of laughing to ourselves how probably verb and zulu are off with 400 total me and day four it was all over that point so we're just kind of chilling to be honest cooking cooking sardines and this is what people want to see isn't it yeah it is no one wants to see efficiency do you want to see bromance and this is what they get [Music] the infamous waterfall quest and the infamous moss giant that can hit four teams me and mr guns chile we had an amazing strategy for this we hopped to a pvp world we were gonna box each other we're gonna have each other's backs and box each other take the items box each other on the way out but moss giant it can't even touch us we're not gonna get one hit we're gonna be absolutely fine with this quest okay get right right down the side of it search it okay box again okay going through okay nice all right up you're running you're right run yeah okay uh we just need to get past this thing good boxing i already got that one [Music] where is he he's just gone absolutely missing left me for dead a moss giant comes straight over nine to the face and i am in lumbridge and our run is an absolute tatters we're so pushed for time can we get this done i don't even know from here we both came up the idea just to dump the rest of our money into baby dragon bones head over to yalta and just see how many prayer levels we can get because the bones don't get eaten by the ultra all the time boom hidden xp right one bone got me level three kept the bone level five still got the bone this is a good this is a big dub seven nine ten [Music] eleven thirteen prayer i got from it that's a dub if you ask me look at these clicks i've got 16 beautiful you got well lucky all right we have five minutes left jim oh good thank you this did not go how i expected it to go yeah it's okay i always think that training just with the money you got is better like just yeah i agree but you wouldn't know that get power strat jump my cash into bones dragon phones oh my god that's genius at the last second it occurred to me that i still have cash left over and you told me we could use player owned houses so i bought dragon bones i teleported the house and i got like nine levels really quick at the very end by just putting bones on an altar in somebody's house that would have been so much better god dammit i wish i got nine prayer nice yeah oh that was so epic that would have been so much better god damn it i wish i did that solo mission died at the mass giants and he basically just said to me look you've got to just go on and try and finish this quest i had one job and that was just to finish the quest [Music] i have not known who just died so far joan no i didn't use glorious urn on the chalice you said one minute left as i was in the room and then i realized oh i don't even have the amulet i can't get through the door we're screwed one minute no oh no we're gonna come last we actually are we actually are some little news will have just beaten us i think we did horribly honestly no we did that trust me we did bad i really don't think we've done well here dave that was so fun welcome back from a difficult but entertaining challenge lots of different strategies and plans used some worked some didn't but before we announce the winners we have to get to the losers one team had both members die during the challenge and it demoralized them so much that they flat out quit halfway through the challenge with only 120 total levels gained between them ditter bitter and torvesta are today's last place team did you even leave tutorial island we do uh we tried we did try oh my god torvester and his partner ditta quitter what is up with that he gave up he joking they're supposed to put allied with us but that's so big for us i'm so gassed because they get an extra vote when they're banning i have no idea what they are doing because they're pretty much guaranteed to get voted in now everyone's gonna pounce on them and they've just given us the biggest get out of jail free card ever your team will now have one vote heading into today's banning just use it at this point and if you think about it there has up again i guess i up but imagine if i had a really clean run he still died witch's house has he done anything good in the gillandog game so far last month standing sparta i'll give him that now for the winners the two teams with the highest total levels were settled in jimmy and tanzu and vertozo no no way tanzania no way go on go on come on please please i literally have my hand together praying please come on say tanzu and potoso the boys have pulled this through we need them first if they're not first we are definitely in the banning there is no way settles and jimmy are not going to be putting us in the banning so i am hoping so much that they've managed to pull out the bag right here with a combined total level of 322 the winners of today's challenge are tanzu and vertozoo [Music] so [Music] an incredibly impressive performance they got 53 more levels than second place and finally secure themselves their first golden aprons of the season come on up you guys jesus christ wasn't even close you said those famous little words soup tanzan would say so you have won the challenge let me tell you you know when you put that apron over our head that was like the first time i put fury on that's what it felt like that is exactly what it felt like power in my chest we're slow burners but when it gets to these later rounds smoke everyone no problem 50 levels you're having a laugh sue the guillemot games is full of the best talent across gilano today i had to question that i'm gonna be honest with you i mean me and tanzu are the most inefficient ineffective runescape players in history and the fact that we managed to walk in there big balls and absolutely steam trained it shows a lot about the people in there today and i think they need to hang their heads in shame it's now time to head to the cove we don't have many of these voting sessions left so cast your vote wisely cause i'm coming for you [Applause] [Music] i'm coming for you well you know i got some beef with solo mission but this week we're going to go dinner and tour but the hope here is that ritoso and tanzu send solo in there and that dinner into vesta get to get in there as well would be a good matchup i vote dinner and torvasta because they already have a vote it's it's a difficult one even though we have the power of our alliance we did want to snake solo but tanza and vetozzo don't want to we're voting for settled and jimmy i'm voting for jimmy and settled but i'm not trusting the alliance right now solo missions told us that he's voting for jimmy and settled i hope that's true dinner and torvesta cause dinner just called swamp a when he got pulled in here so that's my vote today is a very special situation 10 people left two of those people can't vote because they have aprons which leaves eight votes there is a lot of possibility for a tiebreaker here now tiebreaker is actually getting last place in the challenge we've now teamed up with verfin zulu which means we have four votes on ditter and vesta plus their loss in today's challenge guarantees that they go in so that's our vote my vote is for should be unsettled but i'm not confident in who's waiting for who this is the day that all the alliances crumble my vote is for settled and jimmy i think it's the last day of the young savages alliance today welcome back from the cove it's wonderful to see your faces again two teams received votes today ditter bitter and torvesta and settled in jimmy both of your teams received four votes however because torvesta and ditter got last in today's challenge they receive one extra vote which puts them at five votes and means they have been voted into today's banning no way i was extremely worried i did not think we were going to survive another banning like we can't we can't keep getting lucky on this tanzan vertoso big decision time which team will you be sending into the banning versus ditter and torvesta it's getting tricky because we're very suspect of solo and we're very very tempted to chuck him in i reached out to tanza before the voting process and told him snake against snake put in solo mission make him fight did rentor vesta for what he did last week it was all down to this tanzan vertozo had to pick what team are they going with i make the regrettable decision of being the one to confirm who else is in the elimination and that is going to be [Applause] settled in jimmy i apologize what tangent vertoso here's the thing with them i know the three of us as a group me vertoso and tanzu we have this mutual respect i figured they wouldn't do that to us you know we're like the funny guys they're funny i'm funny i was very shocked for this big announcement that they had they ended up choosing us it was very very shocking but it is what it is that's the game jimmy and settled chosen for their first banning come on up you guys we were very close on the edge of voting for solo mission because i'm really not sure about that guy every single person has called him a snake i don't know whether he's a snake against everyone other than the young savages because he's not tried to double cross us yet he could have double crossed us multiple times and he hasn't i honestly thought we were putting in birth and zulu but then jen changed it to uh settled in jimmy because ditto said we can beat settlement jimmy so all right we're doing it for you prove it i got the feeling that solo would win the banning and if we put him in that's bad news for us so keep him in get rid of someone else this is a big banning over one million youtube subscribers combined between these two teams and one of them is going home to fight for your place to stay in the game you guys will be playing an elimination that's coming back from last season it's time for a puzzle today's elimination is called spawn camping each team will be sent a list of the same five items that have a spawn location in the game the items are going to be scrambled up into an anagram so you'll have to unscramble the words find the item and bring it back to me the items cannot be bought from any shops or the grand exchange they must be picked up from their spawn location the team that brings me the correct five items first will win the banning and stay in the game loser goes home wait can you repeat that all from the beginning dude holy so as soon as i saw it was a puzzle challenge and we were going against settled and jimmy i kind of knew it was over then for us especially considering me and torvesta's game experience within this ain't the greatest we don't really know where to go around finding items and like that after seeing ditter and torvesta's performance in that last challenge jimmy and i get into the call and we are very confident that we're about to win this there's no way that the team that just quit 30 minutes into a challenge is about to win this i'll meet both teams at the dual arena and we'll get started [Music] discussion is key focus on unscrambling as soon as you know one go for it try and unscramble the others while you're going through it organize your inventory your teleports along the way and then get yourself to the next item as soon as possible so we needed teleports we needed to know where all the items were going to be or have some way of finding them we just had a wikipedia page for like findable items on runescape opened so when the challenge starts we get a list of anagrams five items that are scrambled up and we have to unscramble those items and find their natural spawn location in the game jimmy and i decided to prepare just by pulling up the wiki list of possible items it could be and that's just about it i mean i have a lot of game knowledge on item spawns and along with the list of the wiki i thought it was going to be just fine alright guys this is it a massive banning the prize pool is looking huge i would not want to get eliminated here here we go work from the bottom i'll work from the top okay yep let's do it you try and work out the last two i'll try and work out the first three okay here's the list good luck dude i don't i can't figure out any of these bro that looks like dude god i hate this you know when i say that when you announce things when whenever you announce challenges i go cross-eyed well this one i felt good going in and then in order to solve it i had to force myself to go for cross-eyed and i hated that co-lesson oak shield oak shield yeah shield oh okay i know where oak shield is okay any idea what mine is dude like first glance um leather boots leather boots oh crude okay okay one's red spider eggs i'm gonna go for it okay and another one's oak shield apparently oak shield yeah yeah table ranging guild okay go there go there go there ranging guild oak shield where is it uh table by shield master where the is the shield master i don't know okay i've got the oak shield got sealed leather boots leather boots okay i got red spider eggs cats i got red spider eggs i'm going to the fish and go okay i'm going lumbered for leather boots while running to it i was second guessing myself i'm like wait this is called a wooden shield but maybe it's oak like i know this spawn is here as soon as i pick up the wooden shield i'm like no this is wrong wait what what oak shield oh  this is wrong it's wrong my heart sinks like at that point i knew that if we lose this is on me like i am absolutely responsible for our loss if we lose this okay no yours is fine i i know what i did wrong red spider eggs okay so that's karanja uh something pot the hell is that boilerpot i couldn't figure out what the first word was because i lit my brain shut down i was panicking it was boiler i was like it said boilerpot with the boilerpot lobster pot lobster pot lobster pot nice all right we have four of them just the middle one okay where

fishing guild oh it's over here it's in the corner okay i got the lobster part i think definitely having the right teleports on you made a big factor i had the max cape which teleported me to the

get it yeah i think we got it i [Music] dude we were so hyped we were so hyped that was more hype than us winning like the lms challenge that was just i feel at this point we shouldn't really even be preparing for the challenges we should be preparing for the eliminations because it seems like we're just gonna have to win every single one and hey if it has to be so it has to be so i think we can do it did they get it yeah no way i got it this is one moment where i should not have tried to rely on game knowledge and just googled it but i've never seen an oak shield so i feel horrible i genuinely feel horrible i know that was entirely my fault jimmy i i should have done better i'm sorry settled can say he threw all he wants but i mean my dumb ass was sitting in my poh like trying to figure out what the word said for two minutes straight so i was definitely the weight there that he had on his shoulders he did great considering you know he got the three things i got the two scavenging i guess is not my strong suit in a five minute time span so hey that's okay did her bitter and torvesta win their third banning of the season these guys do not want to go home go ahead and rejoin the group we've survived another elimination the third one you just can't get rid of us just stop trying please prevesta and dinnerbitter are like lazarus like they just keep getting risen from the dead they get knocked in the band three times are you kidding me settled in jimmy you guys were absolutely amazing this season you want yourself some golden aprons had some great performances it just wasn't in the cards for you today i think at the end of the day i'd have to say chile and solo mission win this uh they have played a good game they masterminded something last time that somehow they're not getting punished for but i think my bets would have to be on them uh good luck fellas soul mission is a snake that is all we will definitely miss you take care guys [Music] honestly i was more devastated that settled was feeling as bad as he did because i know it meant a lot to him you know we made it farther than kevin and that's kind of what brightened our mood at the end of it is you know maybe we did win our own version of guillenore games because we made it farther than kevin that guy sucks [Music] four teams remain guys we're getting dangerously close to the final if there was ever a time to win the golden aprons it's now it sucks that i'm the last of the n a i'm gonna try my best to do them proud this is bad because settled and jimmy were kind of our closest alliance this far in and to see them go now means that we truly are our own team for ourselves because of the stage we're at now over halfway through there's there's less teams therefore losing is so much more detrimental now that plus one vote means so much solo mission and guns chili they gotta go they gotta go and i've i've started putting things in action we're already pretty sus with them at the last banning if everything goes to plan if either us or tanzanian virtuoso can win the next challenge we are hoping to get zulu and versus seoul mission and guns chile they've got to go see you soon [Music] if we were going to make a move we should have made it today we should have made the move today but i don't have the heart in me to betray surly mission when he's been you know pretty loyal whoever wins next week will have the power and that'll determine how the end of the series takes off basically four teams remain and we've been strong allies with every single one of these teams pretty much from the start and with the reason they're here they're part of the reason that we're here but now there's only four left it's dog eat dog out here we don't have any alliances right now we're gonna sweet talk people of course we don't want to get banned but at the end of the day we're just going to choose whoever we want next week no alliances no game playing we're just on it to win from here [Music] [Music] so i bet you're all wondering why you're here so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
