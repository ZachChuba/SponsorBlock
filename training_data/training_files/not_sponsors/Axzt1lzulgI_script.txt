Proctor's content centers around cross country motorcycle road trips where Bravo rides along nestled between mr. Proctor and his motorcycles gas tank as they tackle everything from long stretches of highway to rugged mountainous terrain mr. Proctor and Bravo have written thousands of miles together and spent countless hours exploring camping and conquering new lands in March of 2019 mr. Proctor and Bravo set out on a multi-state trip beginning in Tennessee and crossing through Culver City for Nia on August 13th where he was stopped by officer Hernandez of the Culver City Police Department for allowing Bravo to ride on the motorcycle so you don't think that you can get arrested you got this running then maybe I should arrest you and we'll test it to see if that your speed that I saw you going on national I was doing 40 in the zoning and your dog laying on your gas container what you have setup for your dog do I guess hold on tight but if he decides that a pit bulls some somewhere around here when you're at a red light and a pit bull attacks him what do you think he's gonna do he's gonna run or fight he's gonna jump off your motorcycle do you understand I have Tennessee plates and my driver's license is from Tennessee and that we didn't fly here with this motorcycle we rode it here I've written over 12,000 probably 13,000 miles since March okay I passed many pit bulls I passed German Shepherds I passed down Nations any kind of dog and animal you can think of we've been in almost every situation that could possibly cause him to want to jump off of the motorcycle he has not jumped off the most what about he and I are both very skilled at doing this goes up to him and tries to bite him what is he gonna do I I need to know what the outcome of this is gonna be because I don't we do this or let me just go ahead and arrest you for this violation and then you'll know the outcome this is called animal cruelty this is not is not a citation it's not animal if you feel it out listen budget misses certain I'm not done here yet I'm thinking about arresting you right now believe it or not this is arrest of all it's all on video your dogs holding on for dear life on your motorcycle when he's not tethered he's just holding on to the front gas container so this is where we're gonna go if I feel that you understand what's going on here that makes it different did you telling me this is not animal I'm just telling you nothing has happened so I'm forced with the decision here to give you a citation for animal cruelty or take you in for it I could do either one you got you got ID here I'll take the citation oh that's not your choice so I can carry it it's not your choice everybody would likely to carry on after they get arrested I just don't understand you're the part where you don't see the danger in all of this I really don't understand it you think that I don't see the possibility of danger with my dog on the motorcycle there's a possibility of danger of stepping on your front door there's possibly a pain for me right I'm not doing anything wrong show me show me what he looked into can you show me that there's a log what is just her address hang on so a mission you citation laws regarding animals riding in open vehicles vary from state to state with some states outlawing the act completely in some states having little to no restriction the law that officer Hernandez cited California Penal Code 597 a states that whoever carries any domestic animal in a cruel or inhumane manner is guilty of a misdemeanor the code does not clearly define the phrase in a cruel or inhumane manner which renders the practical enforcement of this law inherently subjective and based mostly on the opinion of the acting officer an officer may cite or arrest a citizen for whatever action or circumstance he believes satisfies the language of the law the presiding judge will ultimately determine whether or not the officers arrest or citation was based on an accurate interpretation of the code nonetheless officer Hernandez does have the authority to enforce the law as he understands it and leave it to a court to decide if his interpretation was correct due to the ambiguous nature of code five nine seven A's phrasing it is likely that officer Hernandez would be entitled to qualified immunity in the event that a judge were to rule against him [Music] semadar now in Memphis Tennessee Ida localize the law chuckles dogleg right up Richmond Jeremih garage after a seven-hour ordeal Wednesday at Van Nuys Municipal Court the rock hardly were declared not guilty of violating section below the photo section 2 1 7 1 2 - a of the case that mr. Proctor is referring to appeared in a 1996 article in the Los Angeles Times and detailed the courtroom appearance of motor cyclist Jeremiah kirbridge in his Siberian Husky Harley in the case mr. kirbridge was charged with violating California Vehicle Code two one seven one two a which states that a person driving a motor vehicle shall not knowingly permit a person to ride on a vehicle or upon a portion of a vehicle that is not designated or intended for the use of passengers municipal judge Michelle R Rosenblatt dismissed the case declaring that the language of code 2 171 to a only applies to people and that the law mentions nothing that suggests it applies to animals or any other thing mr. kirbridge was allowed to go free and continue riding his motorcycle with his dog mr. Proctor is operating under the false assumption that Judge Rosenblatt's decision applies to all other laws within the state of California but the judge's ruling has no bearing on the code that officer Hernandez is referring to code 597 a [Music] because you seem to think I asked well no answer these questions of what can happen if you believe me respectively about the law it's not speculative it's that speculation you speculate what wouldn't happen what would happen to my dog I can't and that's why we are go with y'all just if you would have told me sir this is no no no no this is all just about you talking let me explain this okay because I don't think you understand if you would have told me you know what yeah probably not the best idea in the world this because my dog the Decker that tells me you care about your dog that tells me that Julie that you have a heart for your dog because you're not going to subject it to a roadway where it's going to tumble and tumble and tumble and probably get runned over by other cars while there is no question that mr. Proctor is not in violation of code two one seven one two a and it is debatable whether mr. Proctor is in violation of code five nine seven a however mr. Proctor is clearly in violation of Los Angeles County code one zero eight zero zero one zero which states that no person shall transport any dog in or on the back or bed of any open vehicle while traveling on any County Road subsection B of this code states that this law does not apply to open vehicles which are partially enclosed by stakes racks or something similar which rise at least two feet nine inches above the tops of the sides and back of the vehicle and are designed to prevent the dog from falling or escaping considering that mr. Proctor has no enclosure for Bravo on his motorcycle it is likely that a court would find him in violation of the county code but whether or not officer Hernandez was within jurisdiction to legally enforce the county code is a topic for another video because that's a very cold-hearted that you won't even admit the possibilities you're telling me the law says the law says in the past I'm looking up sections that they woman so I can no of course not the worst stuff but I'm just telling you that I'm telling you you have I could actually book you for this I'm not going to you have an ID and you're not you're not wanted in any state so that's why you're getting a ticket even elite but I can't under the fifth amendment suspects cannot be forced to incriminate themselves and the 14th amendment prohibits coercive questioning by police officers confessions to crimes that are coerced are not admissible against defendants in criminal cases even though they may be true here officer Hernandez states that if mr. Proctor had chosen to verbally acknowledge the danger associated with the dogs riding on motorcycles and admit that he knowingly and carelessly put the dog in danger then the interaction would have had a more positive outcome it appears as though officer Hernandez a statement suggests that if mr. Proctor had admitted to the crime he was being accused of then he would have faced lesser repercussions it could be argued that officer Hernandez is coercing a confession from mr. Proctor and even if mr. Proctor had agreed with the officers opinion it likely would have no bearing on the legitimacy of the charges Kolber City 35:23 [Music] East them East Drive it's at national and Jefferson Boulevard I'll refund Julie yes there's also another violation issue gonna have a beach yes I have a leave yeah well you gotta use it okay well he was on the motorcycle when you stopped me I have a laser you put him on your leash and you Bravo come on load up load up is that East Ham yeah it's East to be pleased him yeah he's very well trained I'll give you that he doesn't mind writing but I'll tell you this he's an animal whether you like it or not he's not a person and I don't want to believe that I feel an animal they're vintage they're gonna act like animals when emergencies occur and you know what he'll probably do is he's so smart do probably try jumping off your motorcycle to try to save himself probably resulting in is that by doing that officer Hernandez issued mr. Proctor a citation for animal cruelty under Section 597 a and allowed mr. Proctor's friend to come pick up Bravo before leaving the scene without further incident mr. Proctor traveled to San Francisco and returned to Culver City for his arraignment where he was notified that the arrest had been changed to a detention and that there was no need to be processed or appear in court the following day mr. Proctor filed a formal complaint against Hernandez that day and internal affairs denied mr. Proctor access to the police report and body cam footage of the interaction citing the pending investigation against officer Hernandez overall officer Hernandez gets a c-minus because although he was within his authority to enforce code five nine seven a he displayed a distasteful lack of professionalism and attempted to coerce mr. Proctor into admitting some degree of guilt throughout the interaction officer Hernandez threatened mr. Proctor with arrest several times for questioning his authority and the officer allowed his ego to dictate the tone of the interaction it certainly could be argued that a dog riding on a motorcycle presents a legitimate safety concern on a public roadway however it could also be argued that a well-trained canine with many hours of riding experience presents less of a threat to public safety than an inexperienced human riding on the back of a motorcycle officer Hernandez refused to acknowledge the context of Bravo's riding experience the courts are charged with the duty of considering the totality of circumstances of any case and it is likely that Bravo's riding experience will play a major role in determining whether his riding conditions were in fact cruel or inhumane mr. Proctor gets a B because although he was misinformed about the legalities surrounding judge Rosenblatt's ruling he still remained calm throughout the encounter refused to admit guilt or agree with officer Hernandez's opinion and did not back down when threatened with arrest mr. Proctor's calm and controlled candor and developed conversational skills served him well during this encounter and I commend him for his wise and strategic use of dialogue while mr. Proctor was technically in violation of a county code whether or not he was in violation of code 597 a is up to the courts but his collected demeanor and intelligently executed opposition to officer Hernandez's charges will likely pay off in the courtroom if you haven't already I highly suggest checking out mr.
