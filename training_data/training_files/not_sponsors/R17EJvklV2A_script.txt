hello and welcome to another video I've had a nightmare with the weather today absolute nightmare been chasing different shots all over and off Yorkshire all day long and it just has not been happening I'm currently racing to a spot that I know quite well to try and capture what I think could be an amazing sunset bomb against the clock it's probably about 20 minutes to sunset I need to be there few minutes before it's about 15 minute walk so it's gonna be tight but I love it if you had to come with me let's go also name on an online store make UX prove with Squarespace right so I've made it I'm in position and I've even made it in enough time to get a time lapse which is what I'm doing here it's a very popular spot this there's other photographers around and the reason being I think at the moment it could be something quite stunning every time I come here to the North Yorkshire Moors there's generally mist or cloud on the horizon and today it's kind of the other way around the sky is full of cloud but right on the horizon there there is that thin band of clear sky when that Sun drops below that cloud line I'm hoping I'm hoping something pretty special is going to happen these clouds will hopefully catch with some nice yellows and oranges and warmth and hopefully we'll get a bit of Sun on Rose be topping there behind me which will make this a really interesting picture I still need to find a composition I got here late so I don't have the best position I want to get some of the Heather in the foreground it's not very colorful this year I was here about this time last year and it was a beautiful purpley pink but it's kind of a bit model this year because maybe because of that really hot weather we had earlier in the season I'm also getting eaten by flies but I'm just gonna let this time-lapse run calm down a little bit because it's been a busy day so far and then try and get a decent composition to get an image it's all gonna be about the sky though today so I'm not that bothered particularly about what's in the foreground so we'll see how we go I think what I've done is gone ahead and jinxed it because I thought we were gonna get a massive amount of color on the road behind me there but when it's dipped below this thicker cloud it's clearly not clear on the horizon so that horizon cloud is there that's pretty difficult to see at the moment I thought I'm certain it was gonna come through but you can sort of see it trying to burn through there's a little red spot there behind the cloud but it's just not happening so I think what I'm gonna do is pack up and we will try again not here we'll go to the beach in the morning so I'll see you bright and early so good morning and it's a pretty beautiful morning down here at the beach in North Yorkshire and we've got a little bit of a sunrise there very small portion of the sky I came here yesterday when it was really busy and there's lots of tourists on the beach and I picked out a composition this composition in fact which I wanted to shoot this morning the weather was forecast to be really nice but again I've been chasing the weather for the last three days the weather forecast it's usually pretty good I've got different apps I use different services like BBC and the Met Office but it's just been worthless of last few days and the weather hasn't really done anything like it said it was going to so I've been chasing it cuz it was always just toying with me saying it was going to be ok but it never was that has forced me out this morning vogue and I think I'm still going to make something decent of the morning because it is beautiful if not much wind and I'm on this beach about 6 o'clock in the morning all by myself so it is a very nice way to start the day right Photography wise I've been desperate to do some photography over the last few days I am set up for my first shot of the day the camera is on the tripod and I'm just using the reflection coming off the water to add interest to the mid-ground of this shot and then I've got some really really interesting moss covered green rocks right in the foreground here and I'm really just that's the main subject of the images these rocks in the foreground then going up into that reflection yellow or in reflection on the sea and then I'm actually breaking the rule of thirds and putting the horizon right up at the top of the frame because we've just got that little slit of lights that you can see there that's right up at the top of the frame anything above that really isn't that interesting it's kind of that gray blue tinge of the sky so I've broken the rule of thirds for that reason because of all the interest he's down at bottom of the frame to make it work I want to extend the exposure time a little bit just to smooth out that wall to give you that nice ethereal feel and that'll work really nicely with a color in the sky the green on the rocks and then that reflection on the surface I think it's gonna work really nicely so to do that I have a six stop filter on the front and then I'm bracketing three shots just to get that exposure right I could use an ND graduate but you know I don't use them so I've bracketed it and that should pick up that exposure really nicely to catch a little bit in the sky as well so we should get the top area of the frame covered in color a little bit now that it's brightened up a bit f11 ten-second exposure to stops either side ISO 200 just to get that exposure time up above 30 seconds of bits and that is that let's just wait and see what that looks like while it exposes yes I think that looks pretty good I will crop it down most likely into a square because all of the interest is in the center of the frame it's sort of darkened off either side because of the focal length I'm actually at 35 millimetres just to get in close as possible onto that sky where these some of their interest is but yeah overall good image nice way to start the day and after three days of toiling to get a shot it's just nice to get something in again [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] most fathers shot it's always good to come back to a location that you know very well especially when things aren't going quite right for you whether it be the weather whether it be your mojo whatever is going on it's always good to come back to a location that you know very well even if you shot it before even if you've captured the great image of it before like I have here it still pays to come back sometimes because capturing that scene in different weather conditions with different clouds we're different anything that's different in the scene will create a different image and that could be even better than the one you've got before and even if it's not it's still worth doing today especially the beach the tide is different to the last time I shot it so the tide is currently going out I usually prefer it when the tide is coming in to take a seascape shot but that's fine it's going out so the groins are kind of sat here on the sand and that is just leading me up but the cameras down low to make those groins a bit bigger in the frame because they're covered in seaweed which is bit green and it's got a lot of different tones in it and it just looks absolutely beautiful I then have the receding water on the sand still she's just creating some reflection that I'm wanting to capture as well just to give it that sauce slightly brighter feel to the images well that's what I'm going for it then obviously leads you into the sea and I'm using the long exposure to smooth that out because it's not really creating any interest unless it's nice and smooth I just want a nice bright image now to do that I have a 10 stop filter on the front I'm an f-16 because that front groin is quite close so that's given me an exposure with the 10 stop ND filter on the front of 3 minutes 25 seconds i'm iso 100 and then in terms of the sky it's quite well it's very cloudy but there is a slight blue tinge to it which is quite interesting there are some fairly interesting shapes running through it as well which hopefully will show some smooth nice smooth shapes in the long exposure as well so I'm currently out 28 millimeters I took my test exposure first then put the 10 stock filter on the front and then I'm shooting that in bold mode with the built-in bulb timer that the Canon 5d for has it's just about just has finished exposing so let's have a look at that yeah that's that's pretty nice there is a tiny bit of a rock that's kind of sneaking in to the left-hand side of the image now I've tried to remove that by adjusting my perspective in my composition but to get the groins in the right place at the right height close enough to the groins I can't it's sneaking into my frame no matter what I do so couple of things I can do about that is in post-production either clone it out which I'm gonna talk a bit about that in an upcoming video about whether it's cheating or not or I can just crop it out and it might turn into a square crop so that's my options at the moment with that but yeah overall a pretty nice shot love the long exposures I'm gonna do another video as well about extreme long exposures very soon but I think what we'll do now is head back to the studio because I've worked really hard over the last three days to get to this point so I'm gonna head back to the studio and I will show you very very quickly the Edit of this photo [Music] okay I'm back in the studio after a very busy fun few days we're going to edit the first picture I took they're not the last one there because I just think it makes a much more interesting edit for you to see I'm also going to be using the loop deck Plus which loop deck have very kindly sent to me to try out I am going to be filming a video in the next few days comparing it to the palette gear so hopefully that will be something you'll be interested in but let's get straight to the computer and edit picture okay so into Lightroom and like I said this is a bracketed shot so I've already combined those into a HDR and that's the way I generally work with my bracketed images works pretty well there's no ghosting or anything like that so I have that image ready here with all that dynamic range in here so just very simply let's come down to enable profile Corrections and remove chromatic aberration the 16 to 35 f/4 seems to suffer quite a lot from vignetting Syal generally add a little bit in there extra I'm gonna leave the distortion as it is and then the next thing I generally do is to make sure I have my horizons straight so just come up here and then go to this little angle correction tool here drag that line across the horizon and then correct it there I wasn't far off so that's not too bad right let us start off with a little exposure boots so I'm just going to turn a dial on the loop Dec plus here and just increase that exposure overall I want it to be about there by the next thing I'm gonna do is as in a software grad and I'm gonna just hold shift down get it on the horizon and then let go I don't want my exposure there but I do want to bring the highlights down to about there to about 70 maybe something like that try to get the detail out of those out of that sky and then I'm gonna increase the shadows just to keep the the interest in these rocks here politea about there and then going to increase the contrast a little bit just getting used to where the tools off on loop deck and then I'm just going to increase the saturation or not a little bit bring out those cause in that sky I also want to affect the white balance so I'm just gonna increase the temperature a bit just to bring it back to those colors that I was seeing at the time and then I'm gonna increase the magenta in there as well to bring some of that back out that I can see at a time and that's gonna affect the reflection a little bit as well close that and then bring in a second one I think from the bottom so getting dragged up from the bottom this time I'm just gonna put it to there and then just push that up to about there to affect the whole area of the bottom image but I don't want the exposure affected that much so just double click that and it should go back to normal all I want to do here is just increase the shadows a little bit to bring out some of the details in those rocks so I'm just gonna go up on the shadows a little bit you can start to see that come out very nicely just keep going to probably about there and then I'm just going to affect the temperature there a little bit just to bring back a little bit of the blue in that water so just go down on the temperature and you can see that starting to take effect and looking really nice so we're not far off there I'm happy with the exposure across the image now but I want to just add in a little bit more contrast first of all so I'm gonna go up on the contrast and then just bring the highlights down a bit further on the whole image to around there any hits at start to see even more detail coming out of that sky now I want to increase those shadows back again and that's starting to look really nice then just a case of getting the whites right so I'm just gonna hold down the option key yeah just to touch on that white there and then bring the blacks down as or just get the blacks right that's looking good and then increase in the overall saturation and vibrance so just subtle on these ones okay so that's looking pretty good now but like I said when I was shooting it I just want to crop off the sides of the image because that's not where the interest lies so I'm just gonna hit R to bring up my crop tool again and then go to the one by one drop and just just it's getting the composition right I want to have some not quite in the middle so just over to the side all the interest in the sky is over this side so somewhere like that just have these rocks working on my composition leading me up to the Sun hit return very subtle changes bit of a boost in contrast bit of a boost in saturation using those then software ending grads with this bracketed image just to get that exposure just right I think that looks really good and I'm very very happy with the results of that the loop deck is also pretty nice to use so a bit more right
