welcome back to my hardcore ironman only playable in pvp worlds if you kill this account you will get a bounty of 250 million gp i hope you guys are ready for this episode because i'm going to get some really good upgrades and when i say good upgrades i mean really good upgrades i saved all the good footage for this video so enjoy in the last episode i collected a bunch of prey potions and food and we are going to do a very big barrow session we are starting with 70 kill count and i'm planning on doing barrows all day so let's see what items we get and there we go that's a full ibn staff 2500 charges i completely forgot you can do this um i thought you had to pay gp for every full staff i don't know why but yeah that's good because i'm going to save a lot of money but i use around 50 charges per barrows chest so that will last for quite a long time and the 4 dream items i want from barrows are carol's ladder top carol's leather skirt arum stop and aaron's legs and everything else is a bonus there are a few useful items and i might get sets but yeah those are the main items i'm hunting for and that is the first notable loot a torx blade body i have the body and the leg right now not bad 83 chest i'm just going to say this beforehand i am only going to show you the items i get because i don't feel like showing every single chest yeah all the periscopes pretty much that you will see are actually exciting clips i think it's nice for a change instead of seeing every chest another item 85 kill count for a derox x i don't think i'll ever use that but we might get the set so i am keeping that another torx blade body that will be a high alk and my barrows rng is starting off really strong oh a ferrox helm yo that's actually a prayer bonus but that's actually really nice for some bosses i think not bad that is a pretty good bonus item another derrick's x that's not very useful but very nice high hogs for sure basically all the duplicate items that are worth a lot of money i'm just going to highlight because i can really use the money and most belarus items aren't too expensive anymore nowadays so yeah why not yes oh my god that's the first item i need yes let's go a carol's ladder skirt the reason i want carroll so badly is because of the extra magic defense bonus that means more tether blocks will splash and more freezes that's really good there we go one out of four items completed and that is 100 barrel skill count 30 chests in and we already got a lot of items oh a ferris blade skirt once again that is a tank piece with prayer bonus i think it has slightly lower range defense so i will still use the torx legs but that might be useful for some stuff not a bad item i actually went so dry for varex blades good and helm on my main ultimate back in the day and now i'm just getting them left and right hey hello an aram's hood that is actually really good because if i get the body and the legs i will have the full arm set and that's actually a pretty powerful set first duplicate high arcs and i made 292 000 gb very nice rare clip of me getting a level 83 magic and 1450 total barrows does give a pretty decent amount of magic xp so very nice what another one derox x number three i guess um well that's money i suppose [Music] no way aram's rope skirt already 128 chests wow i am getting extremely lucky right now but i'm not complaining nah what a back to back i got two aaron's rope skirts in a row there's no way that's just stupid no back to back to back but i did get an elite clue that's actually my first elite clue i don't really care too much about them so 130 kill current i have noticed that we are getting really close to 100k subs i'm done with barrows for now i'm going to take a small break and that is a bit of kingdom loot you guys have to understand i have not played with a bank for over four years so being able to do kingdom is just i don't know what to say it's just crazy i put money in this dude and a few days later i get these things that's just amazing first task boost for 250 points we are starting with 150 tasks you can probably guess what i'm going for i am going to get a room pouch which is going to be a very big upgrade for my inventory space and it's just really convenient for barrows and other stuff so yeah let's do a bunch of task skipping this should probably take one full day and it will get me a very nice upgrade so let's get to work 84 hit points my favorite levels to get because the higher my hit points the lower the chance to get specked out and that's the final task completed for 200 in a row 450 points and that means we have enough to buy the room pouch let's quickly open this shop bye and there it is 750 points for the room pouch obtained very nice upgrade guys three different types of runes i can use it for pvmming and just teleporting around the game too so not too bad all right we're going back to barrow so that means i'm going to charge my ivans again let's see what we get first item for guttens chain skirt not too useful but it's nice to see items and that is 150 chests decided to use some blocks from kingdom and that's 55 fire making i need to get fire making levels for specific goals i will get into later this video so just starting the fire making grind i don't want to do it in one go because that might give it away so i'm just doing a few levels here and there another item another duplicate that is another ferrox home and that is another duplicate torx blade lags on 160 kilogram some pretty good high arcs i'm taking a little break from barrows i'm going to test my new obtained gear and i'm going to try some ancient kills last time i did ivan's i think ancients will be a lot better because i can use blood blitz so it should be some pretty easy kills i won't be able to do too many kills because i will run out of blood runes but yeah let's see how this goes and see if we can get any items [Music] i had a pretty fun zura session no loots and i'm completely out of food so i'm going to make a bunch of pizzas so i can do some more barrels later and there's 73 cooking first level and there's 74 cooking as well i decided to use the grapes and got a 100 000 xp drop right there nice two levels in cooking oh wow a carol's crossbow that's actually an amazing item um i think it's only really going to be useful if i get the full carol set and i don't have the koi right now but that's just a lovely item to see isn't it and that is 170 chests which means we did 100 chests so far in this video [Music] oh my god i got the iron rope top already no way 171 kill count i have full arms wow that is so lucky we only need one item from the list now which is the carol's ladder top now i tend to go dry for the last item but i am not complaining having 3 out of 4 items with this kc you can call me a spoono guys that looks so beautiful in a bank look at that full arms and a staff we can't equip the staff yet because we don't have 70 attack but once we get 70 attack we can use the full set and that's another rare level at barrows 91 ranged i'm going to take a break from barros that is 180 kill count we have done 110 chests we got an insane amount of items it's time to work on some other stuff guys the ladder top will come i just got level 84 splashing very nice i'm back at titty farming i'm going to finish the points for the herb sack it was pretty obvious last week i was doing this so i think no one should go here i'm here at a completely random time so that's 65 farming i can now go to the mid tier and i can also kill hespori so that's a very nice level to get yeah i need to do two more rounds so not too bad shouldn't take too long and then i'm out of here forever probably i really hate this minigame and it's also extremely dangerous so i just want to get done with this and that's it the last fruits i need for all the points people asked me in the last episode why i first deposit 80 and then 20. the reason i do that is because most xp is from the 80 fruits so if a pko shows up when i'm doing the last 20 and i have to teleport out i don't miss out on all the xp there's really no other reason you still got the full points if you deposit the last 20 after and the last bit of xp but yeah that's the reason i do it and that's 58 herblore's world that's the level i need to buy the herb sac because i actually didn't have the herbal level yet but yeah i got all the requirements now and that is the sac obtained first time ever in a game getting this item and it's going to be super useful for slayer and just anything that drops herbs really i can collect them weekly tears of runecrafting there is level 42 tears of gothics 4 mind runes amazing part 2 of fire making that's 65 making people going to be so confused why i'm doing fire making which is really fun and that's 64 fi making i need 65 fi making so i'm going to keep 64 and tomorrow when i wake up i'm going to get 65 and get the eminent of the damned in one session it's going to be quite a grind but i want the eminence since i have full arms now so once we get 70 attack in the future i can use arms with the eminent of the damned it's just nice to get the amount now because i don't think people expect me to go for it and it's basically a glory so i can also use it for stuff like zura get the extra attack bonus it's just a very solid eminent to get so alright i'm kidding these ghost things and this just reminds me how horrible this minigame is i i understand why people hate this it's super tedious very confusing yeah i have to get through all these doors then kill the ghost and burn the ghost get the new keys get to the new room it's just a really big hassle i use some of the black keys and that is a flamethrower bag which is a really nice item i can store all the building materials in there i was trying to do this solo and it was just horrible so i used an all to build the temple so i can make the oils you can cancel me it's a small exception i didn't leave the pvp world so basically had a bit of help for myself to build the temple yeah with this back i think i will be able to solo it completely because i can basically store all the materials in this bag i did manage to get a level 50 prayer i was only 1000 xp off the level so i was expecting this level hopefully we won't be getting another prey level but yeah that's 50 prayer it took me around 2 hours to get these nine silver keys getting the emirate of the damned is a little over 1 in 15 so we have a decent chance and we didn't get the amoled i got myself 40 more oils which should get me to amulet so yeah let's try again i guess all right we are three hours in please give me this amulet i have 10 keys thank you and that's another one as well beautiful all right we are good to go that is even better we have two amulets this shitty grind was worth it i don't have to come back here for a long time i don't know about you guys but i am looking pretty scary this video is just upgrade after upgrade that might be surprising but one small favor completed which is a very nice quest and i can now make gothic's rest tea which is a very nice upgrade because it works as an anti-poison and i can replace the anti-poison in my inventory with a full gothic's rest and that means i have 20 extra hit points in my inventory so that's a pretty big upgrade doing a lot more splashing and highlighting some stuff and as level 85 splashing i can now tele-block people random fletching level but this fletching level gets me 1500 total level on the pvp hardcore i'm pretty happy about that that's a very solid level i think i've mostly been doing combat and slayer but i'm getting some 60s and 70s skilling stats getting up there i guess i started using a lot of my seeds from zura and farming contracts and that's my second hasbroy for level 69 farming nice we are in my favorite bank doing some herbal upgrades and this is how you make gothic rests pretty cool and i realized earlier today that i can actually plus four boost my herbal level with a botanical pie and that means i can boost to level 64 and make super restores and i have a lot of snapdragons and i collected some spider eggs so i can now make pretty much unlimited supreme stores and bring them in my inventory with sarah dolmen bruce and it's just a lot more balanced because i was using regular restores and yeah i'm not a fan of that sure upgraded my inventory even better all right there's one last upgrade i want i've been putting this off for a bit i unlocked these spells last episode and i waited nearly two weeks with this but i think today is a good time to do major arena 2. i checked on the pvp hardcore discord and most of the hunters are actually working right now and there's only about 50 people in the world so let's get that cape upgrade [Music] and that's it we are free i was really scared doing this but that's it we can now upgrade to the imbued zamra cape that is such a beautiful item to get on this account and that's an amazing upgrade to get it has plus 15 magic defense and plus 15 magic attack share a little bit extra magic defense compared to the fire cape for tanking and the magic attack just awesome for stuff like barrows and zura thank you so much for watching definitely the biggest episode yet in terms of upgrades all the barrows items the room pouch herb sac emerald of the damned matrina 2 cape super restores gothic's rest that's going to help out so much this episode i'll see you guys in a few days with another episode don't forget to
