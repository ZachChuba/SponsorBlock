see static the heart of your system hi and welcome to a new video this video will be about the brand new Coraline 9900 KS and KS or the S behind the K seems to be like special edition because if you take a look at the packaging of the 9900 KS it looks very similar to 900k only that special edition is written underneath and if you're wondering what what's the difference between the 9900 K and K s basically 9900 KS has all core total frequency of 5 gigahertz across all the cores and that's the difference that's everything so you could just stimulate your 9900 KS by using a 9900 K and push it to 5 gigahertz maybe you already own one that is clocked to 5 Gertz so you will have exactly the same performance there is literally no difference the only thing that I find personally interesting is if Intel is delivering a CPU like that guaranteed m5 gigahertz across all cores on tour vogue it means that the quality of the CPU has to be better so it's a better bin than the previous 9900 K that's why from my personal perspective the only thing that's kind of interesting of the CPU or could be interesting is overclocking potential that's why we will also use some dry ice today do some dry ice testing with this if you see if we can squeeze out some additional megahertz of this chip first of all let's talk about power consumption of 99 hundred KS versus for example in 3900 X if you're wondering about this whole power consumption TDP topic please go and watch the previous video of gamers Nexus where he did a deep dive into what the TDP value really means because a 3900 X with a rated TDP of 105 what can consume easily like 130 140 watt under full load the same goes for the 9900 KS with 127 Watts TDP the CPU especially in turbo mode consumes a lot more because the TDP of 127 what is rated at the base frequency but not at the turbo turbo it consumes more so let's take a look at Windows I will just show you how this works in reality let's do a quick run off Cinebench are twenty mainly because it takes quite a long time because if you take a look at the frequency right now we are at five gigahertz across all course then we have the core temperature typically around 75 to 80 degree Celsius with the Corsair age 115 I and the package power consumption is currently about 190 to 195 watt peak and now it drops down to 127 which is the TDP and that's because of the turbo boost time window that's a value you can also configure in BIOS if you set that limit to unlimited that's basically what multi core enhancement is doing or MCE so this means the ninety-nine hundred KS can only run the 5 gigahertz turbo boost for a certain amount of time I think it's about 16 seconds maybe 17 seconds and after that it will drop down to maximum 127 what power consumption therefore it cannot sustain the boost clock of 5 gigahertz and it will be more about 4.5 4.6 gigahertz during very high load like in Cinebench r15 what does this mean for gaming it has the different gaming applications to see how the boost frequency behaves during gaming benchmarks and for csgo CPU consumed maximum of 90 8 watts so that's 5 gigahertz all the time with 1080p shadow of the Tomb Raider with 1080p CPU consumed maximum 126 watt so in this in this case also the 5 gigahertz was always there with shadow of the Tomb Raider with 1440p the load has shifted even more towards the GPU therefore the maximum power consumption of the CPU dropped down a little more to 117 also in this case five hits Toba was always there for example in times by extreme he have gt1 and gt2 TT 1 so the graphics test 1 and the graphics test 2 in those two benchmarks 5 gigahertz on the CPU was always present but going to the physics test CPU drop dropped down to like four point five to five years depends on the exact state of the benchmark let's get to some benchmarks before we start with overclocking Silver's our 21st first of all cinema chart 20 is fluctuating quite a lot some not so much a fan of this benchmark for comparison but just keep this in mind okay on top we have the 3900 X obviously with four additional course it's much ahead of the 9900 K or 90 100 KS multi 7000 120 points 9900 k KS stock has only 4500 points if you enable multi core enhancement and it's 4607 points it's not much of an improvement there mainly because if you enable multi core enhancement then I saw that the ABX offset is set to 2 while without multi core enhancement the ABX offset on the CPU is set to 0 that's why if you enable multi core enhancement the CPU will actually clock a little bit lower than 5 gigahertz so most of the cases 4.8 yuka hurts because Cinebench r20 is using a bx that's why multi-core enhancement doesn't help in this benchmark as much 9900 KS at 5.2 gears or c has a very strong single core benchmark score of 513 while 3900 X is 499 which is basically identical to 9900 KS in this case with 498 and 497 a quick look at Adobe premier obviously a hike or count CPU is much better for such render applications that's why 3900 X or even in future 39 50 X will be much better in this case than a 9900 K or 9900 KS the 9900 KS is about 1 minute faster than the K in Adobe Premiere going from 16 to about 15 minutes with heavy OC of 5.2 gigahertz it's going to 14 and a half minutes still we are far away from the 3900 X in this case let's talk about some gaming benchmarks all the benchmarks are done in 1440p I don't see why you should test 1080p or 720p with the CPU of this value which you would obviously pair with a 2080 or 2080 TI and in this configuration you should not play any games at 720p that's why I don't see a recent testing is first benchmark battlefield 5 obviously the 9900 K was all ready a little bit ahead of the 3900 X in this case and the 9900 KS especially with overclocking takes the lead in this chart shadow of the Tomb Raider 1440p looks kind of similar with the only difference that the 3900 X was ahead of the 9900 K in my testing but then the 9900 KS was faster than the 3900 X and with a little bit of overclocking the 9900 k KS also takes the lead here far cry 5 1440p similar results 3900 X a little bit slower than the 9900 KS again a little bit faster and obviously with overclocking you gain another 4 to 5 fps so nothing surprising everything as expected as previously as all the other reviews with we've seen before 3900 X versus 9900 K there is in most gaming applications not much of a difference especially if you're playing in high resolutions I mean if you're going even higher than 40 for TP you will probably see no difference at all 9900 KS obviously is then still a little bit faster so overall you can say the 9900 KS is the fastest CPU for gaming pretty much as the 90 and 100 K was before but keeping in mind that you get a higher core count with the 3900 X and you can also use it for endurance you just have to evaluate yourself what you're going to use the CPU for before we get to dry ice overclocking using this baby right here it's liquid nitrogen or dryers cooler I developed a while ago we are going to talk about overclocking numbers using this 280 millimeter a IO from coarser the H 115 I I'm currently using you can see right now on my screen the CPU is pushed to 5.3 gigahertz across all cores using one point three volt this is Cinebench r15 stable you can hear that my fan curve is quite aggressive right now because you really need a cooling we're hitting about ninety degree celsius peak on the CPU cores which is still fine I can tell you that my CPU can do for 5.2 gigahertz across all cores with one point three five volt rocks table like everything like prime95 all games rendering everything so that's what you can probably expect from the $9.99 hundred KS overall the CPU seems to be a higher quality than the ninety nine hundred K which was obvious that's also what we expected I think in general general we can expect about three hundred yeah two hundred to three hundred megahertz more in average out of the KS and off the K so overclocking wise I think it's a quite interesting CPU first of all I have to check if this cooler fits on to the CPU because this one was originally made for thread Ripper and also for socket 2066 but seems to fit nicely on there at least without mounting gear we will not use any threaded rods and stuff for additional mounting pressure we'll just put the cooler on top of the CPU obviously they will paste in between for better heat transfer and then use some paper towel just close off some of the gaps around the socket I'm not going to insulate it today with like Vaseline and stuff it's too messy I don't want to spend too much time on this I just want to see how the overclocking behaves so we will just use some paper towel around to catch some condensation using some thermal grease decry on extreme thermal paste it's not out yet it's not yet on the market that's stuff I use for xoc at the moment application which were completely approves fixing a temperature probe inside the container quickly the hole here is filled with thermal paste sticking it here should be good edit some additional paper on the right here to fix the container in the middle doesn't move away I think this will work everything a setup should be ready to go we have a second camera right here which I think will make it better and easier for you to watch I have to speak cooler in the middle we have a thermometer right here with dual channel so one temperature is ambient temperature one temperature is the temperature of the CPU container right here then we also have a current clamp here that is showing and measuring the current flowing across the eight pin eps connector to the CPU basically monitoring the CPU power consumption in today's video we will use dry ice with three millimeter pellets they are very convenient to use much better than the bigger pellets I use previously all right this is our base condition for now CPU cooler about 22 degrees Celsius on the cooler bottom measured right here then we have the CPU clocked to 5.4 gigahertz across all cores with 1.4 B core in idle which should result in one point three five four point three six under load this should not be stable under this condition we will just perform a run quickly and see ya crash immediately we saw a quick peak temperature of 86 to 90 degree Celsius we will now test the frequency scaling of the CPU when it comes to cold to see how much lower you have to go in temperature to get the last additional 100 megahertz to see if that would be kind of possible with custom water cooling obviously you cannot compare the cost of water cooling with the temperature you can see on my cooling device right here we have to go by the core temperature CPU cooler temperature is much lower now we are at about zero degrees Celsius I just already passed it in the German video running five point four gigahertz you can see runs perfectly fine now with 1.4 vcore in idle resulting in about one point three six week or under load peak temperature unload right now 65 to 70 degree Celsius and this was necessary to get five point four gigahertz to pass city bench so we need about 15 to 20 degrees Celsius per 100 megahertz on the 9900 K it's a very similar skating to 9900 cake [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah we're now at minus 65 degrees Celsius a little bit of acetone and dry ice that's really doing the thing what was really interesting I just tried it for the German video is I adjusted the CPU to 5.6 gigahertz using still 1.4 v core because previously the 9900 Cawood extremely well scale with temperature I could just overclock the CPU previously to five point six five point seven a ninety nine hundred K just by lowering the voltage but I just tried it in a German video it immediately crashed let's just see what happens now okay now it seems to work maybe I needed a little bit lower temp so it was just a random crash looks like it was just a random crash okay five point six seems to run fine what's interesting always is how much CPU power consumption is lowered even though the clock is higher we just saw 170 180 degrees at 170 180 watt peak considering that we increase the frequency to what we did on for example water cooling yeah the power consumption per ature we reached the limit right now of the voltage we were still running the same voltage as with the previous testing so that's 1.4 in idle 1.35 under load resulting in 5.8 gigahertz running right now Cinebench r15 stable compared to previously with a corsair AIO we were able to run 5.3 by lowering the temperature by 100 Kelvin roughly we increased the frequency by 500 megahertz that means we need about 20 degrees Celsius or 20 Kelvin per 100 megahertz increase that's just in a good indicator for you let's say you have your CPU rock stable at 5.2 with a peak temperature of 80 degree Celsius if you manage to get your tip CPU temperature down to 60 degrees Celsius max then you can probably squeeze another 100 megahertz out of your CPU that's the conclusion I want to give you with this testing I'm getting closer to the limit of the dry ice right now running on all cores 1.49 volt right now I tried it before with 1.53 1.52 but then the CP was getting too warm we were hitting a pork consumption of 200 220 what right now I had 230 before in this condition the CP was getting too warm therefore it crashed mid run but this seems to be stable that's cool so about 6 gigahertz maybe 6.1 is probably what we can get with the CPU out of sandwich or 15 yeah last kind of interesting step to me is what can we validate with the CPU I increased if you voltage to 1 point 6 volts right now and we will just see how high can we get to CPU without any kind of benchmark just validation it's pretty funny how easy xoc is these days I didn't touch anything besides just doing power limit and load line calibration sip UV core and that's it like those main boards are so much optimized these days that you don't really have to do anything you just put your cooler on there at least four basic XOC obviously if you go for a hard core on the limited ln2 overclocking it's a different story because then come to boot issues and all of this stuff but just yeah six point three gigahertz across all the course was not really a issue I thought it would just be cool to test if we can actually game at those frequencies that's why I pushed the CPU to five point eight which was previously in a bench table now in the pub G Lobby running 200 FPS right now average is showing 217 one percent low is actually quite low with 93 but let's see how it goes here I failed quite early because I don't have sound on this setup right now but it really works at five point eight years you can technically game even with xoc the question is always how long is this going to be stable because at a certain point we will have condensation on this break and once we have condensation on the backside of the CPU or anywhere near there memory slots it will be a problem things will become unstable but for the moment works fine 5.8 gigahertz on the CPU averaging about 200 FPS and one more annoying thing is that obviously you always have to get dry ice every few minutes and then have to fill up your container also ventilation in your room has to be decent otherwise you will have a lot of co2 in the air which can technically be a problem at a certain point so much for now about the 9900 KS the CPU is really only interesting for gaming for gaming it's the fastest cpu on the market still you have to decide yourself if you might have other applications that the more cores then you maybe should still go for the 3900 X is up to you to decide which CPU you want to get but the CPU compared to the 9900 K obviously is better will overclock higher has a much better quality so on average I would say 300 megahertz more is what you can expect from those chips thanks for tuning in see you next time [Music] you
