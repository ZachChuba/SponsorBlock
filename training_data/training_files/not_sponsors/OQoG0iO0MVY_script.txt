/ polyphonic will get 20% off an annual premium subscription nowadays it's nearly impossible to have a conversation about musicals without name-dropping Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice as a duo or paired with other artists these men have become Titans looming over the musical world for the past half century of all their collaborations however there's one that's always resonated most with me Jesus Christ Superstar reinterpreting one of the most important stories of human history Jesus Christ Superstar brings the ancient face to face with the modern and in doing so it forever changed the way that people thought of musicals let's take a closer look in 1968 Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice broke through into the mainstream with Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat when they went to follow it up they decided that one biblical story worked for them so why not pitch another so they came up with a radical idea one that would tell the story of Jesus Christ through the eyes of Judas and on top of that they would forego traditional musical theater for something more contemporary rock when they took it to producers they were promptly told it was the worst idea in history but that didn't dismay the duo they knew they had something with this piece and they were determined to make it work even if it required turning away from the stage in the late 1960s the rock opera was in the process of being born albums like SF soro by the Pretty Things and Tommy by the who were experimenting with the narrative abilities of rock and roll this inspired Webber Anne Rice who thought that the rock opera might just be the medium to tell their radical story with this new media in mind whoever started shifting his writing in his mind this was gonna be a rock album so it should be written as a rock album not as a stage musical because of this he focused on telling the story through the music and just as Webber sought to pull influence from popular music at the time Tim Rice also let the songwriters of the day seep into his lyrics one of the biggest influences for Rice's perspective on the story came in Bob Dylan Dylan song with God on our side featured the lines you'll have to decide whether judas iscariot had God on his side this was a thought that had always fascinated Rice who felt that the Bible's depiction of Judas was written as a cardboard cutout of an evil character Rice's take on Judas however is completely fleshed out and presents a remarkably sympathetic case for one of history's most reviled figures were introduced to this story through Judas's eyes our first lyrics on the album are sung by him my mind is clear and we start with a revelation the effusive morning heaven on their minds shows the perspective of Judas he yearns to help the poor to help the cause of his people and that's why he took up with Jesus in the first place but what Judas can't abide by is the talk of Jesus as a messiah he cares for his friend Jesus and for the cause of his people and this desperation and care come through perfectly in both the music and lyrics of heaven on their minds operation for you has musically it starts on desperation before oscillating back to warm Compassion's building to a last desperation once again in the end [Music] all this was made possible thanks to an incredible performance by Murray head who was then an up-and-coming singer not really making many waves in the scene but when reisenweber found him they knew he had the chops to be there Judas and Murray head wasn't the only one pulled from obscurity Yvan Elliman who played Mary Magdalene was also an unknown when Andrew Lloyd Webber came upon her he was scouting a jazz club to see if the headliner could play Pontius Pilate and while that singer wasn't a fit element opened the show and Webber thought she would be the perfect Mary Magdalene in Rice's characterization Magdalene is a warm loving character and el-amin's voice fit that role perfectly in everything's alright we get a peek into the relationship she has with Jesus [Music] she's a foil comm grounded love paired with the passionate idealism of Jesus Brice's Jesus is an interesting figure he's more passionate and angry than many depictions but he also needed to have the charisma to move crowds and the ability to sing Jesus's pacifism Webber and rice found a singer able to do all of this by looking to rock Webber her Deep Purple's 1969 album in rock which featured child in time in that song lead singer Ian Gillian captures both the highs and lows necessary for Jesus and particularly the doomed desperation the climax of that song features pain screams like no other when Webber and rice approached Gilliam he was game so they had their cast in place and worked on putting together an astounding album after we're introduced to all our characters and their motivations on the first side the second kicks us into action in the triumphant Hosanna Jesus arrives in Jerusalem with his followers the passion that Jesus's followers have for him carries through the next song SIMON zealots slash poor Jerusalem in that song Simon tries to convince Jesus to march to war musically the song is a triumphant celebration Webber writes a catchy chorus line to show the manic devotion of Jesus's followers [Music] this song is a perfect display of the dichotomies that make Jesus Christ Superstar so vibrant Simon zealots is fast paced loud and climactic but it runs headfirst into the slow piano driven poor Jerusalem in that song we get to see Gillian softer side as he reflects on some of Jesus's burdens ending on one of the most powerful sentiments of the album to conquer death we have to defeat this goes on to a mystical scene where pilot dreams of his fate above quang e guitars meanwhile Jesus visits the Temple of Jerusalem in one of the most cinematic scenes in the album it's easy to see the chaos of the market painted by an enthusiastic bassline and building cacophony of voices strings and horns [Music] throughout Jesus Christ Superstar Weber reuses and recontextualizes his musical themes the temple is a perfect example of this the theme of the merchants hawking wares gets reused for the desperation of lepers and beggars in this context it carries the same chaos but it also seems haunted building around a helpless penis this is followed up by a briefer priests of everything's alright and then marries shining moment I don't know how to love him this was actually a recycled song for Weber he had originally written the song about his home state of Kansas but Rice's new lyrics provide a deeper look into the psyche of Mary Magdalene on one level it's a song about unrequited love but on another it begs a more profound question how do you love somebody that believes they are a god I don't know how to love him is the emotional core of the album and was released as one of its two singles [Music] to end the second side of the record we go back to Judas and his despair in this scene Judas sells Jesus out but we can understand his motivations for it he's seen the mobs that Jesus inspires he's worried for the fate of his cause hurry heads performance in the scene really convinces you of Judas as cause he comes off remarkably sympathetic even though he thinks he's doing right one thought is burned into his mind if he's wrong he'll be damned for all time [Music] with this we go to the second disc where we're greeted with one of the most iconic scenes of Jesus's life the Last Supper the song is an entire suite and it shows off both Gillian and heads remarkable performances as they face off against the Last Supper leads into Jesus's soliloquy in the Garden of Gethsemane if I don't know how to love him is Mary Magdalene showcase guest feminie is Jesus's this soliloquy is a beautiful look into the mind of a man condemned to die [Music] young Gillian portrays Jesus's own internal turmoil even questioning himself and his fate [Music] and it ends with an angry acceptance Jesus didn't start this but he'll finish [Music] who Jesus has resigned to die for Humanity the rest of the album is a march towards the impending crucifixion this section shows off more of Weber's theme reuse the Apostles what's that buzz is reused for Jesus's arrest and its other half strange thing mystifying finds another home in Peters denial once Jesus is arrested we get a tour of his trials pilot is jeering and sinister prodding at Jesus only to be met with Placid responses then we get another highlight King Herod's song like I don't know how to love him this song was taken from a previous Webber composition because of this it's the closest to traditional music Herod sings in jaunty show tunes so the Christ Jesus Christ while Jesus is being tried Judas is rocked by his own conscience in a reprise of damned for all time Judas returns to the priests in desperation regretting his action then we'll get Judas's own take on I don't know how to love him showing the last moment of empathy and care judas truly loved Jesus and did what he thought would be best for his friend it's a painful tragic final moment for our main character and then as he dies we revisit the opening of the album his mind is no longer clear his mind is in darkness as he dies Judas realizes he was a pawn in God's game and he turns all his hatred against a cruel God than doomed him to this fate [Music] but Judas appears once more after Jesus's trial before pile Judah sings one of the biggest hits of the show superstar that track was released as the album's lead single it's a step away from the story and a moment of philosophizing it sums up some of the main questions asked by the story who and what was Jesus if he was truly the Son of God why did he appear when he did and most of all is it possible to separate the myth from the man [Music] and then our album ends on Jesus's crucifixion and an instrumental piece john 1941 that title refers to the following bible line at the place where Jesus was crucified there was a new garden and in the new garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid upon its release Jesus Christ Superstar caused quite a stir it was banned by the BBC for a moment and condemned by a number of religious groups for its portrayal of Judas and its refusal to show Jesus's resurrection but at the same time it captured its audience it blew up in the United States and soon enough it found its way onto Broadway and into a 1973 film that legacy has continued into the modern age because the story continues to be so relevant it's one of the founding myths of the Western world viewed through an unusual lens the medium of rock and roll dress obvious comparisons between Jesus and our own superstars it asks a question was Jesus truly a holy figure or was he just the Beatles of his day and it conjures questions about the nature of power and the realities of fate and destiny musically it weaves a complex story but keeps enough catchy melodies and hooks to keep the listener involved it was something utterly different something nobody could have expected but something that seems so necessary in hindsight it helped Rock find its way into musical theater and it kicked off the careers of two of the greatest artists of our age and perhaps most of all it gave us a new way to look at a story we've been telling for 2,000 years
