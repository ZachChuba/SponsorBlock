[Music] peanut butter and jelly chicken and waffles you know some things just go together kind of like egoraptor and jontron on the gamegrumps channel well that is until John left all the way back in 2013 with many to this very day asking what ever happened there well today on internet mysteries we're going to try to find out when a duo dis bands in the entertainment industry how the public reacts largely depends on if the parties involved are being transparent it's very easy for the audience to feel alienated if their favorite comedian is hiding something and the same holds true for web-based content creators from stupid Mario 2 more recently Smosh there are numerous examples of this dilemma occurring online one of the most infamous of course is the departure of John from game grumps - I also love to watch you play them and then have it filmed and shown for our audience at home welcome to game grumps where we do that the game grumps youtube channel was created on July 18 2012 and almost immediately was a success within the first three weeks they managed to accumulate over seven million views across various playthroughs and quickly hit the 150,000 subscriber milestone by the end of their first year they accumulated 1 million followers and garnered a total of 197 million views once the ball started moving they decided to publish multiple videos every single day an employee John's longtime friend and creative partner Barry Kramer to work as their editor though game grumps was never the most popular let's play channel the audience they had cultivated was dedicated to say the least fans began producing game grumps themed animations and even song remixes out of sheer appreciation for their work and all seemed to be going well until the constant stream of content was abruptly stopped On June 15th 2013 due to quote-unquote circumstances beyond their control the channel began uploading only one Episode a day a stark contrast from what fans had gone used almost immediately they began to speculate something had gone awry their suspicions would be confirmed 10 days later on June 25th out of nowhere it was announced that John would be leaving the show to focus on his own channel this naturally upset fans because John didn't and still doesn't upload frequently so they'd be going from daily doses of him to nothing the goodbye video was also really strange titled Oh - John John segment was filmed entirely differently from the ending skits implying that John was no longer in the game grumps to do interestingly the excuse given also contradicted several statements John had previously made on the channel overall the video just seemed unplanned as if John's decision to leave had been done abruptly why hadn't there been a transitional period to ease viewers into the new host and why did the channel introduce new merchandise of John if they had known he was going to leave ahead of time well the majority of their audience accepted the official explanation those who read between the lines knew that something didn't seem right in the months following John's departure this suspicion only grew Arin and other contributors to the channel stopped acknowledging John entirely this included their editor who again had known John since high school this passive-aggressiveness would come to a head when Aaron began asking fans to stop mentioning John claiming that John wished to move on this ended up leading to John making his own post on the game grumps subreddit demanding that Aaron stop speaking for him he goes so far as to write in the reply I am NOT trying to put game grumps behind me but maybe they are food for thought but that was only the beginning in spite of the game grumps being adamant that the reason they gave was the truth totalbiscuit tweeted that he knew what actually had happened but there was no chance anyone was going to find out it was also revealed that the reason John's footage was shot on an entirely different camera was because he had left Los Angeles to live in New York with his girlfriend at the time an artist named Nicole Rodriguez that detail will be important later on unsurprisingly once all these facts had come to light rumors about John's departure began to spread and with an audience as dedicated as theirs it wasn't long before this commitment became obsessive their fascination would eventually accumulate into conspiracy grumps a subreddit that existed solely to speculate about the controversy let's examine some of the forms most popular theories to see what ideas we can definitively rule out one common belief at the time was that John had left game grumps because he didn't like steam train being on their channel this rumour however failed to address the discrepancies a vote to John steam train had been in development for quite some time so if John wanted to leave the game grumps would have had more than enough time to ease in the new host the way it happened seemed too abrupt for this to be the case another commonly spread rumor was that John had gotten into some kind of physical conflict with Susy Aaron's wife albeit ironically this had become one of the most popular interpretations of the fallouts while the severity of the conflict ranges from theory to theory the most infamous is the claim that John hit Susie and then promptly fled to New York to escape Erin's wrath this obviously was not true and it was eventually debunked by Nicole who stated if you want at least one thing to be put to rest - nothing involved any physical trauma but that doesn't rule out any conflict with Susie from happening altogether interestingly a lot of the theory passed this point is a result of pot stirring by Nicole while she was still with John and there was a period of time where she visited and commented on the subreddit frequently though she alluded to there being some sort of non-disclosure agreement preventing her from outright stating what happened her input was useful in ruling out a lot of theories so expect to see her throughout the rest of this video the most notable example of Nicole pot-stirring where screenshots taken from a chat of a twitch stream he or she drunkenly insults Susie multiple times and then compares her to Yoko Ono who was the wife of the late John Lennon and she's often blamed for the disbandment of the Beatles Nicole did however confirm that John was not kicked off the channel and left willingly this comparison was later corroborated by the Tron era remix sir Gerry Terry in response accusations that Nicole was in fact a Yoko Ono of the channel Gerry revealed that John had been considering leaving game grumps for quite some time it was only Nicole who dissuaded him and encouraged him to stay he then went on to write if you're looking for a manipulative Yoko ask figure you're definitely firing in the wrong direction the most obvious implication here being that they should look in the opposite camp and consider Susie but by far the most substantial information to surface as a result of the subreddit it is a set of events known as the e3 incident and unlike the other two theories the core of this one was rooted in facts on November 3rd 2014 a Reddit user by the name of talented lobster created a timeline of what he believed to be proof that the incident that led to John leaving game grumps occurred at e3 2013 even on a surface level this is interesting because III took place less than two weeks before o to John let's take a look at the evidence they provided the timeline is constructed of tweets from various members of game grumps who attended e3 on day one a tweet from Barry reveals that him and John were attending a party together he was for sure at e3 this day as they had photos of him at the conf lor on day two a tweet from grant kirkhope reveals that Jon didn't show up to e3 that day and meanwhile Erin appears on the game station stream and in Jon's places Barry on day 3 John replies to Grant's tweets claiming that he didn't go because of the flu he doesn't show up to e3 that day either the next day both his and Erin's Twitter go silent and finally on June 15th the game grumps announced that they will be switching back to the one Episode a day schedule for reasons beyond their control clearly something happened the evidence speaks for itself it appears that something happened at e3 to cause Jon to stop attending the event prematurely and amazingly John Alba confirms this timeline of events writing underneath the timeline post damn you guys are good so sometime between June 11th and June 13th Oh John and Erin had long outs but even with all this analysis no one really knew why that is until people kept on digging and we'll link to it in the description after John essentially verified that there had been a falling out at e3 that year the most prevailing theory was that it could have been due to Polaris previously known as the game station Polaris was a youtube network owned by maker studios that launched on June 13th of that year it was in the process of transitioning at e3 Aaron could have wanted to get further involved with the network while John wanted the channel to stay where it was in this scenario the incident would have been an argument about the future of the show and this theory was seemingly corroborated by a few key points as well firstly the party that John attends on day one was actually a get-together for partners of Polaris this was confirmed in a post by youtuber nintendo capri sun who met and took footage of john while he was there capri-sun notes that he had looked all over the party that night for egoraptor but was pretty sure he wasn't there secondly if it was because of business decisions it would explain the non-disclosure agreement if they were negotiating contracts they wouldn't really be allowed to discuss the details of the agreement finally the incident took place extremely close to the one-year anniversary of game grumps this is important because John had revealed previously that they had to sign paperwork when they first started the channel this implies that the channel could have been created in cooperation with maker and since it was a brand new venture the contract they originally signed probably only lasted the first year maybe they were at e3 to negotiate the terms with them well maybe not because unfortunately despite all the circumstantial evidence the theory was deemed incorrect by Nicole herself like she did with many others she replied to a thread proposing the idea with a singular net so if that was in it we can only assume that the issue was something personal an interesting note that many people don't realize is that Nicole had actually gone to e3 that year as well so she has to know what really happened presumably she and John left for New York shortly after the incident and really if John didn't want to get more involved with Polaris why would he later let them fund his entire Star Kate series it's more likely that the NDA is a separate issue entirely the truth is we may never truly know why John left game grumps but at the very least we know why it wasn't and by using this deductive reasoning it's easy to come close to a conclusion so the rest of this video is dedicated to why internet mysteries believes game grumps ended firstly let's address something that will be important to characterize the relationship between John and Erin at the time if you recall the remixer Gerry Terry revealed that John had wanted to leave game grumps four months before the e3 incidents but why well John may have accidentally revealed the answer to this question in an interaction he had with Reddit user Zuger door 9 94 as he tells it he met John in 2014 at the screwattack gaming convention some time around 2:00 to 3:00 a.m. this is what he recalls John sang as most of us know John was a huge egoraptor fan before he actually met Aaron it might have been a result of this that Aaron treated John the way he did according to John Aaron's treatment of him was less like a friend and more Lackey certainly putting the ego and egoraptor John didn't seem to fully realize this up until the time he left we can verify that this meeting really happened because the image of him and John still exists online it's also possible that he's lying about what he was told but it's also possible that John really did slip him some details back to the subreddit Nicole also implied in one post that Aaron had been verbally abusive to John and on the coop tional podcast both Dodger and totalbiscuit seemed to side with John in the fallout now on to the incident itself what happened in the hours after the e3 party and before at the roundtable interview while the public excuse was that John was feeling under the weather that could have easily just been a PR move what could John have done that led him to feel so awful that he was unable to attend the rest of III if you watch enough clips of him John will admit that he is extremely susceptible to drinking perhaps John could have felt so hungover after the party that he told err and he was unable to attend the game station interview maybe this is what had upset Aaron as the rumors mentioned before John and Aaron's relationship may have already been pretty tense so John essentially sitting out of an entire event could have been the straw that broke the camel's back maybe John's sick of being subjected to Aaron's anger decided that enough was enough and that he was finally going to move to New York to live with Nicole we do know that once the game grumps returned to their studio they began to upload only one video a day maybe this was to buy time in case they convinced John to come back regardless he refuses to return and records a goodbye video for the fans owed to John is released and the rest is history well this theory seemed to hit all the boxes it had never actually been proven that alcohol was served at the party so the final step was to verify that him getting drunk was plausible after all this could lead to an entire theory being thrown out the window so we attempted to find more details about the party along with other Creators who attended with John as it turns out the after party was actually just a concert for a chiptune band it was an open concert though pilars provided tickets to its partner for free well it's unknown when John left the vent exactly he was last seen at 12:47 a.m. CST which would have been ten forty seven pm in los angeles we did find this image of John at the event with a fan but who knows if he's actually even drunk here eventually we ended up just doing a query of all references to the band on Twitter from June 11th to June 13th and after a lot of scrolling we actually found a tweet that gave us our answer and it came from another parse attendee yes in this obscure tweet from the warp zone that it seems no one else was able to find they say that there was in fact an open bar that means that drinks were not only being served to John but given to him for free which makes the hangover Theory even more plausible at the end of all this we still don't have a definitive answer though well one plausible theory is that Aaron got upset at John for drinking too much we'll never truly know until somebody says something which they won't because it really doesn't matter anymore a lot has changed since the falling outs who Ross and Barry ended up leaving game grumps on their own accord John and Aaron eventually put an end to the silent treatment and reunited for the starcade series and the game grumps brand severed all ties with Polaris and John and Nicole eventually broke up what happened on that fateful day itself just isn't relevant the only reason we're still talking about it now is because of the mystique around it the stigma and the fact that after all these years we don't have an answer makes it one of the most infuriating unsolved internet mysteries of all time well at this point I think it's highly unlikely that we're ever going to be able to find out the complete truth there maybe someday later on down the road we're enough time had passed that we'll finally get answers to the questions including why John left but until then we'll just have to wait and see alright cut that was a good shot is there anything else that you want me to do before I go home while I'm closing up these lights can you just give me a coca-cola yeah okay [Applause] all right here's your coke I'll see you tomorrow thank you see you [Music]
