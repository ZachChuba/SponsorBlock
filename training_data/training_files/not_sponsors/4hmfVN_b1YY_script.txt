hello fellow dendrites I'm Pruitt and this is Jim Davis and some might see it as cold-blooded to shed the trappings of man flesh but there is one out there who's not gonna turn down your worship it is dinne dar he will eat the Sun and he will make a new place for all yon tea on web DM this episode is brought to you useful it's all get up so check out link here and in the description Jim once again first of all tunnel snakes rule tunnel snakes rule just wanted to get that out of the way we're talking about you on t1t you you want e I prefer personally snake people serpent folk why would you know what they call themselves the scaled ones scaly kind people of you there's a lot of different sort of names for them of course there's a lot of our own history and conspiracy theories you can draw from when dealing with reptilian humanoids such as yawn team I British have a whole thing about reptilian people this is probably one of my favorite of like monstrous peoples of a big fan of like pulp fantasy and so the stories have say the serpent man of Valusia in the king called stories or the various serpent people that show up in different conan tales or mythos horror it's just like alright I'm here for this yeah give me give me all kinds of snake people whether they got snake arm snakes for heads lower bodies of snakes cut them open snake spill out of them give it to me I'm here for yeah they're like rushing nesting monsters just snakes within snakes snakes are just kind of like tentacles another way of doing a cosmic or thing I think probably for me it's because I am not a particular fan of snakes they're just one of those animals that I look at it like man I hope we never meet each other and because I've lived in Texas that's not the case and rattlesnakes I've run into too many of them in my life water moccasins water moccasins copperheads it's one of those animals that you're like okay you got to stay away from this is the serpent it's a snake you know there's strong mythological and mystical symbolism to them and not always was it bad like not all snakes were seen as wise it's just one of those things where I finally have such rich potential and they are an antagonist in Dungeons and Dragons that I think works really well you could substitute them for drow you can substitute them for tea flings they've got that we used to be humans at one point but we did something terrible to ourselves I like that aspect of them particularly because it's it's one of those things of just like this this could be you given enough time and enough bad to say bad decisions yeah this could be you too this could be you too and if you get caught by them and they feel like that you would be a worthy addition to their society they can turn you into one of them they can create an abomination or a Malazan out of you and now you're just you've had your emotions too stripped from you and you've been suffuse dwith serpentine magics and praised endar eat the Sun praise didn't are the term morality tale has a whole new connotation when it comes to being turned into a snake person because it is that that whole like this ancient empire like they at one point they were the they were the top and now they're there they're hiding in the muck waiting for their chance waiting for their channel rise again I find like the auntie of say the Forgotten Realms really inspiring and that country of them was calling you know Raja or something like that around the serpent hills and the high more these are like dry dusty hills and they're riddled with all these tunnels where they live and then there's like this sulfurous mud flats nearby you can just imagine these like serpent people that have evolved to live in this environment and they're used to just the steam and the sulfur and the poison of it and they're just waiting there and it's like you got everybody's got to stay out of here do not come do not come around here this is our place we are a country that that is in this world and and sort of like trying to revitalize their fallen Empire and of course there must be up to no good which is why it's great source of adventure or there's the auntie that are in Choate that you might use for your own games it's like they are the descendants of whatever indigenous Empire was there that has long fallen and replaced by other successions of empires yeah you guys like did this to yourselves and I think that's why I like you auntie is that whereas I look at like orcs and goblins and and and all the others and it's like someone did something to them and now they've just had so long of a bad run of it that they're the evil guys no yawn T you guys did this to yourself like you know like you're the ones who started worshipping these gods you're the ones that transformed yourselves and they in this manner they're the one that rip your emotions from you and and made you this sort of like cold calculating monster and that's what's interesting about it I'm role played a yawn T before yes and that was the most interesting part I think trying to roleplay a superior emotionless just no empathy no sympathy you still have to work with these people I think there's a few inspirations from from pop culture that you can draw on I know I drew I drew from a more evil version of Q where it's just you almost think of these things it's just like yeah it's it's it's whatever but it's it's almost I would hate to say fun because they don't have emotions right but you know just being around these makes them kind of feel better because it's proof of his own superiority another more recent would be from the Orville Isaac who's the robot who's the completely superior but emotionless it's a great like watching that it's like oh yeah that's that's Y on t and then the last one I think of Sherlock Holmes just the mentality of just having to deal with these idiots that you're surrounded by constantly I mean just like you're not even a human it could be something to kind of draw from from a role-playing perspective really got to stretch yourself in these because this is an option that if you take it similar to say drow or tea flings or depending on what the way it works are portrayed in your world have a conversation about it with your group because you know the group might appreciate like having a spy in their midst or someone who's just kind of like yeah I'm tolerating being with you and you know well we'll see how long this lasts so in that sense I think like they're very pendant on like party composition and what kind of campaign you're playing but that's just if you're trying to use like baseline the aunty you know you reskin these guys and just about any any way you want and he'll they do every spring alright there we go transformed humans the decisions of an ancient magical society that they worship snakes and wanted to become more like them the potential for a reborn conflict that's millennia old that now that these like hibernating serpent people are returning to activity they're going to revive those conflicts yeah we went into you know hibernation for eons to skip ahead far enough in time so that you know we would be in a position to rebuild our empire we wouldn't have any competition from other big empires out there and they looked forward in time or just like yeah we put ourselves into sleep then we'll wake up and erupted from the ground are these giant breeding pits and snakes the world is made a little bit better for them to live in yeah I'd be a little hotter more humid they weighed out geological epochs that are incompatible with their physiology and but I've always wanted to create a monster that vacillates between life and undeath when they want to go into hibernation they transform themselves into a type of undead but when they're ready to re-emerge and and be active in the world they revitalize themselves someone that has if you conceive of save necrotic energy more like balancing and kind of act and and and you know they change their internal balance so that it's more like say dark necromancy and then whenever they're ready to come out they change it to light necromancy and then they're sort of like suffused with healing magic in life and shed their mummified dry snake skin to emerge pristine and glistening ready to greet the world as its next I am a snake so you see something like that you come across a hibernation chamber of them the presence of fresh blood awakens them before they're ready the meet creatures have arrived let us awake from our slumber and have breakfast if that was the case then like maybe they would seed the world with clues as to their whereabouts so that people will come to try to find them therefore ensuring that they have something to eat when they are ready those are more maybe away diems with what would conceive of them what about s'more player option the fact that they they do want to add to their empire so they have that whole like capture not kill mentality like at least there that's a way to ease into a party when we played there were well there were two aunties and it drew it right and the Giroud kind of been out of it for a bit so it was more like the auntie looked at each other and then looked at him it's like well at least we'll have some meat in case we've run out of other meat with us like we literally looked at you as like our reserve for observers yes so let's keep him alive outside of a party where two-thirds of the party is comprised of beyond tea I mean I could see how sometimes that might be a little rough to introduce into a normal like we're heroic adventuring party and this is re aunty just don't worry about him yeah unless they were playing some kind of like illusionist enchanter they had some disguise self or maybe they're a warlock of jinn dark and they take disguise self they never appear as a young team I mean to me that would be the heart of a yachty right like deception is is their thing I would love to play that because when that secret finally got out you want to talk about drama you want talk about story at the gaming table you're just embedding it for ten adventures down the road and it could be that like time away from the auntie and time away from their ritual cannibalistic practices from their serpent magic from all of that life in a deep undercover as a as a spy for them like they all know that you run the risk of like reversion and like your emotions coming back but it's a risk right and so those Y on t that go out into the world to spy or gather information or something like that like maybe they are seen as disposable in that way by their superiors and it's like yeah you provide us valuable information but when you come back from the outside world you will be tainted you will not be welcomed back in here because you're no longer pure you've been swimming amongst the muck you know these mongrel creatures we were at the height of our civilization they were just swinging through the trees kind of thing you know like that you which of those liberal cities and I think you learned off to live with people how dare you it's ripe for potential and you get that kind of like outcast from an evil society if you're looking to do that and you don't want to do the more traditional half work or drow jaunty is available for that or you could even just be like they're not sinister they're just like snake people and they're just weird and they're not the first player option that has like emotionless as part of their thing right there's several of like lizard folk have sort of an alien mindset like that kobolds or forged you could place a dragon born that way depending on how you see the relationship between them and Dragons and even something like Ravnica the the vettel can I believe they have that kind of same very cerebral we removed our sort of emotions and our different kind of person Simek hybrids it was similar alive I don't even know what that would be but maybe it is one of those things where it's like you're the magic still has to fight against you know your natural inclinations and if you if you don't renew it through these ritual practices in their society then maybe you do revert that's the reason why they just send these low people on the totem pole out into the world the pure blood cuz there's a more snake you look like the more power you have in their society so if you just look like a person that you got like little fangs or there were some scales behind the ears for like slit eyes I like them for for not just like snake people but like as this is a human that's experimented on themselves to some degree I in lamb between two rivers yon tear often the product of Vavoom answers most things in lamb treat two rivers are both its thing you know there are you aunty there but then I will also take them and rescan them for other things so they represented wastelanders that it had something done to them or did it to themselves when it comes to picking what kind of like if your snake people what kind of snake like there's so many different kinds of snakes you could you could come from a Yan T coral snake like with the you know red black and yellow stripes you know what would that look like or like a Diamondback of a black adder you know I mean these are these are all different because I think I went with a black mamba for Salazar yeah that was the base for him yes I like the black and the red and there's so many different varieties I would play more of their interaction with what how how evil they are based off the kind of snake if there's just like a like a grass snake there from you know some grasslands they just want to be left alone they just you know do their thing they hunt small prey they could be anything it could be anything yeah you could have great big constrictor snakes and maybe you switch around their stats a little bit you know give a strength instead of say charisma you know take away their poison unity and poison spray and maybe give them like a bonus to grapple or something like that and now you've got light bill a powerful bill now you've got wise beyond their years because they live for forever kind of snake person a a a someone who's maybe seen as a sage their emotionless 'no cysteine as an asset and it's like yeah they we found a place for them they recognize the value of being part of our society and we take advantage of their different perspectives we appreciate the fact that this you know this group of very slow very methodical very patient Reptoids have something to offer us because they think right and with that different way of thinking that lack of emotion they're of course less likely to get rattled oh I'm talking like other serpent type creatures that they might be connected with the one that immediately comes to mind is Nagas of course whether it's antagonistic or cooperative Hydra would be one even just like dragons you know like there's all sorts of creatures in the monster mail that like different versions of dragons don't have legs and they're more like serpent I mean like more like Chinese dragons make sense to that you can just kind of trim a little bit and you know these guys they're just like kind of the coal bulbs instead of cobalt Stu dragon you could very much be that they are the ones that are the true descendants of that instead of saved kobolds or a dragon born or you could just sort of like mix them all together and just say like these are the Reptoids we've got portals we've got you on tea we've got lizard folk and kobolds and dragon born one of the things i like sort of about Tiamat from her you know mythological origins is the idea of like yeah she's just like hanging out with Abzu and a bunch of gods came along and killed her husband and now she's just like pissed about it and she'd rather be just like asleep and chilling out in the oceans it's only just like the chattering of these mice nothing furry creatures don't even lay eggs they give grosses it to give birth to live young with milk like how disgusting is that like maybe that's just the basis for it so a little mammalian all of these Reptoid people's are put on the earth to just like cleanse it of all these mammals and make it safe for dragons and and serpent kind again because they just breed like well they breed like mammals the concepts that you can you can make with this character given the traits especially that that charisma int yeah bonus it's a little weird if they're emotionless why they have a charisma bonus unless it's like their lack of emotion makes them more adept at manipulating others right well they're just standoffish I mean it's the ultimate like Dow of Steve or whatever like since they they don't show any interest everybody you know nature abhors a vacuum they're just constantly making people they're the ultimate bad boys right just reminds me of my father your father had scales well nobody no charisma is there because this is really one where I feel like they want you to play like warlocks and sorcerers or just any kind of real casting because I mean a little bump to in also I mean you could be a wizard what game was we were running where someone playing like a auntie mystic I was Josh in the he had like giant growth and and he took all the spells all the powers are like let him change his physical form and say you just like turn it like a giant constrictors and just enormous least spit I remember I'm soloing that Lich for a while so there was that that's maybe one way to do it that that they just represent any kind of like ant based caster maybe you flip it around it's plus two n plus one charisma I just took that that charisma bonus and made a paladin oh yeah because you know everything else who cares but at least I can put my lower stat in charisma and it won't be as low it's the way I saw it I told my invisible son character was a serpent person she called upon the serpent it was like one of the things that I had for for her was like heard the spells that she would have selected would be reflected in the color of her scales an invisible son every school of magic has a color associated with it right so maybe you can like translate something like that to D&D and if you've got like a sorcerer or a wizard jaunty and they do have scales or something like that that may be the kind of magic that they're proficient in is reflected in arcane patterns runes on their scales that changes over time you could do that with say a draconic lineage sorcerer angle like well maybe it's we're gonna like slightly reskin this and maybe pick you know energy type that fits more like serpent the wings are gonna be like feathered wings you know so you get that sort of like multicolored cosmic serpents feel to them now I've talked myself into into a TV character you can peyten up and play up that magical element to them the fact that they do have this strong connection with magic and like you can like lean into that and make them more than just people with like snake features that they are magical snake creatures really find inspiration in the mythology and the like of you know serpent gods too to make a Castro den Darby praised in Darby Perez I like a good mythology that involves a cosmic serpent you know like shedding its scales and creating stars and planets the first God's being bon mots and demons and their conflicts fuelling like the creation of worlds and mountains and rivers and things the first Celestials being massive serpents that that come and live in the world and like in part the the wisdom of the gods two people maybe it's not like a reptilians versus mammalians thing but it's like the Reptoids were the first people here and they see it as their responsibility to like Usher everyone and into that we were rushing in talking about concepts with with with the traits but we can go ahead and move into that because I like I already said charisma plus two and plus one they get dark vision Hey why wouldn't they why wouldn't I have snakes can see in the dark the trend that is as of late which is the innate spell casting of these player races that's the new hotness that is the new hottest thing is it's old but it's still like you know it seems like half of them now getting poison spray as a canned trip it's a it's one of those canned trips I find that people usually don't take but when you have it yeah like I used it quite a bit if you don't have a you know a class that has something like that then it could be handy poison is one of those damage types that if you're looking at just like pure numbers and break down along with fire one of those that's really commonly resisted by monsters and the like I think a lot of people discount it or or don't like consider it as maybe an option or something but having access to it certainly thematic there's all different ways you can reskin it the big thing with any kind of innate spell casting is the to answer the question are these actual spells as in does this person have to do the Josh sure's say the words use the material components can it be counter spelled can it be dispelled like is it a spell or is it just using spells as a way to shorthand a special ability to me that's always something I want to answer and it's one of those things where it's like any kind of innate spell casting whether it's you on tea or furl bogs or drow or something like that more inclined to say like this is a consequence of the magic inherent in you and like spells represent the ability of someone that doesn't have inherent magic working their magic you've got poison spray because you're a snake person you have a poison gland in your jaw and you constrict your muscles in your mouth and shoot it out even the animal friendship with snakes is a consequence of all different of just like some of its training some of its like a very subtle form of magic maybe it's that all of these serpents are really super intelligent and we just listened to them and talked to them then maybe we don't get along we're trying to do is tell us how to how to change our lives for the better and we run away screaming I do love that hold the animal friendship with snakes like at will and it's so formatic and I think we carried around just a bag of snakes because at any time when we would need some I hate animal friendship go do a thing but then suggestion once a day which this kind of goes back to I just think of Jungle Book oh yeah just the spirally eyes and just this is it you snakes you got it you got to watch him like suggestions kind of that it does play into that sort of like a reverse of the snake charmer archetype but it is that the the mystical the yeah don't just they're just gonna talk to you and you'll do something it's not overt there's nothing necessarily flashy about it it's that creepiness it's the subtlety it's the deception that makes you aunty so fun to play even if they're even if they're like play along and they're good like they might just be mistaken like oh you're a serpent person and have to deal with the fact that maybe people just don't trust you our have to work harder to to gain their trust and maybe eventually they you know overcome their difficulties and it's all good and blah blah blah having that in your back pocket is certainly pretty fun a fun suggestion place at the right moment can stave off so many combat you know just tell someone can you just take a lap please just walk away that's my favorite one for suggestion just just walk away just put down your weapon and walk away you don't even have to fight I just love the open-ended yeah you have to follow this for eight hours it's a powerful spell it's cool that it sort of like reinforces there are sort of themes of course all these things can be changed up and made more specific to your specific type of yan tea but of course when you do that much stuff to your own body with magic you're gonna develop some resistance you're gonna you're gonna build up that resistance a bit so that's maybe why the pure bullets can't go full snake magic resistance is one of those abilities that changes practically every edition of D&D it used to be like a percentile that you just like rolled and you had to get above it after that it was sort of like a static number that you had to get above on a caster check there have been spells of the Lord or whatever and now in fifth edition it's just sort of it began I advantage on safes versus magic or save versus spells and spell like effects and on the one hand I miss the old school oh yeah you didn't I've got 95 percent magic resistance not touching me because it also was like yeah I that means I cannot benefit from good from beneficial spells guy can't be healed I can't benefit from a haste or a dimension doors yeah some creatures could lower it voluntarily but then they don't have their protection against against magic there it's a strong ability in fifth edition but isn't the like killer ability it's been in Prior the closest thing I can think of is what gnome that gets advantage on int charisma and wisdom saves on magical effects from this is just you know magic resistance and if you're playing like an oath of ancients paladin you could also have resistance to magic damage I mean I went to a conquest but I can see that I like clothes of ancients just because the resistance to magic damage or ability and just like the theme of that style of paladin an ancient kind of like tree Viper or something like that you know when those ones that there's coils of world he's been trying to fracture a part since the beginning and only by my coils am i keeping it together it's sort of like an opposite of the the serpent choose you know gnaws at the roots of the world tree it's the serpent protects the world tree that could be the secret hidden truth yeah that the millions they have perverted for their own propaganda against stupid mammalians of course they have poison immunity yeah the immune to the poison condition yes which you know that takes care of that poison condition is like the feature of a lot of low-level monsters and mid-level monsters as well and just like bee and it's some nasty effects come along with with poison you know it's one of those things where you know I'm not sure if you're a DM out there poisoning your enemy's weapons can and probably should if it's appropriate and this is I've suppose that and this is just one it's like yeah I don't want to be knocked unconscious by this thing I wanted to take an extra 12 d6 and damage I don't want to have to deal with all this just give me the weapon and and you know don't worry about it given how common poison is I can see it coming up huh quite a bit and of course languages you know common abyssal jerk on it because that you know they're there God is kind of evil they're kind of descendant from dragons if they're more serpentine I mean it's it's whatever you know I would let them you know speak with serpents and and talk with them I'd let them do all kinds of serpent magic adjacent things you just like reinforce the flavor of them everything I love you auntie and I I've tried to work them into every setting that I have I tried to find a place for them mostly because I do think they make great villains look at him just a little bit differently you don't like have them be always wicked always evil and you're just having more alien and unknowable and weird that's closer to how I have the the auntie planet Starbound they haven't gotten there yet it's like falsi doom not evil just more hedonistic not so much evil yes so I'm sure L real love and of course there are the you aunty fertility cults you should never forget about those never forget about a good fertility call never forget about a good breeding pit if you liked the

today really sure they were just really thank you myself Oh bill mater's blessings be upon you appreciate it thank you very much I really do I like going on there and if you talk to em over there she can probably give you a cookie that I made this morning so the Sphinx you know support system uh-huh it's pretty infallible right I mean they want to kill a couple of I'm sure I have four spaces that take us to the section of the city and I know but if I walk in the building would you still be able to hear it because I was gonna walk in there behind hills from the mist and then turn around I mean I don't want to be too intrusive because I don't want to mess with her with their vibe
