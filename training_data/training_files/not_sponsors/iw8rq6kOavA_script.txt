hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's video the Spanish Civil War and Tao Generalissimo Francisco Franco managed to achieve quite an unlikely victory it is October 1938 a bomber plane screams above the burned-out buildings of Madrid the inhabitants below scurry for cover but the bomb they heard was not intended for them not this time at least instead a paper bag wrapped in a nationalist flag and attached to a small parachute slowly drifts down from above also attached is a note in a national Spain great and free there is no home without a fire nor a family without bread one of these starving inhabitants quickly snatches up the bread inside leaving the bag behind it is more of a taunt than a gift the nationalist military forces of Elko do their leader have besieged the city since their failed coup attempt two years ago slowly starving the inhabitants into submission the grueling siege would last another five months [Music] [Music] the Spanish Civil War perhaps best to known as a proxy conflict between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union gave the world an early look at the type of war that would be waged on a global scale only a few years later in the early decades of the 20th century communist and fascist groups surged in popularity competing for nothing less than total domination on the international stage in the Spanish Civil War these two worldviews clashed and the result was disaster before we start today's episode sign up using the link in the description below [Music] the cow do we spoke of earlier was none other than Francisco Franco an avowed monarchist in the days of the Spanish Republic Franco went on to take over the country and pursue neutrality as the world descended into war remaining in power up until his death in 1975 but how did he go from military commander of a small colonial garrison to the totalitarian leader of all of Spain the civil war in Spain represented the culmination of a period of inept leadership in increasing polarization in the country as the financial gap widened between the wealthy often devoutly Catholic elements of the country and middle-class workers both groups were increasingly drawn to political extremist ideas and rhetoric including monarchism fascism communism and militant anarchism to name a few the Austrian miners strike in 1934 served as a grim prologue to the conflict to come the labor uprising had begun in opposition to the rise of the Catholic conservative political party the spanish confederation of autonomous rights were SATA which socialist union leaders believed held dictatorial ambitions and to be quite honest they weren't completely wrong he'll rob lace the leader of seda and admirer of the German Nazi Party had declared that democracy is not an end but a means to the conquest of the new state when the time comes either Parliament submits or we will eliminate it troops under the then Major General Franco brutally crushed the labor uprising giving him a reputation for merciless pragmatism political enemies and a growing loyalty among the rank and file sure enough he'll rub laces words were more than just rhetoric [Music] Ceyda narrowly lost the 1936 Spanish general election to a left-wing coalition called the Popular Front unsatisfied with the result a far-right military faction co-led by Franco launched a coup d'etat on July 17th of that year the Nationalists as they called themselves Pope to overwhelm the newly elected Popular Front government before the Republican loyalists had time to react however their initial efforts were only partially successful just four days after the coup began nationalists had control of Spanish Morocco the Canary Islands and most of the Balearic Islands on the mainland they controlled much of the territory north of the guadarrama Mountains in most other areas forces loyal to the Nationalists were not influential enough to mount a proper attempt at insurrection but come August the Nationalists made rapid progress by swiftly thrusting through Western Spain as part of what was essentially a peninsular blitzkrieg troops from the army of Africa led the advance ultimately paving the way for Franco's ascension to supreme commander of the nationalist forces in October attempts to take the capital repeatedly failed but further peripheral offensives in 1937 secured Malaga in the South and the industrial enriched autonomous regions in the north in contrast the main Republican assault that year on Zaragoza was a complete disaster due to poor reconnaissance and a lack of coordinate during the attempt to take the fortified town of Fuentes del a brawl Republican troops rode into battle on the holes of Soviet supply dt-5 tanks but suffered heavy casualties after the battle an American volunteer row courage and heroism are plentiful in Spain and the Spanish people have no lack of it what they need is tactics and as for tactics on 13 October regiment Beattie was bankrupt 1938 proved to be one of if not the most intense year of the conflict with the Nationalists achieving a crucial victory during their spring Aragon offensive slicing the Republican zone in two moreover the failed Republican attempt at reuniting their territories in the Battle of abro the largest of the war drained Republican military power to its breaking point 1939 saw Catalonia easily subdued by Franco and that same year the war was over [Music] the civil war in Spain was certainly not an unbroken string of Francoist victories but the Nationalists almost always have the upper hand but why was that the case well first off the uniquely high nationalist troop quality in comparison to the Republican foe is of great importance the nationalist advance in August 1938 which secured its territorial integrity for the rest of the war was only made possible by its most elite formation the army of Africa composed of both Spanish colonial troops and North African regularise it was led by a cadre of well-trained and highly professional officers called African East us the army of Africa advanced ruthlessly securing vast swathes of agriculturally rich territories for the nationalist cause opposed only by hastily armed peasants and were commissioned by early 1937 they had increased in size to around 60,000 troops from a measly 1,500 during their initial deployment the year before both the local African and Spanish soldiers of the army of Africa possessed a professionalism that was matched only by their capacity for viciousness they repeatedly committed atrocities against both soldiers and civilians in areas they conquered due to their infamous reputation nationalist commanders would place them in the most dangerous positions along the front to intimidate Republican forces but it wasn't brute force alone that allowed nationalist forces to triumph at this time much of Spain's land was devoted to traditional agriculture and controlled by a small group of aristocrats during the Civil War these land owning conservative elites almost unanimously sided with the rebellious nationalists this gave the Nationalists a decisive logistical advantage in a radio address Franco proclaimed that the Battle of wheat as he called it was as important as or even more so than those at the front food became such an alluring motif that nationalist propaganda directed at often omission Republican soldiers almost always emphasized the full stomachs of Franco truce so how exactly did nationalist administrators acquire such a well-regulated food supply during such a devastating war while the Republicans failed to do so as it turns out the Nationalists partial coup in 1936 was more successful than it initially seemed capturing the agriculturally rich regions of Andalusia and Castile meant that by 1937 the Nationalists possessed twice the wheat reserves of their adversaries furthermore the military regime employed an ethos of pragmatic productivism to ensure output was high granting incentives to effective producers of grain meat and other essential foodstuffs regardless of ideological concerns perhaps most importantly nationalist military administrators were ordered not to disrupt communities under nationalist control a proactive effort was made to ensure that the population was kept fed and potential enemies kept suppressed this efficient management led to a relative continuity of normal life for local populations in contrast to the relative order behind Franco's lines the Republic under its president Manuel aza√±a was almost perpetually in a state of internal division with its many factions squabbling with one another the most notable of these civil wars within a civil war is known as the may days of 1937 which broke out in Catalonia and pitted Republicans against far left anarchist and socialist factions this strike resulted in roughly a thousand dead and 1,500 wounded now I'd like to introduce my friend Hilbert from history with Hilbert to talk a bit about the foreign intervention in the war superior domestic military units were a key determinant in the nationalist victory but foreign military aid was just as vital despite the signing of a non-intervention pact in August of 1936 the fascist governments of Germany and Italy and the dick toriel regime in Portugal continue to aid Francoist Spain critically these allies also assisted in transporting the army of Africa across the Strait of Gibraltar as well as sending combat aircraft and armoured vehicle reinforcements around 350 tanks and a thousand 260 aircraft notably the condor legion a german volunteer formation compromising air and ground forces proved highly effective in maintaining air superiority in many battles and is perhaps most notorious for its participation in the leveling of the basque city of Guernica an event many at the time and to this day rightfully cease a war crime well novel for 1937 the targeted mass bombing of a civilian area became a staple German tactic during the Second World War in order to psychologically force an enemy population to submit while on a smaller scale new tank tactics were trial that would form the basis of the famous blitzkrieg in Europe if you want to find out more about how the Spanish Civil War influenced the Second World War then head over to my channel history with Hilbert and give it a watch as for the Republican government they were for the most part on their own no democracy was bold enough to risk escalating the conflict so the task fell to the Communists the Soviet Union sent up to approximately three hundred and sixty tanks and eight hundred planes unlike their nationalist counterparts however the Republicans had to pay for a lot of these goods during the war it should be noted that despite the neutrality of many democratic governments many sympathetic citizens of those nations did volunteer in what was known as the International Brigades however they did not prove particularly effective we can therefore conclude that by almost all measures the foreign support that the Nationalists received was far more robust altogether loyal and professional military units order behind the lines and a pragmatically organized authoritarian economy and food supply as well as extensive foreign backing created the conditions that led to nationalist victory in 1939 the ripple effects produced by the Spanish Civil War on the country it was fought in cannot be overstated widespread economic destruction and deaths to other countries took the nation decades to recover from and recent estimates indicate that around 500,000 people died during the war out of a population comprising only 25 million some put the number of as high as two million little wonder why Spain stayed neutral during the Second World War today the Spanish people still feel the cultural echoes of their civil war on a wider scale the Spanish Civil War served as a macabre testing ground for Germany Italy and the Soviet Union tactics and technologies that were to be employed with great effect in the coming Second World War were perfected on the fields and streets of Spain from Wescoe to Madrid [Music] [Music] you
