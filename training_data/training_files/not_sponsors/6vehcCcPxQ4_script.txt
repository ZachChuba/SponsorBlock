hey groupies welcome back to form therapy this is the culture study i'm the channel's video producer and your host you can call me pd and today we are checking out monster from irene and sergey the new sub unit from red velvet which coincidentally they are my two favorite red velvet members really excited for this i heard a lot of exciting things in the description let's check out this video this is monster by irene and tsuki and this is your form of therapy [Music] um [Music] my god [Music] i'm a little monster [Music] [Music] foreign oh [Music] my god [Music] oh [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] forever [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow whoa please tell me there's a performance music video for this [Music] wow oh well looks like there's some kind of video for this wow or we're definitely checking that out again but initial impressions songs called monster which isn't the first sm song to be called monster um obviously there's exo's monster which i love the song for this actually feels horror inspired you know um i think the main piano hook the that sounds very much uh like classic horror uh scores um the big droning sounds typically what you would hear i would say in dubstep also gives it a much more of a intimidating much more darker sense to the song which is really interesting because the droning sound sounds a lot more um deeper like more on the low end whereas the keys actually sound a lot more higher so like they contrast each other really well too um i want to watch this again i want to see this again i i do feel like the music video um here's the thing the music video i i can't tell if this was a big budget or not because these sets that they did have were huge and they they were honestly incredibly beautiful they were gorgeous but there are actually very few set changes um typically in a music video there are at least double the amount of set changes for this um i don't know if that was just an intentional choice for this or because this is a sub unit and um they i i don't know i guess they they're not sure if a red velvet subunit will make as much monetary value as a full group unit come back so they invested less into it i i don't know what the case is because i mean honestly irene and turkey are such popular members i do think that they would make the same amount if not close to the the revenue of a red velvet come back and so that's why i'm a little bit confused because the music video has very few sets and it reuses a lot of shots um or at least a lot of um set pieces but it feels glamorous and rich and still holds up to the same red velvet standard um so i definitely want to check this out again i want to dive a little deeper into this song because this song is incredible like it's very much a red velvet sound very r b inspired very um uh i would say american r b inspired uh there's a specific portion uh syracuse portion that i really really liked that i want to highlight but let's watch it again and then we'll we'll continue talking about it what so it starts with irene in the front and sergey in the back but it ends with the reverse but i love this it's such like a visually visceral look let's start that over god i love how they're like all like morphed together into one [Music] one monster one two five [Music] foreign the so that sound sounds very horror inspired this uh music video looks very much more like classic um like like the european victorian era type of horror um you've got bugs on the wall bones on the wall [Music] okay so part of this set design i feel like plays into that um let's let's see if we can get a better yeah okay so i'm just noticing this about the set which i really like uh first of all um you've got the broken windows which gives you your classic you know sort of haunted house sort of feeling but another thing that makes it interesting is actually the backdrop right here on the left so first of all i'm gonna move actually to this shot so that you can see it better so this portion right here if you see the line right here it's not flush it's not um it's not level uh it's slanted upwards so first of all i mean there are several horror movies um where the house morphs and takes different shapes um and the crooked look already shows you that something's off and then they also have this uh staircase this never-ending staircase another classic horror movie trope is when the when when you're going down a staircase and it feels like it's never ending it's always um repeating um it has that sort of like you enter the haunted house and you can't get out sort of feeling um so parts of this already give this uh give this a more it's very subtle i would say because it's very dark and it's in the background and it's a little bit out of focus um but it gives you this feeling of creepiness uh which i really like [Music] i love that i love like the big dramatic droning sounds um also i feel like what is intensely very horror inspired twins uh creepy twins are very big uh hor trope um so our sisters um a very famous korean movie called tale of two sisters um uh i feel like the white outfit uh sort of portrays innocence um usually among the female protagonists and they're they it kind of gives you this feeling of investing into them because then they see so much blood or so many horrifying things so yeah i feel like i feel like that's sort of the inspiration for that love [Music] i'm not quite sure uh i never watched rocky horror picture show but i wonder if that based on what i've seen from um uh images from rocky horror i wonder if this is sort of inspired by that i know it's a little bit more inspired by glam um if you look at the lighting here uh they have basically a giant a little bit uh overblown stage lighting so it's like a spotlight on her and then everyone else is uh darker and like you can see the giant hair light above them too so uh and and just like the whole neon aspect and the way they're dressed with the glitter it kind of feels like rocky horror but again i i've never personally watched rocky horror so based on just like images i've seen that's what it kind of reminds me [Music] i think so like they're using a lot of dubstep elements which is a very interesting way to personify the horror and the music and i believe this is going to be the sergi part that i like man if this was a red velvet b-side i would have i would have said like this is one of the best red velvet b-sides of all time but this is a title track but oh my god i love circuit circus pride [Music] [Music] she's like singing from her soul in that one i love it [Music] oh and then creepy dolls i'm not a fan of dolls [Music] i love the movements too the choreo for this is really interesting [Music] i wonder if they're also supposed to be like opposites or mirror each other i wonder and this move here i like that a lot like i like that the choreo a lot of it is like really really fast and then the chorus when it's just like whoa the way they move to that the way they sway to that [Music] oh my god why [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] oh that part right there [Applause] [Music] oh i'm a little monster holy crap irene and turkey went hard they went hard hard i oh my god oh my god wow this is incredible i mean it's not to say red velvet has never done a concept like this red velvet has done darker moodier creepier concepts but i think what i think what makes this kind of pop is first of all the incorporation of the dubstep is just very jarring but in a very good way it works for this a lot but it's the choreo i think that's what stands out to me the most it is such visceral in your face engaging choreo i don't think i know i will personally from what i've seen i don't think i've seen red velvet do choreo like this my god red velvet even to this day is able to surprise me um i think this is incredible um i think this works because this is a sub unit i think i think sergey and irene really really shine here um i don't know if this would necessarily have the same impact if this was a group comeback so yeah i i personally i give this song a 9 out of 10. um obviously we've only heard it twice that might go up or down whenever i listen to it a little bit more so you know ask me again in a couple weeks in like a live stream but the music video even though like i said there aren't too many set changes i i really kind of don't care that there aren't too many set changes right because i think the set the sets that already do exist are so visually interesting and captivating that i feel like yeah i don't need it you know i don't need too many different set changes and it kind of gives me a better focus on the choreo too which i will definitely be checking out choreo stuff as well on our patreon but guys thanks for watching let me know what you thought about monster from irene and turkey and once again a lifetime supply of rosetta stone uh with the youtube search algorithm uh
