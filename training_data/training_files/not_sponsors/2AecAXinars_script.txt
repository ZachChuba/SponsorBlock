when we talk to each other we look each other in the eyes and it's a huge part of effective conversation and is vital for building a good rapport with whoever you're talking to however with so many people using video chat systems at home these days we are looking at a screen so we actually lose that eye contact because we're not looking at the camera and this is a shame because we do lose a fairly important part of communication when this happens so in this video I'm actually going to be showing you how to build a system that allows you to retain eye contact with whoever you're talking to over the Internet it's not particularly difficult to do and it's super cool so let's get to it now a cool thing about the system is that it's actually collapsible so it's great for portability as it can fit inside your laptop back and first thing that you got and the first thing I'm going to show you how to build is a collapsible shroud now this actually fits onto the laptop light so and surrounds the screen and this is super important for the whole system to work as you will see but to make it we actually need some sheets of foam board we're using foam board here because it's a craft level material and is therefore very easy for most people to work with at home it consists of a sheet of foam sandwiched between two layers of cardboard so as a result it's very lightweight and relatively rigid now I won't be giving specific measurements for the shroud we're going to make with these as all laptops are different sizes and shapes so instead I'll be showing you how to make one specifically for your own laptop we'll start by making the top of the shroud which we can simply take a sheet of foam board and cut off an edge with the help of a ruler it's important to use a freshly sharp tool for this for a clean and neat cut otherwise you'll just end up with org a tears which doesn't look good at all the piece we've just cut off can now be glued on top and because the surface of the foam board is essentially cardboard we can just use craft level glue using this new pieces of reference we can actually place the laptop on top and Mark its front edge and this will define the depth of the shroud once this is trimmed down we need to glue a new piece on top in order to make a little groove along the back edge the function of this groove is to actually clip onto the screen bezel holding itself in place the next piece we'll make is for the bottom of the shroud which sits just above the keyboard and you need to leave a little gap between it and the front of the screen so to connect these pieces together and make the folding system we can cut out some side pieces which then need to be divided exactly in half now these actually need to be joined together again but instead of using tape which is likely to detach every time we're going to glue on a piece of fabric this basically makes it into a simple hinge but because of the thickness of the phone board it doesn't allow it to open any further than flat using some more fabric we can glue these to the top and bottom pieces being careful of alignment with the fronts of all the pieces being level with each other and once it's dried it should open and close quite easily nice notice how the sides overlap the edges of the top and bottom which prevents them from opening too far giving it a test you may find out that there's quite a bit of play so to rectify this I recommend gluing in place some small triangles that can rest against the screen itself hold it nice and squarely in place so as you can see it completely surrounds the screen and because it's black it means that it blocks a lot of external light which improves image quality in the final system so with the shroud complete now what we need next is a very special mirror now this might look like any old mirror but it is in fact a two-way mirror which means that it lets some light through it's made of plastic and you can get them from most good craft shops or the internet link in the description if you can't find one locally and it actually fits inside the shroud like so that's a 45-degree angle and can be held in place by some clips now to make the clips is actually just a case of cutting through the foam board at an angle so that a pair of mini shelf brackets can slide in place now you might be thinking what on earth is this for how does it work doesn't it block the screen well because it's two-way the light from the screen can pass through it yes a slightly dimmer but you can still see it just fine when indoors and it works really well it almost looks like it's not there at all however if I put my hand in front of it you can see that the mirror is in fact reflecting light from the bottom of the shroud and this is the fundamental function of the whole build because it allows us to actually get an external webcam again this is DIY but I'll show you all about it in just a minute and put it on the shroud and it can see you through the reflection on the mirror now I will be explaining why this is significant in just a minute but before then I'm gonna show you how to make this webcam which as you can see is super thin this thinness is achieved by repurposing the webcam out of an old dead laptop as they're designed to be flat this is a great way to recycle otherwise useless electronics that you or your friends might have lying around which keeps this project cheap and accessible that said if you don't have a dead laptop to disassemble you can even buy these things separately online as spare parts and they are extremely cheap you can find some links to the correct search terms in this video's description to help you to find them whichever way you acquire them they do need to be wired up to a USB cable in order to be used as an external webcam it is recommended that you use a soldering iron for this but you can just about get away with twisting the wires together if you don't have one as there are only four wires to worry about they do need to be connected up correctly however so when you get to this stage check out my video on how to do this properly over at the new DIY perks extra channel which contains everything you need to know there's a link to it in the description and perhaps you can consider subscribing whilst you're at it anyway once why I dopey can give it a test and should work just like any old external webcam usually without even needing any drivers nice with it now confirmed to be working we can glue it inside a piece of foamboard which keeps it nice and secure and protects any delicate wiring it does need to be completely black though so we can cover it with some black fabric that has a hole in the middle for the lens to see out of now as it is a little bit lightweight we can glue some washers together and paint them black after which they can be viewed on top to make it just about heavy enough to not be influenced too much by the stiffness of the wire when slid around with it placed inside the shroud it looks upwards towards the mirror however it being black means that we can't really see its reflection but if I shine a light on it you can see that its reflection actually appears to be on the same plane as the screen itself and as such it looks out at the user from this point this is all thanks to the mirror being angled at 45 degrees as most of the light coming in gets directed down towards the camera for as light from the screen at the back can pass through it unhindered if you look closely the distance from the point of bounce to the camera is the same as the point of bounce to the back of the screen and it's this consistency in distance that creates the illusion so with it all complete now I think it's about time we give it a test so I'm just previewing the camera feed on the camera app in Windows and if I position the camera inside the shroud so it's vague reflection appears to be over my face it should mimic a Skype call with someone else and if it looks like I'm making eye contact with you then the system is actually working and as far as I can tell it's like I'm looking in a mirror and when you look in the mirror you're always making eye contact with yourself so so far so good so this is looking so thank you for honey for sponsoring this video and back to the video now sometimes when you're on a webcam call getting even lighting on your face can be a bit tricky so what I've done is make a little DIY tube light now this is actually really easy to make and the first thing it needs is a strip of tracing paper as this will diffuse the light and make it soft and easy on the eyes now I can stick a thin strip of metal along the bottom I have a piece of aluminium here but it could equally be an old metal ruler or something it doesn't matter too much with that done we can now apply some double-sided tape onto the back of some kitchen foil and in turn stick this just above the metal strip as this will act as a reflector for the strip of LED tape we're going to use as the light source once the tracing paper is looped around and stuck in place we can now wire the LEDs up to a 12 volt DC power adapter like one from an old Rooter or external hard drive normally I'd solder this but just like with the webcam it's not strictly Cerie and you can actually get away with just twisting the wires together make sure that you get the right polarity however as it won't light up otherwise and make sure that you insulate the connectors with some electrical tape so that they don't touch each other and short out looking good so with that it can just fit on top of the shroud like so giving you an even lighting now time for the call hello how are you I'm all right so I'm testing out the new eye contact webcam system so I've positioned what looks like the vague reflection of the camera over your face so this should look like I'm making eye contact yes it's a lot different from a normal call well it is it makes you feel as though I'm really talking to you okay cool because for me you're actually looking at the screen because I haven't made one of these for you yet and as a result I've lost that eye contact from my side but if you look up at the camera yeah that kind of fakes it but the thing is you can't respond to my facial expressions and there's not that link there yeah well sometimes some people do that you see they actually intentionally look up at the camera but that's super unnatural whereas this system you actually are naturally organically looking someone in the face so actually it actually works pretty well I think yeah well I don't know about you guys but I'm super impressed with how well this works I'm not even very many downsides either because I mean maybe it's size is kind of bulky but you can fold it down so that's alright but I hope you guys make this actually because it's not very expensive I'm not very hard to do and you can make them for your family and have a little network of people you can converse with properly over the Internet which you will enjoy when you see it actually in action now before I go I just want to say a huge thank you to my patreon supporters that are supporting me at patreon.com slash D I perks because the numbers have shot up recently and I really appreciate your guys support it means a lot so thanks a lot and I hope you enjoyed the videos that I come out with into the future but other than that I'm at you can watching DIY perks and I hope to see you next time good bye for now
