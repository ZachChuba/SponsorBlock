this right here is a perfect example of how long it takes groundbreaking new technology to be commercialized this is one of the first 4k 144 Hertz HDR monitors on the planet and even though we've had 4k monitors for over five years and fast refresh rates are even longer than that and the bandwidth to push all of those pixels since DisplayPort 1.4 was ratified in 2016 and even though we saw this thing running beautifully at CES one and a half years ago it is only now finally in our shop for review so then after all that waiting is the PG 27 UQ even worth the $2,000 price tag or is it still too far ahead of its time up your rig check it out at the link in the video description [Music] let's jump right into the meat of the specs starting with the resolution its 4k 3840 by 2160 which as we all know looks great at 27 inches it's not quite what I guess Apple would define as retina but it is pretty darn close it's also a quantum dot display which gives it more saturated but more accurate and more brighter colors than a regular LCD allowing it to achieve over 90% coverage of the DCI p3 color gamut now this monitor is marketed at gamers but because of that it could easily be used for color critical tasks on a professional workstation mmm delicious cake that I can both have and tape I have and how much of it are eight for me of course a lot of these qualities are closely related to the next big buzzword on the box HDR a good HDR display needs two things one lots of color data and to lots of brightness and the PG 27 UQ has both fruit n bit color so no 8-bit Plus FRC baloney and 1000 nits peak brightness which it can hit in any of its 384 zones that's the same number of full array local dimming zones as the Nvidia BFG display that we saw at C yes but since this is only a 27-inch monitor the zones are way smaller at under an inch square so you don't get nearly the same halo effect around bright objects on dark backgrounds but we've seen 4k HDR monitors before but what makes this monitor really special is the high refresh rate up to a hundred and forty-four Hertz that is if you can manage to push the frame rates of your games that high 4k monitors are tough to drive even at 60 Hertz and 44 well this is where the cherry on top of all of those specs we already told you about g-sync is supposed to come in handy since the most dramatic tearing and juddering happens when you're running between 40 and 60 frames per second g-sync smooths out those wrinkles significantly so then it's basically perfect god of monitors no compromises go buy one now right hold on there's actually been some controversy around the PG 27 uq and it's acer cousin that uses the same auo panel and gsync module it turns out that DisplayPort 1.4 uses the same transmission mode as 1.3 which is capped out at 32 point four gigabit per second or 4k at 120 Hertz not 144 DisplayPort 1.4 adds support for a technology called display stream compression which allows it to send extra color information so 4k 120 with 4 4 4 chroma and HDR what that means in a nutshell is that in order to refresh at a hundred and forty four Hertz you actually have to overclock the monitor using the on-screen display this instructs the system to free up bandwidth by reducing color information down to a chroma subsampling ratio of four to two now in real people speak is that something you're gonna notice in games probably not unless you were running two systems side by side and really looking for it with a trained eye I mean chroma subsampling is commonly used in the movie industry but it is noticeable with text on top of a flat color which for PC use is pretty common I mean just look at the last two rows here the good news is that if you turn the refresh rate back down to 120 the effect goes away but some buyers were still upset because damn it the box says 144 Hertz and it cost more than Linus's car and that is a fair point but at least the exterior of the display should make most gamers pretty happy it's got an unapologetically game relook with all sorts of aggressive lines projecting LEDs and I mean why not a gigantic RS ink compatible RGB badge on the back it's a thick monitor with chunky vessels I mean not that you were going to be able to drive more than one of them at the same time anyway or afford more than one of them and it consumes up to 75 watts as measured from the wall with a very robust stand that offers lots of movement in all the relevant axes okay got all that stuff out of the way so back to should you buy this monitor you might have noticed that there's still a lot of video left to watch that's because it's kind of a complicated answer for the sightseeing triple-a gamer we could just say well which are three running at ultra settings on 4k or Deus Ex with HDR turned on they look utterly fantastic and call it a day but you're only gonna get about 50 fps and that's definitely playable it's a good experience problem is there are many cheaper monitors out there that can do that even with a Titan V and all the settings cranked down at 4k these kinds of games still only hit around seventy to a hundred frames per second so if you wanted to play demanding triple-a titles at 4k 144 FPS well based on our back of napkin analysis of GPU performance and release trends over the last few years it looks like you're gonna have to wait two maybe even three generations of graphics cards we're talking three to five years before you could fully take advantage of the PG 27 uqs capabilities and do you think that a monitor of this caliber is still going to cost to brand in 2022 probably not but that's not to say that you can't enjoy all of its benefits together today let's turn our focus to the eSports gamer again with a Titan V we were able to easily 110 FPS out of rocket League at highest quality and on fortnight we hovered in the 110 to 125 FPS range using the high preset but with the view distance turned up to epic and anti-aliasing turned down to fxaa so not quite full epic settings but it still looks amazing as for weather looks amazing is a strong enough selling point for a competitive player to spend over three times as much on a monitor that's a little tougher because at the end of the day this thing is still running a lower refresh rate than a 240 Hertz 1080 p PG 258 q or even a 165 Hertz 1440 PPG 278 q are so they would be trading some of their compete level for eye candy so what all of that means for now is that in our minds the PG 27 u q is more toy than tool for Portability and competitiveness reasons it's impractical for serious eSports gaming so if you're the kind of person who gravitates towards the tricked-out Miata this thing isn't the fastest quarter-mile per dollar but that doesn't mean that no one should buy it gaming on it is in a word luxurious so if you're more of a Model X type person who wants damn near the best of everything and is willing to spend more to go really fast in style well I think it's fair to say that this monitor is the most versatile full bells and whistles model we have ever seen at least it will be until AU Optronics unveils the rumored 32 inch buyers or more
