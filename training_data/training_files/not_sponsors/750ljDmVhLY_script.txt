okay it's time once again for a review of a plant-based meat substitute by me and non-vegan this time it's this isn't pork sausages [Music] so this isn't pork sausages now every time i do one of these videos i get people complaining about the naming of these products and i don't usually have a problem but this time i do and there are rules about this sort of thing and i take exception to this being called this isn't pork sausages i think that's completely wrong and this product should not be named this it's an outrage the correct name for this product is these are not pork sausages there fix that for you right anyway so some rather sad looking sausages which have sagged at the bottom of the pack because these things are displayed like that on the shelf in the supermarket we've got six sausages as usual there's way too much going on in the pack here for me to read it all of this so what i'll do is i'll scan this and i'll put it on the screen now if you're interested in reading that in detail pause and have a look ingredients are rehydrated texted pea protein water olive oil thickeners which is methyl cellulose konjac carrageenan xanthan gum kind of thickeners assemble p protein isolate natural flavoring dried onion pea starch dextrin salt sage black pepper white pepper ground mace dextrose color which is beetroot red acidity regulator calcium hydroxide preservative which is sodium metabisulfite so jenny can't have this because she's allergic to sulfites but i'm going to cook these now and make a sausage sandwich so cooking instructions are just a fry for seven to eight minutes in a frying pan so let's get on and do that just gonna put a little bit of oil in the pan just to stop them sticking it's a non-stick pan and the sausages themselves have got some fat in them but i'm just gonna put some extra in there just to stop them sticking right off the bat so well i'm not a great fan of this style of sausage this style of sausage is quite popular in britain so if these were made from pork it would be very very finely ground pork mixed with probably rust and water and i'm not a massive fan of that style of sausage actually i prefer a bit more of a chunky texture and a higher meat content in my sausages but these are replicating your kind of british banger which is a relatively low meat content sausage so you know the bar isn't all that high there anyway for these we're coming up to the seven or eight minutes prescribed cooking time they have puffed up a little bit and the appearance is kind of normal for a sausage what i'm going to do is something that i quite often do with sausages when i'm cooking them for a sausage sandwich i'm just going to take one of these away from this pan and slice it open and butterfly it so just to see how these take to that treatment what i quite often do if i'm cooking sausages for a sandwich is slice them open and then kind of return them to the pan flat like that so they can take a bit of color on this flat side on the cut side so let's do that with one of them in fact i'm going to do that with two of them so we can see what it's like well as they're cooking there's a kind of slightly sour smell to them they don't smell meaty at all of course there is no meat in them so that's to be expected really but anyway i'm gonna stop there actually because these don't seem to be they seem to have reached a kind of a plateau for browning i got a feeling they're gonna burn if i go any further than this and that probably won't be nice let's get them out of the pan assemble the sandwiches now and then give them a taste so the butterflied ones have taken a bit of color on the inside that's the intention regular sausages well they don't look that exciting before i go ahead and assemble the sandwiches i'm just going to taste a bit of one of these completely on its own as it comes straight out the pan so the visual texture inside well that's not unusual for a british banger like i say not my favorite style of sausage but the appearance of these is not atypical let's give it a taste texture is not bad i would say better texture than those richmond ones we have um flavor's a bit weird flavor's almost like a kind of stir-fry vegetable flavour in there almost like banana notes in there as well how strange right sausage sandwich so this is the butterflied one in fact what i'm gonna do i'll put one butterflied pre-cooked and then i'll do one that i slice after cooking in each sandwich so two sausages in each sandwich i'm going to try them with mustard and with ketchup so that's the one that was butterflied prior to cooking this is the one which i'm just going to slice after cooking so ketchup on this one and of course the brown sauce brigade will be up in arms about that because apparently some people have a notion that only certain sources can be put on only certain kinds of things never really understood that very well myself but there it is on this other one i'm gonna have a bit of english mustard on there let's get these to the table and give them a taste okay right here we go then fake sausage sandwiches my little companion eva is here to watch me eat you can have a taste in a minute okay so this isn't sorry these are not pork sausages with ketchup first well the texture is kind of within the range of ex sorry you've got something to say so the texture is kind of within the range of accepted values for a british banger the flavor is just lacking some kind of robustness really and same thing with mustard that works better i think because the mustard is obviously masking some of the differences between this and a pork sausage well they're kind of okay the flavor's a bit kind of lackluster really interestingly there isn't a prominent p protein flavor in these now often when i eat things made of pea protein i comment that i can taste the pea protein in them in fact i said that with one of the products that didn't have pe protein in it it was soya protein but often i can taste the vegetable protein or i can taste something weird in these products that isn't meat it's some kind of other protein with these i can't taste that so i can't detect that weird pea protein flavor in this product so i suppose that's a plus butterflying those sausages and putting them back in the pan didn't seem to make any difference really that extra bit of sear really hasn't got any extra flavor but yeah without the mustard those sausages just taste a bit weird i think it's time for the all-important eva test so i give her a tiny little bit pea protein is quite safe for dogs breakfast in bed i've got a pool did you give me a pour when you're lying down you're dry couldn't you oh she didn't spit it out so i think eva's opinion of that was it's all right than that what do you think either it's all right and that you said you look like you're gonna say something there so there we go this isn't pork sausages or rather these are not pork sausages they're okay the texture i would say is closer to a real british banger than the richmond sausages the flavor is just weirdly off to one side it tastes like stir-fried vegetables almost with that kind of vinegary sweet and sour vibe to it don't know what that is but there it is so i hope that was interesting thanks for watching and i hope to see you again soon [Music] you
