although there's still a lot of arguing between gamers who prefer the power of a PC and those who prefer the convenience of a console one thing most of us can agree on is that any particular title should just plain work as advertised regardless of the platform be it PC Xbox Playstation / Atari 2600 but unfortunately there's been a noticeable trend over the years in which games initially developed for console just don't translate that well to the PC and when these games drop on Steam they might have wonky controls underwhelming visuals or even outright game breaking bugs so why does this happen well a huge part of the issue is that at any given time there are only really about three or four major livingroom consoles and aside from minor updates every two years or so every single Xbox one or Playstation 4 in existence is using the exact same hardware inside this means that developers writing games for these platforms know exactly what configurations and api's they're coding for making it easy to optimize performance and functionality for that specific device especially if consoles tend to have exclusive developer features to make programming for them even more straightforward pcs on the other hand present an additional challenge in that games must be written to work on an enormous variety of different computers and although the dominant setup is a modern 64-bit version of Windows and a CPU and GPU from one of just two different manufacturers each there's still tons of variation in terms of performance driver revisions and what other kinds of hardware and software are installed and remember that on a PC games are sharing resources like memory and CPU I'm with other programs to a far greater extent than on a console that was built to consistently prioritize gameplay and because of all these factors every time a game is installed on another PC chances are high that it's a brand new environment the game has never actually seen before so the games code has to be adjusted to work with general technologies such as DirectX and the x86 instruction set which can be an imperfect solution that as we know doesn't work flawlessly on every PC every time and even to get it as close as possible can be very time consuming and sometimes tens of thousands of files have to be rewritten to play nicely with an Nvidia or AMD desktop graphics driver instead of some specialized API that was specifically designed for the PlayStation 4 meaning that PC ports also add months to development time which by the way costs money money that many game studios would rather spend on making new games marketing existing ones new dlc or pecs why not ice cream at that point and since consoles are generally underpowered compared to current gen gaming computers games originally developed for consoles are often designed to be less graphically demanding so creating more high def visuals for you no whiny vocal minority customers with top-of-the-line graphics cards like GTX 1080s and rx 5 80s can also result in months of additional work and this combined with the translation of visual elements so PC api's and drivers can understand them has resulted in more than a handful of games looking like a mess on a computer and of course a game being written for a certain console means it was also written with a specific controller scheme in mind meaning that the experience may not map well to a keyboard and mouse and although the concept is simply mapping a controller button to a keyboard key seems very simple this process can still involve modifying a great deal of code under the hood the good news is that while there are still plenty of bad pc ports floating around consoles have been moving towards more PC like architectures and tools like Microsoft's new Universal Windows platform might make porting games at least from xbox pc much less labor-intensive as games written for uwp like Gears of War 4 don't have to be rewritten for desktop computers but with that said at least for now underwhelming ports are just part of the price you pay for being a member of the PCM are do you to get 10% off your first purchase so thanks for watching guys like dislike leave a comment check out our other channels and don't forget to subscribe
