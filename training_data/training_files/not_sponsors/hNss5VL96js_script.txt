hello everybody and welcome back to a brand new video now runescape has been around a long time now a lot of content has been added and this game has so much to offer unfortunately though uh some content just kind of falls between the cracks and becomes extremely underutilized but even further than that there's some content that i think barely anyone knows about and would be considered by most to be extremely dead content so today i wanted to go over the most dead content in the old school runescape and show you how it works anyway guys i thank you so much and let's get started now the first piece of content i wanted to talk about is in the ogre city of gu tenop now overall this whole city is kind of underutilized granted there are a few useful things here but near the bottom of the ogre city there is a really interesting chest that has some interactions that are not found in many other locations now first up here as far as i'm aware this chest has no thieving requirement to open however it does provide loot from this chest you can either get bones an emerald or a rotten apple however the weird thing about it is it also has a chance to spawn npcs you can also get a chaos dwarf out of the chest a rat a scorpion or a spider alright so first try the chest and we get a chaos dwarf okay what was that doing in there now the chest does take 300 seconds to respond so we're gonna hop worlds okay next appeal we are gonna get a rotten apple next up here we're gonna get as some bones all right next opened up here and hey we got an emerald apparently that's actually pretty rare that's 1 100. okay next try here and we got a spider that just spawned out where is it okay we'll go kill it that's so weird there's not that many other interactions like this in the game for some reason monsters hiding in chess kind of weird and so anyway you get the idea i'm not sure why this chest is here and what its purpose might have been but i think it's been here for the better part of 15 years so the purpose may long be lost now next up here i want to talk about the paramaya inn now this is a relic kind of left over from runescape classic from a period in time where you actually had to rest it is located in shiloh village and is probably one of the most underutilized pieces of content in the game it is kind of a stretch to call it content because it doesn't really have a use but you do actually need to pay to get in there so it's not just a random location it does have some mechanics to it and i do think it's pretty interesting now the entrance to the paramy inn is a little bit north of the slayer master doordell you simply just have to go up this ladder now once you're here to actually enter the end you do need a pair of my ticket otherwise they won't let you in now there's only two ways to get paramaya tickets that is by buying them from caleb but paramaya or you can get them as a really rare drop in the viali caves in legends quest we're going to take the easy way out here we're going to buy them from this guy here once you have the pair of my ticket you're allowed to go up the stairs into the paramay inn it's a very simple location it has a couple of beds but that is it it looks like it would have been a nice place to rest off after a long day of traveling if you actually had to rest now our next piece of dead content brings us to caldergrim a unfortunately really underutilized city beyond being featured in the red axe storyline there are very few reasons to legitimately come here now during the quest line there is a interesting minigame you participate in to complete the quest and gain favor with one of the eight companies there however interestingly once you have completed the quest you can continue on completing the mini-game that involves fetching different types of ores and bars for the consortium and instead of building favor with the company you will actually get paid not much but something now to start the mini game you need to talk to the director that you completed the quest with if you talk to one of the other ones they will just be mean to you so for my purpose that we did the blue opal first up ask if you have any more tasks which they should we need four bronze bars in the next 18 minutes okay i'll take it okay so we'll come back with bronze bars okay so we went ahead and got the bronze bars we'll talk to him here hey i've completed your task here are your bars for 36 coins hey that didn't even pay for the bars what the hell okay well maybe this next one will be worth it three steel bars in 60 minutes okay i really hope i get paid more than that all right what do you got for me this time hopefully a little more than 36 coins 345 okay uh it's a little bit better i still am pretty sure i lost money on this though as yeah as you can see not really worth doing but a really interesting old piece of content that i think most people have forgotten about now you can't talk about dead content without mentioning the ranging guild which i think in my opinion is the least used guild and has very little redeeming qualities here to incentivize anyone to ever come here most people only ever come here once to get their ranging cape and that is it despite that it's not for a lack of trying there are things to do here they are just nearly pointless there are multiple different shops some of them selling at basic arrows javelins thronaxes there's even a tannery here which i didn't know about there is even too many games here including the tower archer minigame and the shooting range the problem is the only unique item here that you can get is the barbed bolt tips and these are pretty much useless all right let's try the arrow shooting mini game the only thing here that kind of has a purpose only 200 coins okay great let's give it a go does it actually matter where you click no hey bullseye nice now you get a very token amount of ranged experience i mean i guess this could be a training method but you don't get access to this until level 40 anyway i couldn't imagine any circumstance where this would be useful at all granted it is kind of interesting so we shot our 10 shots and we got 40 archery tickets now let's go see how much stuff is in the archery store okay so let's have a look at the adam and javelin's here 2000 oh my god it's like the arcades all over again you guys ever have like fantasia or chuck e cheese you finish an entire day of fun and all you can afford is some stupid pencils or something the shop is way overpriced there are closed doors that you can't open chests that have nothing in them for some reason it's unfortunately a really dead piece of content and i do hope jagex does update displays because it is kind of cool now the lunar spell book it definitely has some interesting things on it and some spells i don't think i've really personally used but for most of them i can see a purpose even if it doesn't really suit my needs that much however once both i think is almost entirely useless i cannot really see any circumstances where anyone would want to use it is the dream spell to use the dream spell you need level 79 magic and on top of that you even have to have completed the dream mentor quest they thought it was that good they had to lock it behind a secondary quest now essentially after using the spell you will go to sleep wherever you are and you'll stay asleep until you are full hit points while in a dream state you're going to restore your hit points three times quicker than normal but you just have to sit there and wait that's pretty much it you just take a snooze and you wake up when you're full health it's hard to imagine this being useful anywhere maybe if you were playing runescape at work for some reason and you had to go and like talk to a customer for a little while and you wanted to come back and have your character be full health maybe but it is kind of hard to imagine okay the final destination that we're going to is berthorp berthorp has a lot of interesting content but unfortunately most of it is severely underused now the warriors guild does have one really heavily used piece of content and that is of course the defenders now the grand majority of players will get their tokens to fight the ogres by killing the animated armor sets however there are actually a couple other ways to do it that nearly nobody participates in there is a game where you throw shot puts damn it's pretty good there's a mini game where you balance a keg on your head [Music] and even this weirdman gamer you have to block magical attacks with a shield now these are all worth warrior tokens however they're all fairly slow compared to the main method which is killing the animated armor sets now furthermore in berthorp there's another piece of content that is extremely underused and that is the birth thorpe game room i've literally never been down here before that's how obscure it is now in this location you're actually able to challenge other people to games for example we could do roon link and now we can start off the game i'm pretty sure this is just connect four there are also other games like rune version rune squares and droughts anyway guys that is going to be it for today's video those are some interesting pieces of content that are unfortunately extremely dead in the current game does that mean they desperately need an update not necessarily i don't think there's an issue with some content just being underused not everything has to have a purpose and i think that's okay anyway thanks again guys and i'll see you next time
