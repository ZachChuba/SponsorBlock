guy high school we bout to add them to the chain you feel me putting them ankles on here one time and uh Julian Fleming Brian no you watchin us young destroying is ready for that smoked young Destroyers willing to fly out to your fly you out to me it don't matter you know n-c-double-a be trippin so I'll probably got a flat at you and deliver that smoke to your front door but obviously I'm not a DB I'm a kicker but I does this before we get into these code destroy and uh let's see what this man Julian talk about all right we see he's number one right here so we're gonna click the little video tip on ESPN 300 obviously it probably doesn't show most of the hot lights we can have to take it to YouTube but straight off the RIP it says ed read loves the touchdown cat from Fleming so if a tree show not to his games then he must be the real deal ed Reed is a defensive player so if he said Lou in a number one player no country type [ __ ] he plays on offense a you know he must be the
