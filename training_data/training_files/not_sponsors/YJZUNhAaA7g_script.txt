[Music] so this is a logo this is a logo and this is a logo in Beijing volumetric lighting we can create these simple logo animations on top of that we'll be able to control the sharpness of our light the color of our mission along with the length of our rays and obviously this works with other kinds of patterns including animated ones which means they can go into the video settings talk over to volume and watch the rest of this into superior format so with blender open D polymerized a default cube replace it with a plane and in the render tab toggle over two cycles now in the shading workspace we'll create a new material for our plane replace the principle be SDF with the transparent one and with an image section out just load in whichever logo you're using if you still don't see your logo make sure you're in rendered mode which will show our transparency next head over to the world editor add in a principled volume note connected to the volume socket and bring down the density to exactly point 102 5 remember to use this exact density because different values will mess up our next steps and now that we have our voluminous world just position our light under the plane and in the light settings play around with the power value until you're happy with the intensity to prevent any light leakage we can select our plane go into edit mode and essentially extrude our edges to make a bigger plane and then keep extruding until we blocked off all the extra light now finally with our current setup we can move around the light to change the direction play with the parrot affect the intensity change the light size to determine our sharpness choose the car for our mission and while also supporting your boy cg matter but other than that you should now be a volumetric master and as always I've been cg matter you've been you b'bye
