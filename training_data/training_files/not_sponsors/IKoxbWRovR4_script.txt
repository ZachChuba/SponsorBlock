why are you looking at me that way what way you have a problem so what is it i have a problem oh god protect me please what is that noise run [Music] he's gone sit tight man i i know you're scared but i'm going to get you out of here if it's the last thing i do you need to see if he's still out there well i need to take a picture of this thing it's very important i don't think he's out here i think he went back to his little cougar hole what do you see there ain't nothing here grab them by the back of the net cats can't move when you do that oh dimensions i never would assignment run get out of here if you're allergic to cougars get the hell out of town look out there's a big cat i am a nature photographer it is my mission to document all the rare creatures of the world smile baby come on something's not right with this bird you just fall move your arms flap those wings come on where's the bird at i shot him never mind uh-oh that's your horse is this your horse or is this wild this is your horse or this wild about to hunt his i just want to kill you and take your picture hold still what what what happened to you why are you walking why are you moving around like that did you swallow a baseball bat [Music] you may be wondering why i take pictures of dead things well due to the limitations of photography photos don't turn out right if the subject is all alive and moving around the downside of this is yes a couple of rare animals might be put down just for the sake of a photo but how else will future generations know that these animals existed wouldn't it suck to get shot oh god help me caught me a dead one wait wait hold hold still wait we gonna be good oh my he's not dead yet well he's not dead yet yes i just got a hit marker this guy is not dead yet get out of your hair all right he is talking despite what he might say he is dead don't listen to him don't listen to him we're gonna put him down you hear that that was you i'm not an idiot i know that was you he's dead tell me what it's still giving me hit markers of all the amazing photographs i've taken over the years there's one animal that has always eluded me and that is the bear i've seen bears before but they're tricky devils to take a picture of and i have this drawing i made but it doesn't do it justice at all so my mission is to snap a photo of a beautiful bear in his natural habitat have you ever you ever hunt for a bear before jimmy one time i brought my my cousin and stop hunting okay sorry i just had to shoot this little rascal what is that thing get a little cat it's all right i'll take it with me what were you saying about your cousin i'm allergic to cats keep away from me uh he's a good guy but he just always falls and he forgets bullets when we go hunting it's just one thing after another and one time the bear stopped in its tracks looked at them and just laughed i didn't even know bearcats could laugh it's true i've seen a bear i i saw a bear at a comedy club once he was cracking up all right head on down to the river bears love to drink water that's a fact just be careful it is slippery careful careful don't worry i'm hey can you hear me down there all right yeah can you hear me yeah i've got here's the size of a [ __ ] cantaloupe of course i can hear you are you stupid maybe all right make some bear sounds make it pretend to be a bear down there anything i don't see nothing [Applause] i don't think this is working maybe this is kind of dumb sound like a female bear it sounds like a koala or something a what koala you're in koala territory got it you keep the base but just you know sound feminine we stayed down by the river until night time but unfortunately we were unable to find a bear i did find this really big fish though and that was cool dumb cowboy got my fish all dirty come here baby despite our bad luck we weren't giving up yet jimmy knew of an elaborate cave system deep in the mountains so we figured we would take our search there in hopes of finding a bear let go don't scream you'll the barrel here go are you crazy let's go this place sucks i thought you said there was gonna be a damn bear in here i don't like this what is that over there a skull ew gross i'm gonna throw up oh this looks like some sort of deer skull or something deer or dog yeah it's probably a raccoon german shepherd i think i think i kicked that skull around and you just walk through someone's dead bones be careful with your sketchy they're in my way they're in my leg you gotta respect the dead that's like rule number one it's like a whole entire animal here what is this i'm seeing remnants of some sort of beast what the [ __ ] was it i don't know i think it was a bat take my picture with the beast look at that look at the camera look all get a good picture yeah look all like that okay yeah all right look look at me look at me looking at you just take the picture you're looking at the ground i'm looking at you take the [ __ ] picture just looking at your shoes that's fine i'm not looking at my shoes i'm looking right at you wow this is something else we're gonna make a lot of money selling these pictures probably this doesn't feel right i feel like we're being watched wait dude wait do you hear that god you are so immature trying to lie in the mood i was just trying to lighten the mood you're being a grumpy butt oh you deserve that all right jimmy this is gonna be a little unorthodox but i need you to cross across that little tiny ledge on the left-hand side there and see what's on the other side just drop down it's safe it's all right it's i think it's safe just follow that all the way to here oh god you got this oh god there ain't nothing for me over here just keep going a little bit farther i think there's probably something over there my bear hunt was temporarily put on hold after my friend jimmy died in a cave somehow but this hunt has taught me a very valuable lesson you should never try to achieve your dreams because you are most likely ugly and stupid but that's okay i can take pictures of other animals i don't need no stinking bear to be [Music] happy [Music] pics from here to mississippi your girl seems nice i got pictures of us kissing the neighbor called said his dog went missing well i've got a new photograph in my kitchen i went down south looking for a fight the animals hide cause i shoot on site they can tear my skin they can scratch they can buy but they look so good in black and white
