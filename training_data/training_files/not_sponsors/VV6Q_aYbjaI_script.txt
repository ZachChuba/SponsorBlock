hi this is Wayne with the Tesla way I was just going to show you guys a little night driving with the autopilot again how it will work through the transition of the 101 and the 405 see the entire trip from Englewood all the way to the valley doing a little Dodger blue today the Dodgers and hopefully they'll get back on the field soon [Music] I'm gonna try to do more of these driving videos [Music] so let's promise instead of putting it at autopilot I'm just doing this a little bit right now just so you can see uh works for firms on their regular streets handled it quite well I did have my foot ready just in case I need to apply the brake looks like the car that was pulled over is next to me got away hopefully without a ticket [Music] No [Music] [Music] [Music] see how that works now it's gonna take me eight minutes to get there [Music] but discusses I'm up on the freeway I just bumped it up to $75 an hour so it's giving me in the first lane right now and you will notice here is the arrows pointing down for the cars that are going slower than the speed limit so I don't jump waste by them going too fast and then they possibly in their blind spot kick like over in smiling waiting fast bars one day left hand side of the bar I definitely need online [Music] [Music] [Music] so now it's doing an auto lane change [Music] that's pretty good it noticed it's probably about a hundred feet ahead of us that was really nice [Music] I don't know if you notice can notice but all the lanes are displayed here looting the carpool lane it's not indicating that it's a carpooling what it is noticing that a good d'Alene [Music] now we're back to solid opening currently for the carpeting [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you know it's gonna go back into the fast lane to one lane over from the best there's no cars ahead of us that's what it is courteous as well we'll get out of the fast lane [Music] then we come to the 405 101 exchange I want you to notice how the car wants to slow down to 40 miles an hour it's been that way for a few updates and it still doesn't resolve itself I do put on the accelerator to not get rear-ended first of all like to base of traffic which is 20 2012 6.1 I don't believe it let's break today issue this will be my first drive with this give it any kind of a anyone show you in this case you'll say bug report and then give them the information that you would like to report and then there goes to Tesla you think hopefully so because at this time I will do that for us hopefully it won't fix our prophecy live in the other area alright here we come up to our first turn of the grapevine hands up [Music] I mean you just straight away here [Music] they absolutely have a lot of customers follow wailing I know I still have data but I think that's just get them out of any legal issues but I think it drives phenomenal I think we're getting closer and closer to the pool self-driving [Music] between 2001 [Music] put us in the center lane there's a five- we're getting to the very top of the Sobotka pass right now once the global one we're laying here in a second what a beautiful buggy that's mine please if you guys notice where did you go bit about if I can keep my hand down here in the world as I said I just it but I'm also not going to allow it to make any kind of filling losses or anything in my life so here it is slowing down to 65 just notice you remember getting close at 16 so 16 is still okay now it's jumping back up to 70 now 65 again now back down to 60 you know it's jumping down to 40 so I have to put on my silly dog report all right fuzzy on a 40 mile an hour [Music] now it goes back up to 50 so if you handle this turn here at 50 mile an hour he does shoving back at this Pinkie Pie sixteen about 65 it may jump back up to 70 but it will not go back to my silly five because the reason for that is I have a text to go five and now that way [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm starting to slow down because there's far on our left this one slower remember it likes to slow down to give the other drivers reaction time they say be slowing down in the footy choosing the lanes telling me to take over which I'm already there did not stop because I don't have the stop one stoplight one [Music] all right this is Wayne with the Tesla we thank you guys very much for watching hopefully you've learned something about the auto pilot today have a great day
