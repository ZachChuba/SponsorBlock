their link is in the video description so I'm going to be selecting one patreon supporter every two weeks from now on to play a full light with me you're going to be featured in a new series that I make for the wipe if you would like to have a chance to play with my team and I and be in some of my videos check out my patreon you can choose any term support on my patreon to be entered into the random draw and I'm going to be announcing the winner and my d'squared later tonight the following draw will take place before July 4th both my patreon and disscourn links are down below so this video features a perfect example of one of the main struggles of breast you log into the game you're rated you try your best to set up again but you get rated once more you think to yourself should we just log out and forget the server no we won't do that we set up once more when you get rated in multiple times there's a big tendency to just give up but our team and I like pushing through to see where the rest of the wipe takes us and this being a longer season I can assure you that this wipe in particular turned out to be uniquely successful and in our favor I hope you enjoyed today's video the following is vanilla roast [Music] they won on the server every goddamn time this what happened you were in the cave and they just randomly [ __ ] they just randomly put a turret down and grief to cave and hop down there and they saw you going starters I'm sure I don't know what happened and I were sitting in base we come back from Mike infirmary round before that and we start hearing stars go off really what the [ __ ] and then it kept going and going and going but it wasn't any exuberant amount of time so they were fast yeah yeah did you get a chance to move everything mostly there's some stuff at the starter they ever hit the starter buskin most of it was all in the bunker I mean we had again why we can usually say they're probably [ __ ] proud of themselves oh yeah new bases in note heaven and there's plenty of trees too yeah it's on that island that means you'd find last night oh yeah yeah another bad location I'm gonna hit the water to your components when you think about it it was old stuff we got it together in one day I was damned you know you guys probably didn't sleep I don't know you've been on pretty long we were up late and you guys I don't think slept as much as I did so hey you're on there alone in there and then they left and I went back up in there and just oh like scuba diving because you thought on it that's really smart yeah that is school they let him die you got a chest plate metal chest but they miss that there's a [ __ ] room in here I've never been in before it's like through the the vents yeah there's a secret compartment with like three green boxes here this Islands stupid I mean if it had feelings notes they just they mock me they pop up behind me it's like whack-a-mole does anyone does anyone else know Med yeah yeah okay good god I'm loading him now someone wanna bag me over they have we seen our neighbors active at all do they have a decent base a looks like they have a furnace base there's two yeah they've got a decent-sized main and a little furnace face there could raid their first base stick it over cut their supplies might actually be a good idea I was killed by friendly friend Vanessa what's up dawg jumpin discord a few minute I'm in the starter do you want me to bring stuff over current location is what the v9 with the river right or is it up by v4 no benign benign were just above the be okay well this space is good for seven and a half hours so maybe they can read it I shot the guy on the left twice I got a ball T Kelly oh dude it's [ __ ] irrelevant I wouldn't just someone grabbing the bolt all right cool that's strange yeah that's right yo do you want it do you want to grab all this circle might as well bring it smoke from a lot of sulfur good job guys five hundred scrap to learn that semen [Music] fishbowl tea does anybody else think that my character looks like Conor McGregor yeah a little bit yeah like decent amount I can imagine the tattoos you already look mad at me he's got the beard at everything they burn do you want to grab one of these ribs if you have feel when it's long to that our base but to get extremely dark so he was head back he gets stuck I don't think there's any ice yeah how's it gonna hold him I bet you guys are loaded there's a helicopter above us yeah I see that it's actually coming directly for us what the [ __ ] yeah fuel and just run run back right what the [ __ ] here let's kill this guy yes I said oh [ __ ] it good oh my god did full of sulfur he's got a jackhammer and Tommy did 500 fuel what the [ __ ] was that hello his name quakes he just gave us 7 8 K sulfur and it saw me in a joke Henry I mean okay that was [ __ ] random dude no he flew in with what the hum the cult yeah okay I won't touch your buddy let's [ __ ] piss holy come to me is that Jack and I think it's wise if we researched the Tommy pretty good gun like up close alright so nobody flies helicopters near me because apparently if people in helicopters die around me okay I'm cursed doing good Sensa let's go to BB why didn't he shoot ya everything in the cave and everything from our starter though we transferred to a native area so just building up that area where a v8 I'm not sure if anyone begged yeah so I'm gonna check out the neighbors base and we should all take through then all right I also check for any DK or anything yeah will do they're active haven't been raided but yeah I'd probably smart to try to hit them soonish there's nodes over here if you want to venture this way I think it'll be cheaper to go through the roof with Stan Jules yes what I was sent into ten samples at one of the corners hopefully to get the PC it's a three by three inside okay it's not the kind of eighteen the satchels and then we could probably pick the route since it's mostly stone it's about assuming so it sounds good yeah I'll get on that right now could have a decent come up you know this is a node rich area since we're alone Austin that could be very loaded Ellie's coming over our Island well hey case he's got a K I hit him a couple times to this are me there's a second heli landing behind us on they'll come twice I wonder if it's the guise of you rate it does they were probably coming to over here the farm honestly those guys that raised us are talking in game trying to talk [ __ ] like haha it's like just a game just play it if it wasn't for [ __ ] Butch Johnson for butch he's all you know he's that dudes a [ __ ] [ __ ] he's like he said he was gonna offline rate us [ __ ] bug all right I got eighteen satchels mid query rating our neighbors is just [ __ ] take them out there's SARS in there if you wanna use them all right that's enough horsing around there yeah sure take them for a [ __ ] trip but go straight and I'll be honest with you go straight you look like a [ __ ] mandated colliders know when did you say I find satchel feta today when we're at harbor in a box I call it oh my god I did we're good yeah yeah yeah okay if we can break the ice right here it's a bunker break it all right we got to seal that top real quick I'm gonna stop some CC let you know Jojo okay 84 here I'll make a door all right you can put it TC anywhere in the space some more seconds we got a new vase uh should we keep it it's fairly cheap oh yeah we should have that next month okay Salter's I'm gonna move these in and then grieve this area brief the front door though yeah I'm gonna just bunker it cheap raid dude for all that stuff yeah wait someone's doing oil right now there's no box let's [ __ ] do it who we missing here yes those dudes for sure that God Ellie so do you see anyone the crate is not there and it has some reason scientists though hopefully it's like a dead a gay guy yeah there might be recycling all three of the cases are

start it I'm coming back we can hide loot under a foundation with stashes we don't bury that's an extension to your base maybe yeah if not we can just do them behind the soft side wall so it's good to what do you guys think you have any ideas I think we've got a really cool setup here we do man I don't worry I don't like running either we already left we could have just rebuilt I think where we
