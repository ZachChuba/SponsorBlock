hey how's it going welcome back to another episode of the ultimate iron man over the last few weeks i've been collecting gear to go back to raids one and last video we finally went back to chambers and we wrapped up last video by getting our first item since coming back which is the ancestral road bottom here's the raids data tracker plug-in this is where we're currently at 800k points and that's the one item that we've got so far well i can show you the collection log i mean we've got items in the past but since coming back to raids that's what we've got so far we got the ancestral bottom at 359 kc i know the log looks pretty empty for my kc it's not because i was just like getting 1k points per raid i swear i had like a 5.6 million point dry streak at one point to get the decks so i'm hoping in the long run this rng will balance out in case you forgot i plan to camp out raids for like a month or two um and after getting that ancestral road bottom it really makes me want to stay here until i finish the full set because it is storable in the poh but we have to get the full set to take it out so it'd be really nice to get that done over the next month or two but you know what even if i somehow don't get any items from raids in the next month or two i still like being at rates because it's a fun time with friends and plus all the skilling supplies you get too is really nice but i don't know i've just been enjoying it so far so in just a bit once my friends get online about to be heading back to raids very soon and speaking of raids sponsoring this video our our first duo together not rewarded but at least we know we can do it oh you know i think it's my first time ever seeing someone get in alex and raids all right let's go team olm oh god dude wait bro what the [ __ ] dude two out of three now what wait i actually okay i mean but i actually kind of predicted it in my head but no one's going to believe me no way dude you actually call that that's crazy shut up literally okay just be like all right we got an elite clue here and then youtube will think that my voice changed or i'm sick or something so it'll be a prank all right go the mirror puff puffs all right uh youtube we got this elite clue here let's see what we get oh so rooted wow what a great clue oh that's perfect good luck you know it's funny kid what'd you get dex nice oh it's wait it's 16 mil what the hell yeah it's so cheap now you know how much arcane 600k might as well drop boys right yeah legit just drop for the voice yeah let's try hey it's a pet chance me and zach actually robbed from each other feels bad like i know this isn't how rng works but like it's so depressing knowing that it theoretically is like 870k uh personal points between each drop i'll get and like i know it's not how orangey works but it's still just like ah i guess the long dry streak i had at the start of my raids grind is finally uh balancing out i guess 16 freaking mill dude i bought that my main for like 70 mil or something years ago the price of the decks is probably the most tragic part about this to be honest good luck good luck team today's crazy bro that's back to back as well that's on the same drop table as ancestral so uh you come here often no i don't i actually don't well you can see i've spent quite a bit of time here at the motherload mine today this has been my afk activity since i started doing raids and we just got a mining level as level 90. hello all it is update date today let's go over the update so the things that affect me are things i'll be doing so we got the birthday event we should probably do that within the next couple weeks uh lms they added the varak map to it which looks freaking sick and then what i'm interested in is right here in the collection log they added all these items into the collection log so i'm glad i didn't get any of this stuff before because it says if you bought the untradables those would have been unlocked in the collection log um but for the tradable items those would not be in the collection logs so i'm glad i didn't just like grind out lms or something so we have more reason to grind for these now what i started doing in my downtime last video was hunting herbivore which before then i had never done on this account and there's 88 hunter it really triggers me when i see like a dragon emptying or crystal implanting or lucky implying i have to just let it fly away because i can't catch it and it takes too long to get the net and jar out and by time i would get it it'd be gone so it'd be nice to be able to catch those bare-handed plus there's also a pet from herbivore motherlode mine is for my afk downtime and then hunting herbivore is for my non-afk downtime in between rating no what is andrew's meat doing here oh my god dude my arch nemesis actually living rent-free in my head okay i just finished a little session of doing a bunch of herbivores today as you can tell by that xp there if you're interested in the herbal or xp per hour it's getting like almost 2k herbal or xp just from like harvesting them because you get like a tiny bit of xp so you know every little bit adds up that is almost 9k or lyrics feet today good luck oh fam nice we've seen so many freaking ancestral hats it's like the third one now that we've seen right actually robbed bro you're like uh hey man do you feel something hitting you nah bro okay that's a lot funnier in my head than that actually ended up being never mind and this is going to be level 89 hunter and that is lucky implings with the net and redwood birdhouses which i'll probably not be doing birdhouses at this point i've kind of come to accept the fact that there's really not too much to show in the videos it's just kind of like a random clip here and there of me like training hunter or raids or something but like in between those clips it'll be like a day or two like i'll be playing all day long just to get like a 10 second clip which is how like it normally is i guess with the uim but like not this bad to this extent luckily the videos are still a couple weeks behind real time so this gives them time to catch up and gives me time to actually do raids and not have to worry about running out of videos to post and by me rambling like this that also is good filler for the video good luck team i for one i'm team olm wait is that your first stack that's his first scroll yo congrats dude zach's gotten way too many purples for his casey zach's gotten four purples in 47kc very well deserved for all the bullying that's happened to him wait what's your pure level let's see 72 you freaking noob here's a little milestone for the herbivore that is 500. i was thinking maybe i could check in every 100 but that's kind of like too often so maybe like every 500 is like a pretty decent number to check in with all right elite clue casket from the chambers of zurich oh it's that's pretty it's pretty this will be the elite casket i had to make this sled for this so it better be worth it here we go oh wait that's not new wait the collection log plugin was said but do i have it in the poh already oh that's such a cool item though i think i made the same joke last time about um plankton from the spongebob movie the all hail plankton joke okay it's my prayer potion cosplay okay wait how does it look with the ghostly robe top ah there we go hey girl are you a prayer pot cause i take a sip of you are you a three dose prayer pot cause i already took a sip of you girl pear pot i barely know her nana's family friendly wholesome christian mormon minecraft server stream okay this has gone on long enough look at that 400 million total xp this is this pretty cool milestone this is the start of a brand new saga the 400 million download i think that looks really cool and we have once again got another milestone coming in right here as 90 hunter not only 90 hunter but that is also base level 90s and we can catch what was it crystal limplings bare-handed which is nice because my house is in priv and i see them so often all the time and i just let them go and now i can actually catch them that's like right after getting 400ml xp as well was it all worth it do we get the casket here we do i had to make a sled i had to go to tarn's lair i had to do a lap of skull ball was it worth it it was because we're working towards the 200 elites for the the casket thingy i have seen this level coming for so long now like the last week plus of doing raids i noticed i was so close to this woodcutting level and here it finally is it's been a long time coming 105 woodcutting finally i have a clip for the video 400 kc and nothing but 400 kc okay another elite casket from raids here we go okay so i'm 82 raids and now and this is the first time i have to do this we have to go to spory and then grab out the zoro scales because the blowpipe is almost out of scale so i have to charge this up and then after i charge this up i have to put these in the bag and then next time after i guess like 80 more raids i'll have to re-die to hispory and then get the mouth looting bag and then do this whole process all over again because i have these out of the bag i'm also going to charge up the trident so i can i guess save like another like 700 scales that way save me a little bit of time later on another elite from raids of course oh we actually got mimik oh i haven't seen one of these in a long time all my stuff's in this forum so i'm actually kind of scared oh frick all right we defeat the mimic without dying in 48 seconds and we have the mimic casket here we go we got manta rays from that all right i can't wait for like three years from now when they add the stash unit to fallow and then they pull it for uim's to see if they want access to it and then it passes the pole by like 76 until then i'm not going for the arma helm hey there's a pp though that's really fast so much rating for like a five second clip for the video hey again we're back at the herbivores and once we kick this mound here that is 91 hunter and this is huge not really um but this does mean that hunter is no longer the lowest skill on the account which it has been for a very very long time but now that place is taken by mining maybe i'll start doing tears again at some point i haven't done tears of gothics for like i don't even know dude since like the start of the account really i just felt like it really wasn't worth the time just for getting hunter xp from it oh yeah i forgot it was update day today oh let's see what we got here the steam client came out today uh okay here's the changes from the last pull so the amulet of blood fury can now hold up to 30 000 charges which is probably like really really nice for uym especially because like if you're doing the thieving you get two at a time right i've never actually uh gotten a blood fury before so i don't know exactly how it works i'm pretty sure you can get two of them if you do it that way see the precise kill time so we have exact pbs now uh i've never done nightmare before probably one day i will do it but i have no idea what this means and uh yeah that's pretty much it i'm doing the birthday event right now they made this so like you i am unfriendly i have to have like empty inventory space to like make these things who is this absolute beast unicorn elite killer i wonder if they relate to cali killer love this guy okay there we go the event is done and we get a couple of rewards banana cape wow this cape is really bananas and then we get a cursed banana which gives you like a cursed pose that you walk around like that or run around like that it looks like my guy's ready to just like poop this very well could be the last time i end up doing the beekeeper random if we get the last piece there it is beekeepers legs so open up the treasure chest here and put that in and now we have completed the full set still missing the baguette from this box here but that looks very nice i guess we may as well take out the full outfit quickly put that on just to show it off there it is i'll probably never take that out ever again we got another elite casket here we go oh what's it oh wait oh that's new hey it's new yo the giant boot prime fashionscape dude look at that it's beautiful and we could store it in the poh just checking in over here again because this is going to be 1 000 harvests oh nice dude we finally saw something dude it's been five almost six full days without seeing anyone get a drop oh my god i'm just glad to see someone get a drop if anything even if it's not for me actually robbed me or my drop though like i know in the video it doesn't seem like that far between but it's been almost six full days without seeing anyone get a drop yeah there's four ancestral hats though you see now though that's pretty crazy i guess we're kind of back on rate now it's uh 10 drops and 8.6 million points in total so it's pretty much on rate again and we just got really lucky at the start dude i just realized i just went back to check the first clip of the video to see when it was recorded and apparently it has been 10 days of progress in this video so far and i don't want to have to go 10 days without uploading i mean right now it's fine because the videos are still behind but i think i'll just work on hunter for tonight and then i'll figure out how to wrap up this video in the morning but i'm just physically incapable of going too long without posting videos well it's been a fun 10 days of progress at least we got the decks this video we got something even though it was hadoop um but yeah this is over 100 hours of progress between raiding and then afk mining hunting herbivore doing clues etc here's what the chambers data tracker looks like right now 2.2 million points in my name so we're kind of dry not really though and the team is pretty much on rate as well and then here's what the looting bag looks like because i'm pretty sure i said i would show the looting bag at the end of each video so uh the herb stacks are going up uh it looks like i'll actually be able to maintain my blowpipe adidas with the adior i'm getting from raids i was kind of worried i'd have to go to aviances i don't know if i just got lucky or what but that's ten thousand addy darts i'll be able to make and that will more than completely fill up the blowpipe okay let's see the raids kc is now up to 433 uh the herbivore casey is well we reached over a thousand this video and uh i'm not sure if i said it in the video cause like i say the same thing every stream like over and over so it feels like i say a lot but in case i didn't say it already i plan to stay at raids for like a whole month or two so the next few videos at least are gonna be a lot of raiding but with that said thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed i hope you have a great day and i will see you again next time
