hello everybody welcome to another episode of the brain Food Show podcast show and podcast because we go live on YouTube or we broadcast on YouTube and then we also have a podcast version that comes out later I am one of your hosts Simon join with me today as always daven for the longest time i mispronounce his name in my mind as davon and it took a long time getting used to the fact that your name has a soft a but then everyone else calls you leave on the comments yeah yeah how's it going it's going this is a long one yeah let's I've got my coffee I've realized I've just sat down to do this and it's just the time I normally eat lunch and I haven't eaten lunch so by the end of this I'm gonna be pretty hungry that's where are we starting today got a quick fact but it says in the document we've got here be not so quick back I should do my podcasting duty have you left a review for this show if you haven't yeah you know what to do leave us a review wherever you get your podcasts we're giving away an Amazon gift voucher to whoever gets luck randomly luckily selected from the wide array of reviews on different platforms not just iTunes but when it gets to a thousand reviews on iTunes we're gonna go through all of those reviews and we're gonna find someone who's gonna win a thousand dollar Amazon gift cards so if that's not a reason to give us an honest review of the show doesn't have to be five stars although you know we like that please go do that and yeah that's about it is there anything else I need to plug I mean no Skillshare later look guys again no we good no good for now not so quick facts take us away alright so have you ever wondered why our tires car tires why are they black when rubber is naturally white leave every day yeah well some people might some people might not even realize rubber isn't it surely white cuz you most rubber products it seems like they're black right like a lot right before they're colored in some way I feel I thought it was whatever the color of rubbers is you know on the top of a pencil it was that kind of oh yeah yeah like whatever pinkish red I thought it was that for the longest time you know and that's what ever is yeah yeah yeah it turns out it is actually white but tires of course are black although in the old style they did have those white tires or the white-walled tires at some point and which are still kind of a thing nowadays to have the white ones I feel yeah but in rap videos they talk about white walls and stuff and yeah but you don't really want those for I mean besides the fact that they look dirty like in two seconds if you actually drive them around but no sir ian was look would look a bit weird on my regular car yeah yeah so in the 1900s early 1900s there was a company called bin Ian Smith and they made a product called carbon black which was purchased in masse by BF Goodrich for incorporating into the rubber tyres and before this although all the tires were white and so um so just for people don't know carbon black is it's a nearly pure elemental carbon that's just in a solution it's a colloidal particle form and just made there's various ways to make it classically you had like stuff like there which are like organic materials and stuff so he had like ivory black where they would literally just char ivory and lamp black which is just from the certain stuff from where lamps but more commonly like you have like thermo black today which is made by natural natural gas they kind of shoot it into this very hot furnace and then you know it produces carbon black and hydrogen but so why did Goodrich actually want this in their tires and it turns out it's not really clear who first discovered this but if you add about 50% by weight of carbon black to the latex the rubber it ends up increasing the road where abrasion and tensile strength by over 10 fold so makes a really crappy tire not so crappy and I did that's a lot yeah that's that's a ton and it turns out today so various tire manufacturers they use different blends and stuff for different types of tire and everything so today according to Michelin at least their average is more like 30% rather than 50% of carbon black and then they use a lot of other things for different things but um so the advantage of this not only that increasingly I feel like there was a time in history well like a lot of stuff was made by just people randomly like you say they don't really know how someone figured this out I feel like for a long time science was just less mix things together and see wow this this whole episode is just like let's mix things together and see what happens and then you know if you do it long enough something happens and it turns out I'll get into shortly this one was just that they didn't really know they were they're actually going for something different but time so just to quickly get back to the the other advantages besides this the extra strength and tensile strength and all that it also helped conduct the heat away faster from the hot spots of the tire so the part that's actually on the road and everything also reduces UV damage from the Sun and all that so and makes your tires look cleaner because if so you have white tires they like really dirty really quickly and this was actually the point BF goodrich in 1910 they were experimenting with different tire looks just to sort of look and see different colors and different advantages it's sort of a novelty item as well and so while they were doing that they came across yeah yeah right so they came across silver town rubber which is actually something from Britain and silver town England I have no idea where that is you know religious I don't know but I realize everything in this episode has an insanely cool name some what silver town rubber yeah that doesn't even sound like a town in England you know should be like silver Shire or something like that from you know if there was a silver rush it imagine like silver town yeah yeah so there's a chemist they're called SC mote who is working on there's a there was a company called india-rubber there and so he was working on it and he figured out at some point to add carbon black a little bit and it made it more of a grayish look to the rubber that they were making yes it's not really clear if he knew what this did other than make it gray but that came to the attention of Diamond Rubber Company which was owned also by Goodrich and so Goodrich then when they were looking for different different type of colors for their tires they looked at this as gray so it's different so they started you testing it out and seeing what it would what I would do and they quickly discovered like oh we exciting the color of rava yeah great and then so yeah when they started when they started using it on their tires I found wait a minute these gray tires last oh they're a lot more durable than our our white tires and so then they this followed a couple years of experimenting with this to see kind of how much what's the optimal amount of carbon like to add and like you know the different properties and stuff and then they eventually came to the or approximately 50% and then the problem here was to add this to quite a lot of their tires they were selling they would need like a massive amount of carbon black to mass-produce and so they needed they actually looking for 1 million pounds of carbon black fur annually to start and there was no company that could do that except for Binney & Smith thanks to their they'd come up with a pretty innovative new process in producing carbon black a lot cheaper so a lot so a lot of people would like burn organic materials and stuff like that and they actually came out with with a natural gas solution and to produce it mass very cheaply fine so they could do that tons by the way I just looked it up because I had no idea it's a lot yeah yeah yeah and so that this a bf could just started introducing it first in their high-end tires and then eventually it kind of caught on to their from other companies and stuff and they also they got a huge boost it kind of became a bit Kurtis after World War one thanks to during World War one there was a zinc oxide shortage and this was something that was added to to the white wall tires are the white tires that would increase their strength somewhat not as good as carbon black but but during World War one the zinc oxide shortage because it's used I think it's used in like him was it bronze or whatever and so they needed for various things so people just everyone switched to the black tires and they were way better and no one's really gone back except for if you want to buy crappy tires that just looked kind of cool until they get dirty two seconds after you drive them I would just add it is possible while we were talking about the color of tires I look at where they you know because it's 2020 isn't Italy 2020 surely someone's mastered the color of tires you can absolutely by fully colorful like neon style tires for your clef you can just put on there I'm looking at an image now there's yellow green bright purple which I think would be my selection look I'd never do this though it's quite imagine then they probably have like better white white rubber you know keeping it white and then just adding color you know properties or something but on that note so you have a lot of two's have white rubber soles and stuff and that there's actually they usually used fumed silica for that and it has similar reinforcing properties of carbon black but not it's not ideal for tires except for wet surfaces it's really good for wet surfaces but has has some other downsides but it works in shoes why I I had a problem the other day I was driving on the highway and I must have hit a patch of oil or something and it was really raining heavily and I started out really on the motorway it was really intense I mean just for a second and when I brought it back under control my wife that's quite alarmed yeah I could have used this I was like a puddle there like hydroplaning or something no not quite you know it's like you know I was going around a corner so I kind of felt like as if just control wasn't on or something yeah switch the traction I think I brought it back under control largely but you're like Simon with their Fast and the Furious well I think it's just cuz I played a lot of computer games like left around the corner and yeah yeah really just carefully nudge it back in to bring the triassic back into the streets see I grew up in the middle of nowhere and like gravel roads and everywhere so we did that all the time just for fun and like in the winter and like my driver's ed even we would go and the drivers instructor used to just randomly on the gravel roads just like to pull the emergency brake so the car would try to spin around then it was like a game to see if he could not like spin out because he would do it without warning like he just he would just reach over and like you know get your reflexes he's just good fun and then like actually my dirt road we had so they would plow like one side of it when it's all snowy but then I found if you actually kind of embed your car half way into the giant berm it would kind of try to suck you in but then if you were really fast you kind of try to throw you out around the corner you know and so there was just like a fun to see how fast you could go but you know is a crappy car so who cares and there's no one else it's just no this is in the middle of nowhere there's there's no one like literally like an hour from anything remotely resembling a city or town town really I also grow what I feel you know in the middle of nowhere in England but then it was like you could walk ten minutes here in the nearest village no it was like it was like a 30 30 minute walk to my bus stop so for school but anyway going back to in Ian Smith so they didn't just help revolutionize the tyrol by coming up with a way to mass produce carbon black cheaply but they also sold the red oxide paint they were the first company to to sell the commercially sell the red oxide paint that would be the stereotypical barn color so when you think of like um barn color you think of that like red or whatever kind of like mutton today mostly people think of it they like the bright red but you know like the brownish red or whatever and it turns out before this before the 19th century these sort of rather than paint so painting your house or your barn was considered a bit of like your kind of highfalutin and you know wasn't obviously one thing farmers would want to do she follow exactly and so they would just to go with the whole wood preserving philosophy of the right wood in the right place needed no paint so they would actually this was like a thing where you would side the location of your barn based on the wind and Sun and water exposure and stuff like that to help preserve the wood and the keep everything going is and plus at this time of course they had a lot more heartwood and stuff from from the lots of forests and everything being deforested and that's nice with big trees yeah exactly and so they were you know naturally weather resistant and that worked really good but in the 19th century that started not worrying so good because not as much of that and also they started thinking well hey what if we just paint them anyway or put some sort of finish and then the barn will last longer so lots of homemade concoctions we come up with and one of the most popular was using linseed oil mixed with milk and lime or turpentine apparently and this would actually come up with that I guess and this it would come up with a burnt orange color this would be lime like builders lime rather than yeah lime right yes yes yeah yeah or turpentine is what they reduce a becomes a kind of inside is I mean isn't it sort of like I'm not sure and oil of turpentine oils at serpentine this is really helpful Google dictionary still from gum turpentine or pine wood used for mixing paints and varnishes of all that's how pungent oil distilled from yeah gums happen time okay yes so this is what they use but the problem is the problem with this is it didn't well it helped to protect the wood it wasn't resistant to like mold and moss and things like this that was you know would also degrade your structures then they figured out you could use all iron oxide for this purpose to make some homemade paint with that and our an iron oxide is pretty abundant with soil in parts of the US so you could I mean it's literally like just get it out there cheap you know so you could just mix that in and then it would to end up with this paint that was kind of a burnt orange or dark red brown and so then inter been Ian Smith who figured out a way to mass produce this type of paint and we're the first to do so this this color of this iron oxide and that helps make it thanks to its extreme cheapness and commercial availability and utility of it helped make it the gold standard for barns all over and so that kind of states you know we don't have red box yeah I know dude was it blue was that the color I feel like they're made out of bricks wow that makes sense i i i i google-searched it I mean I grew up around bonds and I kind of remember them just kind of being old brick buildings yeah naturally our days they're just made out of steel I guess or you know sheet metal yeah but I looked up UK barn it's basically bricks bricks sometimes wood and now it's just mostly barn conversions which are just you know nice big yeah well in the u.s. anyway if you ask a kid to draw or color in a barn in a coloring book they're gonna do a picture some shade of red and this brings us back to bein Ian Smith again because people are Aguayo Binney & Smith never heard of them but what people have heard of is Crayola Crayons which is what Binney & Smith invented as well another product of theirs is misty the tiles as well yeah well I mean they were the ones who came up with the way to mass-produce the carbon black that made the black tires and mess possible and cheaply responsible for black tires red bonds and Crayola and like lots of other things its colors and pigments they were they were super innovative in their their techniques and stuff they would come up with C I mean cuz it's not like anyone like other people had they throw all this stuff together it's your house yeah other people had this stuff you know had carbon black and stuff but they figured out ways to mass-produce these things which I mean you did that right that mini documentary on pigments how hard it was to come up with just like the idea of blue in the 17th yeah it was like well we don't have that yet yeah like not in a way that you could mass-produce or and if you wanted like the paint like what was that one paint the one with the blue lady or whatever paint where they had to get it only from Afghanistan or something like that combined in Afghanistan and that was the only way in the world you could get it and it was just specific red they made it out of beetles that came from like some South American islands and they just round up these beetles and they gave this this one super popular red yeah and so this is like minion Smith they were just really good at coming up with these ways to mass-produce these paints and colors and pigments and things that they would then sell to companies and yeah Crayola Crayons so that one it was around the early again the turn of the century there in 1900s that's a good it was a good time for minion smith um so they purchased a stone mill company because they were they were gonna make slate pencils and slate supplies for schools it was really popular back then and so but they they wanted to develop other lines of products so they got they roped in Alice Binney was Edwin binney's well wife so one of the founders of the company she was a schoolteacher at one point before they clearly were quite wealthy so she didn't teach anymore so she would hold a thing yeah well I know that yeah all these bright and they won my a lot of awards too so they were at like World's Fairs they won what were those gold gold whatever's gold medals at those that they used to Crayola Crayons used to have that that logo on there from one of those and that was just one of their products so see how they came up with a bunch of products and so one of the first ones was the world's first desolace chalk so and called shot crayons is what they called them and that one was one that won a gold medal at the 1904 st. Louis Fair and then they came up with a wax crayon which they sold under the Crayola brand starting in 1903 and Crayola was the name so that was actually thought up by Alice Binney and so it's comes from the French word and I'll cry cray I didn't know sorry I was looking up the gold medal thing yeah yeah you're right is cool the gold medal also create little boxes look super cool in the past yeah yeah they they certificate or something pretty excellent yeah they like way way cooler than now are they were just you know whatever they just ballistic yeah I'm so friend French word cray I know nothing about French but I know you took like years of French yeah dude but you know attention French was by far my lowest grace do you actually get like props from you from your school because even you're British and you're like yeah we don't speak French so like if you get a lower lower grade teachers like yeah because our cravings blemish it didn't your Whistler cream eating chalk or with hola shortened from the French word I don't know that's a lot of letters oleic No yeah meaning oily is the point there and it directly derives from Latin a lioness which is he which basically just meant olive tree so then then that all brings us to that so that's the first part of the cray francais le ignite yes I do or I was hang on as in if you had that but he said only as you know no all right anything yeah yeah so cray was the first part of crayon and Crayola so okay I've lost my spot dude I'm not surprised you lost your spot looking at these notes they stick a whole bunch of reds and French words strung together so crane actually did exist before she came up with that I'm used for going all the way back to the sixteenth century actually and just mint chalk pencil and so if you put it all together basically the point of all of that little sidetrack was the Crayola crayon the name of cranek yes actually just means oily chalk pencil which is they made up they made up the word no no Crayola wears what she came up with and then they used crayons so crayon just meant chalk pencil and was all the way back to the 16th century which actually in French in the French version just meant pencil eventually so is just oily pencil or Orly chalk pencil which is apt description meaning just yeah yeah or a Crayola crayon which is it really that's a that's a good name so yeah they started making it just a waxing and they had actually previously made this for industrial use for like a companies and I found this funny because so they couldn't use it straight off for kids because it had chemicals and I had like toxic chemicals and these things that they were perfectly happy to sell the companies for their workers to use on like crates and barrels for marking but you can't give it you know can't give the toxic chemicals to the kids so they had to get the kids would eat it or something yeah that's probably true like the 19th century was just like whatever our workers are dying who cares we'll just we'll replace them with new workers it wasn't like that you know the early 20th century or that all started that we did the radium girls yeah that one that one and then Henry Ford had a huge about to do to the reduction of work hours and actually better conditions and factories and all that everyone kind of had to follow suit after his success but up until then it was graphic yeah what also started an American town in the middle of the Amazon rainforest coat Fordlandia where he roped in all the locals do you know this no I don't know this fun oh dude I did a business place video about this which is another channel I do dude it would make a great today I found out as well he stopped in the middle of the Amazon rainforest he's like Henry Ford so he's like super Christian and he's really into these like American values of like poetry reading and pure Tana T or whatever that word yeah back in the day and so it's essentially just an American suburb in the middle of the Amazon rainforest then he says to all these you know locals hey come work in my Amazon I you know American suburb in the forest gathering rubber funnily enough for his motor copier and yeah it didn't end well let's just put it that way okay this kind of sucks because we have to go to mandatory poetry reading and there's no booze was it in English did they speak English I I can't remember but I I could imagine it would be forced upon them yeah now even I heard that one now we'll be good to you like in India it's it's one of my favorite random business stories that's good that's good so in any event they came up with new pigments and stuff they because again they're super innovated their opinion Smith new pigments for their stuff and came out with wax crayons for kids and at first for anyone curious their first it was an 8 pack of crayons had black brown blue red purple orange yellow and green and sold for a nickel which was a dollar 50 today in today's money so and today and deal yeah and eventually they rebranded their whole company Crayola instead of Indians Mythbusters why a lot of people haven't heard of Binney & Smith and also hallmark now owns Crayola so home records Inc they bought him in 1984 and I did there was another little aside here this is a bit of a tangent but also connection and I thought was interesting because it's a little funny so Edwin and Alice Vinnie's daughter was named Dorothy and she married a publisher named publisher and promoter named George P putting them who in turn had two children with her before she started having an affair with some South American guy funny enough and and then it does this whole episode is so random but also all ties together random aside seem to be pulled it yeah my subjects it took a while so anyways they get divorced because George putting him they eventually get divorced after a couple years it didn't really seem to care that she was having an affair they didn't like each other so they weren't you know I live together much but he invited one Amelia Earhart over to live with him before they were divorced to help write a book he was writing a book about her first trip across the Atlantic he had previously done another one that was really famous for with aviator I can't remember that now but it was really big and so that Amelia Earhart you approached her today you want to write a book similar it'll make a lot of money so she agreed she comes lives with him and then they get pretty close and so they lived together and then the divorce happens and and then shortly thereafter he proposes to Amelia Earhart she says no so he proposes again and she says no and this precedes six times before she finally accepts because Amelia Earhart was very anti marriage because at the time if a woman got married even if they had independence before in the career it usually stopped right there like it was just that's it you're a wife now you you know make babies and like chicken you know so that was kind of the thing and so she was convinced this is gonna happen she was quite anti marriage for this reason and so at the point I just thought this was a funny letter so on the day of their wedding she goes up to her mister put them and she's you know they're about to get married her future husband and she gives him a letter in which she writes you must know my reluctance to marry I feel the move just now as foolish as anything I could do I know there may be many compensations that have no heart to look ahead ah on our life together I want you to understand I shall hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly if we can be honest I think the difficulties which arise may be best avoided should you or I become interested deeply or empathic with anyone else someone else or just it someone your fancy if you could just go ahead and do that with the others work or plane or let the other nor let the world see our private joys or disagreements in this connection I may have to keep someplace where I can go to be myself now and then for I cannot guarantee to endure at all times the confinement of even an attractive cage this exotic rule promise and that is that you will let me go in a year if we find their happiness I will try to do my best in every way and give you that part of me you know and see me to what so this is both funny and also kind of like it also kind of shows some of what her thinking because there and you'll read some other she definitely didn't she was convinced like as soon as they were married he wouldn't actually want her to be the way she is you know like that he would just be like no this is you can't have my wife like going off and you know all these adventures and flying and dangerous things and just letting you know her be but that and there's that part where she didn't say I can go to be by myself which is actually how I read it first and so that's why I highlight it because if she actually says I can go to be myself somewhere else and so yet she was convinced that he wouldn't actually want her to be herself there so so she didn't also I'm gonna mind reading this correctly I think she means like she just wants someone to go and be alone and have some solitary time now see that that's how I read it but no if you actually read the words it's to be myself not be by myself she wants to go somewhere else to be herself so she can be yourself because she feels like in the marriage she's not gonna be able to be herself oh he's kind of fascinating sadder it is in that last line to where she will try to be what you know but you know he she doesn't she's not convinced that he's actually gonna like her the way she is she said ninety five times yes and she and this was of course she that part of the letter I didn't put in there was also explained we've talked about this before and basically and you kept asking me anyway so I finally agreed so so this this is also extremely odd for a time she chose not to take his name which was like you know really outlandish back then they didn't bother to honeymoon they just got married and then just went right back to work she just went off on a flight to her actually directly after it all worked out though crazy enough so she did actually eventually you know wait a minute he actually did want he liked her the way she was even though she was a bit atypical for her age and she states in a letter a few years later I had no special feelings about mr. Putnam at first I was too absorbed in the prospects of the trip and my being the one to make it of course after I had talked to him for very long I was conscious of the brilliant mind and keen insight of the man we came to depend on each other yet it was only friendship between us or so at least I at first at least I didn't admits even to myself that I was in love but at last the time came I don't know quite I don't quite know when it happens when I could deceive myself for longer I couldn't continue telling myself what I felt for GP was only friendship I knew I had found the one person who could put me last nice it all worked out in the end it did and I did want to just just another great great quote from her just completely random a little bit so after crossing the Atlantic solo on her this is her second trip this is the first time to do it alone and also became she became the first person man or women to to cross the Atlantic by air twice and so she states of this if there is anything I have learned in life it is this if you follow the inner desire of your heart the incidentals will take care of themselves if you want badly enough to do a thing you usually do it very well and to think well done as a society is organized usually works out to the benefit of others as well as yourself it's a nice quote it is and speaking of doing things well before we get there hang on hang on just take go back on the journey of getting to that quote I'm not mistaken it was the Binney guys daughter who married her publisher called Putnam who divorced her and got married to Amelia Earhart and then we had a section about Amelia Earhart's kind of both funny and a little bit sad and like I don't know interesting I find it interesting on all these like one of my favorites it didn't do well at all and we should just do in podcast form just to beat people over the head with it again is the more interesting the second time but it would actually be more interesting in podcast form because I spent I spent like a couple days reading letters between Napoleon and his first wife English is like hundreds and hundreds levers and is great cuz it's totally humanized so you read about you know you study Napoleon and all these things he did you know military campaigns and that's and he you know he's sort of this mythological figure but then you read his letters to his wife and then ex-wife and you know but they're still were super close the only reason he divorced her was just because he needed an heir and she wasn't cutting it for that I'm so yes but they were still like super close for the rest of their lives and this was a problem with his he's like second wife cuz you know he really liked his first wife and they still hung out and like for a while they had to separate for a little bit because of that issue but they still wrote each other and this is where these letters come from and it's just super humanizing and interesting just to read these like his personal thoughts you know that he's you know these intimate thoughts to his ex his wife in the next life and it's it's just fascinating I think on these historic figures it sort of makes him like oh yeah that's a real guy you know like in the you know just sees it's like normal guy in a lot of ways it's just fascinating years will be like reading Trump's email Trump's emails time yeah and it would be like isn't it nice to have you know he's so humanized the way he talks about you know dinner and all of this stuff and I don't like or do you think they'll remain private because I guess these letters weren't intended for them to be made public and I think with my email yeah the funny part is though well cuz there'll be so many more cuz here's they you know these are these letters but now like I mean I don't know I get like easily like 60 or 70 emails a day or something most of them I ignore but like that would be really fun reading yeah and so it's just gonna be drowned out the ones I actually send so even even if someone were to read through them it would just be like after like alright you know fifty thousand and whatever you know people just quit and not not keep going but it would be I think I think it is it'd be like super interesting and super interesting Lincoln is another one to read some of his letters and and Lincoln of course had those ones where he had he wrote those letters that he would then not intend to send so he would write these letter like these angry letters to people that were just like not doing what they should or like this sort of thing like especially yet yeah it was just a venting and then it was just like he would just rip into them in every way possible particularly as generals and stuff we were completely incompetent like it was more to do is a lot of a lot of the the North's troubles were more to do with the generals incompetence if the North rather than the skill of the south generals they were just they were just skilled but like the ones in the north were really crappy and several times could have done something choosers like in the war and then they just didn't and Lincoln would write these letters and they were just like rip into them you know what are you doing and and then he would take that letter put it in his desk he's bending over and then he would write the actual letter to them which was very polite and just you know much much nicer but kind of a nicer way to say some of the same things and I don't know that's sort of super fascinating as well just sort of see that but in any event I thought all these things all these letters like this I I think are interesting and that that's just a funny one just give your spouse or your future spouse on your wedding day like even an attractive cage you know like this is a cage no lifetime's yeah he must have really liked her which which she was a unique woman for her age I mean there wasn't a lot like that I mean even nowadays to to you know they're her accomplishments and all that but still for her age particularly unique personality should brain food maybe you want to become skills like Amelia Earhart did she move the bus Pacific flight across the Pacific Atlantic ed land it wasn't the first solo that was see I miss Lindbergh yes that and that's the one that her her husband did the the book called we I think it was called but she was serious ties into our content today yeah she was the first to do it twice over the first time I think she was just kind of a navigator or passenger or something like that but she still got credit for being the first woman to cross that way but that's why she wanted to do it again just to show hey I can do it myself I didn't need to be just a passenger right and so she this solo no you know no look I'm not saying that skill shares gonna teach you how to do that so that wasn't the best whole box but as she says and she says if you want badly enough to do a thing you usually do it very well and a thing well done as a society is organized usually works out for the benefit of others as well as yourself yeah sorry for such brain feet and let's get into our main content shall we yeah so today for the main content we're going to be talking we must be like six hours in because that was the longest quick fact ever yeah well as you'll see the the whole thing is is around rubber but this section it's kind of about rubber bands and how we got there so various yeah when making a video a podcast about the rubber bands next week the cardboard box and you'll see though well we're all over the place here it all ties together a bit like rubber bands hold everything together and this is what hosts this whole episode together so Mesoamerican peoples they made they were making rubber they were making rubber like 3,500 years ago so zero just makes you know they had the the sap the milky white SAP the latex from the javea resiliencies trees or something yeah rubber trees basically so and they would actually mix with the Morning Glory juices from the Morning Glory vines and how they figured this out who knows but if you mixed him it actually made a much like ass nice rubbery solid quite sturdy substance and so the Olmec seemed to be the first to have done this and they did it because they would make these large rubber balls which is and they used him for these games so they had these games it's not really clear what the exact rules of these original ones were they over time there's various versions they even had like a hoop likes type thing only it was like sideways eventually that was added at some point for anyone and seems like this on top tends the other day really yeah they're playing dude these games were extremely violent yeah yeah and like good end with the death of the losers or sometimes the winners they're not sure if it's the losers or the winners who were killed because it was seen as an honor like to know to die in it was either if you died like this or in battle then you'd go to you know whatever heaven they have yeah well and they also did it apparently it seems like they might have done it and stuff like in that conflicts with neighboring groups they would play these games instead of like warring with each other sometimes so yeah and there was also a good idea you know I don't have a war just a game a commander conquer going and whoever wins yesterday it's way more fun right yeah yeah yeah but in any event so so yeah they had and they made these rubber balls basically this is some of the earliest use of rubber that they could that you know we know of that humans made and eventually other older other cultures around that area and whatnot started making like sandals and waterproof containers and jewelry and all sorts of things like that and this is where we have a little aside here dandelions did you know dandelions you can get latex from from them this is like it's his Danny Lance considered a bit of a weed like in Europe at all this is gonna be really dumb but I just need to okay that's I was just double-checking was cuz I got I got things because they have to also the you can blow on them right and then the seed yeah yeah but they're also bigger things yeah yeah and this is like your they're desirable in a lawn yeah yeah this is what but there's so many uses to dandelions and it turns out you can get latex from them and this is gonna be huge potentially so they're like the back for quite some time people have been trying can we can we like McDaniel and farms and then mass-produce latex farms because this is a problem nowadays because you have a lot of the the latex farm the trees are being killed off by diseases like in huge numbers and it's it's really hurting the supply of latex so natural rubber which is a problem because even though I think it's like 50 or 50 percent or 60 percent or something is artificially made rubber they we still you know the world still depends on these supplies and so like the turns out the Nazis tried to do this they tried to make dandelion farms they could they could then get mass-produce latex and they they failed and it's only been in the last few years these didn't try how they did try a lot of things that was in the wall there let's try that you know yeah just give it like it's yeah one of those things like the Cold War or whatever is just like when you when you give like a group of people like infinite money to just throw it the problem or Chris just like to see what gas I was getting mixed in with that you know it's just like hey we should try this thing okay here's ten million dollars like you know like whether it's a good idea or not yeah exactly so they tried its last few years so because of the the problems with the the latex the natural latex supplies they're starting to put more money and stuff into this and so now there is a cultivated type of DNA line that produces a lot more latex than the normal and all that and it's starting there's there's some test farms going out to try to see you can just have a dandelion farm which is this crazy to think about and just to produce natural latex so if you do if you do have Danny lines that you can totally forgot why are we talking about latex what's it do that's the rubber that's the rubber that's where we get rubber no like it like it yeah you'll see you'll see why we call it rubber instead of you sort of referenced it right at the beginning of this episode but we'll get to that yeah yeah you are yeah so this is a thing and if you want you can just take some some Danny lines pop off the head and you can squeeze the juices out and then you kind of rub it together and your fingers and the heat from your hand will help it bind the other and then you got a little bit of latex and you can make little rubber bands and things not very good ones but you know so yeah the Spanish explorers they started they started arriving the sixteenth century of course and started looking and observing these them these little them doing this making these rubber products with their um different things so including the rubber balls and documenting games but then it wasn't till French explorer charles de la Condamine do you remember this guy from episode 5 okay yes he was the mathematician who figured out he could rig the French lottery with Voltaire wait was this one of the adventures he went after he got super rich yes because he did he did these journeys to South America which he could then fund himself because he figured out that he could get rich rigging the lottery the French lottery and that also helped Voltaire if people want to go if you haven't listened to episode five and that was what was it called episode 5 enlightenment enlightened wringing of the lottery plus wheezy waiter interview interview with Craig benzine that one that was good time do interviews on this show like it was yeah that was fun back in the day yeah I mean I've listened to a couple early episodes recently because I wanted to see like have we gotten better or like worse or you know like whatever and we gotten better substantially worse no we've gotten substantially better let me tell ya the yeah there was a couple of the early ones I was like really I only said this one though but it's really interesting so and you know Craig Craig benzine he's interesting guy and that's I do miss about the the interviews it would be nice it's fun to actually you know cuz if yeah if you're interviewing you can just see people yeah yeah you can just be like hey wanna come on a podcast and like yeah sure um so yeah in any event so Charles de la Condamine so he actually is often given credit for sort of discovering in quotes there the latex and all that because he actually was the first to scientific scientifically documented in the 1730's oh and he also brought samples back to europe so first to do that and he also wrote the first scientific paper on it in 1751 and he called it and no cat catch you ik it's a lot of bells I'm not even a try let's go it's a French shoe it yeah it's a French variation of the South American word for latex and I don't even know what South American word because obviously there'll be different words different based on the who they were talking to I would imagine but either way that's what he calls it and so rubber this we expect why do we call it rubber because shortly thereafter in 1770 British chemist Joseph Priestley who is the guy who discovered oxygen among other things he noted that the rubber worked really good at getting rid of pencil marks off paper and so by it's a rubbing material and rubber in it so a name that would then catch on and by the 18th century this everyone was calling it rubber for its ability to erase pencil marks so of course where there was a time when pencil wasn't erasable well in the fact that pencil I mean pens pencils were more of a recent thing and coming back to Napoleon Vicks last week yeah but even before that so you had pencils it wasn't til um Britain they discovered that mine that had the pure graphite where you could actually make the Graphite's things and then they would wrap I mean like sheepskin of stuff for strength and that they would like flood that mine because of the world's only supply of these pure graphite and it wouldn't be till later someone I can't remember who I feel like working for Napoleon or something I was definitely a food yeah it was figured out that he could mix clay because they were having trouble getting the supply from England obviously but Napoleon wanted pencils and so the he figured out you mix clay in the graphite yeah so this how did we even get here this whole episode is going bands rubber bands 1819 they an Englishman by the name of Todd oh I know we were talking about erasers pencil erasers oh yeah rubbers oh yeah oh yeah of course you call them in races right yeah rubbers rubber if someone were to say do you have a rubber here they were is you met condom or prophylactic I guess is what would you call them prophylactic what's a prophylactic no really so I saw this but I don't know what it means that's funny because I saw this what's that I don't even know there was a show with the guy who plays on Harry Potter the guy who plays Harry Potter is a comedy show he was just like guest starring on and he kept calling it a prophylactic and I thought is that how the British say that um what is Harry not there's something to do with allergies I thought that condom no I I don't know he's obviously having you on because I've never heard anyone in Britain referred to a condom as a prophylactic what show is that one moment okay there we go I took malaria prophylactic so the idea of preventing disease that makes sense of usage okay no I've never heard anyone if well urban dictionary should we open dictionary and right now is this gonna be good part [Laughter] ricky gervais the show that's the extras of prophy extras oh that's an old show yeah oh wow this urban dictionary definition was submitted in December 1999 who knew urban dictionary been around so long and it you know it is a condom a rubber a Jimmy hat etc just out of a loop on that one yeah all right then yeah but if someone said oh my aunt has this amazing story we were she's she's not American but she lives in America she's an immigrant and she's been there for I don't know what 30 years now 20 years maybe and we went over to visit her and go to Disney like me my dad and my sister and we went out I was maybe nine my sister was seven maybe a little younger and we were having dinner in a restaurant and you know how they'll like hand out drawings you know so kids can draw her yeah and my younger sisters like coloring it in his American restaurant she's just she gets really upset she makes a mistake [Laughter] [Laughter] no in any event going back to rubber bands rubber in turns eighteen nineteen Englishman Thomas Hancock he was in a state Coast business and he wanted to come up with ways his customers dry while traveling so we wanted some various you know rubber based waterproof clothing items save like waterproof suspenders gloves shoes socks among other wearables because you know when they get in located stuff see that's when I was reading that's like so did he just like like a tarp like a rubber tarp type thing like over the top of the skirt right though okay but you know whatever this was I guess there was a lot of them that didn't have you know they were open what sports card they you know but but you know he was you know marketing it to for beyond the stagecoach stuff just for people to wear but he opened a factory begins mass producing it but the problem is he discovers he's wasting a lot of rubber because you know when you actually make the stuff there's a lot of wasted material so how can we recycle this and so he came up with a kawaii called a pickling machine later called the masticator and it would just basically rip up and shred this rubber and shreds mash it together be really malleable and then it's like a solid mass so he can make like sheets of rubber this way and to be reused cut out whatever and also one of his first things he made was these little glue like these little strips of rubber that would made into bands so we the first rubber bands but he did not ever sell these or patent this actually at this point didn't patent either you not even the machine because he's not if he patented it what's gonna happen is everyone's gonna patent trolls are gonna come over patent pirates are gonna come along and they're going to just make my machine and start selling the product and forced me to sue them which is what always happened back then and so then he's just gonna spend years suing people and not making any money and so he didn't patent the pickling machine and so that hopefully that way no one would know how he did it and he also called it the pitch pickling machine just to throw people off of like how it's how that what does it actually do you know it's just sort of a random name so people can figure out how to work it or how it worked I like that idea isn't this is why coca-cola doesn't have a the coca-cola is not passengered they had no patents on coke yeah because by getting it secret they can use it forever yeah well yeah and it expires after what well yeah then and then you give away the exact ingredients to anyone and back then this was like a thing that as we've covered in the other stuff we're not gonna wait for the passenger Xbox yeah no I'll just do it and then you can sue us if you find out at all because especially if you were like in a different country no one's gonna find out which comes we'll come back to him talk because he was actually kind of one of these people so so he does he doesn't he makes these rubber bands and this seems to be the first rubber bands that people made but he doesn't use them for anything he doesn't sell them doesn't seem to see but to be fair in his defense they hadn't come up with the vulcanization process yet and so these rubber was really not a good product in a lot of ways it this time sort of sticky on hot days particularly we get sticky and you know all that and then on cold days I would just get really hard and brittle so wasn't very practical in a lot of sense and it got really messy over over time because he could you just like progressively more sticky over time and stuff as it wasn't it wasn't good especially for these items you know gloves that just start getting crappy over time so this brings us to Charles Goodyear so Charles Goodyear was born on December 29th 1800 in New Haven Connecticut news oldest of six children and his father was a pretty successful businessman eventually called a massive Goodyear mm-hmm and so he got his start his father did real successes would say in business because he buys this patent for manufacturing buttons and at the time in the u.s. manufacturer in the US was just considered universally crap and like suffer button if you wanted any product you basically just bought it from Britain was the thing yeah there was just Britain's where you get the quality stuff the US manufacturing was just crap at this time so he buys this patent for manufacturing buttons though that actually made really good quality buttons and so um he opens a factory and then he starts he was the first u.s. manufacturer of pearl buttons in 1807 and during the War of 1812 had ridden risen to the prominence of course you can imagine in a war of 1812 they're not gonna want to buy Britain buttons from Britain so the US military was buying all their metal buttons from Goodyear's father so he was good business was booming and so yeah by the age of 17 he his father encourages Charles to move to Philadelphia to work as an apprentice at a hardware company called Rogers and and he had an ulterior motive he wanted his son to become an expert in you know running a hardware company because that's something that he wanted his business to get into so then he comes back in around 18 22 18 21 sometime around there to become a business partner was his father and so then they actually switched to making all sorts of agricultural tools and stuff like this and again at this point everyone was buying this from Britain so to actually make it local was kind of a novel thing and it's actually some some say that Goodyear was the first to open a retail hardware company in the u.s. that we like it was made the products here in the US I'm fully instead of buying them from somewhere else and reselling him but either way rather was the first or not he was one of the first so so here are 1824 things are going well he gets married to one Clarissa Beecher and they reportedly had an awesome relationship and everything and so his business is booming and he decides to open his own hardware store separate from his father's business he's gonna open his own thing and this again is considered to be one of the first domestic hardware stores in the US and things are going great there buy stuff before like online or mail order to England they would order it and then you know various so hastily but nice to know you get it cuz all the England made all the great hardware like the agricultural equipment and everything like that you didn't want to buy the US version at this time so it was just you know it was the John Deere tractor British I feel like his British is there a super British tractor manufacturer even sure carry on I'll google it so you can company there's a super British tractor company and all the farmers who listen to this how do you not know this it doesn't matter someone will tell us carry on useless aside Marshall Suns and kill sorry I don't know Karen anyways so that Google search famous tractor and then you you know it also fills the first thing not famous tractor manufacturer the first option with famous tractor M is famous tractor manual and I'm like how many famous tractor manuals are there alright so again the the perception at this point was that you only buy the good stuff from England so a company like this making all their own stuff in in the US rather than just ordering it because there were stores you could go to the store and they were just getting their product from England you know so you just buy but now you know he he had it all local and so as an iTunes I'm sure he's working on around this point it's certainly wait a minute you know Charles Goodyear you make some awesome stuff and so his business was booming so things are just looking up for good year like this this whole first part of his life's super awesome and then literally everything after is awful like yeah for the rest of his life leading to the like that was super super sad and like if you could think like what's the saddest way could go I mean sure there's like lots of more sad ways but he's you know it said the he could it was he hung drawn and quartered yes that would be but this is actually almost worse because that's like painful but this is painful in another way but anyways we'll get to it so that's a little teaser for some make you feel grateful for your life yeah so good year 18:29 so he thinks alright everything's going awesome and of course everything happened to this point in his life is gone awesome you know personal life professional life everything's doing great so he's got enough money he's gonna he's gonna extend operations outside of Philadelphia to start shipping his goods in mass to the mid-atlantic in the south and everything and so but the problem is the tariff act of 28 and this seemed like a great deal for him because this was a way to get people to stop buying all their hardware and agricultural equipment from Britain was to put this like massive tariff and it was what was at 38% on various imports from Britain and 45% on various raw materials that was like a huge it's like you and Britain back in the day you and China today yeah yeah right this is huge and so this seems like a good deal for cuz now he's one of it he's like at the top in the US you know he's got this hardware thing and now everyone's gonna buy it from Britain with that kind of tariffs and so the South but the problem was so all these southerners were placing these orders that he was then fulfilling but then businesses was not going well in the south because of this disruption on raw materials and all this and so what ends up happening is that then a lot of southern companies go out of business or they just choose not to pay like they default payments so he's sending all this stuff spending a lot of it capital to do it and then not getting paid for a lot of this stuff a mass that he's shipping off so this becomes a problem a financial problem and and yeah when people stop paying you and so then at the same time when he needs to be at the top of his game he has a severe extended bout with digestive issues which causes him to be bedridden for quite some time so he can't even manage his company effectively and he's not you know obviously getting proper nutrition and sleep and all that so he's probably not also you know top of his mental game either running things and so by 1830 he this this very prominent promising businessman just a couple years before is now in debtors prison he's just like massively in debt and then on top of that just to kick him while he's down but this was all these people who owe us money and put them in a place where they can't earn money yeah when he wasn't debtors prison he did start his first experiment so it's rubber and were one of his stands he did several stints in debtors prison so 1831 so this just worse 1831 and 1833 two of his children died because that's what kids did back then and his own health was continuing to decline at this point it I've gotten better so at the same time he decides all right he starts experimenting with with latex and he sinks all right my father takes this thing with buttons and makes them better so I'm gonna take a known product and make it better and that's where I'm gonna get my new fortune right so he looks at rubber as the way to do this so there's tons of rubber product out there they're all crap because eventually they you know turn crappy they get really sticky and where they gets cold they're really hard and all this so he's if we can overcome this problem oh and they also stinks like crazy like the rubber manufacturing like if you've ever I don't know people have never like smelt this but apparently it's really awful when you smell the rubber manufacturing process never have the priviledge yeah no I haven't either but if you read accounts apparently it's quite disgusting and you don't want to live near a rubber manufacturing plant either way so he's how can he adds place in London which was a biscuit factory I say I like to live next to that yeah my house and I'm like quite liked to live above that yeah but then you just be hungry all the time really KFC so he look easily gonna solve all these problems so he buys you know he doesn't really have much money but that doesn't that's fine because it turns out at this point from Brazil for just a few pennies which is about 70 cents today you could you could buy a whole pound of the substance of this rubber that he could then work with so he starts doing this he starts working on it for wood right yeah and so he starts working on this and he's still he's getting thrown in debtors prison in 1834 1838 and he's he's not really making much headway like he started to make some different products like tablecloths and shoes and he was making like he was mixing chemicals and stuff and getting you know he was finding these ways to make it better initially the rubber but it always would eventually like her to come in contact with this or that that people that it would come in contact with then it would revert back to being this crappy thing or even worse so and one side thing he actually did at one point add lamp black and just you know basically carbon black similar just derived from the from the lamp burning process and so he added this to the rubber to make any he found it made it more desirable in some way so all the way back then he was doing that but but this product again his mixture it would ultimately break down become sticky and lots of other issues that still plagued and so he wasn't he wasn't making money on this really um and so in one point he the neighbors speaking of the smell his neighbors called the police complaining of the the foul odors because he was I'm like day and night you know he was like it was not like it was wasn't working hard to try to support his family here but it wasn't working out he ended up having to sell like all their possessions and things like this and various investors along the way would come along one of them actually kept him afloat during some of the hardest time was when J Haskins from the Roxbury rubber he was also just a close friend of his and would just give him money and then he had another business partner and things were looking up he started his product was okayish still not great but you know as good as some of the other rubber rubber manufacturers of the day and so he opens a factory in Staten Island with this business partner investor and immediately after the financial crisis of 1837 happens which results in a major recession and his business partner going bankrupt and his factory then closing within months of opening up so his good year he's he's not he's not unfortunate timing he just said he keeps having this and so many failures he finally nine eight or 1838 Goodyear meets one Nathaniel Hayward who had worked Hayward had worked and he'd figured out that you could actually sort of dry the rubber with sulfur which would make it not so sticky and I mean it still smelled because now it smelled like sulfur which is I don't know probably worse I mean sulfur is like one of those horrible smell that's not yeah it's the worst isn't that what they used to make stink bombs yeah that's like that rotten egg smell or whatever so but they figured out this this seemed to to actually help the make the rubber stronger and less susceptible to temperature changes and stuff if you add some sulfur in so now it stinks so they're still it's like a new problem to overcome and also to find the optimal way to do this so here at a good year they begin working together and good years bringing like he has massive experimental knowledge of mixing all sorts of chemicals with rubber which I should mention this his health wasn't awesome through all this because he was mixing random chemicals like just randomly well you know it's not a good idea if you don't you know if you're just like an amateur okay and at one point he did he almost suffocated and then got a fever a severe fever directly after and almost died so yeah but anyways he had lots of experiments in knowledge with rubber and so he's doing it and eventually he comes up with the vulcanization process which a lot of people say he stole from Hayward but for the record in 1841 in a court case Hayward himself would say no good year came up with it on the exact balkanization process so Hayward did not claim the Goodyear stole it from him and as for how good your claims he came up with the vulcanization process he writes in his autobiography which is weirdly and awfully written in the third person but just makes it like weird to read yeah of many levels but that this is good you're writing about himself he's just writing about him something that they say starts off the inventor experiments to ascertain the effect of heat on the same compounds that had decomposed in the mailbags and other articles it was surprised to find the specimen being carelessly brought into contact with a hot stove charred like leather he this is so strange directly inferred that if the process of charring could be stopped at the right point it might divest the gun of its native at heated 'no said he Cygnus throughout which would make it better than the native gun upon further trial with heat he was further convinced of the correctness of this inference by finding that the india-rubber could not be melted in boiling sulfur at any heat but always charred he made another trial of heating similar fabric before an open fire this same of the same effect that of charring the gun followed there were further indications of success in producing the desired results as upon the edge of the charred position of the charred portion appeared a line or border that was not charred but perfectly cured on ascertaining to a certainty that he had found the object of his search and much more and that the new substance was proof against cold and the solvent of the native gun he felt himself M sleary amply repaid for the past and quite indifferent to the trials of the future so not only is he writing this in the third person but he also he the number of he's and hisses in that ya segment is a little bit absurd yeah and this last part he's he found himself amply repaid for the past so all his bad luck and then quite indifferent to the trials as a future but he should not have been because his trials were only just beginning so yet come up with his revolutionary and this is huge because if you think about it even like think of it like steam engines and car engines and stuff like they need the rubber for like at the time like the best gaskets people were using we're like leather soaked in oil and stuff this is just not good for high-pressure stuff like in car engines and like high-pressure steam engines for being very efficient and so like you know whole connives Reber would like made some of this stuff for the industrialization revolution like to really get going possible just and all this some of the things like replacing like rubber washers yeah leather in oil yeah yeah and I mean it works good in low pressure to a certain extent but high pressure stuff and so yeah all this stuff and let alone all the products made of rubber and derivative materials so yeah so he you know this is like a leather circuit in oil this is a world-changing product that you know that he has come up with a way to make rubber actually it's a lot stronger not sticky it's durable it lasts less a really long time it's it's more it's not as susceptible to temperature change issues I mean it still is I mean if you get cold enough or hot enough but less so and yeah it's this awesome product and so he's quite indifferent to the trials of his future but no so this is good here he's just got bad luck I'm so 1840s Oh a year the year after his world-changing discovery it was not a good year for for him he's he's so he's still fiddling at this point with the exact combination that makes the best version but he has come up with this really awesome version and he still got the digestive issues and gout he's got gout now um so he's and he's thinking he's gonna he's just got a die of dysentery or whatever but so the fearing he would die he does wonder if he's not he's not gonna finish his slice where he's again jailed this time because he couldn't pay a $5 which is about 27 dollars today hotel bill and on top of that jail his it his infant son dies another kid dies yeah so he soldiers on by 1844 he comes up with and patents the optimal formula here and what this did not induce trouble because like we say this is a time you patent something and you tell everyone how to do it then everyone's gonna start making it and then just force you to sue them to actually you know you're first you have to find out they're making it you know infringing upon your patent which you know at the time wasn't it wasn't like a matter of googling it you know you quite often wouldn't find out that they were making money off your invention and so he did he ended up 32 patent infringement cases and all he had to pursue at the same time he decides to build a rubber factory because things he seems like quite the optimist like he's still way in debt but he said I'm gonna build this rubber factory everything's gonna be awesome because I have this revolutionary product but it wasn't he kind of overextended himself so that didn't really work out for him either so he just kind of got more in debt but he was making money now at least like he had a product legitimately people were people were you know he was actually bringing in some good money just you know he had massive amounts of debt which we'll get into when he dies how much he had even upon his death um it was a massive amount it's big so yeah so his patent problems continue cuz he goes over to England and he says I'm gonna patent in England cuz this is gonna be great you know some major market over there what he finds is that one Thomas Hancock coming it all back to Thomas an [ __ ] has already patented a huge Thomas Hancock is the guy who had the stage goat business and made the rubber Bay the first rubber bands right yeah that guy so it turns out Thomas Hancock it already filed the patent and turns out he even filed the patent before Goodyear filed his US patent how did Thomas Hancock wave know how easy random thing yeah how did Thomas Hancock and remember we were talking about how Thomas Hancock was a was kind of worried about um the the patent pirates and this is kind of what he did a little bit except for he didn't need good years patent because he had a sample of good years one of his sulfur you know before his patent was approved he had a sample of this rubber and he got it from a buddy of his which um will get to his buddy's name a little bit I can't remember it off the top of my head but so that's to work out how he did it I mean exactly but it's this this ensues so when someone Goodyear finds out about this ok of course you know Susan is like hey this is actually mine so this is a it's a hole is about a decade long court battle we're just costing a lot of resources to which good years this is not how you want to spend your life no no and especially when you're in debt and you just know like you invented this like if they give you if they accept it if the judge accepts it though he's gonna get a massive windfall of money because all that money Hancock had been making office and he was like a major like he's considered like the guy who founded the Brit written rubber industry you know so they I mean he was making massive amounts of money here and Goodyear is entitled now to all of it just like a massive windfall and future revenue so good he really wants to win this this fight and among all the other ones he was spending money on legal bills and stuff so he goes he finally after about a decade of this he goes to and a British judge of course signs with the British Hancock and he the judge says there's no way he could have figured out how to reproduce this just by examining a rubber hangout that's a bit of a coincidence but isn't it yeah it is a bit of a coincidence and that he got the sample right before you know not long before and then he comes up with a thing and for what it's worth and this is why Goodyear is considered to be the guy who invented it rather than Hancock even though Hancock Patton was technically first by a few weeks is all so it turns out English inventor Alexander Parkes who is friends with Hancock and the other guy who William Brock Brockton who actually brought the sample to Hancock there's a buddy of his and they worked on it together to try to figure out how could your a doing this and Alexander Parkes who is the guy who invented the first man-made plastic he said Hancock and Brockton had both told him yeah they had your sample and they reverse engineered it like it didn't take him a long to figure out how he had done it cuz they knew in the first place they knew he was using sulfur and something and heat and stuff they knew like the kind of the basic idea so then it was a matter of just experimenting and rehearsing exactly what do you put in this thing and and even if you just know something's possible yeah and you know kind of a general formula yeah even if you'd just cuz you know it can be done it'd be like yeah the alchemists are trying to make gold forever even though they knew it couldn't even though they had no idea that it could definitely be done but it's yeah it's like yeah here's the gold that we made through our committee better be like that is gonna be a different game ya know and they not only knew that they knew he was having like heat and sulfur and in some way and come here like it didn't take him a long time and there's various chemical ways you can do this like you can burn material stuff to get to see and find out what it's made of and stuff like that and so the exact composition so there's there's ways they can do it but the judge was convinced that it couldn't be done just yeah he's just like give the British guy the money and probably yeah so yeah this they denied it and Hancock though would would later say in separate you know after the court case so that yeah yeah he was he had this sample and you know he admitted he had the sample and they were looking at it and just a note to Brockton William Brockton who is his buddy who brought him the sample was he actually came up with the vulcanized name it was from Vulcan the Roman god of fire so referencing the heat added so that's where why we call it balkanization was from Brockton uhm yeah again the Alexander Parkes is like no no they told me they told me that he's the sample so in any event so yeah Goodyear's credited though historically just because even though he was technically a few weeks after Hancock just because it seems like Hancock just kind of ripped him off so good year he he was not lucky again he lost that court case so he's still he's still working on his debts you know but things things turned worse because in June of 1861 you know doing his business and he finds out yet another one of his children this time one of his daughters is dying because he have he had six or five five or six total some like most of them died I mean like all of them died eventually but most of them died before he races to New York but this is this is good year you know he doesn't have good luck so he gets there and he finds out she's already just died so he rides and as when he hears this news he collapses right on spot he's then brought back to his hotel and he dies almost immediately thereafter in 1860 at the fifth age of 59 years old so yeah he he dies he's approximately $200,000 in debt at the time despite all this and if that's about five million dollars today yeah that's a lot yeah these remaining surviving loved a great deal she was imprisoned until she died yeah and like she had to resort to prostitution good good year though he's a positive guy you can tell kind of you know there's these like the optimist eternal optimist because even when he loses the battle the court battle with Hancock his response is is the following quote life might punch you in the face mult not really life should not be estimated exclusively by the standard of dollars and cents I am NOT disposed to complain that I have planted and others have gathered the fruits a man has cause for regret only when he sews and no one reaps that's very very positive yeah just so long as someone's benefiting you know from my life's work that's all I want so yeah so and you'll notice here a lot of people might beard when did he start the tire companies just then he didn't cuz yeah I assume he didn't at some point he's gonna start a big company and everything will work out okay no that came in 1898 so is that uh there forty nine years after or forty eight years whatever forty eight years after he died 49 years sorry so he's no affiliation with the company they just wanted to sort of honor him because you know for a lot of history like when he died he wasn't like well-known or anything he wasn't famous like like more today like it for an adventure he was quite unknown and so this was just sort of to honor him of you know Charles good versus good year so they they just named the company after him and I think they might have been in a town close by to one of them to that he was born I can't remember exactly but either way going back to Hancock in rubber bands cuz this is a story about rubber bands after all so he didn't he didn't ever patent his his rubber band making process and so as Hancock's is going through this decade-long lawsuit issue this is hurting his own business as you might imagine because you know like even people buying stuff from him was he gonna win or is he gonna lose and you know like I'm sorry I have a completely rendom aside ya think that in like two hundred years people will be like oh yeah the Tesla company founded by Nikola Tesla because you know yeah of course it's named after the guy invented rubber what are the odds of it being anything other than Matt's yeah well in this case I won't because they'll be like colonization on Mars and Elon Musk will have had something to do with that and so people will remember you know and musk who didn't actually found Tesla by the way but he everyone thinks he did no one remembers the guys who actually he of course is the guy who made it a thing and made it not go bankrupt a million times and now you know doing awesome what a great guy yeah but yeah so 1850s Hancock he's his business I mean it's still doing well he's not like Goodyear or anything so but he did cost him quite a bit and a lot of his competitors started popping up as he's going through these legal battles and having trouble with all this and including I'm going back to even before the legal battles were one moment because we already mentioned all this including cuz in 1845 some of those legal battles are all still going one Steven Perry figures out hey those rubber bands he made now that we have vulcanized rubber like these are actually super useful and so he patents his own thing so he was working for a Messrs Perry & Co rubber manufacturing of London and he patents the improvements in Springs to be applied to Gerst belts and bandages and improvements in the manufacture of elastic bands do you use meshes in America no but it's old-school like a teacher at school used to when he would address multiple boys he would call them messes and then also friend of mine from school is called Perry so it always be like Messrs Perry Whistler and Sakharov see me after assembly ya see I don't really know this from like Harry Potter so oh yeah yeah like yeah like mrs. Mooney Padfoot and prongs or whatever like kind of similar to school school boys but um any event so he patent C's and rubber bands is one of the things and for he found them really useful for holding papers together and so in the patent though he did actually explicitly distance himself from the in the ongoing vulcanized rubber thing going on because he didn't want his patent to be tied to that in any way so he just he just notes in it improvements in Springs to be applied to girths don't read in the wrong so many first they did no claims the preparation of the india-rubber Harun mentioned our invention consisting of Springs of such preparation of india-rubber applied to the articles here in mentions and also a particular forms of elastic bands made from such manufacturer of india-rubber so he's definitely a rubber and here it mentions yeah so he did he basically once say you could use any rubber for this even though if you use a non vulcanized rubber it's not gonna be an effective rubber band but you know he's like it doesn't matter but it does matter but everyone would use the vulcanized rubber after so Nina meant so he found it but it still this was something mostly just used by businesses and in factories and warehouses and stuff rather than it wasn't like a common household item until one William Spencer of Alliance Ohio sometime in 1923 so this is fast-forwarding a bit so he's getting the Akron Beacon Journal the local newspaper you know they leave it out but before they rubber-banded it you know before these times they would just blow away like the pages which which is blow away which is kind of funny to think about like no one thought to do anything about that so he did he thought hey so Goodyear rubber company was was nearby funny enough yeah that's what it was Akron Akron is really good your company was was founded is sorry I know I've got like a million asides - yeah this whole episode is like a big aside it is I was just thinking I we're not when I was a kid I used to work in a news agents right you know that delivers the newspapers place you know paper boys would come in and they'd grab all these things we don't use elastic bands what are you use they're not wrapped up they just go direct in people's post boxes yeah actually a thing like I know in movies the paper rides through the suburbs newspapers in a basket he throws them does that actually happen I don't know if that's still a thing but I was a paperboy at one point and yes we weren't allowed to throw them like that we had to actually go put them on the doorstep but you did you know did it you know you just ride your bike up real quick and plop it down and go to the next place and yeah and and they they would actually leave in our case at least there was this old refrigerator that was just like out in the middle of this like field and this was the spot they would put all the newspapers and then we would we would wrap we would wrap them and if it was raining we put them in plastic bags and everything so they were just looked like the big old stack and then I was the next day just for us to pick them up rubber band them put him the sacks or whatever and then go deliver him but yeah that was the thing we didn't throw them I don't know we weren't supposed to do that um yeah to put them in letter boxes by us yeah well that makes that makes sense I'm saying yeah so but anyways going back to William Spencer of Alliance Ohio so he Goodyear rubber company there he goes and he start me so hey can I have some of your like discarded like discarded rubber pieces like inner inner tubes and stuff like that they were just kind of like being thrown out and so then he cuts these into circular strips and then begins to wrap the newspapers and he goes to the Akron Beacon Journal and says hey check this out this is way better see how it just holds the paper together now you want blowing all over the place and they thought that was a great idea too though so they started buying these rubber bands from him they still do they was making places I went on a few years ago I took a motorcycle trip in Cambodia in Asia and like I needed something to attach my bag I was like the back of my motorcycle yes so I went to buy some children bungee cords like that yeah sure yeah and they just made them out of old tires so there be stripping tires yeah into long pieces like making wires on the ends and then you could like use my stuff on yeah he didn't he actually worked unlike other people you know who would just quit their day job and just around going full-bore he continued working at the Pennsylvania Railroad for I think it was up to like a decade while he was doing this building up his his side rubber band business which Alliance if people probably notice where he was from at the liance is actually the biggest rubber band manufacturer in the world today so by 1944 is when it really started to UM to really pick up any or opened a second Factory so at this point he had quit his day job and he'd open a second Factory and then he designed a patent in 1957 an even better of the Alliance rubber band which is sort of the world world rubber band standard today and they they make over 14 million pounds of rubber bands per year nowadays the Alliance rubber company but all this newspaper inspiration just people newspapers blown away in the wind and that is the main part of our thing but we have a bonus fact today just because the episode is not long enough ya know or not random enough so a lot of people independently invented the silly putty but there was actually a few people that did it but one James Wright is generally given the credit for actually inventing it because he is the one who invented the one that was ultimately popularized we have silly putty in the UK but I don't think I've ever had it really used to be able to do you could do all sorts of like you're like bound it's like a bouncy ball obviously stick things um NASA used it for a while before velcro to stick things and there's like I think like Apollo 8 or something they brought a posse that you can form into shapes yeah you can forma shapes it bounces but all in the old days you could also do newspapers or page at certain pages you could put it on there lift it off an ink would come off on the thing and then you could press the thing on a piece of paper and make a copy like it's like it's versatile you can do cool yeah you can't always do that nowadays because they use different inks and stuff now than they used to I think it can still be done sometimes but it doesn't quite work as well I think on most cases but II used to I used one that I really wanted as a kid and it was it was like silly putty but if you smashed it with a hammer or like smashing on a surface it would break like like glass now and then I don't think together like you could imagine back together it was just some sort of weird property of it oh I've never tried that silly putty so I wouldn't think anything is that one but that's kind of cool yeah I found it's cool so 1943 how did he come up with it he was working for general electrics new in their New Haven Connecticut lab and so they were obviously allies were super short on rubber cuz Japan hadn't made us and made it various rubber producing countries cific rim so there was a rubber shortage and they need it for war efforts so US government was just like throwing money at the problem giving major companies like hey we need a synthetic rubber and we need it like now budgeted yeah but just hears infinite supply make it because we really need this and so that one of his attempts he mixed boric acid with silicon oil and it came up with silly putty and he couldn't actually figure out he called it a nutty putty um so he can figure out a name isn't it yeah I think so well look at how it became silly putty in a moment but um see he couldn't figure out any use for it you tried all sorts of stuff can so then he sent samples off all over to scientists all over the world allied sciences obviously um and and say like could you can you can you figure this out like is there a way to make because it is kind of a rubber like product and is there away something additive or can you is there another you know useful useful and nobody could come up with anything and so for six years it's sort of languished from 1943 to 1949 and obscurity but but parties it was like a party thing cocktail parties like if you could get a hold of it like if you were one of the people other samples or you know making it local they're at their little lab which we'll get into later some of 3m stuff the 3m labs like the cool stuff and they just they just play with like at the labs they have so much such cool products that they just sort of play with it you know that some of them eventually became big things but they were see the way so this zoo and the post-it notes and almost it knows person else is super interesting how many years it took for that to become a thing but yeah so yeah so people would play with it credible when you think about it compared to all other glues that you know about yeah there was this useless product that ever it was again a situation like that where is like hey what can we do with this and like nothing it's a crappy glue like you can't do anything with it and even when he did figure out you could do something with it it still management was like now that's stupid even though internally it was used within the company quite a bit and then when they released it nobody wanted it they thought it was stupid but anyways that's a story for another day so eventually at one of these parties when ruse Sal get her she is a toy store owner called the the toy store was the block shop and she was like hey I went along with a 1 Peter Hodgson which was a marketer hey we'll put this in my toy catalog and we'll sell it and we'll call it bouncing putty and it actually ended up being the second best selling item in her catalog behind Crayola Crayons a yeah it gets brought around even more in a bit but um yes so Hutchins at the time was deeply in debt twelve thousand dollars in debt will get there one hundred and seventy six thousand dollars today that's how much in debt this guy was and so he decides to buy more of this putty and he wants to also buy so he borrows money to then by the production rights through it and he renames the silly putty and so he then hires yale college students because it's around Easter at the time so he hires them to put it in eggs and this is why silly putty is always almost always sold him in little plastic eggs because it was around Easter when he first wanted to market he was going to sell it for a dollar each and he got they ended up getting the talk of the town New York article published on it which helped a reasonably goes to Easter and it became like huge nationwide 250,000 units sold in the first three days which were stuff how do you go from nothing to manufacturing 250,000 units yeah like when those orders roll in weight you know yo college students I guess so and then first first year he sold susta kegs where'd you get all the actual rules how did this guy he may have been a marketer but he also clearly had some sort of like cuz yeah that's hard them there's a scale up and six million units in the first year at a dollar and egg and just put that in perspective that's eighty-six million dollars today in today's money of gross sales in his first year so he's not in debt anymore and so silly putty ultimately purchased by none other than Binney & Smith in 1977 a year after Hutchinson died yeah and so taya Crayola company right yeah Crayola company and so yeah they purchase silly putty in 1977 and Hodgins net worth upon his death was about a hundred and forty million dollars today almost solely based on silly putty that's about seven hundred million dollars in today's money wait so 140 million then seven hundred yeah then and then seven hundred million dollars today is what that is mostly I'm silly putty on just a few decades of silly putty sales as what he had and that is our show today legends dude this broad this guy's ending was a lot happier I know yeah and he didn't but again he's not the guy who made the silly putty in the first place thing I invented it he's just a marketer who came along and saw the potential of it and you know made it happen ideas are a dime a dozen yeah implement it and and honestly executing to go from 0 to 250 3,000 units in 3 days I mean 6 million units that said that's kind of impressive a little bit yeah I say he deserves that 700 million yeah I suppose it's a simple thing you got plastic eggs people probably easily bought in mass especially around Easter and then it's not like the products used to make silly putty or you know rare or anything and easily mixed so I mean that still is the delicious logistics of it all impressive weight so just the maths on that right so he's got three days to produce I mean presumably he bought like he had like I'm sure he didn't think he was gonna sell 250,000 so I'm sure he didn't pre make that many so yeah but so if you um let's say it took him a day to realize it was going to be incredibly popular from that needs to be making 86 and minutes well yeah getting people the package and put the buddy and everything yeah that's crazy incredible alright um everybody if you thing to do also oh why not support our show in a different way if you want to do that as well is to leave us a review once we get to a thousand reviews on American iTunes we're going to go through all of the iTunes and all of the various different podcast apps not all of the tiny ones that no one's ever heard of but the big ones and we're gonna choose someone to randomly win an Amazon gift out of a thousand dollars to celebrate the thousand reviews so that's all we're gonna do leave us a review honest review however you feel this show does that's what we would like well I know we'd like a five-star review but good helpful feedback is also good even if it is faster definitely um yeah that's our show I really hope you enjoyed it we'll be back shortly at some point this month I guess yeah and we have a we have a way we're gonna try to make it so it's like a regular thing which we'll announce at some point yes that would be good we'll announce that coming very soon and thank you everybody for listening and watching depending on how you consume its content
