has anyone ever just been looking into the murky depths of a toilet bowl and talked to themselves why is my poop brown I mean broccoli isn't brown and then of course you stop to yourself because you know as if you even eat broccoli so your poo and yes your poo is made up about 3/4 water and 1/4 solid matter roughly a third of that solid matter is dead bacteria another third is made up of food matter that your body can't digest such as cellulose 1/10 to 1/5 is cholesterol and other fats another 110 to 1/5 is inorganic substances including them including calcium phosphate and iron phosphate and a small teeny tiny amount is protein so cell debris from the intestinal tract is also in your poo as our other things such as dead white blood cells or leukocytes but all of that much normally gets you a grayish color so where did the brown come from the brown color is due to action in your gut on bilirubin and just interested you don't want already know bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is produced from the breakdown of worn-out red blood cells to be specific it's from the breakdown of M which is a component of haemoglobin bilirubin is really really really attracted to plasma proteins such as albumin so it binds to them in your blood it is transported in your blood to your liver where it becomes conjugated to form bilirubin dye greek or a night on excreted in your bile bile is a really important fluid that is secreted from your liver with really important functions it helps break down fats in your small intestine so you can absorb them it also helps you get rid of cholesterol it protects you from enteric so intestinal infections by excreting Aiki and Salaam Tory cytokines on a stimulate your innate immune system and then testing I mentioned IgA so just so you know IgA is the main immunoglobulin or antibody found in mucus secretions including tears saliva sweat colostrum and secretions from the GI tract prostate and respiratory epithelium so the lining of your airway tract anyways bilirubin is conjugated in your liver and has been secreted as vile into your small intestine the bacteria in your gut hydrolyze south breakdown with water the conjugated bilirubin die quick or a night to urobilinogen some of which is reabsorbed and then appears in the urine the rest of the urobilinogen converted into sterile belly no Jun which itself is oxidized to sterile villain and it is a spherical bone that makes you poop brown but if you really want to be basic about it you could say I guess that poop is brown you to the breakdown of worn out red blood cells but you know Starkel billon this video the link in the description below and start learning today
