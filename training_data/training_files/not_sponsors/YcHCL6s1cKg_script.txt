um you do have like child I think this is funny like like harnesses for child seats yeah in the backseat giant branding on it too yeah if you want to like take your kids around and eat around the neighborhood and with can you can do it nothing's gonna stop you except maybe the police yeah I mean if you want to get rid of your kids as fast as possible to get them to school just dump them there how about you make them as good allies and like as kill them well no wow that's dark you know I was thinking it's um like lose custody of that like oh yeah it was only code like yeah I was only averaging 120 officer X likely they weren't in any danger [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome welcome welcome we're doing a fun one this is pretty fun I like it Mercedes c63 AMG it's rare to me that head on to a car is my favorite angle I think it might be my favorite angle privacy or not agree I think the backside of this is all right look at alright the front side is menacing is that straight up menacing looking it's big it's scary its aggressive yes enormous like ducts and the front splitter and it was by judging the outside that both of us in correctly guessed how expensive this car is yeah or rather how inexpensive it is what was your guess I guess was a hundred and seventy thousand dollars yeah mine was not that high mine was still over six fingers though I guess that this was maybe gonna be like 100 or 110 and what is this wrong in this car brand new base price of this is sixty eight thousand seven hundred fifty USD that's a bargain to me for a car that looks this good and with the AMG branding that's a reasonably price it's pretty reasonable and you can trick all your friends into thinking that you have bought a much more special you're the bigger gangster than you really are yet tricked all of us yeah that's for sure three two one that active exhaust sixty Wow yeah that felt about like four seconds or yeah I love that exhaust okay so that as you can see on my face probably that started out slow and yeah it just like hey it takes a second and then the turbo spools up and you're gone yeah when the turbo spools up oh man I love it I love it and when they're people around you to turn on stealth exhaust and then you reckon up like undercover incognito business sedan exactly nobody even looks at it [Music] Mercedes I think is as a brand is almost interesting because I think Mercedes just without factoring in AMG does make cars for boring old people sorry I'm generally sorry but not about anything wrong against old people but specifically boring oh I feel like is what Mercedes generally are made for the kind of where it might be sensible sure like responsible p.m. exactly yeah they're like Lexus what AMG the cars are something different they are it's a different beast it's interesting they took a luxury brand and made it like an angry beast brand yes there's a lot to talk about in this car because it's just I really like it it feels like a muscle car it is little so car yeah if you like turbo v8 if you like a muscle car because it is this is German muscle yeah I love ok this like it's called like casino crate or something like that it's a nice satin gray you can get it on any Mercedes color and it is an expensive option well car or color car okay no color you can make sense it is a expensive color on any Mercedes car or got it I don't know exactly how much it is on this car but I know on the wagon the e63 AMG wagon it's like a several thousand dollar paint job Wow which like I mean I think it's worth it I think it's worth it it's cool this stands out it's not matte which I think I helped cheap sometimes it's a nice set and there's still a little bit of shine it's pretty plush in here it's pretty nice I think it feels the price yeah they may they did nice materials where it counts like the seats are really nice and comfortable yeah nice and leather center console is pretty nice it looks really nice but if you touch it some of this stuff is not as plush as it's the cheapest is right here yeah there's you hear this right now that's like scratching and like the shearing column by Z is like yeah McDonald's toy plastic it is yeah it's very plastic and very cheap feeling and a lot of this area here around the lower part of the - it's very cheap upper part it's quite nice it has like stitching in it and it feels very nice it's soft to us and touch at least it's not super yeah thick but it's at least a little bit squishy fake wood here yeah which is a nice touch I mean it looks good that wood there they've got it on the door panel here they've got the nice big premium speakers here with the brand-new audio system in here is pretty good like I said it feels the price the infotainment system is standard in there sadie's it's I don't know how do you describe it all so it's kind of weird like I don't know spaceship looking dial things so you've got this control here that it's like a multi gesture thing you can you can shift it up and down left and right but you can also turn it to select things and press it down you got a boost gauge for your turbo yep you do got a boost gauge and it also conveniently it shows you the speed limit and when you start speeding it starts flashing at you like hey guy take it easy Bay the law have you no respect back seats are pretty usable mostly I am 5 foot 8 - you're 5 9 yeah right like that so I fit actually pretty comfortably in the back seat here as a 5 foot 8 person yeah even when the seat is back I still have like a reasonable amount of legroom it's not like a huge amount but it's decent however I would say if you are a little taller I feel like 5 10 or above it may be a little tight yeah the Headroom is gonna be a little I think that's gonna be the bigger problem in the leg room because we have tons of leg room in the front here like I could move my seat up a long way and get people in the back a lot of legroom yeah if you're tall there's nothing you can do about it because I mean the way this car is swept the lines on this thing is like a fastback so it the Headroom falls off pretty quickly AMG and Mercedes just does this cool thing I think where they show you like it's hand crap and like they show you the engineer the name of the engineer that handcrafted it how about this one it's Andrew something something German it's very very script it's in cursive it's also it's cursive and it's German and so we were both like Mauser huh Schweitzer so it's something like that started SCH sure I think dude you have 10.5 cubic feet of cargo space very precise so I reckon I am about I don't know nine point five cubic feet because it was a bit of a squeeze to get in there but I did fit and you do have an escape button back there which is nice it lights up when the door closes a window that pops up so again if you're getting kidnapped AMG [Music] first impressions I love the steering wheel yeah the sphere wheels really nice in your hand it's super comfy it's really pretty too yet this whatever this material is it's very grippy I can see that probably it gets a little sticky I would yeah but yeah I think Mercedes makes some of the coolest steering wheels and the biz yeah it's really nice it's squared off at the bottom it's very driver focus yeah very drivers century ah one thing I did notice your paddles are attached to the steering wheel not the column that's true not a fan one thing I didn't mention though on the steering wheel is like the digital display is that was kind of cool well I've never seen a steering wheel that has like LCDs on it there's this comfort oh yeah didn't come for it we're gonna do this one a sport+ whoo you hear that yeah it gets a little bit more rumbly oh man JT this is gonna be a little more heavy yeah alright that's right today turbo come on [Music] yeah that was a lot a career yeah I don't know how much faster it was if but it felt louder felt more expressive it felt more emotional yeah I don't know if that felt quicker like you said necessarily I think that felt about the same amount of speed but the noise yeah was so much angrier and louder I like that I like that a lot I thought was cool so for zero to sixty times whatever mode you're in it's gonna be about the same and I feel like yeah just driving around I don't know I'd probably keep it in sport or Sport+ just because it's the exhaust oh yeah the exhaust sounds good too it's sounding v8 engine it's angry it's cool all the different modes you good I like it and it's right here on your steering wheel I like that a lot that's clever I haven't seen that in any other car Jules everything was just your steering wheel yeah you've got buttons here for suspension and exhaust which are also have a little digital displays that's really cool yeah I like it I like not having to take your hands off the steering wheel you've got your volume we've got call hang-up answer yep it's pretty cool everything you need is all in the wheel some of the performance specs on this this has a four liter v8 biturbo engine inside of it that's made it to a nine speed MCT transmission yeah automatic yes a 9 speed automatic mc2 it'd be weird to see one of these in manual 469 horsepower and 479 pound feet of torque that's pretty good I mean for a business sedan 2-door sedan yeah it's not really sedan I think AMG stops being like a business yeah like AMG cars start being like it is ass undercover sports car yeah it really is like they're undercover sports cars that's exactly right for this person who wants to maintain their status symbol but not look like it's one like you eraser yes it's exactly that when you want to maintain the look of I am a responsible business person yeah it's on the weekends lately a boy or girl racer yeah anyway if you look on me you probably shouldn't care about it but if you do well JT tries to distract me as hard as false I'm asking you this answer you get 17 mpg in the city 26 mpg on the highway with premium unleaded yes so it's expensive to run you should expect that yeah you know if you're gonna get to this it's gonna be expensive to run maintenance costs are gonna be expensive like upkeep is gonna be expensive fuel is gonna be expensive but if you're trying to door if you're dropping almost 70 K on a car you probably shouldn't care you prob yeah like you're you should probably be okay with that also man this really does remind me of like Camaros at Mustang yeah it feels like a muscle car it's really cool like I'm pretty confident with I'm very confident in straight lines around the turns not bad not yeah it was a little Wiggly there when I when I accelerated out of the turn but I'll take it it's better than the Mustang more comfortable I think it sounds just as good unpopular opinion the exhaust note on the v8 Mustangs the GTS kind of bothers me now really yeah I think it's a little too raspy how do you put it be like I like this or like the exhaust of this yeah this one's not it's not like 150 decibels it's loud ish it's crumbly yeah it's very vocal but it's not gonna blow out the eardrum stop answers by crazy crazy yeah it's cuz you don't need to flex on people I mean you kind of flex on people with your Mustang g/t like hey I got a fast loud car it's almost true with those cars you flex with the noise with this you flex with the looks yeah yeah like that looks expensive and it does look expensive so you can just cruise past people and not feel the need to blast them with your exhaust note yeah but you kind of can you still can feel that wiggle yeah Jose yeah I'm definitely a little I'm a little shook yes if that is the thing I would doc it a little bit before handling because of that because if you can't give it its full throttle if you can't stomp it what's the point what's the point yeah and I mean I guess it's for its to be fun for the responsible adult yeah ooh I don't want to push it any harder that would be irresponsible because it warns them it Wiggles a little bit before it does anything serious yeah this isn't this kind of car isn't built for someone our age really I mean you'd buy it someone a little bit older mid 30s maybe 40 years old but I really like this I would buy this I buy this over an alpha oh yeah absolutely the only I've done it I love the 4c yeah but that's a different beast in time I would get this over the Giulia Quadrifoglio I'm gonna say Julie is trash you know the Quadrifoglio is a little more expensive than this even I think the portfolio's like in the 70s I don't like it yeah well we haven't written the Quadrifoglio that's not fair a suit we restored the regular Julia yeah assuming it rides like is as comfortable as and is designed as the base model I won't like it yeah but it was supremely uncomfortable I would say that I would take this one other thing that I would like to point out is the roof here is almost like cold glass let's put that thing back on allow alright well I think that's probably about everything yeah everything anything is so look at the ratings - the ratings okay so we're starting out with performance pretty good I think it's pretty good pretty solid here to 60 3.8 seconds which is pretty speedy handling pretty capable very capable it does get a little squirrely if you're stomping it in the curbs seven that's about what I was thinking - actually as a seven yeah I don't know get right on the mark there was so much higher than that yeah I don't want to go too much higher it's like obviously there's cars that are way better performers but I think it's seven that's pretty respectable for those yeah next up practicality pretty good for any average I would go with a five yeah practicality I like I mean it works but like I think you're probably right with that one yeah I'm gonna go to five as well five yeah I think it's pretty it's like an app right down the middle it's what you expect when you get into a car yeah everyone gets cupholders everyone gets side pockets yep it's just it's just a car yeah basically all right next up is value which also pretty good well yeah I think it's pretty good for sixty eight thousand seven hundred fifty at the base price of this I think that's a pretty good deal yeah probably you're getting and I'm gonna give it a seven seven I think it's a high value man yeah to get into AMG comfortable Lyle pretty fast responsive yeah relatively luxurious yeah I think it's I think it's a seven wow that's a little higher than I'd give it my reasoning is largely bowing to the fact that Mercedes always depreciate like bricks yeah they depreciate so hard I'm gonna give it a five on value yeah nothing like it's decent but it's still gonna depreciate a lot and so I can give it too much higher than that then cool factor I think what's this paint job I think it's really cool I think it's cool doesn't have tracked like a massive amount of attention but I do think it is cooler than average height give it a six yeah uncool factor it's like it's cool but not like the bee's knees kind of cool I'm gonna give it a six and a half I think honestly I'd probably probably a whole point of that is to paint all right next up is quality which is a mixed bag it is and yeah there's parts that are very nice and then there's parts that are very cheap feeling on the inside it is a bit of a back here would you prefer that it was all one level when do you prefer that the lows were brought up in the mid and the high stuff was brought down to like a medium level of quality or do you prefer I think I prefer it the way it is yeah honestly I do prefer like that it has some things that are very like exceptionally nice it's like the clock here and the leather trim on the - I think I'd agree seeds the seeds are amazing - I think of our very high quality I think I'll go with the seven oh wow on quality of the interior I think it's nice yeah I think it's a nice interior yeah I was gonna give it a 6 and a half okay because there's some chintzy stuff where there shouldn't be I think like the door panels yeah but other than that I think it's really nice yep I would agree all right and then the final thing is fun factor I've had a blast direction so I think this thing's are riot I got so much fun I think it's fine you know I'm gonna go with a 7 I think yeah I'm gonna go to 7 and 1/2 7 I think this is a blast paddles have are hit or miss for me like if you don't have great paddle shifters the car is just a dud and it's no fun at all to drive but these are so precise yeah I love it the paddles are very precise it feels very just quick with all that being said let's get to the average rating movement and the results are in the average score out of 60 is a thirty eight point two five that's pretty good which i think is quite good I think a lot of that owes to the fact that this is I mean all if you say a lot of fun reasonably practical and relatively well bridle it simply well priced I think for the performance on level you get out of this yeah this thing I don't want to give this back and I don't say that every time you don't say it every time but you have said it before I said that with the model 3 which I was with the first electric car I'd ever driven yeah about the last did not about the the model that I did about the Corvette I believe yeah it was it's this the Corvette in the model 3 and I think this is somewhere between those two yeah no I think I'd agree that's right oh man all right so we're gonna send you guys off with a couple of eats through these turns will be safe don't worry we're never breaking the speed you never bring the speed limit and we do recommend this I believe both of us do recommend this car if you got the money if you got the money thinking about it absolutely I would really recommend this car I've had a blast you will too end of story and a story of fury a.m. go by c63 awesome great car yep send it off there we go thank you for watching see you in the neck [Music] give it a try by signing up using the link below we promise you'll love it
