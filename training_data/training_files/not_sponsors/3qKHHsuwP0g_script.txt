hey guys welcome back to another video today able to show you something really cool we made a fully automatic self sustainable tree form so fully automatic means the player doesn't need to do anything like placing fungus or breaking blocks machine does at all and self-sustainable means we don't need to supply any bone meal because the machine produces it itself net of course uses the new mechanic of edit the snapshot of a decay now compost those nazimod blocks so basically you generated a tree compost most of the network blocks and get both my back so I can grow a new tree alright so here we are on the cycle of snapshot server yesterday there was a 12 hour session designing the farm a couple of people got on it we had some efforts helping process NLS and also k10 de Canada also released some crimson and warped fungus three films on his channel already so I also checked it out there's a link in the description right I just want to show a little bit of the progress we made so we started over here in this area and slowly after bit of brainstorming the farm took shape first we thought maybe when only two it 11 high suppose less effort but then we went for a full height of the farm so 27 highest the fungus tree could generate and then we went through several iterations of the farm always improved some things changed it up some of the modules also broccoli clone it over and over again and after a little bit of journey we will arrive at the fracking version so you had a swamp biome synced and he had splits up and we got a couple of failed versions and we should arrive at the one with the nice house next to it that nns pelts yep that's the working version i just turn on the farm and try to explain things as they're happening so first thing we do is we bone meal the middle Nydia block once then we check if he get a fungus and try to pull me let it grow it into a tree alright let's do it in case it fails and we also have yeah turneth program okay the simply didn't get a fungus we only get the asanas appliances mostly rules also a wrong fungus type and we flushed it away let me try again we both need one block in the middle of the severe actually got twisting whines all right not this happened this actually doesn't happen very often but it's also not an issue okay now the whole piston wall starts and if you just spend some TNT there's a clear case of the showcase effect I'll just to take what trick quick so we can see maybe a tree growing it's what we came here for okay get the top we got TNT system trying to explain it a bit later and there we go this time we worked we got a tree okay I tell you got this piston wall here pushing the whole tree over so we can blow it up with the teensy system you the top that was designed by Kay tender alright so we blow it up from bottom to top so the items can fall down sometimes if you lose a couple of items because tool Anand rocks lower but should get most of them and we also have to yes dispensed in tea too covered up to 27 blocks high that somewhat maximum height a tree can grow to I also discussed if you only mu should here limited to a height of 12 or 13 or so because most of the trees will only grow to this height it's only like a 1 in 12 chance didn't retrieve the tree was grow here in that but in the end decided to just break all the blocks in order to get a maximum amount of all mid-back alright so yeah now we were trying to grow the next fungus the 7th didn't work NASA plans are flushed and also I can collect it by the water stream yeah and this time pH got a really high to be is this a maximize almost 25 high so that's why we also eat response tint here up till they are because you never know how Hydra tree can grow you have some plans or ideas how to do a tree high detection but we just wanted to get a working version first right so the items that are broken get collected by the water stream here at the bottom and then B is sort out the locks and shroom light locks if I don't filters there and all the rest is going into the composter so all the water blocks and also D yet to the plants we get from ball milling I liam and yeah we get actually more porn mill out then we put in so here we feed the ball mill back to the dispensers they try to grow the fungus and on will deny Liam de flutter the plus you make is collected by this hopper here that's just a wool block so we can check how much you actually get using carpet mod we also ran a long a test in order to figure out how many items we get approximately power so over thousand minutes of testing and me getting around hundred thirty-six room lights power and fire phone and what stem blocks the results for a crimson variant are pretty much the same so we also get to see one of room lights and what stems but a bit less bomyeo so if the Warped variant we get 225 for me power crimson a bit less I think the reason is that if a crimson fungus treats that some of the water blocks are replaced by the weeping vine and this way we get fewer what blocks and fewer boomer does also disadvantage when using the Warped and eylem you've seen it right in the beginning you grew some twisting vines that something that very rarely happens but it's also wasting some bone meal because you can actually or merely the twisting wine and it's also interacts with tree detection that we have so if you don't get a fungus then we just flush but if you get a fungus then we activate a piston wall the way we protect if you have grown a fungus is by checking if we used bone meal so actually got two separate bone meal systems the first line of hoppers feeds the dispenser this is under the middle million block and the rest is hooked up to this hopper line here this supplies all the dispensers with bone meal and also the hoppers in the back are filled so if one of those dispensers can bonemeal one of the fungus then this hopper here for short moment is not filled up completely which we detect using the comparator here and this way the Advocate can detect if a fungus tree has grown and that then basically starts the flying piston wall and also the TNT system at the top there's one more interesting topic we need to discuss so not only is this farm fully automatic so it doesn't require a play and you buy it actually only works if the player isn't nearby the reason is the Warped nigh Liam or a crimson item can be converted back into NASA rec so that happens if there's another block on top of it and then if it's getting ran on tickets it could turn into nazarenko so similar like grass block turning into a dirt block but this would only happen relative based and those random ticks only happen when a certain radius around the player disco changed the microphone point nine there the venom takes happens in the complete render distance and now it's only radius of approximately 100 to 28 blocks around the player so actually in order to run the farm without issues you would need to stand about 150 blocks away to be on a safe side so instead of turning on directly here hope you recommended to just have a yeah red furnace line hundred fifty blocks away and safely turn it on from there and this way you can basically prevent that an item would ever turn into nazar√© of course we were also discussing making a version that would deal with the nigh Liam conversion into Nazarite by converting it back into 9 looms we can do it by bone milling and ezarik if there's a Nydia block nearby in a 3x3 area would be converted back into now Liam but there are some issues with that which basically made the farm less efficient we would have need to sacrifice you know one of the rows here in the middle and then would be kind of a problem that also fit in the additional dispensers that would only deny Liam either from the side or from the bottom you can see here the bottom is all right quite filled up with papas would resupply all the dispensers and drop us there so we decided to use three rows of 19min stead and ya have a Russian we just need to stand away but it still works fine in case you do that it's actually so important to have three rows of my Liam to get a maximum amount of fungus for a pokemen attempt on deny Liam if you would for example only have a single block they would need to boil up to twenty times something that range until we finally get a fungus so you would spread away my bone meal and then he would get back so ideally of course you would have twenty five ninety and blocks there we yeah can't get off a fungus at and try to pull mill everything there but yeah the first working concept ahead was fifteen he already have some ideas how we could actually do it of 25 to be more be a bone meal efficient but it will also have some downsides of course so I'm super happy of course that we finally have a working version took a lot of time to get there but we also have some ideas how to improve the design for example instead of using the expandable to web small cross and maybe try to design a custom solution that requires a bit less effort towards justice design here it is infinitely expandable as you could make it larger or smaller but if you make a custom one it could be a bit less effort then here also some ideas how to do a three high detection but on the other hand is still in the snapshots and things are changing all the time example in previous snapshot versions the fungus trees grew up to nine white but this version is only seven white so a tree would actually grow nine one would be a problem for this form because if you would have have fungus on this end and in this end in both of them generates seven nine procs in a row there would be some overlap but it totally would have certain blocks in a row and the Pistons obviously can only push twelve sort of machine would break so we kind of be careful now to not put too much effort into making the perfect form already here because things are changing really quick and didn't there that's one way to get burn out if every snapshot a farm breaks one way or another so at the moment we're super happy with this form case one point sixteen and this constant was still working I mean probably gonna show a bit better version and also provided by download and maybe a tutorial alright that's it for today hope you enjoyed this video thanks a lot for watching and see you next time goodbye [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music]
