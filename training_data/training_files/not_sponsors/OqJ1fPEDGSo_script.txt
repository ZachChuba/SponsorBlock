this video is sponsored by - Lane full disclosure I was supposed to have a completely different video out today but everything went wrong with it ah another story for another time I've got to get a video out today and I don't have anything ready well this is a new one you know when you occasionally have those weird repressed childhood memories of things you did such as me one of those popped up when I woke up this morning I had either completely forgotten about it or the very least had not thought about it for like I don't even know let me check 18 years viewers of my greatest wops will know that I am a huge fan of the video game Shenmue which was released in late 1999 I was 9 years old when I first played it probably 10 by the time of our story so I was a member of Shenmue dojo which was like this online Shenmue message board these were before the days of social media if you wanted to talk to people you had to go on forums I don't think it was technically old enough to go on those but whatever so there was this guy I don't even know his name anymore he was working on this Shenmue fan game called Shenmue zero it was a video game prequel to the original Shenmue story he was looking for people to voice characters in this game he was making the game's main character Ryo in this iteration was like eight years old and he needed somebody to voice the character I was ten and I had one of those like stick microphones that came with Windows 95 so I thought sure I'll audition and I got the part I recorded my lines on the terrible little microphone it was like this it didn't have like a windscreen or anything so you were supposed to talk into it like this but to avoid plosives i had to hold it up kind of like a phone i remember recording my lines holding the microphone like this and he put the voice in the game i voiced a video game character when I was 10 I think I don't know this might be like one of those weird self conjured memories in which case this video is going to be about that phenomenon we'll see I'm gonna have to do some investigation we're going to fire the desktop up and do some searching a low battery warning you don't have any script for this video has to be out today working without a net folks okay so the first thing I need to search let's just do shin zero I think that's what it was called let me see here here's the old site it's a tripod site yup here it is Shenmue zero is a fan game made for the PC developed by tension soft this game is not in official title but is still good to have if you are a Shenmue fan the graphics are not good the voice acting it's a really short game but it's Shenmue and it's free from file planet is they even still around okay download now let me see if I can find this all the download links dead ok so what do I do now you see let me see here we go download link click this the image is not found thing is making me a little nervous nope that's not working either dead there are like no links of this this is gonna be an anti climactic video if I cannot figure out how to get ahold of this game at least I know that the game exists and it's not a figment of my imagination there's like a few people who like me remember this thing but they can't find it oh here we go here's a mega link is this gonna work though huh ah no longer available ok here's one at the very end maybe maybe this will work hey it works ok ok ok see this I can't wait I'm so stoked ok Shenmue 0 application and it's like this is a virus he'll me don't run it run anyway and some installation files are corrupt please download a fresh copy this whole thing seems really fishy I don't know I need to download direct plays like when you it's like when you watch an old video and it tells you it needs to download RealPlayer 7 I skip no DirectX setup I don't want the being barred see this is why what remember when I made fun of Linux said that was a dumb operating system ok it needs like old archaic plugins so I need to find an old archaic computer to run it off of luckily I have an old archaic laptop also known as my current laptop I bought this laptop for 150 dollars at Walmart five years ago this is installing way slower I'm really nervous now I really this is gonna be really embarrassing I'm pretty sure I did this I don't think I'm making this up I'll be able to know when I hear the voice for the first time Smurfs okay I'm so excited I should not have hit escape I accidentally hit escape okay but you sound directed by you shucks ooh okay here we go the opening cutscene now unless this is all a weird figment of my imagination when the character Rio appears and he speaks that should be 10 year old me the anticipation is killing me any hard [Music] in order to be able to do this move you will have to concentrate all of your abilities and focus on all parts of your body and trust them I will demonstrate only in washing area I bet you can't ever be at this your father nobody except you're always boiling it so do that'll be the day your dad's beaten I agree with you there no fight for yourselves that's me that's totally me the other guys a much better actor than I was maybe maybe oh look at the walking cycle I'm having like all these weird memories flashing back like I remember from the script there was like some kind of leaf raking minigame I think I just got stuck in the leaves nope here we go look at these textures I mean that sky mat up there's a little funky but still look at this I mean this is a game that was made in like 2000 I've voiced this character but I never actually got to play the game because my computer was too slow to play it and that's ironic because now my computer is too new to play I need nothing stopping me from being the best that I can be and someday I hope I'm just as good as you are it's my father who's a real champ he's never lost I've ever seen I'm kind of slurring my words I need to work on enunciation good morning you oh so cringy you have something for me father yes I want you to take this rake to rake the leaves of course okay so here's the this is the arcade it looks a little bit different but it's it's got the sliding doors I wonder if they'll actually open up here we go look at that yeah look looks pretty similar to the arcade in the original game is you can play pong you can play ultimate Racer Z let's play ultimate racer z or okay it's mines okay the end we're playing mines now apparently I just collect these things pretty ambitious you've got a mini game in the fan game okay something I noticed right off the bat it does not make sense why is my score it says time left up top of my score at the bottom is going down that needs to be reversed right like he meant to put time left on the bottom oh I crashed here we go cutscene cutscene do you not look so cool look at this I'm loving the cinematography there's a love interest okay I'll be done in no time at all I'll be done in no time at all oh I think you should know something there's a man outside laying to see woloson see he says that if he doesn't see him we'll do something that will regret you want my father you'll have to get through me first you big bully that's a pretty serious that's about as good as my voice acting God back then oh this a QTE son sure hahaha should reavoice this yeah yeah little little karate move over there yeah why do you think that man came from my father yesterday I thought I heard him say something about a mirror he could go buy one for only as cheap as 300 yen at one of the local shops huh maybe he was too worried about his appearance spin off his money on a fancy smancy suit and needed to see what you look like oh boy well this was a weird trek down memory lane I don't even know what to say I don't know who made this game I don't know if there's any way to contact him so there is I'm really happy that I was not like imagining that that happened I was pretty sure as you get older you tend to like forget these things but every now and then they just kind of like pop up and I woke up this morning and I was like I'm pretty sure this happened but I wanted to make sure and now we have thanks for coming along on the journey with me see ya this video started today [Music]
