hey what is going on you guys it is mr no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new loot video for you all today so today i bring you loot from 10 hours of vire watch sentinels and the goal for this video is without a doubt to receive as many blood shards as possible because as you can see on screen there at a current price of 6.5 million this 10 hour could prove to be one of the most profitable yet alongside that we can expect a lot of hard clue scrolls a decent amount of strength xp and a very laid back afk experience but before we get into this to mecharina for sponsoring today's video all right now that that is completed ladies and gentlemen 10 hours of firewatch sentinels so i've done a video on these before a couple years ago i did kill 3000 of them i probably wasn't a couple years ago because these were released into the game june 4th 2020. so still relatively new and in that 3 000 kill experience i did make a lot of money and it was very afk and even though i did say in that previous video that the price of a blood shard would crash because so many people kill these things actually stayed pretty stable around six to seven mil for quite a while now so i'm really hoping to get as many blood shards as possible in these ten hours these firewatch sentinels they're basically a stronger variant of the normal fire watch and you do have to complete sins of the father quest to reach this area it's a very annoying quest and this area in general is not liked by many people but it's worth doing definitely worth checking out if you do have the quest completed and if you're a big fan of slayer then you can purchase the ability to be assigned vampires and that's only 80 slayer points so that's why occasionally you will see people here with a slayer helmet but for this 10 hour grind i rarely did see that most of the people that i was running into were all in prayer gear not a great way to start the video receiving a dragon med helm which is about 1 in 12 000 much more rare than a blood shard so hopefully we don't see too many more of those and as we've already seen two clues girls you can expect level three also known as hard clue scrolls to be dropped from these fire watch sentinels i did save all of them towards the end of the video so you guys will see the loot from all the clue scrolls but i wanted to do that outside of the 10 hour grind so this way we could just see the profit made per hour without the clue scrolls can always come back to those after as this bank tab grows just like i mentioned before prayer gear is very important here i was using prosthelite as well as a max cape the max cape's essentially a prayer cape so my prayer points would go down twice as slow i think that's how that works and as well as this i was just using the main weapon for these firewatch sentinels and that would be the blister wood flail but you can also use an avandus flail it's just kind of up to you on that other gear that you can look at other than prostate light would be monk robes if you're gonna go all welfare or if you're just more of a fan of dps then you can just use bandos here and use the alter that is right south of the bank there's a very popular training location for your strength xp too because these vampire weapons are really just predominantly strength related so i was getting a lot of strength xp in this video i managed to hit 118 million truly have no life but that's all right and as it goes for the inventory setup other than the gear of course i was really just rocking the serodom and god sword and a super combat potion divine super combat potion serodom and godsword is definitely not necessary here because you do have all your hp you're never going to really get damaged because you're always going to be protecting from melee and there's also an altar south so you can use that at your own convenience the saradomin god sword does give you prayer back and it does give you hp back if you happen to run out of prayer so that is good but you're not going to be able to damage these fire watches with it so it's kind of up to you if you want to bring that personally i just like extending my inventories as long as i can without clicking the altar because i just like to be as most afk as i can so it really just comes down to your preference and if you can afford an sgs you do need to get the clothing set in order to use the bank here so just make sure to pick that up i think it's just found in a chest somewhere south of the town that shouldn't be too big of a deal i think the only hard part about this is just the quest that it takes to get to this location once you reach this location you will be rewarded i mean not only do they have a decent drop table but the price of the blood shard is still high and it's not that uncommon to receive drop rate of is only one in fifteen hundred and it's currently about six point four mil and the making of this video was about three days ago and it was at 6.7 mil so i mean it could be going down a little bit but i wouldn't worry too much there many people using these blood amulets blood furies whatever you want to call it which requires the shards so there's always going to be more people and more demand for this item which is probably why it's still stable in price i did receive a lot of weird rares during this video such as a roon two-hander a roon square shield even had a shield left half at one point which without a ring of wealth equipped that is 1 in 25 000 i mean you're always going to see those uncommon rare drops especially here for some reason it seemed like my luck was just not in the right place especially at the start and even five six hours into this video so far still no blood shards so i'm really hoping to still see that because without that the profit will still be there but not as much as it could be as you can see in the bank tab there's all sorts of different drops from these firewatch sentinels i'll be price checking everything at the end but i would mainly just focus on the runes as well as the coin stack those items make it so that you never have to bank as you can see there's multiple rune items such as the full helm kite shield dagger and all the uncommon rune items that you can get too so bringing a rune pouch here especially if you're on an alternate account or you're trying to afk it's really smart to bring high alks you guys know me i'm not a big fan of high alking anything we gotta pick up everything for the video so i wasn't doing that but i did see a lot of people here using high out so if you have a rune pouch make sure to bring that along i don't really think you need a herb sac or a gem bag the herbs and gems are very uncommon here as you've probably noticed by now in this video there's a lot of banking clips and that's because ladies and gentlemen there's only so many blood shards that you can get in a time span of 10 hours but here we are seven and a half no wait about eight hours total later into this video that we did receive our first shard price on the ground is 6.2 mil so i guess it went down more but yeah it does vary in price but either way eight hours later we did receive it i was very happy to see this because no matter what that's an easy 600k profit per hour the reason i know this is because there's minimal supply spin here the only thing i was ever using was divine super combat potions and that was only like one to two sips per inventory just depends if it's a five to ten minute trip so very minimal i don't even think i'll probably calculate the supply cost so that's awesome bloodshard guaranteed a ton of profit and ironically right after that we did receive that shield left half that i mentioned earlier my luck was just all over the place but that's okay as long as we got a shard i think that is the fourth one that i've had on this account total iron man still hasn't gotten one so i do need to work on that in the future but either way it's really nice to receive that and uh you know even in the bank they have a pet blood belt so i mean i don't know this location is just all sorts of surprises and speaking of my iron man account i was fishing infernal eels the whole entire time throughout this video so 10 hours of infernal eels matched with 10 hours of vire watch sentinels you can always multitask on multiple accounts while you're here i imagine most people are probably on multiple accounts if they are here because it's just so afk and you're really just standing in the same spot for minutes on end so it's really a benefit to be playing on multiple accounts in regards to the infernal eel video i'm actually doing 30 hours of that so you guys will see that probably in like a few days or so either way though here we are nine hours into the video getting a lot of things that are just not worth picking up as you can see and the banks have a lot of low level uh herbs a lot of low level seeds but i really wanted to try to pick up mostly everything to give you guys an idea of the loot that you can expect here especially without a blood shard tank tab will probably not be looking as full as mine was especially if you bring a herb sac and other things like that but either way it is really nice to see the variety of drops a lot of the bolt tips aren't really worth picking up either but the onyx bolt tips are occasional here those are always worth picking up well here we are ladies and gentlemen loot from 10 hours of firewatch sentinels has been completed in my experience it was very laid back i was really good strength xp and it was really good money so i'm gonna be the first one to recommend that anyone out there who wants to afk a monster and also get some decent strength xp come check out vira watch sentinels maybe use an alternate account maybe use your main or produce some slayer against vampires and maybe get lucky and get that shard even without that blood shard the drop table's decent and all these level three clue scrolls that we've acquired throughout this video which i believe was seven hard clues and all the kills that i did i was getting on average about 115 to 120 kills per hour so if you're looking at it like that you should receive a blood shard on average like every 15 hours or so something like that so that's really not too bad based on the drop rate and of course if you're lucky then you can always get one much sooner with all that being said let's go ahead and get into the price check see our overall profit from 10 hours of killing these fire watch sentinels we have over 1 000 dust banked which means i tried to pick up as much as i could but i you know you can only get so many anyway they're 520 gp each so don't be shy from them 3.2 mil from the very first price check not bad at all and now we move on to the second price check this is just the rest of all of the items i received i wanted to price check all the items without the bloodshard included so we just saw the overall profit without the bloodshard compared to with it either way the second price check does come out to be a steady one mil which means about 4.2 mil in total normal drops in 10 hours about 420k an hour now with that price of the shard at this current point in time 6.7 mil coming from that means if you add up all of the numbers we've seen 10.9 mil from 10 hours of firewatch sentinels and i'm still looking for my third h plate body from these hard clues 782 actually 783 overall completed and another 900k from the clue scrolls from this video so we'll just round that up to a mill and call it about 11.8 mil made in 10 hours time honestly a really relaxing experience i hope you guys check this place out if you're into the same thing and uh yeah thank you very much for watching i really appreciate the continued support guys and i will see you next time and until then mr no sleep out
