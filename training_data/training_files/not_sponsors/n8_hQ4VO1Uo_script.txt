downtown area when he noticed a vehicle make a sharp turn and cross over the double yellow line inside the vehicle were captain amanda cayton and lieutenant patrick hayton of the cincinnati police department officer salomon waited until the vehicle was in a safe location and initiated a traffic stop good evening hello you got your license insurance on real quick yeah all right reason i'm

said you were that's why she drove out she didn't she said that's why she drove home i said i know she drove home because she's not intoxicated you do what you got to do well here's now now here's the problem two is that you've got your gun on you where's that at it's on my hip nearly all states have legislated laws that forbid possessing a firearm while intoxicated and ohio is no exception ohio revised code 2923.15 states that no person while under the influence of alcohol or any drug of abuse shall carry or use any firearm or dangerous ordinance and anyone who violates this code is guilty of first-degree misdemeanor in 2016 oxford university researchers published a study in the epidemiologic reviews journal that examined 40 years of data relating to firearms and alcohol the study showed that over 33 of firearm violence decedents had consumed some amount of alcohol and over 25 percent of those victims had consumed an excessive amount of alcohol the study also noted that another large group of studies showed that alcohol was significantly associated with firearm use as a means of suicide the study also showed that the combination of alcohol and guns was statistically significant among self-inflicted firearm injury victims the researchers also highlighted a small group of studies that investigated the intersection of alcohol and firearms laws and alcohol outlets and firearm violence which showed that off-premise outlets selling takeout alcohol were significantly associated with firearm assaults although these statistics may seem staggering the researchers readily admit that more studies are needed and stated quote because the studies were restricted only to individuals with firearm injuries with no control groups these case series studies offer little guidance in terms of the actual relationship that might exist between alcohol use and firearm injury either from others or from oneself while the oxford researchers may have conducted one of the most comprehensive studies about the relationship between firearms and alcohol other studies have rendered similar results a 2015 study from the university of california found that death rates from alcohol-related gun violence were higher than those from car crashes and another study published in 1997 in the journal of the american medical association found that non-drinkers living in a home with alcohol users were at increased risk of homicide almost all of these studies have concluded that enforceable restrictions on firearm access because of alcohol misuse are uncommon and could offer a potential solution for driving down the numbers of alcohol-related firearm accidents and deaths all that said there are legitimate reasons for laws banning the possession of a firearm while intoxicated and police officers are subject to those laws it's on your hip okay all right miss amanda step out with me real quick okay just talk to me real quick and we'll go from there where do you work since i police department i know what what what district are you at i'm just transferred to inspections what's that inspections okay we live just down the street i understand that my hands are tied okay everything's recorded and that's you know you know the circumstances okay regardless i'm not charging you what regardless i'm not gonna charge you for the gun okay i'm not gonna do that to you here officer salomon informs captain katon that he does not intend to charge her for being in possession of a firearm while intoxicated and while officers are allowed to exercise a considerable degree of discretion in the field it is clear that officer salomon is affording captain katon a certain degree of leniency because she is a fellow officer very little is known about the crimes committed by members of law enforcement and that is mostly due to the fact that there are no agencies that keep records of this data researchers who wish to study police misconduct and criminal activity are constrained to certain methodologies including surveys field studies quasi experiments internal agency records and the investigative reports of various independent commissions delegated to report on this phenomena within particular jurisdictions in 2016 the department of justice funded a study that focused on determining the nature and extent of police crime in the united states as well as the incidence and prevalence of officer arrests the study looked at what factors influence how an agency responds to arrests of its officers to determine whether certain factors influence agency response and employment outcomes the study found that the fate of officers who are arrested for alcohol-related crimes is tied to the organizational characteristics of an arrested officer's employing state or local law enforcement agency the study showed that officers who are employed by departments with less than a hundred full-time personnel lost their job in less than half of the alcohol-related cases and officers employed by agencies with more than 100 full-time sworn personnel lost their jobs in less than one-third of the alcohol-related cases the study acknowledged that state and local sworn law enforcement officers do not typically arrest other sworn law enforcement officers especially for drunk driving and in the cases that officers were arrested over 50 percent were a result of traffic accidents and around 24 of those accidents resulted in victim injury less than one-third of officers lost their job as a result of a dui arrest this data suggests that officers often receive special treatment from fellow officers when they are arrested and most officers are allowed to continue serving as a sworn officer regardless of their arrest what is more troubling is that there are no laws which require officers to inform their department that they have been arrested and many departments have no policies that require them to do so it is impossible to know how often officers grant leniency to other officers and it would be extremely difficult to maintain a database of this information because much of it goes unreported it is safe to say that members of law enforcement are not vehemently prosecuted to the extent that an average citizen would be in similar circumstances and they rarely lose their job or face reprimand let me stay right here let him come up and i'll tell him who's he worked for i know same department yeah okay here look at me real quick i'm just gonna check your eyes okay there are several methods which officers employ to determine if a driver is intoxicated but only three tests are standardized by the national highway transportation safety administration the most common test is known as the walk and turn in this test officers instruct the subject to keep their hands to their sides and walk several paces in a straight line the second test is known as the one leg stand where an officer will have the subject stand with one foot approximately six inches from the ground while counting out loud the third test is known as the horizontal gaze nystagmus test where an officer instructs the subject to follow a stimulus with their eyes typically a finger or pen as the officer waves the stimulus from side to side this is the test that officer salomon is employing and it is designed to determine at which angle the eyes exhibit a nystagmus nystagmus is an involuntary twitching of the eye that typically occurs when the eyes are shifted at a 45 degree angle or further but an early onset of nystagmus can be associated with a high blood alcohol concentration according to the nhtsa studies have revealed the hgn test to be 77 reliable in determining whether a driver has a blood alcohol concentration above 0.10 citizens have a right to refuse to submit to a field sobriety test however ohio dui laws operate under the doctrine of implied consent which means that anyone who operates a vehicle is deemed to have given consent to a chemical test such as a breath or blood test if a citizen refuses to take a chemical test it will result in an automatic suspension of their license for up to one year unless the charge is proven false in court if you would like to know more about the laws and legal requirements surrounding duirs i highly suggest taking a look at the dui guy's youtube channel which will be linked in the description below captain katon is well within her rights to refuse taking any roadside sobriety tests and she initially refuses but eventually decides to allow officer salomon to perform the horizontal gaze nystagmus test he said you won't do any tests you won't take your shoes off and doing more tests right yeah i mean you could take those off you got gym shoes in the car or anything no you know you've had too much drink you know you drink too much strawberry we live just down the street i understand where you live but you know but i haven't had too much drink see how i can do any field tests to help me out to make the right decision follow this home sorry i can't i mean it's beyond too far i can't just follow you home now you understand that it's nothing personal okay okay but i'm gonna have to do what i have to do okay i'm gonna have to rescue for drinking and driving tonight we'll do the paperwork i'm not gonna charge you for the gun i'm not going to do that to you i have too much respect for you officer salomon places captain caton under arrest for driving under the influence after a mild protest the loveland officers then allow lieutenant cayton to walk home the officers took captain kate into the police department cited her for a dui and then gave her a ride home following her arrest captain caden's police powers were suspended pending the outcome of the case captain kate's attorney maintains that no traffic violation occurred and that her slurred speech was due to her british accent and accused officer salman of trolling for a traffic stop captain katon's case is still ongoing overall officer salomon gets a c because although he was adamant about arresting captain caton he did not charge her with being in possession of a firearm while intoxicated allowed lutenikaten to walk home despite being armed and intoxicated in public and decided to issue captain caton a citation instead of booking her into jail it is clear that officer salomon granted captain katon preferential treatments and this is particularly troubling considering that he was praised by the department for enforcing dui laws in the past according to this fox 19 article officer salomon carried out 100 dui arrests in 2013 117 in 2014 and 135 in 2015 and his personnel files repeatedly state that dui enforcement is an area that he excels in it would be interesting to know how many of these 350 people that he arrested for driving under the influence were cited and given a ride home the same night while i do commend officer salman for arresting captain caton i also believe that he may not have chosen to arrest her if the interaction had not been recorded it is no secret that officers look out for one another in situations like this and there have been many documented cases of officers receiving special treatment from both fellow officers and the courts this type of behavior not only influences other officers to make poor decisions but it also adds fuel to the negative stereotypes about police and deepens the divide between departments and their communities whether or not captain katon was actually guilty of driving under the influence remains to be determined by the courts but officer salman had more than enough probable cause to arrest and book her and she should have been subjected to the very same procedures as anyone else that officer salomon has arrested for the same offense captain caton and lieutenant cayton both get an f for attempting to use their badge to avoid being arrested carrying firearms while intoxicated and for lieutenant cayton's hostile and unprofessional behavior although officer solomon conducted this stop in the least intrusive manner possible and even allowed the lieutenant to walk away from the scene drunk and in possession of a firearm lieutenant katan was still not satisfied it is clear that the lieutenant expected that he and his wife would be allowed to return home without any repercussions for their actions captain caton and lieutenant caton made poor decisions and members of law enforcement should be held to a higher standard of responsibility given that they are in a position of power officers should not expect special treatment from one another in fact officers should be particularly harsh on fellow officers because officers who commit crimes undermine the sworn duty of their oath and affect the public image of members of law enforcement as a whole it'll be interesting to see if captain caton has afforded the same leniency inside the courtroom as she was on the street and whether she will be subject to reprimand from her department let us know if there is an interaction or legal topic you would like us to discuss in the comments below thank you for
