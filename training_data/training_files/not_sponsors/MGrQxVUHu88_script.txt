ah you thought I meant a wireless router like for the Internet get your mind out of the deep web today's video is about our fancy new CNC router that I hold on I know what you're about to say I will admit that here at Linus tech tips our track record for maker type projects isn't exactly pristine but the point is we want to get better now we could spend years honing our craft making mistakes learning from them and eventually becoming masters at working with our hands but instead of doing that we're gonna build a robot to do all the difficult machining for us so here it is this is our 4 foot by 4 foot CNC router that CNC router parts sent over to us and we're gonna walk you guys through how to build it and how to use it to do really cool stuff like make this memory Express is the go-to place link in the video description [Music] so here we've got 13 boxes that's maybe what like a ton worth of crap and we're gonna have to make all of that using a 244 page document and in the end hopefully we'll have a fully functional CNC router oh yeah I guess we just start now they call this the industrial erector set and I don't know anyone who's an engineer definitely gets 80/20 boners so it makes sense this must be for the gantry that thing is huge so once this is tightened down on there that is not going to go anywhere at all put in the router table together is pretty straightforward thanks to the excellent included instructions you just join the extruded aluminum together using the anchor fasteners tighten them down and then repeat what feels like 10,000 times extruded aluminum is actually great for machine frames because you can create extremely strong joints without giving up modularity so compared to a welded steel frame if we decided in the future that this router wasn't quite big enough for our needs expanding the bed is relatively simple this table is so freakin sturdy like holy crap I can like this thing is not going anywhere at all I guess that's why it's called the pro version bullcrap precision linear rails are added to the sides of the table to give an excellent bearing surface then to make sure they run smoothly we just need to add a little bit of grease the gantry holds the spindle and moves around above whatever we decide we want to cut so from here we added the stepper motors and we were basically good to go mechanically onto the electronics so you guys have seen computer power supplies before but look at this guy holy crap so I'm just making this up because I don't actually know what everything is but I'm guessing that these two are power supplies we've got a board here that's going to be the controller that goes to your computer and each one of these is a stepper motor or it'll be an output to a stepper motor so we'll connect one to each one of those and they probably take fairly high voltages I'm not totally sure but this power supply right here is for one motor only and it's good for 2200 watts that's what Wow there's not even a whole lot in there that's crazy that they can get all of that power in that small of a thing Oh oh that's heavy so this is gonna be the real business end of the CNC that's good for three horsepower twenty four thousand rpm oh okay okay hey don't don't be a show-off I don't want you hurting yourself cheese yeah we're gonna have to move it too that'll be fun we're gonna need like six seven people to do this like comfortably this ends not so bad but like is this all manual assembly like every one of these plates yeah how are their instructions really good I guess we should really close that yeah guys we're filming here yeah the spindle on its own has a 2.2 kilowatt power supply what holy crap so to put that in perspective this motor consumes more power than even the beefiest gaming rig including its monitor and peripherals I'm gonna hit it and see what happens it's alive is this wood here because we're sacrificing it or no okay really this is a table I would never have known that you had a table based on how many of the tools for this project ended up on the ground there's a little light that's turning on on this okay good I guess so the sensor is definitely working but I don't know if it's inputting into the Hat I was like oh it'd be nice to see this stuff a bit big No so it turns out that if all we wanted to do was turn it on there was a switch that we needed to flip but that wasn't our biggest problem anyway so basically what we're doing here is I was an idiot and put the spindle and the whole gantry assembly on the wrong way so when it homes over here it's like a good foot off the table so we need to pick up this whole piece right here and flip it and that's why we have four dudes okay so one person just stop it from tilting all right all right anti-clockwise we're going this way okay so I think me and John are going to have to hold it and you guys will have to go under now that everything is assembled correctly time to fire it up so now that it's all working let's take a look at our finished router now I'm sure many of you haven't seen one of these things in operation before how the heck does it cut things how does it get to one thousandth of an inch of cutting resolution basically code is sent from the computer here and then executed by the stepper motors which you'll find here here here and over there so those are the ones I alluded to earlier now a normal DC motor will rotate continuously when a voltage is applied more voltage means more faster which is great if you just want to go but it doesn't give you any control of the position stepper motors contain a stationary magnet attached to the output shaft with magnetic windings all around it so by energizing these electromagnets the internal magnet is attracted and aligns with them to move the motor one step the next set of electromagnets gets energized moving the shaft however far it is between electromagnets so our stepper motors have 200 electromagnets meaning that each full step is 1.8 degrees then that resolution can actually be doubled with half steps so that's where two electromagnets are energized to have the shaft move only half as far and then beyond that microstepping which relies on multiple electromagnets at different ratios can be used to further increase our resolution all of that lovely precision can be ruined though and very quickly by bad gears so right here we have a three point two to one gear reduction to increase our torque from five foot pounds to sixteen this allows us to remove more material at a time but anytime there's gears involved backlash can quickly become an issue so backlash is the slot between two gears that causes a loss in precision when you reverse the direction experiencing something like this once in a run might only result in a couple thousandth of an inch of accuracy being lost but on a machine that will normally be changing direction hundreds of times while making apart all of those little errors would really add up so to combat this our gears are actually preloaded with a high stiffness spring right here this smashes the gears together preventing them from shifting about willy-nilly now of course our previous explanation of the instructions come from the computer wasn't exactly the best so let's take a closer look at where those come from because it's not quite as easy as just hitting go like on a 3d printer for some of our parts will use SolidWorks and HSM Express to create the CAD and tool paths but we will also be using V carve Pro for other parts due to its greater ease of use in the software we end up having to define many parameters like how fast the rotor will cut for example we have to do this because well think about if you were using a handsaw you'd actually find yourself adjusting how fast you move your blade how hard you press and all kinds of little things intuitively based on how it feels but the thing is that this robot isn't gonna back off if something's amiss and it will happily destroy a cutting tool or anything else in its way if you don't program it correctly that's actually one of the reasons that they have built-in safety Stoppers that we have to wire up before we start doing anything so to make sure this doesn't happen the correct rpm for the cutter and how fast the spindle news has to be calculated based on the force of the cutter from there those instructions are compiled and sent the laptop that's connected to the router now down here we're running what's called Mach three which directly interfaces with the router and runs g-code a programming language for CNC machines and because this is all been preset up we should actually be able to just hit go once we are of course fully clear of the machine so right now what we're doing is we're giving it a known zero height is that correct yeah okay cool I only know about these what my neighbor told me during scrapyard wars to next time it goes past and here it's gonna be taking a bit of thau off so just clean this up you ready I don't think what you're doing is really helping you might as well just get that over there [Applause] this poor laptop well hold on hold on at least get a shot of it if it's gonna suffer it might as well alright go ahead don't scrape it back over it doesn't seem clean you go through with the big bed yeah you get most of it done and then you come in and do the fine details got a smaller one beautiful so where's our smaller bit and this is safe to just go right in there that's considered safe practice I want to make sure whatever we're doing in this video is what you're supposed to do it's pretty close okay yeah we definitely clearly need a better material capture solution here so is this the last thing on your wish list because this is one of the things you've been trying to get me to get since what you started we're at the point now where we can basically make anything out of acrylic though or like any plastic like our just collect us you know Manor okay wow it sounds heavy is it considered safe for me to just reach in and grab this well you can't pick it up I can't oh it's double-sided tape down Oh what the crap yeah I think we need to use not that GoPro tape because this is ridiculous that stuff like how much did you use you could have used just like a tiny amount of it the world's most spectacular you put that much on well I could have told you that was gonna happen yeah it broke wait no it didn't no this is just some cleanup that we need to do yeah you could have put like this much times four or five and it wouldn't have gone anywhere and that my friends is about how this whole thing goes down so it does take a little bit of cleanup to get it to you know quite this stage but surely you guys can kind of see how we get there so we are to say we're really excited to make some crazy things with this would be a gross understatement we do still have a little bit of work to do before we can really go hand like there's the dust collector that is highly necessary we're gonna attach that to the cutting head and we're gonna be making a spoil board that goes on the table freeze your mounting but we're well underway and that's pretty much it for this so huge thanks to Nathan from CNC router parts for sending this guy over and to rod from BS mods for giving us some extra advice and big thanks the events to you for the awesome suggestions that you'll be leaving in the comments for projects that you guys want to see while you're at it by the way we actually need a name for our friend here because that joke at the beginning of this video the router video hahaha get it the bolt it's actually really confusing referring to this as the router around here so the top upvoted name in the comments below we're gonna cut out a sign with that name we are gonna mount it to the machine have fun the mast drop XA k g:k now at the link in the video description so thanks again for watching guys if you just like this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed and maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link
