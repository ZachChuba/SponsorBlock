all right it's man show time again ladies and gentlemen I hope you've all had a fantastic week beautiful gorgeous Halloween full of beautiful gorgeous you know costumes of bond stirs that are at your house talking about children we're off to a bad start on the land show today fortunately we weren't planning to talk about Halloween today we've got a bunch of other great topics for you including YouTube peace course did you know that my peace corps is bigger than most people's in the top NP scores yeah yeah top ten P scores I have a bigger Peace Corps than Will Smith so will explain what exactly I'm talking about in a little bit we're also gonna talk about Google buying Fitbit very interesting about time ah would you watch Netflix at 2x oh wow that oh that's gonna be a conversation and how I know we should invite David and Brandon over here ah that'd be terrible really enjoy yeah let's just I can't what's wrong way chickens says you successfully cleaned the whole bowl all right for the last month a handful of creators have been probing the HTML HTML code of YouTube videos like we need right click in your browser and hit inspect you can see the HTML from whatever page you're on and for the last month around it was at October 8th there's something YouTube exposed some new HTML oh that wasn't there before and it says all these funky things like what the videos Peace Corps is yeah and then so they went ham with that and they looked at the peace scores of many different channels and videos yeah and then they made all of these kind of assumptions about what that could mean and they're freaking out and I don't know how I feel about it so basically there's actually there's a couple of pretty good articles about it the one that I've got on my screen here is from medium calm and I'm just gonna see if I yeah here we go so here's an example of what the inspect source code looked like so Channel Peace Corps and if this is like we're talking pretty granular scoring of the of an entire channel like we're talking what what it what is this called you know five precision I know I know you're thinking of sig figs I'm thinking like metal you know when when like a metal is super pure you talk about how it's like two nines or three nines but this is like that but not that at all you know what forget it whatever the point is they're they're basically they've got such a degree of granularity and the way that they are quantifying what a channels Peace Corps is that out of one two three many places is this you know 86 million channels you know a point zero zero zero zero one difference between them could give one a higher Peace Corps and one a lower Peace Corps so clearly that means they're taking a lot of factors into consideration here and this is this is another really interesting piece so this was data gathered by bow blacks nickel ours Diorio Optimus and Josh press Kotori of 10 top youtubers P scores based on a randomly selected data set of large youtubers now admittedly this was only out of 200 youtubers so when I show up on the top 10 of the top 10 youtubers P scores right there yeah that's right where's BBC News act now where's Will Smith that now that's right - tech tips yo mind you I mean Jimmy Fallon is like you know way better than me apparently which you know I guess I'll have to learn to live with but to be clear I'm just funny we already knew that Peace Corps has existed it's not controversial that Peace Corps is existed we just didn't know what they what the numbers were YouTube doesn't tell you what your number is now which is obvious like defensible reasons they never wants to expose like how their black magic works because then people can exploit it and gain the system yeah they don't want to do that so it's hidden so basically what we know about the Peace Corps is that it seems to dictate whether or not content is surfaced in YouTube's Google preferred lineup which is the advertiser friendly vetted the high quality content I'm using finger quotes even though I personally think Will Smith is a national treasure and is absolutely vetted in high quality in every way on YouTube and I definitely support his YouTube career the point is that there's this thing called the Google preferred lineup yeah which is a like a select set of youtubers or if you're a big brand I don't know remember ad pocalypse ad pocalypse happen in 2018 where a bunch of big brands decided we're not gonna advertise on YouTube anymore because our product is being advertised in front of Isis or content not just Isis content that we don't want our brand associated with right that's that's a better sort of overarching way to put it so they made this shortlist of creators who are safe so if you're a coca-cola and you're like look just put me in front of something safe now they have this list naturally they needed some kind of automatic automated system that would make this list well Google preferred has actually stood for a lot longer than that so we were at Hereford yeah we were added to Google preferred back when they launched it and that was early on in the days of Linus media group the thing though is that Google preferred and YouTube is always sort of obfuscating things more in the early days of Google preferred you could see not just who was in Google preferred but you could actually see a breakdown of just how preferred you were oh wow so I was in top 1% Google preferred in the technology category specifically so Google preferred as a whole is 5% of the creators it was well they have to today well see this is the thing this is information that we wouldn't have if they hadn't originally exposed it to us but at least at one point though I don't know that it works this way anymore they had a top 1% and a top 5% and so for example Linus tech tips was a top 1% channel probably by merit of its size and tech wiki was a top 5% channel probably by merit of its lesser size so what it seems like to me is that instead of just having like a 1% preferred and a 5% preferred now this Peace Corps is a much more granular way of determining just how how safe and how advertiser friendly and how non-controversial that channel as a whole is likely to be and it's based on five dimensions apparently there's popularity which is a size that you're talking about and that's driven by watch time and engagement there's passion which is mostly channel engagement apparently there's a protection which ensures the content is appropriate platform which highlights content and watched often on TV screens which is the market that they want to grow into and production production values how do you quantify something how do you do fellow school children I'm saying alright so yeah how do you measure the production values of a video that is honestly something that I find kind of difficult to quantify there's certain things you can like was it uploaded in 4k for example yeah you just get a score for each one of those you can upload anything in 4k I mean this is something I get so tired of explaining to people 4k is not inherently a measure of a videos Chris penis or whatever word you want to use to describe it because I could take the most crap garbage footage off of a cell phone from eight years ago I could throw it in Adobe Premiere and I could export it in 4k upload it to YouTube it will look like crap garbage cell phone footage from eight years ago so it's it's the kind of thing that is extraordinarily difficult to to measure I mean there's certain things you could do like you could you could use machine learning to scan for things like obvious distracting background noise you know like wind blowing through a microphone or something like they probably look out at a pixel-by-pixel basis because they do that for other systems that they have like their Content ID system that's true I also do know that for for top creators and for what was yep for preferred it is shocking how many real actual Google employees watch a video so it is possible that part of the production value scoring is handled by actual people yeah but but we don't we don't know because Google is intentionally pretty opaque about the whole thing but I want to get into the controversial part of this topic and I want to know Europe and you know where you stand because those have someone with a high Peace Corps just saying just I've got a huge piece comes to higher than 15 huge Peace Corps yeah the creators that are looking through this data they discovered references to throttling there's all these tags that involve the word throttling in the source code of these pages and they believe it could indicate that Google or YouTube is doing two things one thing called brand safety throttling which is restricting the videos access or eligibility to ads so it's not demonetized where it's not getting any ads put on it but it's getting fewer ads or a certain type of ads and then the other thing they think could be having was what they call feature video throttling which was just like serving your video to fewer people but do you think that's do you think their take on that makes sense um I see the problem for me with a topic like this is it's really hard for me to appear unbiased because my understanding is a Peace Corps of above 500 is like pretty decent or 700 I think yeah I think they said 7 to 800 is like you're getting into the Google preferred lineup - ok so we're obviously well clear of that apparently our peace corps is over a thousand huge what it's huge the biggest I've ever seen its enormous it's bigger than Will Smith's that's gonna fit look I was bound to beat Will Smith at something once in my life it looks like this is gonna be it this is it I've crested it's all downhill from here because nobody is gonna put the time and effort into you know bringing me back to my prime once I'm over the hill so this is it it's all downhill from here Will Smith if this makes it you somehow can we please please do a challenge video like hut Olympics where you guys do various things and compete that would be so awesome there's no way there's no way I'm 10 basketball there's no way rapping oh man take that Sybase pop that up right now ok so it's gonna be it's gonna be hard for me to come across genuine when I say no I in fact do not think that this is as big of a deal as people are making it out to be because I I'm speaking from a privileged position where we had we made just decision back when Linus media group was founded seven years ago yeah actually it will it be oh my god will it be eight years when the calendar rolls over seven seven okay thought I lost you there seven years ago when we founded Linus pewter we made a conscious decision to stay pretty family friendly and by extension brand and advertiser friendly because when I founded the company I was in a very precarious position I only had around two hundred thousand subscribers on the channel and because I didn't know the first thing about operating a camera or video editing I my intention was to go at it hard hire two people immediately ad in Luke and then my wife was also doing some work for us on the side even though she was supposed to be on her mat leave higher ed and Luke go go go and we're just we're gonna pump content so Luke you're gonna make sure that we're pumping lots of content we're gonna get you know a forum started so we have a back-up plan and you're gonna do all the shooting and everything you can do all that right and and so I already knew that in order to survive we were going to have to be able to engage with a wide variety of brands so I was like okay say here and now set it out here now we're not gonna swear on the channel like in my daily life I people people often either act or are shocked when they meet me in person and I'm like dropping f-bombs all over the place cuz they're like but like in real life I don't really care no saint I don't care like I don't care about cussing it's it's not a big deal to me and in my opinion as a consumer of content I I don't notice it or care about care about it but we made a conscious decision to bleep - okay - a swear infrequently so that it has a greater effect because that really does matter I remember the first time I adopt a swear word with my friends in high school cuz they had they had known me as like the kid who didn't swear so I've kind of been all over the place on this issue it was like this must have been like very very important and then over time the impact gets lower and lower and lower so we made this decision to only swear when we felt like we really needed to emphasize something and to to bleep it whenever we did it and that was for two reasons one to make sure that we aren't for no reason like for what good reason turning off advertisers it's it's just entirely unnecessary to close down like as a business owner it would be irresponsible of me to be like no but my free speech I won't put a beep sound in my video you know deal with it what no I'm trying to run a business here we need like over what there is some edited everyone knows yes not much everyone knows what word I was saying and to personally this is very very personal most people probably won't agree I find swearing much funnier if it's bleeped bizarre I know I know a bizarre please turn your hat a different way I hate it I will not I will not and I don't care I have I have always found till the first time I ever heard the the uncle bleeper song from South Park the movie okay the first time I everywhere yeah [Laughter] okay look the first time I ever heard the song it was bleeped and but it was not bleeped well so that's something that I've given a lot of guidance to our editors on over the years like sometimes they'll bleep things too much one of the one of the most egregious examples of this is the stormtrooper rap and did actually rap on the channel once but that's what I'm saying the stormtrooper rap that we did in our review of the streets by 50 headphones the way that it was believed was so bad it was just the bleep was over not just the spoken like like rapping audio track but over the background music as well so just we're completely disrupted the song No and so I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm all about tactical bleeping so I think sleep is the correct way to bleed because you obscure absolutely none of the meaning but if there does happen to be a four-year-old watching and even if the parents don't care it's it reflected people judge you if your kid shows up at preschool and teaches the other kids the f-word like it's just that's a social norm deal with it so if there happens to be a four-year-old watching well they don't know what that word is yeah sure right and if they do well that's not on me okay bring us back to P scores bring us back to P scores I don't remember what I was talking about right it's hard for me to talking about the different dimensions that contribute to the Peace Corps right okay so right so I made a issues the throttling I made a conscious destroyed I made a conscious decision to keep us advertiser friendly but do I actually believe that that is giving us some kind of unfair advantage in any meaningful way on the platform and I would say no in fact over the last year we have let me see how it's gonna increase your Peace Corps for and brand safety you don't think so for sure yeah in brand safety shirt but here I'm just gonna I'm gonna bring up some analytics I don't usually start diving into the inside baseball here because I'm always afraid to show something that like because YouTube I'm not supposed to show you guys I hate this thing so much what even am I looking at right now oh well you're looking at the year that's why it's checking yeah it was like what is this I must just be oh it's check what is channel analytics but even oh oh I'm in that I'm in the wrong Channel you released one video that year that's what happened BRB BRB okay okay here we go okay alright so I'm gonna I'm gonna explain why I don't think it's that big of a deal so one is in spite of our amazing Peace Corps sorry I have to this is exactly this is one of the reasons why I'm skeptical of this whole thing does and it's because they think like there's so many things that happen to your videos that make you feel like you're being unfairly maligned or your videos not being served yeah all these things that happen all the time and we experienced them but our Peace Corps is huge yes so why would we still experience them this year has been a pretty big struggle at times for us we were steadily in decline all the way from January down until we hit rock bottom somewhere in the neighborhood of early July since then our you know what no this was probably rock bottom and the end of May and of May was rock bottom that was the first time we had done one point four million views in a day since like eighteen months prior like that was on and to be clear I'm not I'm not expecting you guys to feel bad for me - tek-tips is an extremely successful YouTube channel my company is great my staff is awesome I don't expect anybody's pity but what was alarming about all of this was that going from two three four five million a day down to one and a half means that all of a sudden you might not be sustainable if that trend were to continue you know another six months of that and we could be getting 1 million views a day or 500,000 views a day and all of a sudden I'd be laying people off so that's something that I that I've told myself I never want this to come to so we've we've taken a very sort of responsible approach to growth but we had also never seen sustained view hemorrhaging like that and we got a lot of complaints from our viewers saying like oh well I'm not getting notifications for your videos and well that's that's nothing new though so like like what is it exactly that's changing and so anyone I think who's looking at this Peace Corps thing and going oh well like that's the problem I think you're missing the bigger picture because during some of the most frustrating spells of declining viewership we've actually had a really really frustrating last probably week or so ever since the Facebook portal video went up I think people were really mad about that video and maybe they thought it was answered by Facebook or maybe they just couldn't handle that we were looking at the product for what it is rather than the bogeyman that we were we could imagine it to be like it was just a straight-up video about the Facebook portal which is in marketing and advertising everywhere and we kind of thought people want to know about but people were super mad maybe because they thought it was sponsored or we shouldn't cover it or I don't know well it's that plus a lot of audiences isn't gonna be interested in it in it anyway so so I get that but ever since then even on videos that we thought are kind of slam dunks like the tree-planting Canon that took a long time to gain traction that started out as the worst video in the first couple of hours that we had released out of the last 10 and that included the Facebook portal thanks and then now it's grown its got like 1.4 million views or something like that so it's like really made up ground but it seems like there's things that can happen that have much much more dramatic effects cuz I can tell you guys for sure our Peace Corps didn't change that dramatically in those days and the really frustrating thing is that during this time we've had videos that are performing like hot garbage and I'm getting notifications on my phone every day you're on trending do you want to send a little notification to your to your little buddies who follow you on YouTube and let them know you're trending so they can congratulate you like no I don't want to do that because this video there's literally I click through the thing and it's so I get this notification you're trending I click through the thing and then I've got this helpful little thing here that says 8 out of 10 down arrow down arrow lower interest from subscribers and nonsubscribers what am I expecting you guys to congratulate me for here exactly my epic Peace Corps so how do you explain the those tags for throttling um I don't know and so ok I think it's I have a theory I think it's possible that they're throttling certain things but I also think that people might be overestimating the importance of these things so I got a trending notification for 4k video editing piece on a budget which in spite of having a great like to dislike ratio pretty solid engagement in terms of people leaving comments on it was a terrible that was a terrible terrible performer for us so I got this trending notification on it but if we dig into my analytics for this I hate the new creator studio so much oops something went wrong retry well yeah seriously oh so now it's just not working at all okay give me a second I'm just gonna go ahead and go back to creator studio classic if I even still can here it is just skip No no I'm giving them their feedback other the page wouldn't load I'm sure glad that you guys are gonna start sticking people with this with no option to opt out when pages literally don't load it up Wow I have to re-sign in yeah that's happening this month yeah I know right well first luck you people anyway yeah but you don't get to pick no you don't and there's also no guarantee that if you're chosen that you're gonna be chosen for all of your different channels so you could be only on the beta on last tech tips but you're still available in classic for tech quickie yeah not a consistent experience so let's go let's go find that let's go find that video again now that we're in the new manager sorry guys I would just share you on all the navigation but I've been told that there are certain confidential things in here especially not necessarily with respect to like how much money do you make on YouTube but with respect to what kind of CPMs you're making that you are not allowed to share as part of it holy crap stay on classic it's it started putting up banners every time you try to navigate to new page and then there's this horrible header at the top of the screen that like you can't get rid of like you can't close it there's no button here's my theory about the whole dongsaeng bottling tags where is that is there no way for me to get into this I click video manager you have got to be kidding me they definitely didn't change anything here okay because they don't want to spend any resources doing that this is so stupid wait yeah so I want to see the analytics for this video here's the thing that throttling peg could just mean that your piece core is being throttled that there's certain aspects of your video that are contributing to a lower piece war that's what I how I would interpret it yes that could be I I actually doubt that though why okay sorry give me a give me a sec I'm just trying to find this stupid thing all right um you know what I'm just not gonna worry about it you guys will just see the revenue numbers for this video because I can't be arsed to hide it all right so here we go let's have a look at the analytics for this video so in the time period we're looking at which doesn't include today that's normal it's got six hundred and twenty thousand views solid like dislike ratio you know we generated some new subscribers that's pretty cool shares is always low I always get a kick out of people thinking that like shares is this super crucial metric if something's gonna go viral yeah a lot of shares is probably great but it's far from the main driving factor what what drives a video these days is let me just see if I can get in - here we go so let's have a look at watch time but yeah it's it's all algorithmic so here we go let's go to views because why would I want watch time to be my default why do I care about watch time on a video by video basis impression click three or four point six eight percent that's like kind of l'idée --scent actually for the first couple of days and if YouTube was serving as many impressions on this as they do for some of our videos it probably would have performed better average view duration at eight minutes is really solid but let's have a look here so one of the things that I'm I think everyone pretty much agrees Peace Corps effects is your ability to hit trending that's why it's constantly Stephen Colbert John Oliver Jimmy Kimmel and and us we run trending like everyday but a lot of the creators that I talk to they're like wow yeah you guys are doing so great you're like on trending all the time like yeah look at the actual views on the video so let's go back to our non correlative let's go back into the analytics here so where's my where's my sources traffic sources here we go alright so browse features this is your this is your home page home screen subscription feed and other browsing features so that's where we're getting 60% of our views from suggested videos so suggested alongside other videos or after them that's 17% channel pages traffic from YouTube channel pages or other people's YouTube channel pages or topic channel pages we get another 6% there that's unusually high director unknown so this might be people sharing it off platform notifications where even is trending oh I can't even find it anymore what's given in your precious classic view dan Brown ha here we go okay whoa right so browse features is really good so home is 67% of that subscriptions is 31% of that watch later is 1.8 percent of that watch history is 0.5% of that this video hit trending and got literally literally 9,000 people saw it and I'm pretty sure this one trended hasn't been one contraction saw it saw it out of which 117 people watched it so 90 percent of one percent yes click through this so if if people are imagining that this Peace Corps giving you some kind of huge leg up because you're trending all the time is a big deal that's a video that trended I got literally 117 views which registered as 0% 0.0% not only that but this is this is great of those people they had the lowest average view duration so didn't even watch the video so it's actually detrimental for your video to be on trendy because that just lowers your CPM increasing your bounce rate your click-through rate so it lowers your click through ratio but again not in any appreciable way and it increases your bounce rate so the rate at which people jump into your video go Abba sucks and leave which is bad because that affects how the video gets promoted via the other mechanisms that actually matter so have I yeah this is great dead polymers says I never even look at trending right well why would you because nothing it's just gonna show you stuff if you're not interested in tech and it puts it on your trending page yeah like not gonna watch it anyway yeah exactly so what we're talking about again can we just move on so yeah we oh right so something else that I had wanted to talk about and I can't give you guys exact numbers here unfortunately because it is one of the things that YouTube is extremely sensitive about our creators sharing their ad fill rates they're they're CPMs their see whatever the rpms are yeah whatever the effective how much you're getting paid proves revenue per minute all that's Italian yeah per mil per thousand yeah mi million so your your CPM your cost per mil which doesn't factor in people who use adblock or whatever else and then your revenue per mil which is just your overall your aggregate score not score like rate they don't like people disclosing that stuff so I can't give you guys exact numbers but what I will tell you is as someone with a high Peace Corps huge my RPM so the actual like money that comes in to Linus Media Group's coffers on advertising supported content was comparable or lower to even gaming channels who have notoriously poor CPMs that I talked to at the top creator summit I don't know if that's because of a high percentage of our users engaging adblock I don't know I really know what it's to do with at all actually and it's not the kind of thing that Google will talk about they're very cagey anytime you're like well hey how's our CPM is compared to other people in this base they're like fine you know like they they're not really going to talk to you about that so I can say that from my own experience Peace Corps doesn't appear to generate more revenue for me in any meaningful way in fact if I cared about increasing the revenue that we make from YouTube directly as opposed to the sponsorships and partnerships that we work on on our own I would be pushing everyone to sign up for read yeah YouTube premium yeah YouTube premium because a viewer on YouTube premium is worth I forget what it is it's something like six to ten X or something like that compared to a viewer who is AB supported now part of the reason for that might be that we do not include mid-roll ads in our videos and that's something that I know YouTube is big on people enabling so creating natural ad breaks within their videos and then plunking down mid-roll ads throughout the video but the way that we see it I've kind of actually hoped no one from YouTube is really watching right now but like you guys suck at monetizing mid-roll in a video like there is so much stuff that you guys could do way better and giving top creators anyway or like people who have the resources access to better tools I think could dramatically improve it so you guys have probably noticed if you watch our channel regularly there's a spot for honey the web browser extension that features me explaining what honey is but then that honey is actually using as a pre-roll and a mid role on YouTube imagine if youtubers had the power to work with brands to create their own pre-rolls and mid roles that instead of just being some random ad that's just plunked into a video it it was coming from a voice that the person watching actually wants to hear from like that's why integrations that are built into the video that are read by the to the video command so much higher CPMs than random algorithm driven stuff from google so the reality of it is if we have the resources to manage it it is actually more cost-effective for me to employ not one not two but three people who pretty much their entire jobs are to go out and make these business deals and then include our own sponsor reads than it is for me to just not have them do it and plunk in YouTube's advertising and we've tried it without would youtube make money off of that I mean they could create the tools where the money that costs the money yes of course so they create these tools and then I would be willing to give them a cut because obviously I have overhead from running my own sales team or in the case of a lot of other youtubers I'm having an agent it's pretty typical for an agent to take ten percent right off the top regardless of how much the deal is or more and there's a lot of deals out there that are more than ten percent I'd say ten percent is like when you're someone like me and you have a pretty strong negotiating position you can demand 10 percent if you're smaller to the point where the deals coming in are so small that 10 percent would just not even be worth their time you could expect to be paying quite a bit more I could see why they wouldn't build those tools their whole ad platform is based on the auctions automation its scale you know they're so kind like in absolute sense they're so few or in a proportion sense I mean proportionately there's so few creators that would even have this available to them who have like those connections and everything honestly though I think that's part of their problem just as a company is trying to turn everything into a machine learning problem I mean we have gotten away with saying some making some pretty egregious mistakes with our with our sponsors and with our brand partners and with all the people in the industry that we work with and through the through the magic of human contact we've managed to smooth over the vast majority of those things whereas I think that's how Google ends up with things like ad pocalypse on their hands if they were actually talking to their partners all the time I don't think they get blindsided by something but this is me probably speaking out of turn you know I did attend brandcast that was a pretty cool show that they put on for their advertising partners I guess there was a cocktail hour after maybe that's all you need while you were in it you're just butthurt you weren't invited to TM day two years in a row speaking of butthurt I would be butthurt if I whatever something-something segue the sponsors for the LAN show right jerky I'm so hungry I didn't get a chance to eat today okay here's the thing so Netflix is trialing on Android mobile devices the ability to alter your playback speed just like you can on YouTube you can go 0.5 speed 0.75 speed normal speed 1.25 and 1.5 now interestingly even though I usually speed stuff up I have heard from people who slow it down people who have the english's maybe an additional language change she'll watch it more slowly there's a lot of other people who watch certain types of content really fast because it's they like more information density especially for watching like a college lecture or something like that or frankly when I watch our videos especially if I'm looking for a certain information just as a reference I just crank it up to 1.75 I feel is a good one sometimes I usually have a hard time with two and less yeah the host is kind of one of those slow talkers who seems to be kind of thinking while they're presenting you know what's weird though is when you crank it up at first it sounds weird but then very quickly it sounds like that could just be the normal presenting speed yeah I've had people I've had people walk up to me in person and be surprised at how low the pitch of my voice is because they always watch it one and a half or 2x it's kind of funny I've sometimes I thought maybe we should just like export our content faster they just say if you've ever having to do that um we could I wouldn't do it on the main channel but if we had like a secondary channel that's like it's like Linus tech tips faster faster than fastest boss faster er than possible okay so anyway they're trying this thing and there's some notable members of like the Hollywood community I guess the film community who spoke out about it yeah that Apatow tweeted about it as did Breaking Bad star Aaron Powell Oh Apatow said no Netflix no don't make me have to call every director and show creator on earth to fight you on this Aaron Powell said there is no way Netflix will move forward with this that would mean they are completely taking control of everyone else's art and destroying it Netflix is far better than that am I right Netflix can I present okay so oh this is interesting Vimeo apparently allows creators to decide whether playback controls are exposed that could be an interesting middle ground may I play devil's advocate here for a moment lay it on us so mr. pal you're you're all upset about like your art and whatever um are you the customer that's an interesting question who exactly are you Aaron Powell I'm sorry I don't actually know who that is who are you to tell me how I consume my content exactly but don't what if I like it better it's the dude from Breaking Bad Jesse sure and that says Paul so it doesn't help there was a typo in our dog there you go that's way easier I had no idea who Aaron Powell was you knew Aaron Paul was didn't know that either come on well no I like I yeah I reckon I would recognize his face I don't follow I didn't know his name either I saw the new movie I watched the show I'm sorry okay anyway um it's not a matter of who are you okay I know who you are but okay so you're a famous dude so famous dude gets to decide how I consume content so wait does does Kellogg's get to include a manual in the in the cereal box well then why is it when we review monitors and we go through our color like we always care about having color accurate settings yeah we care about how the game is supposed to look or the movie is supposed to look especially on our TV settings that's following the intent of the creator and that's our prerogative if I wanted to crank the vivid setting of my monitor up to a hundred percent and crank the sharpness I can call myself tacky path obviously like either blind or high idiot sure but that's my right as a consumer how about this fine go ahead because the one argument I think that ah Patel was making is like you spend so much time over the pacing of the video and like how long shots are held for and all this stuff and then if you're watching a different speed I could be different so people let's say this catches on and Jeremy and weirdos in my opinion are watching like dramatic content not not documentaries there are other informational content they're watching like dramas at 1.5 X speed yeah and then they're going online and they're voicing their opinion on these works of art they're giving reviews there's like critical consensus based on something you didn't really make okay so by that logic should we ban skinning in books for fear that people will go and leave a review of the book having actually skimmed over some paragraphs well that's not possible you can't enforce that right and I'm saying you can't enforce this once you ship the art it is up to the user to enjoy it the way that they wish to enjoy it maybe they feel like this because they because Netflix is a middleman it's basically it's a broker of the art correct and so they're enabling these tools I like the Vimeo approach I like the Vimeo approach of saying if the creator thinks you should have this tool then that the creator can give you the tool um yeah I guess so the problem though is that then you are you are cuz really Netflix is only sort of the the middle the middleman because Netflix has worked hard to position themselves as an end-to-end content delivery platform so I think the way that a lot of people view their television or movies is like watching on Netflix it's on Netflix I'm watching I'm watching Netflix how many times have you heard someone say I'm watching Netflix bazillion times right they're not saying I am watching Aaron Paul star of Breaking Bad through the intermediary platform Netflix they're watching Netflix and so from a Netflix standpoint if they're trying to build a user a user centric experience they're gonna push features that may be partners don't like the ability to download episodes onto your phone so you can watch them offline but this work the ability to watch it interface also marry you no hurry some of us have a life mr. Paul they also made them they collaborated with some TV brands to have like a Netflix calibrated mode so and with the express purpose of being able to consume the content as the director right is the choice and if Netflix was making this the default if Netflix was sitting there going okay they got their they got their board right there around the boardroom table and they're going imagine this we speed up every movie by 7% increasing user watch time by 7% and our revenues by 7% it's good right if they went and that was their that was their motivation behind making an accelerated view speed the default option so they could extract more more actually no they'd be paying more royalties okay whatever it doesn't matter okay they slowed it down by seven but I don't know it doesn't matter but that would be agreed just if they were doing it if they were making it the default and if they were doing it for some kind of money-grubbing reason then I would be outraged if the default is a correct color profile at the correct speed and with a minimal interface with no interruptions that is correct and then if anyone's upset about additional options and features that Netflix wants to provide to its users presumably based on user demand I mean they're only trialing the feature people hate it then they're probably not going to keep it in there how people will use it of course people will use it I would use it sometimes I might use it for a document I was gonna say a documentary that's great it would totally make sense I mean David Attenborough's so his voice is so deep anyway no but check this out they put in an auto pitch correction feature so you can speed it up without altering the sound too much okay that's pretty cool that's weird though I kind of want the altered sound to like remind me that I'm consuming it and not the normal way so I mean it's not gonna be perfect no here's the thing I was playing devil's advocate there I do not think that particularly narrative content should be should be sped up III believe in using a color calibrated profile on my display I believe in in consuming the content the way that the Creator intended and for that reason I actually end up consuming less content than I otherwise would if I was willing to watch the I can't call it the new Blade Runner even though it is relatively new if I was willing to watch it on my phone or on a plane I would have seen it already mm-hmm but I'm waiting until icon for that I'm waiting till I have two and a half hours to watch it here I dumped all that sub-woofer v6 totally watch it here I'm down but like I won't consume it until I have two and a half three hours to sit and watch it properly and when I don't have my wife around because she doesn't want to see it so that's why I haven't seen it yet because I'm waiting for a lot of stars to line their watch it yeah the reason I put this topic in here yeah was because I believe Yvonne told me that she has watched TV show sped up so Yvonne this is like my movie because philosophically she and I are so different from each other for her a lot of the time a TV show or a movie is in your company okay well she shows she's not even really paying attention to it and then sometimes she'll get like drawn in and then it's like sorry how many seasons of this friggin thing are there and she will literally go read the synopsis yeah yeah she told me she liked to catch up so she wanted to watch the new season when it came out so she just read the Wikipedia page for every episode of the previous season till I get caught up and I was like that's like I guess it's similar to watching it possibly when you're also doing another thing on so you probably absorbed more of that way you see you reserve absorb more of a certain aspect of it yes so she has a very very different way of consuming content than I do and so who are you mr. Paul to tell my wife that she's not allowed to watch your movie the way that she wants to watch it for yourself like no one asked you how dare you what I didn't ask I didn't I don't need his permission s kind eyes I'm not in general just about this specific who are you to tell me how to read my book who are you to tell me how to watch my movie it's my movie now I paid you for it sure and you know what if you were creating your art on your own platform at no cost to the consumer if you were distributing it for free you know what you could make the argument that you have a lot more say with respect to how it gets consumed but as soon as you are doing it for money for a paycheck you you kind of lose some of your artists rights as far as I'm concerned you are compensated already I don't owe you anything so would you be in favor of a feature that allowed you to click it on to do this movie in black and white I mean there's nothing that would prevent you from doing that already you could probably do that through your Nvidia control panel honestly so no that feature already exists I mean like if it's just like a Netflix feature like um I doubt people would demand that I personally would never use it but I mean you we could talk about it the other way to automatically colorizing black and white content that's actually even that's more applicable it's not only more applicable but it's also kind of more interesting because it would have to take liberties like the machine would have to just guess absolutely and so no if there was demand for it from users no I would be supportive of that I would never use it I would I would if someone if I was in a room and someone else was trying to turn on any of this crap I'd be mad and I'd be like look can we watch it properly please so you watch every movie with subtitles on to a lesser degree now because I switched to a BF GD and the local dimming causes subtitles to the halo around that I find very distracting so no actually my most recent binge show which was the the puppet one Dark Crystal my most recent binge show no I turned off the subtitles after you know I kind of after you told me you did that I started doing a little more often and I liked it you okay you miss differently yes because you're looking down here yep and you're not taking in the full I've never turn on subtitles for a movie I'd already seen yeah like if I was rewatching empire or something I think sometimes I would because you know I tend to miss the same things again and again on repeat viewings it's like my attention span has ebbed and flows and they're predictable it's like 25 minutes in I think about something else and I miss the same line every time and subtitles actually do tend to have information that is not always easily distinguishable by ear like you'll hear a line in the background that you couldn't understand or you'll see it and like oh that's what oh that's what they said oh that by the same token I hate that with subtitles there's different languages available German and Spanish English it's not just English sub house it's closed captioning so you get engine whirring and inaudible any door clanks I hate that I wish there's just subtitle a part of it is just getting used to it like my mum is hard of hearing so we always had subtitles on in our house so I just accepted subtitles as part of well if I want to watch TV at all then there's subtitles on I've ever seen a movie with subtitles you don't want I saw force awakens and I believe it was Malaysia when I came out and there was two sets of subtitles taking up like a third of the screen both in languages that I couldn't read but but Disney has no right to tell me that I can't have two sets of subtitles if I saw as I see fit that's my it that's my point and I just I know I had an argument with the with the camera guys today about the upcoming resurrection of channel superfund which we're taking our sweet time with I'm sorry but it'll happen eventually and we were choosing between a couple of different cameras because it's time to upgrade our gear for like running gun we don't really have any running gun cameras that are manual focus and stuff and between the two camera option between the two cameras one of them is two pounds heavier but has 4k 60fps recording and the other one is two pounds lighter but does not it only does 4k 30fps and I said okay well we have to consider the very real possibility that we're gonna be shooting at 60fps and they were both like upset to the point where one of them threatened to refuse to shoot it if we shot it I know who did that and my response was well it doesn't actually matter what you think because you're not the customer you know you look at the other channels that are like dudes goofing around and like having fun or whatever you know so I'm mr. beast would be obviously the the archetypal channel like that right now cuz they are just absolutely killing it they shoot everything at 60fps for some types of content it's at a level of realism that is kind of nice yeah I mean I'm a twenty four frames per second kind of person but for some things especially if it's a first-person view kind of how to like here's my hand grabbing this thing that were wrench that's great and the point that I made to them was like look you can have your opinion personally I prefer 30fps to 60fps - and that's why - tech tips will be 30fps for the foreseeable future except in cases where we're doing something more artsy and it's going to be 24 but you make content for the viewer not for your own smug self-satisfied patting yourself on the back in a lot of cases and you have to consider what the viewer is going to expect there's a limit to that though cuz you can look at the kind of things that are popular on YouTube and you can look at some of these creators and you'll be like I would never stoop that level I don't need this I don't see what people see in this video but it's getting so many views how that's true you won't make that content I'm not allowing my judgment to be clouded and quite frankly that is the way I see it to the point where I'm going to have the frame rate of the video be the hill that I'm gonna die on that's not the content content is king the frame rate of the video is nothing more than a viewer comfort element and if people are expecting if the audience for this type of video is expecting 60fps then they should get 60fps I don't know I feel like it's gonna be jarring there's a medium is the message type of thing there and the other thing too is that this is the direction things are heading whether snobby movie people like it or not for two generations now Google's pixel phones have recorded video at 60fps by default given enough ambient light by default without asking the user so that's something that is happening we already have complaints on our videos about while other tech channels recording 60 why are you guys to budget and ghetto to like record at 60fps because we did it for aesthetic reasons I'm sorry you wouldn't understand recording on the phone is completely different not necessarily not necessarily because how much of the content that we produce and consume is driven by mobile no no but red line notice that you're capturing on your own personal device when you're taking a video or probably more conducive to being in 60 but it's about what people are used to not cinematic if people are used to watching a channel super fun style of content at 60fps and our channel is 30 I had seen it people are like well why is the framerate of so low sucks well that could be it sucks it's stutter dB yeah that's maybe a video that could work exactly so so all I was saying was we need to be open-minded here we need to do some market analysis like a real company see what people are going to expect and we need to adapt to that and I think I made my point but you know yeah oh yeah for sure NYX over there yeah what can I do for you next that's why yeah yeah we did actually the first can fit a packet on so I can fits tighter whatever all right well I'm gonna let James go cuz I think his carpools like leaving huh I think carpool okay so I'm house-sitting in Maple regiment right if I know what it's like to live in the burbs you know I grew up in Maple Ridge right yeah I think it's a burb I grew up from mission dude oh yeah farther oh that's right why did I hire a mission kid if I know you were from Mission oh my god honestly so my family never watches my videos so they'll never see this but I thought it was a huge mistake when my mom sent my youngest sibling to High School Admission no offense I what year to that person graduate like nine years younger than me I never mind them yeah I know like I don't know maybe it was just his group of friends but I I don't know man they just it just seems like it was like like I don't know they just it's like hey what can we light on fire and I'm just like what yeah you had a bullet on fire I like lighting things on fire too but it just seemed dumber when they did Madame dumber than a bullet there's a legendary story of someone from my high school where they tried to have like a relatively small party like 30 people or something yeah one person from Mission found out and 200 mission kids showed up and trashed the house I was there I fit out of house crashing party I don't know what the context was but it was like we're not living here anymore and we're allowed to smash it somehow there's no adults here I've never been to any party so that sounds doubly horrifying to me super Jets yeah let's do some super chats um Gavin fair says please give credit to Optimus he found this data yep that's a something with the the piece course thing there's like four youtubers there Oh Optimus was elected me did I not list the uh did I not listen think you maybe you used his real name and not as Taggart okay cool credit to optimus sander says hey Linus are you a weed smoker no I'm not in fact a weed smoker good question Oh a second super chat from sander all caps I'm sure you are a weed smoker why what would you think that I've had a lot of people because this hoodie it's not my eyes are red a lot cuz I'm tired I have I've had people assume that I am both high on weed and high on coke and sometimes they draw the same conclusion or that those two conclusions from the same video and I think it is people obviously just don't know what people on drugs look like because if you're gonna go those two different directions from one video you and yeah you just got no idea what's going on Robert says hello from Ohio Ohio that's pretty cool long live free open-source Congrats on the Peace

was watching old vids and noticed that your company grew up and got a bit boring thanks ok they have me to thank for that Matthew says love your channel guys keep up the good work watched over all your videos over the last year Wow I want a ninety nine hundred K on an RG hero 30 gigs of RAM and an EVGA 20 atti FTW three hybrid Kart well it's too bad you didn't show up at the micro Center in California like a couple weeks ago in Tustin yeah cuz we basically gave away one of those video coming this weekend don't miss it oh my god I just realized I'm supposed to go to the movies in one hour captain pepper says when can we get that hot LTG desk pad from last video soon TM you later alright see James ah juror says longtime archive watcher first time watching live sweet awesome says we do consider using a Lightroom export benchmark as a real workload that oh yeah that's a pretty good idea yeah we wouldn't consider using that that's a very good idea uh I'm gonna forget though cuz I'm in the middle of live streaming maybe like tweet at Anthony or something because he sort of dictates what our test suite is now Andrew says finally able to catch live been wanting to ask for nearly a year now there's a keyboard quickie noise during the intro just after Swamp but I need to know what that is oh wow we created that intro like five years ago something like that I have no idea I'm so sorry it could very well be a keyboard clicking noise it could very well be me typing in the background while it is like recording something ah Bobby says leave the Hat the way it is oh dang it alright ah Adam flashes that tech link logo thanks blitz fab thanks Thomas thanks a little shadows thanks Seth any idea when the arty rig reboot winners are announced we're actually shooting our G reboot next week so if you don't know about it already you probably didn't win I'm so sorry just a lazy bastard Cole says forget interlacing with 2k 4k high refresh monitors max nobody cards why don't make a setup where each card handles a separate display so that's complicated because they still have to share data between their vram so you still run into sli scaling issues so it's not gonna help sup nerds take my money to the delta-t store says beat wasabi sup little shadows thanks for the super chat rainbow says now you've called me want their bad haircut back well yeah well you know what grade three called they want their improper use of the word their back th e ir sucka not th e re yeah I don't I get I get kind of I get kind of confrontational whenever Matt like yeah Seth says you can share your analytics on how much you make in each video or anything about your income it's complicated so it's not quite that simple yes you can show certain things like I believe you can actually show the overall number but it's as you drill down into it that YouTube gets really cagey about it don't quote me on that I don't actually know that there's anything in the contract I just know that they don't like it Robert says was wondering what you think of my gaming PC it's got a 9500 GT hey it's not about the car you drive it's about how you drive it held says super chats are basically paid paid Twitter Q&A yeah that pretty much I guess no no I think about it Martin says would you mind giving a shout out to rockfish games and supporting their Kickstarter of ever space too we're not gonna run out and support a Kickstarter of a game just cuz like we have no idea what the finished game is like but I guess effectively you got it thanks Julie er Phil wood says insomnia ad jingles are the worst thing and a lot of voiceovers narrator's can also get in the nerves I support via other means I have no idea what you're talking about Phil but thanks for the super chat andrew says I want to test my motherboard but the CP hasn't arrived yet can I test it without the CPU no Eric should I as a YouTube premium member except when YouTube doesn't notify me about new content when I've hit the bell and subscribe or should I be raising a stink because I'm now paying customer what a great question that I would love to have had a longer conversation with my co-host about I don't know I feel like I'm more entitled to complain when I'm paying for a service versus it being ad support it's effectively the same thing you're paying with your time or you're paying with your money which are effectively the same thing time equals money we all know the famous equation but ya know I would I would say that you're more entitled to raise a stink I mean I complain about G suite because my reminders don't friggin work and I'm a paying customer for that whereas free users of Google assistant they get their reminders working tommy gun says where'd the max anomic chairs go to vertigo sent us over these RGB ones and they're RGB that's so like what's up Drake for a faster playback channel Tek quicker yeah I like that Robert says I for one watched a quick get 2x speed looks good Nikko says love your southern Nate love from your southern neighbor in Seattle any plans to make a long sleeve shirt preferably in black I think we're still oh we're still okay I I think I know the story here so our t-shirts are all American Apparel and American Apparel does not have just like a simple long sleeve t-shirt effect like a long sleeve shirt and so we won't be able to do one until we've found what we consider to be an equivalent replacement and that may end up looking like us replacing our t-shirts as well but we will not settle for anything less than what people have come to expect from us so that's why we haven't done one yet honestly the long sleeve shirts that we did before in the past where they were printed on like Hanes or whatever are some of the most disappointing pieces of merch for people to wear up to me not because I don't appreciate their support but just because I hate that I took their money for it the printing just doesn't hold up over time the the cuffs don't hold up over time like this stealth hoody has been worn and worn and worn and it still got all the elastic in it like that matters whereas like those Hanes long sleeves they do they get all like kind of sort of uneven around the edges of the cuff and stuff I really hate it thanks Liam thanks wait thanks Kato did you know that watching a video at two times I did know that so we'd be better off actually uploading everything at half speed and having you guys double it cargill says about the Netflix thing why is there no outrage about TV channels showing movies with commercial cuts interrupting the pace for instance yeah exactly exactly I don't think any of the artistes think that that's the best way to consume their movie I guess they're just they're over it at this point okay let me have a look here and the problem with when we start super chats as people start super chatting up the storm and like I can't I don't know if I can finish them all there's too many Ilya says you enable subtitles for movie in your native language yeah sometimes I don't like to have a movie that loud so I'd like to turn on subtitles daniel says looking forward to the Netflix feature there you go NYC I've been waiting for the project orthrus case to come out for a while maybe you could use your power to talk to the creator man I I don't I don't think I ever even talked to the creator I think it was Ivan and he doesn't work here anymore Cordy says you should try uploading a couple of videos at 60 where it's just double 30fps we actually did that once and nobody noticed they were like oh wow this is sick and it was just we had just interpolated the extra frames I can't I wish I could find that video because hilarious but we did it so stealthily but it's like not in the title of the video or anything we just did it as an internal test to be like dude like can people actually tell the difference no turns out they actually cannot Oh Joey says I sent an email to the help of the line inspected store about a size exchange a week ago and haven't gotten a response well fortunately nick is standing right there it's for Joey tweet at Nick lmg with your order number and he will definitely get it sorted out yeah Zach's saying thanks Zach thanks Joshua Stan Lee says can you do an update video of the PG 35 V Q maybe attempt fixes with the flickering us down I don't have any flickering issues with it honestly my only issue with it has been that it doesn't go to sleep sometimes so I have seen people talking about it but like I don't have the problem know how to address it I died yeah Plex addicted flex addict says unread or is NFS for large storage if you don't need speed on rate if you do need speed then you'll probably have to go at FS and deal with the extra hassle that comes with that like having to upgrade in big chunks of drives at a time and stuff Cory says thoughts on ninety nine hundred KS got a video coming overall if you already wanted the fastest of the fastest it actually looks like a great deal it something like 25 bucks more and you're getting what is effectively like a top 30 percent ninety nine hundred K so compared to what Silicon lottery was charging for hands says get you shots kid let's see if I still have the mark from this morning mmm well whatever my muscles sore cuz that's where my flu shot went this morning why did I do that alright that's all that's all I can do that's all I can do I'm so sorry guys see you next week same bat-time same bat-channel
