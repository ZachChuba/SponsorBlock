all right ladies gentlemen welcome back to another episode of Exodia I just tried to zoom like I had Optifine and that keep mine definitely didn't work it does I don't I don't know what that's robot or something I don't know weird Android interface thing it's pretty wild but anyway as always this is brought to maps' things of that nature so thanks to them check it out and so you done any work since the last one yeah I heard you were making some 10 years eh yeah I've been making pistons and then I mean you took this wall down I I noticed you've expanded the loam biome to biome you shalom loam loam loam yeah so right and then i rolled through and collected a lot of our metals and poured them out I've gotten all of our that's a lot of gold I filled out the gold berries so that's the gold after creating all the gold ore Bayboro she's over here oh okay so then a lot of gold or berries eh yeah and I mean it's not a lot a lot but that's their the this chest now pipes over to the drawers so if we have something the drawers then they don't automatically drain out of it this chest goes over to the these sorters and then you know ultimately into that chest so they kind of all wrap together okay and then a couple quality of life things for me but other than that nothing that you care that much about what are the quality of life things I just I've been asleep I think we can go out no it's not Nathan oh it sounds like it just turned off nope still reading anyway I just spread out I just spread out the trees so that I can chop them down easier okay to use a little bit less space and then made some you know made tungsten I gave myself or I finished and gave myself an axe pickle nice so yeah that's exciting but this haste upgrade because I was like I know you made one another why's that you used like all of our redstone for it so there's 61 redstone here we can make some more i I do have more being made I don't know if it's all done so I can do some more up I went and gathered in magma rack and have another stack of anyway just you know I just resource gathering and kind of ruining the base a little bit that's pretty cool it made a thing to automatically pour blocks out when I need to okay all right well we just lock the Misti right yeah and we want to breathe right yeah yeah yeah we're filters though there's me good so going into the mist layer makes it hard to breathe I need some breathing aid I wonder if I can use the coal that I found as a filter material for the mist to be able to mine the filter coal I need to use the niobium pickax this is a good thing I have that yes yes okay would you like me to mine as some filter coal sure okie dokie are you oh you made you made in IOB and pickax out of the niobium that we got right exam so filter coal is got my filter coal ore which is found at y equals 118 okey dokey I can do that as long as that's above the mist hopefully it's above the mist this works nice y equals 180 oh I can totally do that bro god it's so that's it whoa do I actually or maybe mmm yeah I guess I could just dig down hope for the best 2018 a1 a2 actually mmm I worked out did it a little bit not that much but a little bit okay so then I'll get rid stone any more magma block smash that with my ham ham mmm I wish I could do the one-by-one mining actually I wonder if any of the coal would just show up on the side of the mountain top here I mean I saw the coal just all over just wandering wait really yeah I saw the filter coal tried to break some but then it found that you know oh here it isn't I got it yeah so Rick freaking skele copter get out of here whoa skeletor's drop iron that's pretty cool okay calm your butt off my god almost there stay on target whoa I got an ability totem for absorption I'm actually super down with that that's like really that's super dope oh god I'm gonna need to get my thing when I get back where were you finding all the filter coal I was just walking along the the drop and it was when I was searching for gravel I mean I'm not saying like sigh like it was everywhere expansive but it did certainly I remember seeing it and not being that confused about where it was I need 20 to player levels to have absorption hearts that's expensive that's each spencey well there we are it's going again I'm being told that I should make the fortune upgrade you turn this off - oops left that on and it's okay will you calm down do there's so many skeletor's it's pretty calm I'm telling the Skeletor don't calm down there's the thing all right and then that can go in there and let me do a pipe out it's okay it gives us more redstone now I just need me night time third you want to be nighttime obviously yeah there's neither rain I want to know have you ever seen the acid rain have you think I've seen acid rain like I mean you know I know of it I assume I've encountered it or something but I don't know if I would say I've seen it mm-hmm I it's probably for the better I don't think it's a good thing no it doesn't it doesn't seem that good it doesn't seem that ideal but interesting alright well hopefully this is enough of the stuff fingers crossed hopefully you got enough of the stuff there big guy yeah dude that's one that that's what I'm saying so we also got mithril rocky chunks with I think materials a new metal Boris okay what do we do so we just melt that into ingots okay okay so respirator is oh I see it uses coal as a filter fuel that gets consumed I need them on niobium butter hips doing it I don't know of us of any more niobium don't you have a pickaxe that can go and like chop everything and gather all that for us yeah I have the niobium pickaxe I just think I had one extra here we go I do have an AOP make it fantastic I had one spare I'm trying to make the respirators so that we can go below the level of the mist and presumably find good things when I set up the chunk miner there and I don't have to go through a hundred levels before it gets to the good stuff no I mean yeah yeah ender dust and diamonds process to my condenser with it right please cooperate thank you that's down for my fender that's that much worse so indium it's not that in a meme dust is here we go dude there we go there we go I made it alright so we got the Phil trickle I think that that took care of that so now what is the next step staying longer in the mist I discovered that my filter coal gets polluted at varying speeds depending upon where I am below the mist I found that it depends on how far I am away from the center I ain't of the planet I modified my compass now another time so that this device is able to track my distance from the center when I'm below the mist obviously I want to be far away from the center woods this is hey I mean I assume that sounds to me like the lower you go the worse again yeah and no but I'm like apparently not maybe wait I mean we can make a compass and verify no way there's a thing called a mysterious disk that I'm supposed to make using enderpearls and a compass but it's Z it's not Y a little it's Z level don't go near bedre wait why would I can't I just f3 I'm confused oh it's a challenge it's a challenge that it wants me to do so I don't know okay we need a lot of the gravel is there a way to make the misty gravel out of stuff hmm maybe I can just I cannot do it and then what is the next one a new way of resource gathering we need to lift the right crystal yeah I was looking at and ER dustin diamond so we need a lot of the gravel for the inter dust that what a very low on that alright well in that case I can probably go down below the mist and I can set up this yeah vein mining they are the the chunk mining and okay I hope that that will okay so this is still bound I think to here yep oh and then I need some coal ore is a charcoal or does it matter I don't know if you're talking about filtering then charcoal would be the correct thing no ok doesn't matter no no just a fuel source no God dang it it's right back through the portal I turned around and just walk right into it no guys no well I don't have the chest ladies and gentlemen we are good he's got the chest just drop niobium bro nice oh no his iron is not as nice dude [Music] oh my god dude there's so many of the skeletor's can I say how upset I am that they're not actually called skele copters sure go ahead oh dude we are about to what how was the durability going down if I'm freaking okay whatever dude and we out of here we okay that's kind it's kind of terrifying what are you doing I just I I went down into the oh my god there's a lot of gravel there's a lot we need a lot of gravel okay alright so I can be their life I can do this we need this going on in our life okie dokie I'm got you I got you mate get me but good I'm gonna get you gravel dude I'm gonna get you gravel I appreciate that dude check your chest check your chest you're getting hit up hard for that gravel I will be there in about ten seconds nice okay now the pollution is pretty minimal here so that's good keep going up yep our chest is getting a lot of rocks not that much gravel really a lot of soured soil all right I could do I could do manual gravel mining here but let's see you know we're getting a lot of rocks so that's good this doesn't pump how much growling yeah I mean four stacks it's not Alton okay yeah that's definitely okay then I should keep doing this I thought you were gonna say like oh yeah we got just a couple gravel for a minute wait but if that's broken that's kind of stay there think about we've done is the gravel set to go and you are almost maxed but I just emptied it and we're not gonna have nearly enough which means we need a lot more of the diamond again we need more diamond stiffened meshes which I was making the iron the diamond uses is the one just after iron so I make points by making a vein miner buck for the pick oh boy just don't stop can't stop won't stop come on meet me what are you doing what geez big money no losses what are you do Oh chest is full I see hey you want to go manually dump some stuff out yeah cool let me know in good so many rocks just throw them out yeah you're good you're good I'm talking about dude chunk my neck upgrade top-notch and top-notch I've been wondering all right and then I can turn this into this you can enchant meshes with fortune oh I get some orders comes with some kind coming up here that would be very nice know what they are you know we don't really have that many levels though like we don't have a good way to get levels chess is filled again what do you mean we don't have that many levels we don't have a good way to get levels for I guess now you owe for I gotcha yeah I guess now that we have the misty world we can kill some stuff there and get a few levels we only have like 15 in our storage wow I just barely emptied this too I need to figure out what to do with any of this oh I'm out of fuel okie dokie that's all she wrote for now but I can always head back my just need to do a little bit of uh repairs but it okay alright so how much gravel you get about seven stacks that's pretty good starting boy right yeah man we have for sure awesome or that in there okay so let's see we got a tiny piles not very many tiny piles of vendor dust not a great deal all right yeah yeah no I throw em all in but ya know it doesn't it's it's not like here you take all of them but I I think that the enchanted sibs would be great it's just figuring out a good way to get can you see yeah I wonder can you throw a sieve into an enchantment table directly like it just works Umesh yeah sorry yeah mesh you can just throw a mesh in doing the shamon table and I'll just do it yeah I think so okay so it basically from what I understand it's it's just a different way of doing the default you take the item you put it over and then it hovers and it shows you how many levels and how much laughs ease and stuff and then you can change the page so you've got the three different so it looks like it's just the vanilla here can you take it off game shakers off yeah just over done let's take this that works and make it difficult this is all this is all mumbo jumbo to me dude well it doesn't show you anything but that night it doesn't vanillin right I mean okay you've gotta at least as far as I know I don't know if there's a way to pull stuff off mana pylons what mana pylons be useful for well I mean we have a bunch of those yeah I just saw you know use those and I was like but for what maybe them not saying there isn't do about you I'm just gonna help me out here throw are you belittling mana pylons after everything you mana pylons or everything that they have done for you we need to construct additional pylons mm-hmm that's a Starcraft reference right the fact that you had any sort of questioning in your tone disappoints me a bro I played Starcraft like once sir tons what why are you so silent I don't understand I didn't realize you were like a big Starcraft boy I played a lot of StarCraft did you oh ok were you grandmaster not competitively because I like that fun instead of compete but it but I did play it a lot with friends and stop doing that sorry my bad no it's just a freaking portal were you a grandmaster probably not I was pretty good were you diamond I didn't play competitively so Oh like when you say competitively you didn't plan either ranked modes I see well what are you whatever it is tile sponge name-o I love my entire sponge name every time I find title anything I'm like ah good old tiles bunch name [Music] dials buns name but yeah ores this is all day bacterial shale interesting I mean at some point I needed to craft bacteria oops and maybe bacterial shale could have been an alternative way to do that I don't know hmm wait oops I'm good at things get the exp upgrade for your axe pickable oh my god dude it's just my family is on an upgrade train dude he's like you need all the upgrades bro upgrade the upgrades mode you're doing it hard mode good every upgrade you could possibly do get the vein minor upgrade get to get all the upgrades get every upgrade you get an upgrade and you get a sir for flexible tools ok range upgrade mines 3x3 and increases attack range or detector mines orders from the deep what the what is that like auto or detection then be nutty bro vein upgrade mine's a vein of similar blocks magnet upgrade drops items head to player so you did the receiver upgrade right ah yes the receiver upgrade is necessary for the chunk mining right oh it's getting all dark under here it's really creepy luck upgrade increases looting unfortunate don't upgrade XP that just increases XP from mobs dude it's like it's like some kind of ominous kind of thing in Jurassic Park or something oh god dude something's just about to pop out of the fog and destroy me yeah bro it's so creepy I don't like being here well and I think that's exactly the place you should be why do you hate me so much it's not hate it's a matter of believing that you should confront your fears I believe the chest is filled I'm in a different dimension that's a problem I didn't realize that my role was to sit there and drink your chest for you it is yes you should be manning the chest you are chest man at I mean your chest man you what a man who man's no I'm not not inaccurate but not applicable either like you are the man who does benchpress chest man am I now hmm it's like you know me I did legs today I didn't do just let's see what we have over here is this like a oh oh I think the server is waiting I haven't been through the thing for a little bit oh is that it oh it's like an ocean it's like an ocean in my pocket oh acid that's good that is good I like a co shion's I wanted some blaze rods but I can't find any blazes because as long as you're looking for mobs they won't show up are you okay I have found a many gravel you you have found all the gravel I have hit gravel jackpot there's a jackpot many many gravel it's very good good I'm glad that this has happened for us this has been a boon upon our families oh god wait is this thing mining all the way from the south how do I see chunk boundaries again oh dear 9 isn't it no that's my start stop record button so controls where would I change that to changed it to something it's something you can bet your bottom dollar it's something where what did I what did I make it hmmm don't know what I made it uh-oh the chest needs to be emptied anyway all right there big guy no I'm trying to figure out where I did what I did how did you do what you've done there's like no one here oh oh you just do f3g I can you're right alright good good idea with the vanilla chunk boundaries there we go okay well I guess all I'm getting back oh you are okay fantastic can you do a chest clean out dude and that would be super duper that would be super duper mm-hmm yeah you're doing something to like beat on that old server though no I would never sing a frickin Grabel pillar dude ah thanks don't do that don't do that oh I see no this this is it's leads up to the mountain I see leads up to the mountain to the mountain you shall go hey you got one niobium or annihilations it's very exciting yeah I mean not that exciting but a little exciting all right tell me what you when it's when it's good I'm good you're good you're good all right like we go listen to the gravel listen to the gravel I can't hear it I can't hear it I hear nothing a lot of gravitas okay am i you should be seeing gravel for days dude gravel for days I am the gravel master oh my god there's so much so much well it just just stop the gravel just keeps going it's beautiful it's a beautiful sight to behold oh my goodness dude you have no idea the gravel that you should be beholding so much gravel that I might have to poop in a moment what what I might I might have to poop in a mine I just thought you should know I don't this is not my normal time of day but it's you know when when duty calls oh crap there's so much gravel going it's amazing this is gonna be like this is gonna be like 10 20 stacks dude well I'll just sit here continuing to empty this chest for you then I guess yep yep yep rammer I will vein mine things soon okay but for now dude it's just Britain this will be a limitless lifetime supply of gravel and then I'll be able to focus on the vein mining I just wish you were here to watch yeah yeah sounds pretty cool I'm looking at a chest so oh you're seeing how quickly it fills over the gravel it's pretty amazing yeah let's go with that all right cool and we basically reached the bottom of the gravel there my pickaxe running out of durability as well so we'll call that all in a day's work right there nice an absolute win and my respiration is gonna go bad in a moment so that's a good time to dip out all right whoo good times how many stacks looks like it was a seems like it was a good trip yeah dude few stacks of gravel in niobium and then see oh my god dude oh my god were balling literally 20 stacks of gravel it's amazing it's amazing what happens why are you so dude why are you so cynical about the whole thing when like that's what you said you need it was lots of gravel you're in excitement doesn't seem to be excited that's what she anyway it's fine mithril ingots sound pretty cool yeah I put those in the the wash wash yeah no wash I don't know what that means the furnace you know mint mithril ingots though oh well you pulled those from the furnace yeah I just I put them into the or chest anyway I'm gonna smelt some nugs okay good gold nuts that here you're going with gold to your option there we go yeah yeah all right so oh wow there's a lot of rocks over there we got some we got some ender dust though that's pretty sweet so I don't know let's take a look this soured soil and there was an acid soil acidic sand sour soil there's a lot of them and they don't dude dingus they don't do dingus now that acidic sand okay that can be used in general sand type manners yeah so it's this it expands just a sand but soiled soil soured soil is tilled sour you try saying that fast okay so with array is [Music] and and dim iam I hate don't like that and endymion dust is that's still the under dust in the diamond dust oh shoot did you just throw the inner dust into the thing and convert it into pearls yep mm-hmm yep yep yep yep mmm yeah I did I did do that yeah I did also do that with the I did also did it with the diamond dust oh yeah oh yeah so that's gone well that was what I was working on but I was just waiting for the gravel to sift uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah that's that's good time it's okay cuz we there's got to be some dust right there's probably dust if no there's no dust there um there's I'm sure yeah we could we can put some dust into here and just uh you know just get some just you get some of that going to just mix and dust with the gravel who thought it was I thought it was interpersonal and us no no it's the dust I I know that for this is a mistake that I will be sure to never make again uh-huh a mistake to only be made once I promise okay bad at least yep mm-hmm I understand I am sorry about that so uh yeah I'll just um we do need diamonds to repair the pickaxe though so you know at least they got some of those good that's good that's pretty I would say we were we were gonna need that so that's good I'll go get some more ash I'm gonna I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do that okay sounds pretty good I'm not gonna do that can we sleep when I pick this up I guess I can't uh yeah sure it's been it's been very rainy today yeah it has dude must be like winter already oh look at all this frickin dirt over here bro yeah yeah just do it wait does that mean I can't pick these up what what do they need to be empty no maybe my pickaxe back okay so let's see what we got here dude put that down and get ourselves some ash all right um actually shouldn't just leave this it'll totally where the pickaxe down but I am gonna need to go bathroom they're good just so you know oh it looks like the chest is filled up okay yeah yeah it looks pretty full oh cool just a quick quick dumper ooh and then we'll probably be good all right I thought you're talking with the chest but then that could also be you know it's both is double entendre yeah heck is this oh okay all right I guess whatever it's probably fine I have got to run to the bathroom so I'll see what you got to entertain the people entertain the people he says having assigned me to watching a chest fill up and making sure it doesn't fill up and I am to make this entertaining okay that's I mean it's it's advanced work but I'll do the best that I can see what I'm doing right now is I'm looking in that chest and I'm thinking what are those things that we don't need in that chest and if we don't need them in that chest then can I possibly move them to a different chest and not have to do this by hand but as of right now still doing it by hand that's okay we'll we'll get to a point where we aren't doing it by hand someday and I believe so if I take these items and and this now that I have this upgrade I can take a couple obsidian and make a void upgrade so that way if I can get them in a drawer with a void upgrade then they'll just disintegrate into nothingness and I don't ever have to see them again in my life that's not how you make a void upgrade actually is it just sticks on top might be sticks I I remembered okay so there's a fully upgrade I was I'm sorry guys I was just trying to avoid that that and then there's the way to upgrade and I'm gonna need my key which is right here and then I'm gonna take these terrible soured soils and basically anything that I don't want much of gonna put it in here I'm assuming the rocks I probably don't want that much of them the rocks seem barely it useless the sand this this acidic sand maybe even the forced dirt you know I don't know just going crazy over here acidic Sam for spirit we're just gonna we're just gonna wrap it up here there you go and that's all four of them and I'll lock it and now it's locked I can pick it up I can put it there and hopefully now I have a bunch of that stuff on me in my inventory and I click on the drawer controller then it just goes away and it stores it and we'll have some but at the same time it will just go away so that solves some of that problem the next step is to get this pumping faster because it's so slow so slow guys we have a couple of different options there one is I can surround it with more engines maybe that will try that at first cuz thats that's cheap and easy you know he but he Minds so fast it's like I don't need it ninety percent of the time but when I do need it I need it like now let's see oh right need some sticks got him and then take that away and make some gears I need some more sticks which we have a lot of sticks over here so sticks are not a limiting factor and one two one two one two one two those there we go and then create these engines done I need two levers which we should have plenty of right there and if I surround this with extra engines it should go extra Wells there's one lever on all right I have returned welcome back sorry I don't usually intend to take breaks like that well streaming my apologies hopefully wasn't too long are we good on Ash do you think we kind of just all sat in silence we didn't get very much ash at all oh oh really all right Oh a that are just Auto filtered out but no it's not shifting anything so doesn't seem like we got much ash okeydoke I am getting some more I hooked up extra engines to be point okay that's better a little bit of space I washed my hands everybody my goodness every time every time no I like if it's if it's just a pee and I don't always wash my hands because they I don't actually touch anything but yes I course I wash my hands it's just he goes off the dangle method guys don't worry about it um [Music] alright do you think we're good on Ash now like I feel like this is pretty a lot that I've gotten it's like two elf ones worth really yeah it's not well I'm out of uh fuel anyway so ah let's see how's it look okay make sure you double check my work no I just I just wanted to see for my own eyes so I know about how much how long it takes to accumulate a particular amount that's all I don't not trust you geez Bobby sponge me that's a thing that's a thing we got some foggy sponge meet here guys grab him there oh oh I bet you the foggy sponge meat was that's what I mind with the flexible act pit bull and I was like I found tile named sponge oh yeah that's what I came from that makes sense that makes sense all right so we're getting some ash all that's going into places okay so let's see what's next on the achievement agenda okay we need the little right what about miniaturization that's a whole thing but that's what we do need to do that so it is a it is quite the endeavor hmm and I don't know how does it do it so I assume it's sort of step by step right so in the field projector okay you can get the field projector oh we had we had a field projector require oh you did actually we need weak but well no no no so we need we need to make the lasers for lasers and then for that something different okay gotcha yeah and then and I had looked into this and was started but then we needed the ender pearl and that's where that got stopped so yeah we have that we have the clock of coppers and we have a couple lasers already okay just one just one so we need to make three more lasers all right which is our tight which we should have plenty of so you should be good there cool sounds good to me yep our tight redstone and I think I should have some obsidian still one obsidian all righty then are we out of obsidian ah we are I'll go get some more I can make it happen sorry I can make all right but this happened it's okay it's okay don't worry about it I forgive you thanks I forgive you for all the things that you have done I wonder if it'd be better to just change this over drop that into a chest and have that be a drop pipe but then that'd be too slow still hmm there better know that gravity is the slow one right you fool oh shoot I forgot the wrench you fool I was talking to the minor thing it was being a fool what what what is happening help you just teleported you're fine no no no it's sorry it was the thing was freaking out it's okay everything is fine so you not make the mysterious disk no I've not I mean you can make it that's a sample obvious a lot of it's a lot of ender pearls for something that we don't necessary yeah that's what I was kind of thinking something that we don't immediately need it's a lot of lot ender pearls my thoughts exactly right so you know the gravel add this to the sieve dang it's what's wrong now just dealing with this lava gosh darn lava and it's gosh darn properties it is annoying I would agree I would agree all right so you were getting obsidian for the lasers I'm trying to do then we had the copper and we already have the ender pearl okay so that's all that's all good yeah well that leaves us stuck on pretty much all of the things well we have trajectory at least yeah good my codex I always wanted it that's done all right here we are Frick Oh God the trees are gonna be crazy aren't they I believe you've done this all right I've got ten obsidian now much did I need again that is all but we could use a little bit spare probably if you don't want to get it right now we plan to get it right now it's all good doesn't have to be right now but what if it worked okay sure we'll go with that no chump line the Obsidian I forgot about that I forgot about that seems like that would've been useful to do would have been I gave him totally totally did not have the presence of mind to think about it that would be easier next time they'll now I'll never forget it's a mistake that I'll never make a good one it's a one-time mistake and you know what it's okay for make mistakes making a mistake it's just one one step in terms of practicing - getting be an expert what he said yeah graduations on your laser power I'm out here doing it you are doing it all okay so copper block and ender pearl oh you got our miniaturization fueled projectors so do you know where this leads to in terms of what why it's important yeah like most of the machines and stuff that we do our need to be miniaturized like the solder er is made via miniaturization and the solder being of course the part that allows us to start making refined storage those I see that sounds important so yeah I need to make compact machine walls which I assume is just saved a requirement that's needed in order to do you know like just like we need the wattle and daub and the concrete and stuff like that yeah wall around and dab what the wattle I'm just envisioning that is like a move you pull up you waddle around and then dab that's what this is dude yeah yeah no I know it's what it is it's just I don't want to you know like everyone's very upset on my end about it every no reason honestly yeah I know that's the part that makes everyone mad I thought it was good I think anyone who's anyone who denies it is wrong it's 2019 dabbing his relevance it's always been okay all right so how do I make compact machine walls wondering if a storm kicked up some allergens or something I just got this sniffle using generally feeling kind of Mickey I yeah all right this is the thing throw-in this into the wine throw this into the what what how do I do what this is I've hit a point of confusion all right what are you trying to do compact balls yeah what my door module you broke my door so do I like put these down it says this has to be in the miniaturization field uh-huh missing opposite field projector what they tell you how to do them no I assume it's a three by three nobody would do like that and they're like frickin missing opposite field projector he's a three by three by three inside of it so this would be three by three inside of it okay so it is like it is a plus like this and like that and then really we're putting this yes okay we can put it elsewhere I mean I place it two blocks above what okay where should I place it let's come up here cuz we might it's probably need powers so we have all this right here okay um I don't know two blocks above what mmm it doesn't need power apparently okay that's nice two blocks above you still have the block breaker on you know I put it back in its normal wall spot okay yeah we have this failed nether portal here oh yeah I've been a good way to get obsidian it's like this what needs to be at the center of the three but I'm so confused are you figuring it out alright kind of maybe it's like you're figuring it out what oh wait this is way bigger than I thought I
