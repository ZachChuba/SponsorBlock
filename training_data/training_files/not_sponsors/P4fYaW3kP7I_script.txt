welcome back everybody to Tesla driver today I'm gonna show you some of the visualization updates really quickly in his higher quality as we can so you can hopefully see that the car now picks up pedestrians moving in a certain direction so I've got Holly in front of me here and she's just gonna walk straight in front of the car for us and let's see what it picks up there you go so it can pick her up there and it is showing her walking in the right direction sometimes she's coming back across again there you go you see so it does actually give her the direction of travel that she's moving in you can see her legs walking and she's clearly pointing in that direction it doesn't always pick her up perfectly so let's see if she turns as she walks will it show her walking away from the car oh there you go actually it's showing her walking towards the car but it has got her faced straight on so if she walks to the car now let's see if it shows her getting closer that's pretty confident actually that was pretty good okay it came off again and as she walks by it kind of gets it but again with all of the stones with all little rocks there's a lot going on here for the car to kind of struggle and see but it does need to obviously see a human so yet again it's a little bit hit and miss there but now we have got a new update with cones so if holly puts down two cones here you'll see them nice and clearly on our screen on our visualization and it shows her as well and now if she kicks them over hopefully they should show themselves on their side let's see if this actually works it has hasn't yeah it hasn't really worked let's see what happens if she puts one all the way to the back there it's landed and again it's still showing it stood up throw the other one try and get it on its side and it's hard and that was quite impressive is it gonna show them on their side it's not showing them on the side it's still showing them stood up there you can see at the back those two there stood up still and you can also see that it is remembering where some of these cones are and not actively moving them so she trying to put them upside down now let's see if that makes any difference on the screen here does oh there we go it showed it actually fallen over for a split second it's still okay so Holly yeah like that let's see it's still showing one falling over or it kind of are it's so confused it's not a hundred percent sure at what it sees it's getting really confused with the SUV as well there we go it actually showed it okay there's now apparently oh wow okay it's really confused at what's in front of us but you can see at the back there there is definitely a code that has fallen over let me move across to it there we go look at that cone it is definitely fallen over it seems to think there's an SUV in front of us but there's definitely not it can pick up Holly there as well which is pretty impressive Holly's gonna walk pass with a bike here let's see what the car picks up now it is in fact showing a bike and it does show her going in the correct direction that was really quite impressive actually let's see what it looks like if she comes back to us with it and if she comes at the car will it show the difference now this should show a person and a bike in theory but it showed her a car now it's showing a person walking away from us yeah it didn't pick up oh there we go it actually did so it did pick up a bike for a split second it then put it into the radar sensing mode as she came past us but it did show us a bike for a split second the final two things this visualization update sees of course is the bins you can see that there are bins behind us there are bins in fact in front of the car but it's not picking them up correctly or it's just not seeing them so Holly's gonna walk in front of the car now with the bin and let's see yet look at that it's picking the bin up it's picking her up and in fact it's pretty much tracking where the bin when now I wonder if because it thinks bins and cones or stationary objects it's a little bit confused because the the thing was actually moving so that's maybe why it's tracking it and placing it in separate locations again walking to us it's actually showing her with a bin behind means that was really really good for a split second that looked awesome and finally we're gonna try and mimic some signs here Holly is gonna hold up my iPad which has got a stop sign on it and look at that that is perfect you can see that it's actually got Holly there and it's got the stop sign behind her so let's see if I go forward I'm just gonna drive forward here will it will it be in the correct location it's not quite in the correct location it actually thinks the stones at the back of the house as where the stop sign is but that's pretty impressive let's see if she moves does the stop yes the stop sign moves as well that is absolutely brilliant as she is moving the stop sign itself is moving around that is so so cool to see next up I've got some traffic lights now this is just some colored lights in circles it's not showing it on the screen let's see if she walks around a bit maybe it might pick it up if she gets a little bit closer yes it is look at that it is in fact showing traffic lights and it's actually showing none of them the correct color Holly can you put your hand over the red and the yellow light by any chance can you cover two of them no so covering some of the colors doesn't seem to activate the car in thinking that the one colour it can see is available if we swipe on the iPad I've then got another traffic light that does in fact show just one light so let's see what it thinks of this one and also interesting about this one is it's an american-style traffic light so will it pick it up at all it's not showing the colors it's very clear to me that the green is on no it's not picking up the green maybe zoom in like so it's full screen is it gonna pick it up at all no maybe walk to the other side of the car let's see if it moves the traffic lights I'm actually wondering if it's picking it up at all let's go all the way back let's go all the way back because I haven't seen it actually move the traffic light or do anything with the traffic light for a while now I don't think it's picking the traffic light up you know and finally we're going to test out some speed limit signs so apparently in this update it can now read speed limit signs as of the man you'll but as you can see there is definitely no speed limit science coming up here if we see this it should as we drive past it register that this is now a 50 and now in theory it should have a speed limit at the top saying 50 but as you can clearly see it is definitely not showing that there's an American 50 speed limit and let's see again is it going to see it at all is it gonna register it we're not seeing any 50 sign pop up there's definitely no notice of the car seeing that as a 50 sign and that's it everybody I hope you enjoyed this new video showing you the visualization updates it's basically just moving in the direction of travel and showing the legs of the humans and stuff and as you can also see it is picking up cones on the side which is cool I guess until next time don't forget drive safe
