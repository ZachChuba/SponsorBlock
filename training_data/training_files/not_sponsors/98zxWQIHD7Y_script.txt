in the popular memory of the summer of 1940 the battle of britain takes center stage the common narrative is that the luftwaffe came very close to gaining air superiority over england during july august and september that if it had then german invasion and conquest of the british isles would have swiftly followed this video will argue that this is wrong that operating sea line was in fact a fundamentally bad idea with or without air superiority [Music] reflects the very real fears that people in 1940 had that the luftwaffe was unstoppable and that invasion was imminent on land at least this fear was definitely justified the british army had been effectively disarmed by its retreat from france losing vast amounts of equipment on the beaches of dunkirk the british also worried about how well their air force and navy would fare given how dominant the luftwaffe had been in france this concern was driven by air ministry estimates which gave the luftwaffe twice as many aircraft as they actually had for example instead of the two and a half thousand bombers the british believe the luftwaffe to possess in reality there were only 988 but with these terrifying projections as the only information available the british fear that the luftwaffe could easily gain air superiority and destroy the royal navy from the air in july 1940 the first sea lord admirals of dudley pound stated that the admiralty could not guarantee the germans would not be able to land up to a hundred thousand men on the south coast before the navy could intervene as the main body of the home fleet would need to be based far to the north to avoid luftwaffe bombing in port the prospect of arriving in the channel to intercept an invasion fleet was very slim with these pessimistic assessments of britain's air and sea strength ringing in the government's ears all the stops were pulled out to transform britain into a fortress the first of eighteen thousand coastal pillboxes were assembled over half a million volunteers joined the home guard armed with any and all weapons that could be found at the time a network of obstacles and stop lines were constructed to frustrate the german invasion for as long as possible all this work was carried out at breakneck speed giving rise to this sense of mortal peril that dominated the british psyche at this time unknown to the british though the vermont had not given serious thought to a cross-channel invasion hitler was convinced that once the french were defeated then the british would have no choice but to make peace with germany when this capitulation was not forthcoming the german high command was caught flat-footed with no clear alternative plan to end the war quickly when the british showed their ruthless determination to carry on the fight by destroying the vici french fleet anchored at merzel kabir planning for an invasion of britain was begun in earnest in mid-july franz holder the chief of staff at the army high command okh outlined a plan which called for landing 13 divisions on a huge front between ramsgate and lime regis with subsequent waves to take the invading force up to 39 divisions alfred yodel at the vimac high command okw produced a paper around the same time that argued that the invasion of britain was merely a river crossing on a broad front this attitude incensed the creek's arena as steven bungie notes rivers are not tidal not subject to violent storms and are generally not patrolled by the enemy's high seas fleet the navy thought hitler and okw were out of their minds admiral eric raider commander in chief of the greece arena protested vigorously to hitler what the navy graft and what holder and yearl perhaps didn't was the overwhelming strength of the royal navy in comparison to the crease arena ships lost in the norway campaign meant that in destroyers so critical for protecting transport the german navy could only deploy ten between shir ness and harrage alone the royal navy had 30 destroyers part of a total of 86 on duty somewhere around the british isles on top of this the british home fleet rested its scarf afloat with eight capital ships and 11 cruisers around the country 700 armed fast patrol craft 35 submarines and 165 minesweepers of various types had all been assembled to frustrate any invasion attempt such was the scale of germany's naval disadvantage that decided the invasion front had to be reduced for the final sea lion plan by september the focus of the attack was to be between foxton and celesy bill with 67 000 troops landed in the first wave rising to 138 000 within two days however even with this smaller front it's still hard to see how the german ships could keep a safe channel open in the face of a determined attack by the royal navy now the great german counter to the threat of the british fleet was air superiority which the luftwaffe was to deliver by smashing the raf right from the start of the battle of britain though the germans were losing and losing badly between july 10th and 31st 185 luftwaffer aircraft were destroyed compared to 91 losses for the raf over the course of the entire battle the germans lost over 800 more planes than the british and for all these losses the german bombing campaign was a dismal failure during the three months of the battle only 17 severe bomb hits were sustained to britain's critical industries including aircraft production and the ports through which raw materials flowed as a result fighter command was able to maintain its number of deployed fighters with 640 on july 1st actually rising to 648 on september 1st now it's true that the raf was hard pressed for pilots more so than planes at times during the battle but this was even more the case for the germans as the engagements took place over english soil a good proportion of downed raf pilots could be returned to duty but all german pilots shot down would be lost to the war effort so far from as a periodic being a girl for the luftwaffe narrowly failed to achieve by switching targets to london in reality it was a totally unattainable goal a battle fought on unfavorable ground against a much more powerful adversary than is often thought let's imagine though for the sake of argument that germany is by some miracle able to destroy the raf and take air superiority over england does this mean sea lion would be successful well not really this argument is dependent on the idea that the luftwaffe would be able to keep the royal navy well away from any landing areas so that it can't prevent resupply and reinforcement of a beachhead in england however it's not clear this would have been the case the germans in 1940 had only a handful of he-115 torpedo bombers and their dive bombers did not yet possess a bomb of high enough caliber to penetrate british battleship decom not to mention german pilots were trained to attack stationary fortifications or slow-moving troop concentrations not ships that could travel 30 knots and carry out evasive maneuvers to throw off their aim even with their superiority it's gonna be pretty hard for the luftwaffe to prevent the home fleet from disrupting the second and third waves of invasion troops and this is the key point the question of whether sea lion can succeed is not getting troops across the channel in the first place it is resupply and reinforcement of those troops once the first wave lands the royal navy will know exactly where to go to intercept subsequent transports and can throw dozens of destroyers and cruisers and if it needed to its capital shipped into the channel to cause mayhem the kris arena would have been powerless to prevent this and the luftwaffe are not really much better in a scenario with total german control of the sky it's likely the british fleet would suffer heavy losses to bombing into u-boats besides the sheer size of it it likely wouldn't matter all the raw navy would need to do is to make it too dangerous to attempt to resupply the troops ashore for a few days perhaps up to a week until the german position became untenable in a historical situation with the raf very much fighting in mid-september operation sea lion becomes a delusional operation with no reasonable chance of success phillips patient o'brien pulls no punches in his summary calling sea lion preposterous it was an operation which needed every single variable to go in the german's favor to have even a prospect of success as steven bungie knows everything had to go right the raf had to be neutralized the royal navy had to be deterred by mines u-boats and air attack and the weather had to be benign this last point is especially important considering that the invasion would take place as autumn storms began to grip the channel in september and be carried out by 1700 converted river barges that would sink in anything other than a light swell it is hard to see sea lion as anything other than a plan of desperation bungie concludes it's hard to disagree sea lion was a fool's errand an operation which you've carried out would have led to nothing but the deaths or capture of tens of thousands of german troops it was fundamentally a bad
