this week raga myself have six tasks we need to complete quicker than the other player the quicker we complete these tasks the more spins we'll get on our gear randomizer as you can see on screen a set up will be randomized for us and then each task we complete gives us extra spins for each slot to try and get better gear in that slot the challenges are as follows starting from hardest to easiest get a PK worth 20 spins get an ancient char drop worth 20 spins get a clue unique worth 10 spins get an ecumenical key 10 spins complete a wise old man tasks 5 spins get a looting bag drop 5 spins whoever completes all of these tasks the quickest gets an extra 7 spins to use as well all tasks can be completed in any way we want and obviously the gear we land on is the gear we fight each other in you think my you kidding me these and jeans of super satisfied ok two hours on the clock to complete these six tasks if one of us doesn't complete all the tasks or misses out on one or two then you have a way higher chance of getting [ __ ] agir to be honest so we're to go ahead and do this I'm gonna get the looting bag first unfortunately can't do the rats in the wilderness because the the new for ox clan was last man standing area has now taken over that so the rats aren't there anymore they used to be really easy to get a eluting bag from but I'm just gonna do the thugs because that shouldn't be too difficult one in 15 dropped right let's start the clock and let's go in here and hopefully get it pretty much instantly and bag ourselves five points from getting the looting back there she is the looting bag took a little bit longer actually 27 thugs I killed it so 1 in 15 so that's a little bit [ __ ] but there we go 5 points on the board ok next up we have to ask the wise old man for an easy task I believe I want to make some arrows so I'll need some headless arrows that have been about how the feathers attached please bring me 15 ok so let's grab a axe out of the bank this should be a really easy one that we can complete really nicely I know they're all pretty easy but this one is like one that I can just go ahead and do pretty much in this area grab that so we are doing this from scratch okay so we cut the log and then if I just go and kill a chicken over here we need 15 so might need to kill multiple chickens but we need 15 headless arrows with the feathers attached there we go let's do that and boom and there we go 15 headless arrows let's go ahead and keep these in and that is another toss down for another 5 points alright guys and welcome to the video so we have a bunch of tasks that we can complete for points that ultimately gets translated into gear the more points we have the more potential we have to get better gear now the hard tasks look like the meta definitely they give the most points but there's two tasks that are kind of close to each other that I think I can do really quick the looting bag one and also the ecumenical key which is an easy and medium so I'm gonna send those first together I think I can get them pretty quickly hopefully within 15 minutes I can get both done and then we're gonna go on to the other tasks the more difficult tasks but I don't know my full game plan yet I'm just gonna send it see how lucky we get off the bat but let's start that timer guys and fly on into the video but you got to right-click that so first up we are killing these little rats because they have wow am i using dragon darts in my axe using dragon darts for this what's the respawn rate either way I'm gonna focus on killing these very very small low leveled rats I'll probably kill these two if they attack me but the looting bag is the same chance from everything in the wildy so this should take no time at all to get as you can see I mean I'm one shotting everything at least I'd hope so with dragon darts right and there we go guys super quick wow we're less than three minutes in the competition next up we have to actually head north it's probably fastest just to walk there didn't bring a stay I'm gonna pop shouldn't be too bad as you can see I'm already all geared up to you know get full protection while I'm in there the Bandos armadyl sammy and sarah blow pipe we're gonna probably gonna kill the imps and like the pyar fiends the ice fiends to really really low good ones in there so hopefully we can get this in just a few minutes and there it is after fifty nine kills where is it where is it where is it I don't even know where it is I have kill everything awesome let's tell you out let's secure this that is two tasks done okay let's take a look at what we got now bloody hell rain always that was actually well worth it okay cool okay next up we are gonna be opening gourmet Tim planes to try and get ourselves a easy clue before we got one speak to the lady of the lake okay let's grab some Telly's okay spoken to her and search the crate in the hideous kitchens okay oh we got it come on give me a unique straightaway I think it's like one in eighteen [ __ ] okay we're gonna have to go get another clue that's annoying and this is where the problems can arise you know you could do like 18 clothes and not get a you need okay here's another one come on open open [ __ ] right back to opening gourmets come on third one yes Sammi page Anna berry black it back in the same 160k not bad okay cool that's that task done right next up I'm going for the a Kiki just wearing stuff so that I don't get attacked I'm just gonna go completely rogue in here and kill anything that's close to dying obviously gonna be targeting the Imps as well looks like nothing's attacking each other have I got one oh no there we go I was about to say I swear they [ __ ] attack each other in here so one in sixty from anything in here it's the chance of getting a key so yeah as I say just gonna start putting [ __ ] things into pretty much everyone and just hoping that we get some sort of drop somewhere wow that was quick wow wow wow okay let's get out of here beautiful Wow we're smashing through these tasks like a dumb dumb dumb quick you know what I already have a glory on so let's go to draynor village and see what the wise old man has in store for us right I'm not exactly sure what to do I'd like some maces made of bronze please bring me three okay cool so what we're gonna do is actually go mine some tin and some copper really quick so it's gonna run pickaxe you know I never thought I'd be making bronze Mace's in a PvP challenge right this has got to be tinned is there no copper here if there isn't that's such a letdown I know there is on the other side of our arc so I guess I'm have to run there really quick crap actually if I go to Lumbridge nah [ __ ] it we'll do it we'll just run east we'll just run east we got our stands out mind that really quick tele fally smelt it tele back to varrock Smith it boom okay so this should be the next task completed do all I have to do was talk to him I gotta go through the frickin dialog what do you give me would he give me ooh I mean cool nice all right next up let's take a look at the list looting bag done wise old man done ecumenical key done clue from unique I might try to go for an ancient shard drop first but that might take a while the clue unique I imagine I could do Easy's pretty quick I could thieve them really really really fast and it's right here it's literally right down the road just east okay you know what we're gonna try for some easy clue Scrolls see if we can get unique and yeah alright maybe beginners better but I'm just so much more familiar with easy so we're gonna take that approach and there's the first clue scroll right probably one of many solicitous and I even think about it and fly right into this why not just use that tell you when I have my construction came that was a bit odd that was nothing a bit odd right there what we've got next is that is the hard task get an ancient shard or get a PK I'm going for the PK cuz I think I've got a good idea on how to get a really easy totally trashed PK okay so my plan is I'm pretty sure nice server lag that's exactly what you want to see when you're about to risk D clause um I'm pretty sure people jump into PvP worlds and would cut here at the wood cutting guild so I'm gonna go up to the top of the redwoods I think and we will go ahead and I'll log in up here see if anyone's up here shut this back in see if we can kill someone okay so this is it caught me [ __ ] - our best oh really you know that's let's go for this switch come on come on okay there's one over there level 99 I can't kill him [ __ ] human 100 500 just outside no come on someone down there 1t1 here we go here we go guys here we go one two two I'm gonna look up both of their defenses if the wiki high scores odds super slow they are okay cool I'm bit nervous ur right let's chuck the protect from item on and we're gonna attack go attack this guy and and come on yes we got it straight off straight off the bat turn that off beautiful so I've been doing this clue scroll for only like three minutes or so not even two and a half minutes and I believe this is going to be the last one I think it's just super fast yeah first one unique is that a unique I'm gonna actually have to like clarify I mean it technically is a unique so all the tasks are complete except for the two hearts so of course you know we want to go for that shard first without much of a PK err and on top of all that you know just browsing these guys I think this is gonna be super quick to get truthfully oh my gosh barrage and dragon darts toxic blowpipe to lure them this is gonna be so quick this is gonna be so quick so the only thing we really have to worry about is the PK but we have to make sure we really get the PK because I could see myself going an hour and a half and not getting a kill because I'm bad I'm gonna have to go to like lob dragons or try to pick somebody off and be dark both spec somebody or something I'm not sure how I'm gonna do it but uh yeah I might have to concern myself it allude too much oh my gosh they just all spawned at the same exact time that was pretty crazy where is it where is it where is the mercy Asian shard ooh yes guys I don't even know how many kills that was because it's very hard to track me doing bras you kill like seven in one barrage cast you only get credit for one kill so I don't know how many kills that was but I can say it did take a while look at the time an hour and eight minutes although just overall I think all the other ones we're pretty quick and we probably still got that under the drop rate which or at least close it's one in 246 but we need to get a PK so I don't even know exactly what I'm gonna do yet but we got to figure out the best place to PK I'm thinking of like I don't know maybe in revs dark Bois specking somebody I don't know I got a prey on some weak individual because I can't get a 1v1 PK I can tell you that right now alright that's like pretty quick to gear up so I know this is nothing like a legit PK or setup and of course we'll fill about foo but I plan on just mailing somebody and hopefully they can't protect from melee and then I just go like this and maybe spec them out hopefully get like a 35 35 spec or something I'm gonna go buy the Rev caves or maybe I'll kind of wait I don't know I'll wait somewhere by the Rev cave let's fill up on mantas let's get a burning amulet out III probably gonna die a few times truthfully this is gonna be fun and interesting and by fun I mean very stressful but probably exciting for you guys to watch so let's not waste any time oh if there's any actual PK is I'm [ __ ] though that's that's the problem I don't want to actually fight a PK because I'm a little [ __ ] lovely lovely lovely please don't I only needed one eye he needed one nice that's such a scumbag thing to do but there we go there's the PK I'm so happy that worked I'm so happy that worked okay next up is getting an ancient shard and I think this is gonna be the quickest way is just barging these neck rules so that that's what I'm gonna go ahead and do didn't actually have any magic shield slot thing so I'm actually naked in that slot so you know don't blame me for that but I didn't want to waste time like buying stuff you know so I was just like [ __ ] it we'll just send it without a shield slot so yeah don't don't don't don't flame me please I'm wearing this slayer helm because a lot of people when they see that you're not wearing a slayer hum will just crash you so this means the people just you know don't crash me which is nice but yeah I hope you can get an agent charred I'm gonna have to keep a lookout cuz I don't think they pop up on GA tracker maybe they do and we will see it's a 1 in 196 from neck reels from the Great Neck rules so you know it's not a it's not a common drop it could take some time to get we will see but this is where it's really gonna count for me and kins who can get this the quickest oh my god I just got it I just got - where's the other one ancient shot - I'm gonna have to edit the things underneath this out because it is actually from the other PvP challenge but look at that 10 great stop the clock stop the clock done what okay we have the bracelet of a three I'm also stamina pod I had to go back and kind of get that 84 like could I attack civil 84 I can't really stressed about that not have it a nice hopefully easy kill I got like I I hate to do this I got a prey on somebody like this although I'm gonna trying to find somebody a little bit more lowered leveled less HP easier to spec because I want to make it as easy as possible and myself but if it's you know if it's hard to find people I'll have to resort on you know like the whole 86 I can attack but people like this the scolds 101 ah 75 I can attack that sucks what's my quick prayer is that um let's get my quick prayers just something like that for the spec let's do it let's do it let's do it let's do it let's do it let's do it oh [ __ ] I'm already being attacked by [ __ ] like you know what let's let's stay on this guy oh my god they're all on me ready let's get a lucky spec in or try to telly telly telly telly telly telly telly oh my gosh okay so they have mob mentality in there they hate PKS oh my heart's pounding Wow okay this is gonna be a little bit more difficult than I thought but we're gonna try it again we're not gonna give up just yet we got a resort for a very very lucky dark post spec that's how we're gonna get a kill you got someone we got someone come on let's do this let's do this let's do this let's do this let's do this let's do this yep I don't care if you protect from melee I don't care if you protect from melee Oh get him now that was a very shitty spec that was a very shitty spec but that's what we have to do that's the strat alright we got a little 98 over there level 98 over there I'm thinking we should go for it I think we should go for it 105 that person has more armor ooh nice we just got attacked by him but [ __ ] it let's try to do this whoo eat up eat up while being I'm being piled oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] reet le Wow okay maybe Reds isn't the place to go [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it oh here we go here we go here we go here we go here we go that's the kill No get him I'm so angry might have friends and [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] okay this is gonna get interesting we got to go for that lucky speck let's just reap ah and everything repot up right let's just [ __ ] go for it let's just go for it let's just go for it got the kill that's the kill that counts is that mine that's my kill I'm out of here [ __ ] it I don't think here nope back out back out that's the kill I'm under attack by level 91 well guys that is all tasks complete I'm actually shocked we did it that quick I think I got to kill at like 39 minutes and something second so like an hour and twenty minutes that took us but you know what it is what it is I'm Heights the the peak hang one was the one I was a bit nervous about but there we go the dark boat came through it's about the only way I can get a kill you know is just rag somebody and then [ __ ] boom boom you know so hey it works though we got the kill that was our drop and yeah now we get max amount of spins on our uh our gear so let's [ __ ] do it kid ice oh no the old rice to get these finished quick how do you think yeah I think I did pretty good I don't think that amazing cuz there's one that took me quite a while compared to the other ones but but from how you're sounding you got them all done oh yeah okay that's good cuz I got the more dollars no I mean it was procure yeah yeah I you know I I knew was possible the two hours but I'm shocked it was that quick truthfully I don't know dude well you feel like I did it quick as well so how quick is quick for you you know and I guess we're gonna find out so I have my time that was left okay so do I get I was left over so whoever has the higher time technically did it faster yeah it was time left yeah cuz we start at two hours so the the more time left on the clock is the quicker you did it if that makes sense correct correct how do I do as kids I say we type it out and hit enter you sigh you know over there seems like just like you were saying before what's quick is that 20 minutes left 30 minutes left maybe quick is just finishing all of them I don't know I don't know I was I'm happy you finish as well because this gives a bit attention so what time was he left who are you boy wanted attention in this life I'm ready whenever you are mate yeah same okay Oh God right Jonathan Oh 3 2 1 go that's how much time left ok look I know you're not a PK er how did you get your PK my guys did not actually fight someone I can tell you right now oh my god did you kill a [ __ ] like bone runner and went to the wood kind I just [ __ ] spec some kind of oh ok I felt so bad of the person next to it was like please no so yeah I didn't think it was gonna work I was like going turned up jump to the world straightaway someone there bang dead took two specs and a hit God and they started running like they knew it was happening here I was trying to get an actual PK I'm so so here's what I did I'm in drag gear right I was ragging with the dragon scimitar I knew they're gonna protect for melee the moment they're you know 75 HP whip up the dark boasts back him out and a few close ones few close ones I finally got one and that's at the 39 39 is when the exact happen I could briefly look right now that alone took me about 25 minutes to do and the shard took me awhile that that's of like over 30 minutes or no sorry like 25 minutes to get the shard and I was I was burnt I was perusing dust devils for it so is that iolite barrage neck rails like okay 2 in 10 kills Wow III got and I started filming and then another drop dyestuffs no max that's infuriating like I was past the drop rate for sure kill nose thing I mean that puts on the master time there how did you do on close it took me three clothes to get unique oh it took me one I got fire lighters on my first clue yeah so that I mean I I did hand members I figured I can do them super quick to thieve and then do the easies so that was my idea but I got my first one so yeah okay all right well I mean we put this in place to just have that competition of being as quick as possible but obviously it's only seven extra spins and kids to be honest I've played around with this program a little bit while it was getting developed and I would say seven spins isn't massive at all still as a still is an advantage though Oh 100% 100 it's not game breaking so uh we're gonna move each other and we're gonna go ahead you've got seven teaspoons I've got 77 and we're gonna see who can come up with the best gear let's do it okay so I've got 77 spins because I was quicker to complete the challenge we have a program here which was developed by one of the moderators Robin so Robin thank you very much appreciate it and what this does is when we click on one of these items on well on one of these sort of slots we will then get a random item anywhere in the game but it does also show untradable it shows quest items etc if we get those they do count as a spin or like whatever you want to call it so here we go let's uh I'm gonna go for a weapon first I'm gonna try and get myself a good weapon so 77 spins starting now first one speed to get a B whip that's absolutely massive that is huge okay definitely sticking with that obviously so I get a good play buddy here so number three no four graceful top five six no seven mm no eight oh my god yes okay hey number nine we're going legs we're going tank here obviously nine 10 no 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 beautiful I'll stick on that room plate skirt gonna go helm here number 18 19 20 oh my god this is huge guys okay let's go with 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 I'm allegory T 4 I'll stick on that for now we can come back to it 27 it's got a good she would come up 28 no 29 that's what we're in kite shield there so we will go ahead and take that for some reason when we hover over you guys can't see what it says but when I'm hovering over this I can see it says rune kite shield okay so we got 30 coming in here I'm gonna go for gloves 31 32 hmm 33 34 35 36 Oh combat brace that will stick on that for now let's go ring 37 38 39 occurring absolutely beautiful 39 for the bazooka ring let's get boots 40 is gonna be zamorak dehydrates see if he goes magic I could be in some serious [ __ ] trouble here no let's go 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 black boots I'll take four now 49 their cape 50 51 52 53 definitely don't have a max 154 definitely don't have that 55 [ __ ] sake 56 57 58 take that for now right what do I try not grade here I've got 58 I think maybe trying to get some barrows clubs would be amazing 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 oh my god 69 70 71 72 73-74 oh my god 7576 I'm gonna risk it 77 graceful gloves oh my god [ __ ] sake should I start with the combat racism there we go that's my style guys hopefully it's gonna be Kansas right guys here we go so we have the randomizer never really played around with this I clicked it a few times just kind of test it a little bit and see the you know the kind of stuff we can get I'm not sure where this database is exactly pulled from or what to expect Bor just gonna kind of fire through we're gonna focus mainly on a weapon and we're gonna count up to 70 as we do it we could fill any you know items we want but we can only have 70 spins ooh I don't even know the stats on that but surely there's better that so this is two three four okay those rate beers on here 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 no I [ __ ] one 15 16 17 we'll take that 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 I'm wasting too much on that 31 I don't have that 32 what is that 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 oh my god you go through him so quick 47 oh my gosh 48 oh that's pretty good 48 49 oh man 50 [ __ ] it's

we'll take it this is our gear setup let's [ __ ] hop back in a call with link how you feeling you know I'm not gonna lie dude I'm feeling actually pretty good I'm feeling you just woke id's oh no now there were a few variations on things yeah and so like like for example one dive Rudy if if that came up we could just buy a room [ __ ] normal if it has the same exact same stats for exactly or if you got ace rigger suffering you couldn't take a ring it imbued ring of suffering it had to be a normal ring of suffering yeah I'm so yeah kids I don't know how how ready you are here may but I'm ready to get these these items on looking sexy let me pick the first item in all right go for it mate I'm gonna go with the shield slap okay this was one of my variations actually so we got this bad boy same oh my god I got the rune kite shield ornament version from what the Poh like the red one with like white yeah that's why yes well yeah yeah Coco Coco and okay necklace made you wanna check this out what if I said best in [ __ ] song my god oh [ __ ] high Wow I got it mad quick too because I don't want to focus too much on like jewelry and stuff you know is that a glory that's a glory tea or something wow that's not bad Wow it gives no defense and I think that gives some defense yes yes yeah only three defenses though okay sighing I like the sound of that let's go with keep my man loves a good cape I didn't do too well yeah same 22 if it makes you feel any better dude I I came through a max cape and I had to turn it down because I don't have a max cape he's not happy okay all

proud of that as well yes so as I let's go helm see you got in the helm Wow oh this is one of my variations I got like a like a Borg calf slayer helm but I'm rocking the normal not great that's like a stay isn't it no it's like a room full home oh it's got nothing on the on the barracks but you got prayer bonus with that yeah which is right now he's a big I think it was my first spin really yeah I think so but what I just said sure I could be wrong there but I'm yeah okay I'm good boots mate how did you do that not too happy about these not gonna lie they make sure actually we're still a lotta we're not a lot but like than I wanted to on boots yeah I did actually got like Rangers come up and I even got he hide God boots come up and I decided not to go for them it was a bit dumb really right right but I obviously think pegs or dragons would be sick yeah yeah well not pigs pigs is range I'm [ __ ] Prince all right Wow my guy look at you and your beer-bellied over there way to watch d my guy wasn't waiting in the garden wheelers bad job you I love bad shops are still open in your version the goal look they got to make an honest living you know let's go let's go gloves this is why I was happy that we didn't fight in the world this [ __ ] got graceful gloves mate well I had combat as one point come back brace and I went for [ __ ] bear oh such ferocious I feel icky I feel a bit guilty link I got this like really really really quickly got the combat price this is the region region one strength over the combat I got Onix one but not a regen fuming oh I should probably make sure mines not a Nanak oh my god that's an onyx which is no stats oh I'm so angry oh my god dude you heard my shield a DK [Music] I'm so angry I'm now gloveless but I have this fancy looking shields yeah I figured since it since it's not better than yours I at least wanted it to look cooler than yours hence the a DG o bad poor back i feel feel a little bit bad for that it doesn't matter just said wait just send one man and that's good it's got like what if I said take what would you guess they got twice a good Wow [ __ ] what do you get [ __ ] oh oh my god that's huge that's massive now now why is that I'm obviously you didn't have enough spins but did your weapon take a long time to get or something or I got the ring I got the ring I got the room plate skirt and I was sort of like that's not bad it's middle-of-the-road it's fine and then I was really worried if I click on it again I'm gonna end up with like [ __ ] green d hiding you know something even worse like that no chance I'm not wasting it on that Wow [ __ ] how long quick like really quit I think it might've been my first one or it was quick though let me just go see if I can go back real quick it was like four three or four all right Wow Kenz you'll pick my ring you can't see it so I'll just say mine after you say yours I got a berserkering normal I got a normal ring of suffering Wow dude yeah I'm just saying yeah Wow okay they go down to like okay so right now you have a better helm a better kite but I have the better legs all the other stuff I feel is not negligible but I'd say it's very very very close yeah and weapon is easy to determine so much right now right just which I am very happy with my weapon link [ __ ] get out bad boy what what would you say 1 to 10 how happy are you with your weapon I was like 1/8 but you've sort of destroyed my confidence with what you've just said I'm a 10 so quick I can't believe this I got it oh my god you know to be fair a whip isn't like that much worse what is it a seven strength bonus hold on it's like hey I ATT Matt I strike with ATT slash and this gives 94 stab 89 strain yeah that's [ __ ] good that's a class above but what is your stab defense it's worse than my slash but what is it - I - oh my / is - a 9 kids mate yes sir I can't believe this you know link thinks he's out of a fight as if orangy doesn't play a factor in these fights so lame guy you know keep your head up man stay strong okay all right are you ready to step out mate into the combat zone yes all right whatever you ready mate this is actually a bit scary only swordfish I'm
