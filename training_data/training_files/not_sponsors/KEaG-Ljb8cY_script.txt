with garlic rice roast chicken
that's right we've done chicken next to rice and we've done chicken on rice and
in rice but i believe this is the first time
we're going to reverse that or as we used to say back in the early 90s flip
the script and do the rice in the chicken and no
not stuffed in the cavity this experiment involved stuffing the
rice under the skin and the results really were spectacular
so with that let's go ahead and get started with what originally inspired
this video and that was about a cup and a half or
so of cold white leftover rice from some thai food takeout if you must
know and to that what we'll do is add a whole bunch of freshly crushed garlic
or very very very finely minced we will also add some freshly chopped chicken
friendly herbs which in my case were thyme rosemary and
parsley sorry sage and then we'll season that up with some
freshly ground black pepper plus a generous sprinkling of kosher
salt as well as a little shake of cayenne pepper
and then last but not least a fairly significant amount of melted butter
and by the way if you melt butter in a pan and then let it sit there
as it starts to cool it kind of forms a flaky crust on the top
which i only mentioned to explain that weird looking flaky crust on the top
but anyway once everything's in there we'll go ahead and give this a mix
and we will keep mixing until we are 100 confident every grain of rice has been
coated in that butter at which point we should probably
transfer this into the fridge since it's going to be a lot easier to work with
once that butter firms up and while that's chilling we can move on
to prep our chicken and by prep i mean stick our fingers under the skin
right where the back of the breast meets the cavity okay the skin is usually
pretty loose there and what we'll want to do here is take
some kind of thin spatula or spoon and we'll slide that in between the skin
and the flesh loosening that skin all the way to the front of the bird
which if you're doing with a spatula like this is fairly easy
since raw chicken skin is very tough and does not tear
easily so as long as you're using something that doesn't have any really
sharp edges it should work just fine and if you'll
notice we're going on either side of the breastbone
which for mostly presentational purposes we want that skin to stay attached
and that's it once our skin has been successfully and thoughtfully loosened
we'll go ahead and transfer our chicken into a lightly oiled oven safe skillet
or roasting pan or i prefer a pan since it's easier to
make a pan sauce later but as long as it can go in an oven
you're fine and then what we'll do is pull our cold garlic rice mixture out of
the fridge and we'll proceed to stuff as much as we
can under the skin over each breast and know there is no neat or graceful or
elegant way to do this just grab some in your hands and shove
it in and then once you've squeezed a certain amount in there
and it's starting to build up what we can do is kind of press and push our
fingers along the surface working that mixture towards the front
of the bird and it's very difficult to tell you how much exactly you're going
to be able to fit in there okay if we really really overstuff it
that skin could rupture as a rose or it might just start pushing out of
the opening so we don't want to go with a crazy amount
but i would say we want to try to get at least like a two inch thick layer in
there and no matter how much you manage to
stuff in there we'll want to make sure we're sliding our fingers over the
surface to sort of shape this into the natural
contours of the breast okay anytime you're going to enhance
breasts like this we really do want them to look natural
so you may need to do a little bit of shaping and then what we'll do with any
of the leftover rice which i'm guessing you'll have a little
bit of is we'll go ahead and simply add that to the cavity
and of course any of that garlic rice that's fallen into the pan should be
snatched up and also placed in the cavity and then
what we'll do once that set is go ahead and tie our legs together
with a little piece of kitchen string or plain dental floss
and by the way that is technically optional all right a lot of chefs say
that doesn't make any difference but on the other hand a lot of chefs say
it does especially the ones i learned from
in culinary school so mostly by habit i do tie mine up
and then before this goes in the oven we'll want to give it a very generous
saltine or a bottom sides and top and that's it
once the outside surface has been sufficiently seasoned
we'll go ahead and transfer that into the center of a 425 degree oven
for about an hour or until your bird is what you would consider safely cooked
and if everything goes according to plan it should look like one of the most
beautiful roast chickens you've ever seen
i mean come on look at that just absolutely stunning
oh and of course since this pan has a handle that's really hot we will always
place a towel over that until it's cooled
but anyway what we're going to do at this point is transfer that to our
cutting board to rest for about 5 or 10 minutes
and while we're waiting let's go ahead and put that pan back on the stove
over medium-high heat and we will simply add some sherry vinegar
or the vinegar of your choice to these pan drippings and we'll go ahead and
bring that up to a boil while we scraping to glaze all that
goodness off the bottom and that's it you just witnessed how to
make the world's simplest pan sauce all right we have those flavorful juices
that gloriously garlicky chicken fat and beautiful acidic flavorful vinegar
to balance everything perfectly and once that's boiled and reduced a
little bit we can simply turn that off and serve it as
is or if we want to get fancy we could strain it but the point is that is ready
to go so i set that aside and went ahead and
cut into my chicken and as i removed that section of the
breast i was extremely happy with what i saw
all right that meat looked very moist and juicy and i thought that rice
stuffing was pretty well behaved all right i was afraid it was going to
kind of crumble all over the place but that really wasn't the case
and above and beyond appearance man was that stuff delicious
okay if you told me you were gonna take the chicken and just leave me with the
rice i would have been fine with that so the
rice tasted amazing but i wanted to taste everything all
together so i cut a piece off and drizzled down a little bit of our
quick and easy pan sauce and that my friends was the perfect bite
of food right it's very difficult to describe just how delicious that was
so i cussed them up and went ahead and served on a plate next to some beautiful
braised greens and since not all the chicken has rice
attached i decide to place those pieces down first
and then top it with those beautiful slices of skin and breast meat
before finishing up with our pan drippings and above and beyond producing
one of the most gorgeous roast chickens i've seen in a long time
i found that stuffing that rice under the skin had three main benefits
okay first of all it insulated our breast meat so it cooked a little slower
which means it did not dry out while the dark meat was finishing cooking
all right this meat was extremely moist and juicy and then secondly because it
kind of stretched the skin out and separated it from the surface that
skin got beautifully browned and crispy and virtually all the fat rendered out
and there was none of that flabby fat you sometimes get under the skin with a
roasted chicken and then thirdly speaking of rendered
fat guess where all that delicious chicken skin fat went
that's right it was absorbed by the rice which was already delicious with the
butter and garlic and herbs but that extra richness from the chicken
fat took it up to the next level oh and i actually should have said four
benefits because i'm skipping over one of the most obvious ones
and that's being able to flavor the chicken from the inside out or if you
season the chicken on the outside a lot of that just stays on the surface
and really doesn't get into the meat as well
as when it's actually touching the meat like we have going on here
so let's update that to four official advantages and maybe the best news
you could do this exact same technique by using all kinds of different herbs
and spices and flavorings i mean you are after all the john
mitzvich the third of your garlic rice stuff bird
and i really do hope you take this basic technique and then come up with your own
fabulous variations but whether you decide to do that or
make this exactly as shown i really do hope you give this a try
