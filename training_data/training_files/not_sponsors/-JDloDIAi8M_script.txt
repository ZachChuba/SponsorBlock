hello today we're going to talk about medium format landscape photography we're going to look at what medium format is why it might be of interest to you and take a look look at this magnificent Fuji film GFX 50s but before domain name or an online store that make your X move with Squarespace ok let's go [Music] I'm here in the beautiful North Yorkshire it's a fantastic autumn day and there's also the signs of the first frost it's a bit windy and cold but really I really don't mind that so what is medium-format it pretty much gets its name from the old 120 film it was bigger than 35 millimeter film what used to go into deals Hasselblad's and things like that and it because it was bigger it was generally considered better quality because it could soak in more of the lights now we're with digital photography that name is given to it any sensor that bigger than 35 millimeter sort of full frame lens sensors this is the fuji film GFX 50s this is a medium format camera if we take the lens off quickly it's mirrorless as well look at the size of that sensor it's absolutely absolutely massive so why would I be interested in medium formats is because with that biggest sensor the pixels are bigger as well so this is a 50 megapixel sensor the same as some of the full-frame cameras have now but because those pixels are bigger this spread further apart as well it generally makes the image quality better it does that by having a bigger dynamic range and also it has lower noise as well the image files that this camera this Fujifilm camera creates they're just out of this world absolutely beautiful this is not a review I just want to talk a little bit about medium formats so what we're gonna do today is we're going to grab an image with this we're going to then go through the whole process of post-processing and then creating the final print because that's really what you were gonna get a medium format camera for the final prints are where you can really notice the difference there is an important thing to talk about first though because as you might know the Fuji film GFX 50s is a 6,000 pound camera now I haven't bought it Fuji film have loaned it to me for a couple of weeks with the lenses as well I've got two lenses in the bag that brings the total to about 10,000 pounds now that's out of my price range I'm sure it's out of your price range as well but I like to know what is at the very top end now you you are talking about cameras like Hasselblad that very few people are gonna do landscape photography with I still like to know what's at the top because I want to know where that quality that performance can really go to but when I am buying my own gear and cameras I I look at it like this so I've got a piece of paper here so I'm gonna draw a little graph and down this side we're gonna do that and on that side performance cost with a very very cheap camera a toy camera for example would start down here and as you start to spend a little bit more money the performance goes up very quickly we start to spend more money and we get into the sort of aps-c type camera that I'm filming on today the performance still goes up as a cost naturally goes up as well as you start to spend more money it's a case of diminishing returns as I'm sure you know so the sort of line starts to go like this because performance is still increasing but cost starts to increase a lot more the Marmon II spend you're only getting a very slight increase in performance and it continues like that so you get this sort of curve along like that basically that is the value curve for me I am looking to hit an area just around here that's that's the best value area for me and I want to get all my gear pretty much in that area but I am still interested in what is happening up here with the top performance but I'm never gonna spend that amount of money for basically being at the very top end of performance and the top end or an early adopter that kind of thing at the lid I'll pick that up in a minute but there when we look at here this changes over time so what we look at the cameras like I've got with me today the medium format cameras they're gonna over time they are going to start trickling back down this curve and that's why I was interested in trying out this 50s of the gfx 50s because fuji are on the verge of releasing a camera with the same sensor is going to be called the GFX 50 R I believe and that is going to be around we think about 4,000 pounds it's definitely going to be cheaper than the the 50s because they are also bringing out a hundred megapixel medium format camera so it's exciting times because what happens here like in Formula on race driving we're at the very top in Formula One you get all these new technology and as time goes by it starts to trickle down to where those consumer cars are the ones that we drive every day the same happens in photography now has been doing for years so that will continue the medium format cameras will start to come into the range of affordability and at that point we live to grab hold of the amazing image quality that it provides if that 50 R is in the 4000 pound bracket that's going to start to be affordable for a lot more people and possibly me as well so interesting times right so I'm set for my shots and it's one I've shot two times before because I am trying to get this composition in every season I've got a similar one I've got a winter one now I'm going for the autumn one as well when I get them all they will present an image overall a project overall I'm gonna be really really proud of its rows be topping in North Yorkshire very close to where I grew up so it means a lot to me and that is why I do this and it's something people ask me a lot about should you shoot the same thing over and over again yes you should and this is one idea that you can use to do that so composition similar to what I've shot before I've got the Heather in the foreground this winding path that so I've takes you round up two rows we topping just there in the distance you've got little Rosebery over on that side as well the rocks and that goals and lights and it's just looking beautiful across the seasons the Sun will be in a different place as well today it's just going to be setting to the left of Rose be topping so it is gonna be in the shot sometimes I have to make sure that I don't get any flare in this image this Fujifilm gfx 50s is very close to being the perfect landscape camera it's 50 megapixel medium formats and the controls if you've used the next one of the x-series cameras from food you for very similar you've got all these dials on the top and the aperture dial on the lens itself so all feels quite manual really nice to use very straightforward camera and it's all about that image quality it does shoot video but you would you'd be daft to buy this camera for that reason it's pure gonna be probably for landscape photographers and then some people shooting in a studio although the flush sink is fairly low so a lot of people are too happy with it as a studio camera but as a landscape camera I think it comes close to being pretty much perfect so settings wise just so you know I am us f-16 a one fifteenth of a second that may come down a little bit as it starts to get a little bit darker and then ISO 100 the camera is pretty much the same size as my Canon 5d Mark 4 although the lenses are bigger because they've got to be wider at the end to fill that full that medium format sensor so it's gonna be pretty heavy but that's what its gonna still provide that amazing quality the lens I have on here at the moment is at 23 millimeter lens now with medium formats you kind of have to crop down so the 23 millimeter lens here the full frame 35 millimeter equivalent is 18 millimeters so it kind of goes the opposite way to what we used to from aps-c to full-frame but I think I'm set it's just a case of waiting for the Sun to get in the right place and then put this camera to work and hopefully I can get it right and make the best image possible there's some beautiful browns and oranges in this scene there's a tree just at the bottom of the hill here with some beautiful yellows and oranges on there the Browns in that fern they're dying off furred from a distance look absolutely fantastic and the great thing about this camera with its dynamic range it's going to be able to pull all of that detail out of what will be a fair few shadowy areas so I'm really excited to see this image at the end is it the classic sort of horizon cloud that I always get when I'm here it might be useful just to get that Sun going a little bit behind that to reduce some of the flare as well so I'm excited about what is gonna happen here I'm gonna put you down and we'll wait for the sunset because I want to get this right and then one turns and that will go back and post-process the image so I'll see very soon so I'm back in the studio and unfortunately the shoot didn't quite go according to plan because I think there is some kind of problem with this particular lens Fuji faults births I think this particular one has a bit of a problem we'll have a look at that in a minute I did go out the next day and shoot another shot so go through the post-processing of that just to really see the quality of the camera so let's get into the computer now and we'll have a look okay so we're into library when there's three images I want to show you firstly is the one that we just saw on the video that's this one here forgot fullscreen does flare in it for one because I don't bother going through the rigmarole of processing that out with the thumb technique but also it isn't actually the best picture because there's so much blue sky in there I was hoping or expecting a little bit more cloud in the sky which would have made it a better picture anyway but just at this distance it kind of looks okay but then when we zoom into the center which is what I did when I was looking at the image on the back of the camera it looks reasonably sharp I'm three to one there Simon very close and it looks reasonably sharp births as we start to drag towards the edges the the sharpness just drifts away from the center basically all the way around even on the same focal plane once you go around the same once you go out of the center it just goes so smudgy and look you can see that there smudge enos the hill in the distance is smudgy and blurred and I was at f-16 so that shouldn't have happened and it just doesn't look very nice I think there must be a problem with one of the elements or something Fuji will hopefully get that side out not their fault not a big deal these things happen so I just wanted to show you that very quickly so the next day though I went up to County German when I won a little trick with my dad which was nice and caught a couple of images now I just want to show you this one very quickly if we go fullscreen on that one the reason I want to show you this because I like the image anyway it's also you get that sort of most square formats that medium format provides as well but just to show you the detail you've got the full image there and if we zoom in at three to one on this area here bang look at that look at the detail at three to one we're in really close on that now you can see the detail in that pier which is looking towards Harley will think that sink Roo if my geography serves me right puts the detail at three to one is incredible it's not perfect by any means but it's still just it were in so far look at that I mean imagine the crop you could do to get that and it still looks okay and it's quite a nice image in fact it that blew me away just a high megapixel that high quality of megapixel as well it's just astounding if we zoom in on something a little bit closer again nice image just like that sort of possibilities it starts to create of cropping out of one main image I really encourage you to shoot like that but the possibility is there so just thought that was quite excited about that and I just wanted to show you it quite quickly because the quality of this camera is just pretty special actually and if they can put this in a cheaper body I'll be excited if they produce 100 megapixel version I'm gonna be excited as well so yeah like I said exciting times let's go and edit the main picture that I wanted to show you so if we just go into the develop module this is the picture I shot now this is shot from black hole rocks on the County Durham Coast this is where they used to dump loads of coal in when they were due dollar mining on the on the Durham coastline this used to be black I remember going there as a kid and it was just black and it was absolutely disgusting but it's since been cleaned up a much nicer area to visit and to photograph so that's what I've done this is what settings are we on so we're at 64 millimeters f/8 two-and-a-half second exposure I would have liked have got a little bit longer but it looks nice anyway it was just so windy though you can see all the white foam on the stay in the waves just is amazing I wish I'd blocked it but I didn't quite a nice little trip out with my dad I will go back there and blog soon though so let's just edit this one quickly because I am going to print this as well because I'm really happy with it I think but the good thing about medium format as well is that you can crop and it's such a square format that's not what I wanted for this image and I couldn't really get in any closer so I'm going to crop this down to probably something like a sixteen by nine because I don't want that much sky in the image I'm gonna go down like that and I think that looks pretty good I've still got that deep dark cloud at the top of the image of here which is what I want to really focus on but I do need to take off a little bit of the color casted the filter out the ND filter I was using produces a hue and I know from experience that it's just adds magenta in so I'm just gonna bring that down and bring that down just to neutralize it so next let's draw in a gradient from the top to probably around there I just want to darken this area a little bit more to really emphasize the feeling I was getting when I was there which was brutal windy coastal conditions brilliant it was and then going to bring the high it sound a bit as well I don't want that clarity in there nothing looks fine that's just the shadows a bit to take care of this area here and then we're done with that now let's just go through I'm happy with the exposure just gonna increase the contrast a bit to about 45 I'm actually gonna add a contrast curve as well yeah that start to look nice and then going to raise the shadows up touch and bring the highlights down the shadows a little bit more actually because you can really draw the quality and the detail out of the shadows with this the high dynamic range of this camera has that low noise as well to about 65 whites I'm gonna go all the way somewhere to about the hold down the option key just to check it that's all the way let's look about us get too far I think I'm gonna come back a touch and then just drag the blacks down a tiny bit no let's add a little bit of vibrance and saturation the files that the raw files that the Fujifilm camera produces food you have already puts them in beds a kind of slight tweak to the raw files when Lightroom installs or when you put them into Lightroom and that's something camera companies can do now with Lightroom they have a profile built in this one does have a profile built in you can see there it's got a profile built-in built-in lens profile applied that does that automatically it's also added 40 sharpness as opposed to the normal 25 that Lightroom adds by default so it does the raw files from this camera do come out strange light we're looking pretty darn good so yeah we're not far away there I'm just going to juice the saturation a little bit look back at it again yeah and I want to just reduce the white balance as well just to bring in that bleak feeling that I was getting at the time somewhere around there that's just increase that was fine as it was and I just want to enhance the yellow color down here so I'm just going to grab a quick brush and I don't want that clarity I'm going to increase the shadows just a touch as well increase the contrast and the white bones as well and then just paint that on in this area just to enhance that and such and that looks pretty good I might just drag that white back a little bit two out there and now I think that looks pretty good that's not far from complete so I'm just going to go ahead create a soft proof for that and get this printed because it's these high-resolution images when you print them that it really starts to make the difference I'm really excited to see what this camera can do what the sort prints that it creates so I'm gonna get that into the printer we'll see [Music] [Applause] [Music] right so here is the final print it looks absolutely fantastic I am thrilled with it what you get is when when you look really close at it there is still a huge amount of detail on a print this size which is a three plus it's going to be a very minor difference if any over a sort of full-frame camera it's when you start to blow it but bigger than it really starts to count for a medium format camera like this but when you demand the highest quality this camera is producing an absolutely beautiful print and you can see that it's just it's pretty much flawless we've got that beautiful see fret that was blowing in off the sea that really makes this image sharp details all through this sort of area here the cloud looks great as well and really chuffed with that image I think the print looks great yeah beautiful really happy with that top stuff so I hope you enjoyed that leave a comment down below and let me know what you think I would love to hear from you on this subject like I said to start first purchase anyway like subscribe do what you need to do and I'll see you on another one very very soon I'm Adam this is first man photography [Music]
