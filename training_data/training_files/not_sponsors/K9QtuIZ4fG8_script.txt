Hello and welcome to London today I'm going to be doing some
cityscape photography using a tilt shift lens so come with me Hello so I'm here in London today and
I've been meaning to do this for quite a long time I used to live in London for
about 10 years I know the place very very well but I've never really
photographed it it's one of those occasions when you live in the place you
just take it for granted and I never did as much cityscape photography as I
should have done. So i've come here today to put that right and I just thought I'd
switch and change up from the usual stuff in the Lake District and in the mountains
would be a nice little change of pace that hopefully you will enjoy so the
plan today is to go to a few different locations and use the Canon TS-E 24mm f/3.5L II tilt shift lens to
shoot some cityscape photography the reason I'm using a tilt shift lens is
because when you use a normal wide-angle lens it really affects the perspective
of buildings and they sort of tilt in towards the center of the frame which
just looks and feels unnatural. Your eyes don't do that, or your brain corrects your
eyes when they do that but using the tilt shift lens corrects that as well so
I'm going to do that today and hopefully capture some really nice images it's a
beautiful sunny day probably too sunny in fact but it should be a good shoot Okay so I'm set up for my first shot of
the day I've got the camera here on the tripod and I really don't want to sound
like I'm complaining about what a beautiful day it is today but these are
are not the conditions that I wanted, it's just too sunny I'm trying to make the best of
it though so what I've done is sort of take a bit of shelter from the Sun
behind this wall here and what that's then allowing me to do is to still shoot
south across the river and I have, if you can see here, is the Shard in the shot
that's the sort of scene that I wanted it's not quite from the position I
wanted so the composition isn't quite right for what I had planned but it's
still gonna be a decent shot and I'm gonna make it work for me so I have the
polarizer on there as well because it's just so hazy but the polarizer is taking
some of the haze out of the scene and I've then got a 16 stop filter on the
front, the water is very choppy and I want to just smooth all of that out I've
got boats moving through the scene as well I don't want any of them in there
so it's just gonna give that nice ethereal feel to the scene and that's really
what I'm looking for today settings wise I'm in bulb mode, I've got that 16 stop
filter on there I'm at F 6.3 because I'm just shooting straight across the river, there's
nothing too close so that's enough in terms of depth of field and it's also
then allowing me to get a shutter speed of about 6 minutes it's a bit less than
that but 6 minutes roughly and in that time it's letting the water all smooth out
there is some sort of very light clouds above which will capture a bit of
movement as well so let's start that shot now, get that going and then we'll see
what that looks like but absolutely stunning day what a good day to be in
the city!! So here I am for the second shot of the
day and i'm at Tower Bridge, is there a more photographed scene in the whole world
possibly not but that's what I want to shoot anyway because I've not really
shot it properly before and that's what I'm gonna do today using this tilt shift
lens I'm going as ambitious as I possibly can with this shot just to try
and raise it up above all the others that you see of the scene I'm quite
close to the bridge here I'm gonna try and get that in the scene and then pan
round and make it into a panorama and then get the Tower of London in the shot
as well and some of these City buildings behind me there as well that's that's
the composition that I'm going for I'm gonna use the tilt shift lens to get the
nice straight lines I'll show you how that works in a minute but I'm also
going to be using long exposures as well so what I'm gonna try and do is combine
two long exposure images because as I pan because I'm so
close it actually distorts quite a lot so I'm just going to try and combine two
shots it might not work but it might turn into something pretty good I've got
a 16 stop filter on the front to give me an exposure time of about five and a
half minutes and that's what I'm gonna do because again there's boats moving
through the scene, there's some nice interesting clouds it will also remove
the contrails that I can see in the sky as well and it will also smooth out that
water so in total this this picture if it works will have taken me 11 minutes
to expose by the time I combine the two of them together so it is ambitious it
might not work; very different to being in the countryside as well is I'm having
to deal with all my gear and make sure it doesn't get stolen which is always an
element of doing cityscape photography especially if you've got good gear
there's lots going on and I'm gonna make it work so I'll show you now how I'm
going to use that tilt shift lens. So this is the Canon TS-E 24mm f/3.5L II - tilt shift lens and the way it works or the way we use it for this
kind of photography is we use the shift function what that does is if I just
have it normal so this is just like any normal 24 millimeter lens if we angle it
up you can see that the tower or of the bridge sort of starts to angle in
towards the centre of the frame and that's what would happen if you used any
normal sort of wide angle lens especially at this distance between
yourself and the bridge so what this lens allows you to do is if we start to
centre the camera so we want it nice and level
and you can see those lines start to go straight with the tower then we just
tighten off the tripod and you then use the shift function of this lens and we
just shift up by turning the knob there then you get the composition that we
would like with the whole tower in it and all those lines remain nice and
straight what I'm then going to do is like I said, is pan
around and try and get that a whole scene in at the shot. It's an absolutely
brilliant use of the tilt shift lens in this situation and it's just
going to help get that image above all the others that you see of this scene okay so here I am on the Greenwich
Peninsula and I'm set up for my last shot of the day it's a shot I've been
planning for a very long time it's a well shot location again but it is
particularly quiet there's barely anyone here at the moment and it's just an
absolutely stunning evening. The scene behind me is Canary Wharf or the Isle of
Dogs and it's got all those bank buildings there and I'm gonna shoot two
shots one now, I'm doing a very long exposure it's about six
minutes and 50 seconds this one. The reason for that is just to really smooth
out that water and get the most ethereal feel I possibly can and I'm gonna
capture a little bit of colour in the sky and in those clouds as the Sun
starts to set the second shot is then going to be after dark because when it
gets dark these buildings light up and all those colorful lights are reflect
off the water and just provide a really really interesting image the way I'm
doing it again is similar to the last time I have got the tilt shift lens on
the front of the camera again and if you see here if you angle up at a normal
angle 24 millimetres without any shift whatsoever you can see that the
buildings again are tilting in to the center of the frame and that's not what
I want so using that shift function of the tilt-shift lens I just get it nice
and level nice and straight and then just turn that shift so it goes up and
you get the perfect composition with nice straight lines that's how the image
is gonna be working let's just see just finish shooting that and that's a six
minute and fifty second image and it is looking absolutely beautiful with just a
few flecks of color starting to come into it and a perfectly smooth River
Thames I'm actually pretty excited about that image So it's been an absolutely brilliant day
today it's just exactly what I needed as you know I've been struggling with my
landscape photography recently particularly around motivation to get
out so this nice change to come and do some cityscape photography has just been
absolutely perfect and exactly what I needed
I've been gone from London for a while now, moved back up to Yorkshire I would
have been down a few times since then but today I've really had a chance to
enjoy it and it's just reminded me how much I love this city it's actually
being it's actually being quite emotional today because I met a wife
here...... I met my wife here we had our first child here as well and just..... there's lots of
history here; Tower Bridge, I used to drive across that every day so I see my
wife when we first met so just so much of my history and my family's history is
tied up in this place so it's just such a special location for me it's strange
as well really because when I was here I pined for the mountains and now I'm
getting out into the mountains a lot I'm pining to be back here so it's really
been a really nice time for me today to get back in touch with the London and
I've enjoyed every second of it and I've enjoyed using that tilt-shift lens as
well to really make the most of some of the scenery and the nice buildings and
stuff that we have in London Please do leave a comment down below and
let me know what you think of the cityscape and the tilt-shift lens is it
something you might be interested in and also stick around to the end so you can
see the night time image and what I'm shooting now which i think is going to
be an absolutely epic time-lapse this please do also subscribe to the channel
