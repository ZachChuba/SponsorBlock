this time last year we gave a homeless man a transformation makeover and you guys loved it also some of you guys hated it and you left very negative comments to me but you know what my friends and family liked it so I'm doing another one as we were out looking for our new prospect I stumbled across an organization that gives haircuts to the homeless down at the public library and that's where I met Jason Jason is a really great guy but that mother is on my turf so I challenged him to a hair cut off probably not the best idea to do with a touchy subject like this but all the adsense from this video is going to a homeless charity of the winners choice and it also be going to the gentlemen that volunteer their heads for this hair cut off who do you want to cut your hair me the guy with his own show or Jason the guy that okay we don't have to get into the st. the voice where they shoot the office yeah my dream is to become the world's most famous comedian my dream food would have never worked out I hear you're starting out a tik-tok career yeah I have over 18 he has about a hundred thousand followers on tik-tok but that is because he has a famous best friend roasted he's actually gonna be the judge today in my book dirty lost okay well that's not fair I'm thinking we should do some Brad Pitt I'm gonna give you the Chris Pratt slash Liam Hemsworth haircut and we're gonna smoke totally great alright let's get back into the haircut cuz it's not about me it's not about the money it's about paying it forward today you were telling me earlier that you got a 27 year old daughter I got two I've got two other girls and do you talk to your your your daughter's at all no okay can we do ours again because there's way more heartwarming and I feel like that's already an upper hand because all I heard is she's from the same place they shoot the office and technically I don't even film there they shoot in LA I told my mom about my dream and she was very supportive my parents told me that I would never make it as a barber but look at me now MA I'm here I got my own show so how much time you got sober right now off of what yeah are you drinking or you smoking weed so meth is your drug of choice be ready are you ready to stop 34 years old I was on the streets I was hooked on drugs and alcohol and I thought my life was over in this last 15 years I got clean and sober and I got a life beyond my wildest dreams I would manage to have two kids I got a beautiful wife I bought a house and it's cuz I stopped drinking and using okay and I was right where you were 15 years ago is right where you were and you can still show up for your daughter and you can show up for your life I support you bro and I'm willing to help you if you want the help I can give a little backstory about myself since everybody's doing it I was actually arrested in Miami at the age of 21 while the charges are dropped they were dismissed having touched drugs or alcohol in one year I owe all my success to that crowd I'm having a good time here today with you guys who's your favorite comedian [Music] you got a couple of jokes right he is a joker I don't need nothing to know when someone has a good personality that's right didn't take us long to realize that you are a joke I've been with you for an hour and a half now right since I met you and you've been nothing but positive dude I've known you for about an hour and a half now and you've been extremely negative to my friend there and I love that yeah that don't change one bit what do you need bro I did some nice few others they do some nice and return these haircuts that we're doing on these guys to actually help better somebody's situation your awesome guy today because you're donating the money and the proceeds from this to help thank you for steering me down the right path thank you thanks for no thanks we don't need your help a little bit Paul now I would say more like Logan Paul yep welcome Paul got hit by a bus okay all right I always thinking Logan Paul if he had a decent haircut you know treat him as if we're in the boxing gym and he's a big fat punching bag that we're just gonna be laying into so he set me up with Cheech and Chong you know what check it out Movember check your nuts full when was the last time you been to the doctor I'm a virgin yeah even more of a reason you're over that jerk you know right we actually set up GoPros all over your bedroom last night Oh posted on gay porn yeah we're gonna post it on gay porn hub rubbish I think this was a great way to showcase my skills it's been a while since I cared so much yeah but a haircut and I can tell you giving it your all and uh I am too how damn man he looks good over there I'm really happy bro thank you so much for being such a good client holding still for me I'm happy for your new look happy for your new journey you ready to see this dude all right here we go open up your eyes brother oh yeah yeah you look really good you know you look like Creed from the office are you happy yeah all right bro we got you cleaned up on the outside now I got to get you cleaned up on the inside rehab what do you think are you down you'll be off the street you'll have a bed you'll have 15 friends you'll have three meals a day you'll go to a couple meetings a day and you'll be clean bro and then you can call your daughter and you can show up and you can start working all right so I you just saw their big reveal is very nice and heartwarming but I think we're gonna blow them out of the water well thank you man that means a lot to me and I agree I think you made the right choice I have some more good news we're gonna be sending you to drug rehab but I know well we're gonna be sending you off to one anyway well there is one thing like I've seen a lot of homeless people out there I guess is that I just want you guys to you know do good and help those in need that's all okay we could do that all right do you want to go to work do you want to start working well I'm already working on my channel Oh but is that is that paying paying the bills not yet here's my opinion youtubing is a tough business it's it's really tough to make money especially nowadays and producing these videos costs a lot of money I have friends that failed at acting try doing YouTube they failed at that too they spend a lot of time doing it and they're not making any money from it so my advice to you is treat YouTube as a secondary hustle like a little side hustle you have your main focus and that should motivate you to spend all of your free time working on this as a passion project obviously a haircut is just a very small gesture but I want to do something nice for you I know that you said earlier that you don't want anything but if there's anything you could think of if all you want is a plug for your channel I'd be more than happy to do that we'll put the link in the description first channel zero 300 and also we'll try to help you in finding a part-time job if that's something you'd be interested in but now it is time for the judging who did a better haircut me or Jason okay judges remove the sack it's not a competition but it is a competition the first point goes to you because of back story but I also like your your haircut haircut goes to you and story goes to you so it's two different categories I won the hair cones this sounds no you didn't you didn't win the haircut it's not only about haircuts alright this is about a simple haircut brought us all together doesn't mean I don't know what else to say who wins I don't I don't choose a winner I think I I think we all win we all win in the end of the day we all want seriously your haircuts amazing well it's not about winning or losing yeah that's it dude that's all I got thanks for having me bro and thanks for donating for coming absolutely seriously [Music] [Music] I just wanna go to Burning Man and suck my own dick right is one go to Burning Man and suck my dick on a spaceship yeah name the Burning Man on you a file war they don't understand why I am the regional [Music]
