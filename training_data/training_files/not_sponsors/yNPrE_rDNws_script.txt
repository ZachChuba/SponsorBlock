[MAMAMOO TV EXTRAS : Solar's Daily Life / EP17_Set A Fire Fire Fire] [#Solar's #Spit_It_Out_MV_Filming_Set] [Stagger] [Pretends like nothing happened] It's too high... [Kim Yong Ddoon (sun) lives hard / Like an energy drink (Hot6) she continues to practice before the group dance filming] [(At the time of filming) It's still a bit cold..!] Oh it's cold.. [(Solar knows no such thing as cold) Turns rapidly into a pro the moment she sees the camera]
Suddenly? Solar : I'm not very good (?) at feeling the cold Not very good.. [She's saying random things because she's cold..] [The filming continues despite the cold!]
Now one! Solar, action! [Back to the original spot..] Solar : Oh? This is kind of like an amusement park parade! [Solar can be found at the Spit It Out amusement park!] [Hello everyone!] [Welcome!] [See you again next time!] [Q. How are the Jjasikis doing these days??]
Jjasiki??
* Jjasiki is a nickname for her biceps Solar : Oh they've grown smaller and harder [Jjasikis have been reduced to their base size] [Q. Then the Jjasikis are now at their strongest?]
Yes, just the core.. [Showing off the Jjasikis] [Strong / Shaking]
Do you see it? [Proud] Solar : The outer shell's gone, leaving just the core. Solar : I should be using both arms to show you... [Q. Will this costume be our only chance to see them?]
No? - Do we get to see them again?
- Yes, you do. [See you later, Jjasikis!]
- Then let's see them then.
- Ah~ [Full of confidence]
Solar : I could show them to you in this costume too Solar : But I'm a little...cold right now.. [The Jjasikis have lost to the cold.. T_T]
It's a bit hard for me to take it off.. [Since it's cold, let's go to the filming of the warm match scene!] Staff : (Blows frantically) [Bursts out laughing] [Bursts out laughing at the frantic blowing] Hey it's fine, nothing's going to set on fire! Solar : The staff member was like, "It's fine to throw it here, it won't set anything on fire, it'll go out by itself" earlier [Quite frantic] Solar : I thought you said it would go out by itself? LOL Blow~ [Solar's blow is a bit weak / Let's be patient..]
One more time, naturally [Solar's blow is a bit weak]
Blow~! Cut! Okay, nicely done! Buddy 1 : Yong~ [The guest that snuck in today, Moon Byul] Solar : My neck is stiff. [Explaining how it happened] - Moon Byul : How? You have to switch right away?
- Yeah. Like this? Moon Byul : You don't have to put in that much strength into it though Solar : I must have put in too much strength. It's because your shoulder moves along with it... [Twist]
Yeah, that's better! [(A different universe) Choreography coaching from a former choreographer]
This is what made my neck stiff Moon Byul : Do you like purple? [You're noisy]
You don't. [Quiet] [Laughing] Moon Byul : That's her flicking boogers (?) away. Solar : That's this one. [Disgusting (why..would you flick that?)]
Oh hey! [Slim] Solar : Was I like this earlier? I don't know. [Solar is embarrassed to have her stomach pointed out] [Oh come on now~] [Moon Byul has already got her hands on one and tried it on] Heart. Solar : I made a heart with these like this earlier. [Big love]
Oh your fingers are so long! [MOOMOOs, love you]
Heart~ [Has something good happened to Solar?!] Moon Byul : I've used a huge amount of money, I have, Solar~ [Moon Byul's solo attempt at cheering for Solar / Quite touching] Moon Byul : Read carefully. Solar : Solo Attempt at Cheering for Solar Solar : 'I am Moon Byul?' [Laughs] - I am Moon Byul~
- Yeah. [Upset]
Solar : Ugh.. she keeps on copying people~ Moon Byul : It's different. Moon Byul : It's different, I have a lower tone. [(I am Moon Byul & Solarsido) MOOMOOs, you decide whether they are the same~]
I am Moon Byul~ Solar si do Solar : Oh a low tone! You keep making me annoyed~ Moon Byul : I heard you wanted to eat tteok-bokki? [How did you know that?]
- Yes.
- There's some here too. [Solar smiles to hear the news about tteok-bokki]
- Oh? Really?
- Yes. I heard you wanted to eat tteok-bokki Oh? Moon Byul : What do we have? [Moon Byul's flour food menu]
We have tteok-bokki, fish cakes, tempura, and cheese sticks. [Oh my gosh!]
I've prepared all of this.. [Moon Soo-jong is living up to her nickname]
- I've used a lot of money, seriously!
- Oh but.. No birthday present for you next year. [Solar's next birthday present = solo attempt at cheering for Solar] [Since it's cold, let's start with fish cakes!] Solar : Oh wow, did you attach these? [Stickers of Solar & Moon Byul]
I didn't put them on myself, but I sent the photos. [Excited]
- Well, 'I am Moon Byul~', thanks for the food today.
- Yeah. Try the tteok-bokki as well Oh my gosh, oh my gosh~ [Swallow] [Solar's excited footsteps]
You're moving like some kind of character from a game - Would you like the tempura covered in sauce, or..
- Oh yes please. [(Solar's preference) Tempura needs to be covered in tteok-bokki sauce!]
- With sauce?
- Yes please. [Solo Attempt at Cheering for Solar 'I am Moon Byul' / Advertising]
Solar : Moon Byul says she's buying. Thank you for the food. Cheer up. Solar : I get the feeling it's done. - Thank you!
- Yes, enjoy! [After the tasty meal, time to prepare for the next filming session!] [(Whistling sound)] [Look at you] [Mischievous] [You are quite absurd] Moon Byul : Hey, don't laugh like that. Moon Byul : Don't show your teeth. [So picky..] Solar : Doesn't this place seem like that place? Moon Byul : This is a grasshopper house. [Solar the grasshopper]
- No
- Moon Byul : She's a grasshopper... [The filming set is similar to the haunted house the members had visited together before]
That...haunted house. - Oh, 'run..'?
- Yeah. Running. - Moon Byul : It was just like this.
- Oh I really hated it. - Moon Byul : Oh it was a bit longer than this corridor.
- Yeah. There were two more of these. There were two more of these. [Q. So with this music video filming, you get to show off your shapely head even more, right?] More showing off of the head? Solar : Because it's also something I'm proud of Solar : and it's a family heirloom (?) Solar : This head shape..(?) [Quite calm]
Solar : It's a great blessing (from my parents) Solar : And I've prepared (?) so that I can show this to many of you. [Prepared your head shape..huh]
- Your head shape?
- Yes. Solar : But actually I have to participate in the next scene too.. Now... Solar : That scene.. Solar : That is.. I don't want to be showing this on-set to this many people either.. Solar : My moving head (?).. [Solar's attempt at revealing her head shape is not going according to her plan..]
There are quite a lot of people and I'm a bit embarrassed too. Solar : I think I could be pretty confident about it if there were only a few people Solar : But there are quite a few people that I don't know myself [Everyone, close your eyes! Solar is embarrassed!]
I'm a little...yeah. A little. [Q. But still, it's the best head shape we've ever seen!] [Hey now aren't you flattering~] [Check out Solar's shaving attempt at her channel, Solarsido!]
Alright that's enough! Stop right there~ [The filming continues late into the night!] [The final scene with the dancers!!] [Amicable] ...at that part, in that video they showed us earlier.. - ..we do it together, right..?
- A sort of wavy... [Q. It's your final scene (with the dancers)!]
The final scene. Solar : Not for me, though.. Solar : I still have one more.. Staff : Now here we go! What? [Suddenly everyone is dancing] [Whoo!! Don't try to stop me guys!!] [She was so excited that she turned her back to the camera..] Oh I should have come up to here.. I was looking for the camera... Alright! Nice work! Thank you! [To the #Match_explosion scene!] [Hissing noise] Please cover her! Cover her! [What's going on..?!] Solar : What's happening? [Hissing again] [Second failure..! / Why!!] [Even brave Solar finds this scene a little scary.. T_T] Save me~ [The filming was done safely!]
[Eyes full of fear..]
Go back! Go back! We can hear it now! We can hear it now! [I'm scared T_T] [Tearful]
Quick quick! [On the verge of running off] - Staff : You can do it! Hang in there!
- Staff : Let's go~~!! [Overcoming her fear, she's giving it another amazing go..!] [Oh right..!]
The lip syncing! [Solar's fear is hard to watch..]
Director : Cut!! [Sorry..] Solar : This scene.. Solar : We should have tackled.. Solar : this scene... Solar : first... [And Solar faded away..] [Stares off into the distance] [Boom!!!] [Surprised]
It's okay. [My heart's hurting..] [Calm]
Let's go! Now, the camera! [Rapid transformation] [Another explosion!!!] [Pretends like she wasn't scared] It's windy... [Solar is saying much less than before]
She's not talking anymore.. [Sleepy + cold + scared..] [There's one person that comes to mind at this moment..] Staff : Let's go again! [It chills the blood..the words "let's go again.."] [And so she bravely finished the filming.] [Bonus video - another guest has snuck in] [Solar dressed in cuteness] [But for some reason, she's a bit embarrassed...] [Hwa Sa has appeared with a bouquet bigger than her body / Hi~] Isn't that cotton candy? Oh, it's so cute! [Oh~ girl!] [Solar, who was occupied with the filming, has spotted Hwa Sa as well] Tada! [She missed it because of everything that's going on]
She won't look! [Hye Jin has brought a bunch of snacks.] On come on.. [Solar was preoccupied with the music video filming..] [So.. with those last words..] [Hye Jin left for home..] [Leaving chicken and pizza behind..] Cut! Okay good work, everyone! Good work, everyone~!
