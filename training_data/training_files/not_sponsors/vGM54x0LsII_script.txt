[Music] on March 17th 1861 Italy after centuries of invasion and internal strife was finally united under one king but why was it this period in particular that gave rise to the creation of a unified Italian state when other European powers such as Britain France and Russia had been well established centuries prior I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and today we'll be discussing the topic of Italian unification but first today's video is link can be found in the description below and now let's take a look at the state of Italy before unification to help us do this James from the YouTube channel Sweeney will be joining us hi Grif like the ancient Greeks Italians have historically identified with the respective city-states as opposed to a distinct Italian nationality these city-states were often governed by foreign powers but by the dawn of the Renaissance a number of independent regional States emerged these budding principalities were eager to advance their own interests and regularly waged war with one another in times of invasion they sometimes align themselves not with their Italian counterparts but with the invaders allowing Italy to become a playground for the armies of Spain France and the Holy Roman Empire during the 15th and 16th centuries in history of nations Italy terrico Hoffa asserts that Italy must be the most invaded country in the world and Lombardi one of the world's greatest battlefields thanks James if you guys haven't already please check out the channel Sweeney you can find the link in the description below he actually created an entire video series on the broad history of Italy you should definitely check that out now back to the video the 16th and 17th centuries marked a rebirth of culture and mercantilism in northern Italy the national consciousness began to develop due to figures such as Dante Alighieri niccol√≤ machiavelli and Cesare Borgia who were all considered the forefathers in some way shape or form of a united Italy their influence would sputter and die out however as the Renaissance drew to a close and Italy became overshadowed by the colonial powers of Europe as the glory and splendor of Florence and Venice faded the cities of the Atlantic seaboard sir asked them in wealth and status what followed from the 1700s to the early 1800s is referred to by some historians as The Forgotten centuries with Napoleon's invasion of Italy abruptly shattered this period of relative calm in the words of Kohath er Napoleonic armies brought with them the germs of liberalism fostered by the French Revolution of 1789 and introduced a minor Industrial Revolution sufficient at least to provide some of the war equipment required when the plains Empire collapsed the masses celebrated his defeat having been agitated by conscription and heavy taxes they hoped for a return to the status quo along with the lacs rule of a Duke or Pope but Napoleon's mark had been made many of the individuals that would go on to spearhead the Italian nationalist movement were descended from the people who profited financially and politically under French jurisdiction nationalist sentiments had been stoked in this exclusive Italian social class and secret societies began cropping up all across the nation so what was the political landscape like after Napoleon's final exile well between 1815 and 1848 Naples continued to be subjected to bourbon wool and Tuscany Milan and Venice were controlled by the Austrians during this period some of the Italians began to realize that the type of centralized government they had been administered by under Napoleon could improve quality of life and to protect their fiscal interests to a greater degree than the Habsburg or bourbon governments did as the Industrial Revolution swept across Europe an expanding Italian middle class saw value in roads railways and an increasingly interconnected network of markets before we begin explaining how the war broke out let's introduce some of the figures that shaped the course of the so-called research amento and embedded themselves in Italian history the first is Giuseppe Mazzini who was one of the earliest revolutionary spokesmen he produced revolutionary writings abroad after being banished from Genoa and Piedmont Mazzini was of the staunch conviction that the matter of Italian unification was a divine duty ordained by God himself he also stressed Italian self-realization without the intervention of foreign powers his ultimate vision was that of a utopian Italian Republic that respected the rights of the everyman at one point he was considered the de facto leader of the Italian revolutionary movement but this position would be usurped by Camilo been so the count of cavora shrewd and some would say Machiavellian politician Tavor ended up orchestrating most of the political maneuvering that led to the eventual italian unification by 1861 the year of cavorts death the only Italian territory is not united under him and his leash victor emmanuel ii where the city of rome itself and austrian controlled venice the final character will be elaborating on is giuseppe garibaldi a gruff and honest man and an accomplished guerrilla leader whose tactical prowess made him an incredibly useful asset to the italian struggle for independence against the Austrians Garibaldi was known for his frugality preferring to sleep on a straw bed and wash his own clothes even when staying in palaces he had a general disinterest for politics and holding office and although he paraded around as a Republican he became supportive of the idea of a dictatorship to force liberty on the people of Italy all three of these figures distrusted and intensely disliked one another but each succeeded in advancing the cause of Italian unification much like Alighieri Machiavelli and Borja once did in 1848 revolution in France once more spilled over in the Italian peninsula this led to the subjugated people's of Milan and Venice to take up arms against their Austrian rulers the Neapolitans meanwhile we're an open revolt against the Bourbon regime that ruled their country in recognition of this turbulent state of affairs Charles Albert the king of piedmont-sardinia declared war on Austria which marked the official start of the first Italian war of independence however the Neapolitans early withdrawal coupled with the disagreements with the Milanese and Piedmontese led to an Austrian victory and Charles Albert was forced to abdicate to a victor emmanuel ii the Piedmontese were also forced to pay sixty five million francs in reparation to Austria but piedmont was not deterred a second Italian war for independence broke out in 1859 when piedmont-sardinia managed to secure a secret defensive pact with France because the pact was purely defensive Keva were the prime minister of piedmont-sardinia at the time resolved to provoke the Austrians into fighting he accomplished this by stationing troops close to the border prompting the Habsburg government to issue an ultimatum that was rejected the war had begun but not long after France entered into secret negotiations with Austria fearing the possibility of Prussian involvement an armed assist would be signed which effectively granted Sardinia Piedmont the state of Lombardy but in short Austria would gain control over the central states of Italy much to Manuel's dismay this latter term was never enforced however and the French made no attempt to expel the Italian Garrison's that then assumed control over the region since the outbreak of the war in return for French backing Cavour ceded nice and Savoy to France this decision enraged the Italians preeminent general during the conflict Giuseppe Garibaldi Garibaldi promptly launched an expedition against Sicily in an act of borderline mutiny which resulted in its annexation in his name meanwhile cavour secured the incorporation of the Duchess of Parma Modena the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the papal States with the exception of Rome Cavour apid expansion forced Garibaldi to cede his control of Naples and Sicily to emmanuel ii after the Piedmontese army marched south through their newly acquired territories six years later following the conclusion of the third and final war of Italian independence which was part of the austro-prussian war Venice was seized from the Austrians and the provinces of Italy were unified under one government but the papal state was still guarded by Napoleon the third after Napoleon lost to the Prussians during the franco-prussian war however France withdrew from Rome in the capture of Rome in 1870 ensued fully uniting Italy after unification the newly created state of Italy faced a number of roadblocks that stood in the way of progress for one the majority of the middle class and aristocracy alike had never truly been won over by the revolutionary ideals that trickled down from France in addition the Italian parliament experienced gridlock as socialists and liberals failed to compromise on even the most basic pieces of legislation to conclude will cite Serge Hughes a professor at Hunter College he describes how in the 1870s the cry of resort amento leaders was now that we have made Italy we must make italians but decades passed and Italians were still as disunited as ever these issues would continue to plague Italy throughout the nineteenth century and even today as I mentioned before today's video is join a clan to take part in an exciting online multiplayer experience thanks for watching I'd like to
