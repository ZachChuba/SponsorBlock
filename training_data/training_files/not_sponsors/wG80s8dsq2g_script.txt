dark web mystery box this is still a thing why is this still a thing I made a video last October where I took a deep dive into these dark web mystery box videos and I thought I was late to cover the trend then I think the dark web itself has just solidified itself as this sub-genre on YouTube and these types of videos are inevitable at this point now if you haven't watched my first part I suggest you watch at least to get some context as to what these videos are for this video I wanted to gather videos that were somewhat recent I want to see how this trend has evolved or if it's still the same goofy crime scene evidence [ __ ] we're used to quickly scanning over some thumbnails I recognize a few familiar faces I covered in the first part one of them even appearing to have become the kingpin of this [ __ ] but I also see a lot of new players in the game so as much as it pains me I watched twenty more dark web mystery box videos this is what happened in the first part I said that this channel had debatably made the best quality mystery box video they clearly had great equipment and the technical prowess to make this visually appealing not to mention this guy isn't a boring sack of [ __ ] he works on camera even watch my video on him and he was a pretty good sport about it I'd say it's kind of funny too because I joked that his channel was gonna die unless he stuck with the dark web [ __ ] cuz his tech videos weren't cutting it and boy did he [ __ ] prove me wrong because he's gained over 600,000 subs since I made that video on him because he's stuck with the dark web [ __ ] I told you dog what did I say I was just being honest I wasn't trying to be rude but hey I respect it though I respect you still putting tech as the first word in your banner let's see what mine see TV is buying off the dark web nowadays duh I just started the video discretion I really hope that this isn't a red flag that I shouldn't watch god damn it what is this goodwill scavenger hunt what is this virtual ambien you just fed me I just picked you up for like a minute straight you're making me look bad okay so not much has changed you're in a creepy attic now you got a new co-host even though I actually prefer your wife I know she took that bTW in the comments when you guys first did this but now I kind of miss her I just don't know how I feel about the fifth member of Impractical Jokers breaking it down with you I think you two had a good contrast even though she was a bit OneNote it was better than this because in this video both of you were taking this very seriously like you're certified dark web detectives and it really sucks whatever ounce of fun you had in the first one also I don't know what these filters are but that [ __ ] gotta go you might think it makes it look creepy I don't even think you think that I think you might this might have been an accident but these just make the video look cheap and I know you have great equipment and quality the realism through the head cam and High Definition gave you this VR vibe that made it seem like we were opening it with you but then you slap this [ __ ] filter on it it takes me out of it makes it look like an old Instagram photo I'm not even criticizing what you had in the box I'm just a little disappointed mine seed I didn't even talk comedy from this what did you find Yahtzee dice at a crucifix what's the next big mystery Buck's gonna have Chang got a Bible so mine seed to be continued us again and again I wasted a lot of time watching the first part so what's another twenty minutes to see what's on the tape it's just my life alright let's see what's on this flash drive okay this is kind of different it's a music video for today's sponsor now let me tell you mine seed keep doing stuff like that that's late okay let's actually watch what's on the flash drive spelled it right this time I got high hopes for this one this is definitely an older priest X area priests face floor to suit alleging abuse so you've got this creepy looking old man wearing a speedo I don't know if that's real or not catch you later okay that wasn't much better so this is mine seeds play from what I'm seeing he takes a real crime case and then forms a dark web mystery box around it almost to legitimize it he opens a box and then he baits you into the next video while serving you up this ominous jumbled puzzle where he now forces the audience to play detective and throw all types of theories in the comments hosting the video and the algorithm and planting seeds in his pockets and even though he kind of let me down I still think this guy has the most potential a lot of most creators I see in this type of [ __ ] so fair game whatever [ __ ] it I got no jokes out of this one so show me somebody incompetent satanic bottle oh my god oh that's someone's hand or something is that real so this next guy ordered a dark web skateboard I know it sounds like a witless idea but it's different I respect it you ever try to ollie over a demon surprisingly difficult oh look that's already I mean a skateboard like this kinda looks like I don't know like an infant's body that's a classic comedy bit the dead newborn chopped up like brisket come on subscribe you could say that sounds a callback to his deceased Tyler joke he made earlier show me that skateboard baby this one is a wheesh a kind of I don't know it's kind of squishy feels like it could be like a I don't know like a beanbag of something you know he was trying to run back that dead baby joke this feels like a beanbag I've been exposed I only have one choke that thing is that someone's handle something is that real like a fake hand or something like it why these mystery boxes are really like mystery boxes snozzberries taste like snozzberries I feel like in that moment he had an epiphany he just didn't know how to word it oh [ __ ] though these mystery boxes they're like fill with mystery he finds a Satanic Bible because we know that Christians would never want anything to do with a grinder thank you I was a Christian homophobic joke and a skateboard joke and all packed into one they said I couldn't do it yeah through this night he he rides this board must sacrifice their soul to Lucifer does that be what this knife is for they want me to sacrifice my soul to write this skateboard these are the instructions in here satanic griptape motifs motors group table I like how he just ends up skipping over that sin once your soul look I got some new grip tape I must do so many heel flips just bought a board I just watched him unbox it okay so I've been trying to avoid them but it's [ __ ] impossible ladies and gentlemen back for round two the man who most likely is accounting for the most dark web mystery box videos in 2019 jasc in ho now Jess can [ __ ] Jess Kineo as he's you know corrected me in multiple videos was one of the more worst videos I saw and it was hilarious he'd clearly put time and effort into the contents of the box but he himself was a bit claudus on camera and it was more so emphasized by his editing or lack thereof so I'm curious to see how jazz can host content has evolved yeah I'm gonna carefully open this up oh my god are you [ __ ] kidding me you have over 100k subscribers what the [ __ ] is this title slide I'm gonna just leave that Helvetica font cuz [ __ ] you so big draw of this video is the vomit alert and the question on all our minds is what made you bombing that carefully open this up so that's what made him throw up it was watch this okay I tried to upload without the black screen and was demonetised sorry so apparently he uploaded this video showing what was in there and got T monetized all on there buster detectives in the audience take a look you guys tell me what you see in there to me it kind of looks like a dehydrated eggplant I don't know if he's trying to make us think it [ __ ] cuz it's not cuz I've never seen that leathery [ __ ] I don't know why this shiny fruit would D monetize you how [ __ ] lazy by the way you couldn't even track the sensor okay we capitalized the beginning of his sentence he's [ __ ] using like 2008 tech slang and his [ __ ] videos you won't even outline the text this is so frustrating as a youtuber so he opens up a black light and the gears slowly start moving and turn in and turn and turn in then BOOM revelation I can put this in my power source it may be this black light turns on I don't want to say I'm on the edge of my seat right now guys but you know I'm standing okay you okay Jason gone well that's upsetting and I was the point wait are you watching this video - whoo that was the worst so weird same exact reaction to this video daddy needs a fork come on [ __ ] this looks like something back from like the medieval times I don't know this is so C I don't know if jazz can hold it just can't act to save his [ __ ] life or this is just him because when the light bulb was hot and he grabbed it he was like uh he reacted the same exact way like he's just sleepwalking through life you now think that part was staged I think he was actually like I'm just gonna grab this even though it's the cheap light bulbs that [ __ ] heat up like the Suns [ __ ] in two seconds I don't know if that's just him maybe he's a great actor just in his own right now the only thing that we have left to do is to handle this flash drive you just seem bored now jaska no you look like you just got done watching a jasc and home video thank you so much guys excuse me did you just suddenly tell us you clap cheeks do these goals listen guys I've been shooting webs mystery boxes before my channel you know what I'm saying so he opens up this flash drive and it's just all gibberish it has nothing to do with anything he has now become the Dora the explora guy there's all these puzzles that don't matter but people will waste their time and flood his comment section and boosters video just in case is oversaturated tags don't do it first I wanted to watch another one of jaska nose videos but I'm assuming they're all exactly the same but I'm gonna try and watch another flashdrive video I'm curious how he handles it since the first time was a bit absolute duck [ __ ] so I'm gonna plug this into my computer when you're straight into that before this video starts if you want a chance to win one of five Amazon gift good right here it looks like a king or some [ __ ] whoa not the brightest so if you guys know what this is or you know how did this say for this I will see you guys later update tried watching to the flashdrive video didn't turn out well I do not have the same patience as I did the first time by the way if you thought jazz can hold was just a bad creator you're absolutely right terrible I'm going pretty hard on the seat because of his recent video jasc in home mentions that his place was ransacked he's really torn up about it which i think is another lie because you've lied about everything so far and I feel like you're throwing this out there just to be a part of your dark web storyline like people are [ __ ] with you because of it which wouldn't have really mattered to me had you not elected to lie to your audience about this Sok about it on camera and then immediately promote your patreon he says they stole his play button some expensive sentimental items adding to this victim role and he also says they stole some of the dark web items he has received now it's very possible that he's telling the truth and if he is I eat my [ __ ] words but I just have one question why would this burglar decide to take your play button rusty crowbars and heroin needles over I don't know let's say your Xbox that thing right there that's there all the time couple feet away from your play button it's right there in an older video and in a sliver of this video it's still there you would also think if you actually got robbed you would take the opportunity to make that its own video you're a youtuber now this is the type of [ __ ] you live for your camera should have been out soon as you notice you got robbed like I said I might be wrong but I might also be disgustingly right and if I am you're kind of a [ __ ] slimeball jasc and ho is jacking your money dark web changed you this guy has pretty good quality multiple camera angles he's got biro and [ __ ] but what in the [ __ ] [ __ ] have these videos become in the first part there was really only one guy doing this where he was manipulating the audience since of feeding the algorithm by asking for QuickTime likes and comments over and over again this guy is horrible with it he starts the video by baiting you into trying to keep the like and dislike bar equal and obviously it'll never be equal some people like to play along some people like to [ __ ] it up which pretty much care jeezum more and more likes with every impressionable dickbag that jumps on that video a minute 30 into his video he cuts a way to emphasize guys this mystery box left me scarred seriously watched her the ants the most messed up mystery box I've ever received I think I'm gonna get some nightmares for the next coming weeks months years Oh a mere okay I look pretty good for the video I think so I'm gonna think it's something I never see in my life but I seen it you've got a pair of women's sunglasses over here is it bad that I looked pretty fire in a pair of woman glasses and I unboxed it it changed me completely I'm a 23 year old man and I am not the same person anymore the inside of the file over here says how many licks a mind you this clip doesn't contextualize anything it doesn't clarify anything it's like the mid-roll clickbait and he throws it in very early at a specific point where I would assume his watch time usually drops off three minutes and 15 seconds into his video cuts away yet again to promote his Twitter so as he explains so you guys can discuss the theories about the scary flat-rate parks and I'm gonna be retweeting people who kind of have theories on this and I'm gonna be retweeting people oh okay I take it all back she's so precious if you guys didn't know I have a husky and her name's storm yours is stormy [ __ ] this is cute too since taking off in all seriousness it is really cute but this is also a manipulation tactic and I'm not I'm not on your side buddy did somebody asks for a random Twitter overlay so he shows us a map and a specific location asking the audience to figure out hey what is this where's the set this part of the video I need you guys to put on your detective caps and this is the problem with [ __ ] like this when you bring the real world into these goofy eyes videos people are going to get involved one way or another especially when you're presenting multiple calls to action throughout the video because they believe you need help with all of this so they're like we gotta help our boy crypto bro you're trying to go dig up a body obviously figure out the places that are on the map but please I don't condone anybody going to these location figure it out where it is and everybody stay away from it thank you crypto dude what the [ __ ] it's been like five minutes of just dark web mystery box content can we get my thank-you on the back it says VI n six six things why this one starts pretty decent I guess and pretty believable for those new to the trend cuz that goes to the post office to pick up his box and even has footage of workers measuring it out claiming they were sketchy about it they didn't know if they wanted to give it to him even though that's not a thing he probably just went in there with it was like hey can I ship this no like I don't know it why does it look like that when the unboxing starts he throws in two extra packages at the last second because he can guys he's for me to open this box you can have to hit the thumbs up on to activate this right come on anymore thumbs up I can't open it it's this thing is lifting isn't it Oh guys come on smash the light bar three two one go what though he's in there I already say too much bothers it again it freaks me out I just feel like this is like some weird voodoo it's going back Fudo that's just the troll doll gen Z come get your man's this guy bought so much [ __ ] that he just starts jump cutting the hell out of it at the end because even he knows it's boring too wasted so much money on this and these views are not gonna replenish that sorry buddy maybe you should actually hop on a tram that's trending this next guy's name is dark web unboxer this video is rather short thank God he finds a bloody knife or something that's supposed to look like that I guess and then pretends to call the cops off-screen for three minutes got him he makes up this entire conversation for three minutes and were stuck looking at this frame oh my gosh is that a new drill okay aside from this idiot this trend has now clearly evolved to the point where almost every video is the same it's a guy rifling through cheap rummage sale knickknacks and lobbying up puzzles for the audience to solve honestly the dark web aspect has been completely lost on these videos it's just a buzzword going down with the ship Wolfie wraps up a box with gardening tools and caged up beanie babies and then [ __ ] with his audience for 12 minutes I'm not sure what this is they take it seriously then make fun of it then take it seriously then parody it who cares you just paid for my next pair of Yeezys you [ __ ] morons you remember the guy in my last video who opened $100,000 mystery box and then was later hacked by stock footage he made another video we made a lot more but the one I'm talking about is where he talks about the 200 million dollar mystery box he literally just talks about it he doesn't even try lying to us that he bought it with his friends aetherium fortune which he was a letdown I would've loved to hear that justification but he does say what the two hundred million dollar dark web mystery box supposedly contains and what that is is a special invite to the Illuminati that's right guys the secret society trying to establish a new world order is essentially the Chocolate Factory he's got a cute little invite you get a nice pamphlet become a Rewards member summon Lucifer you earned this the Box also apparently grants you safety when the lips inevitably hits so since you're a part of the Illuminati and [ __ ] when that category-five comes rolling through you will be guaranteed shelter with the top 1% now there were no specifics given but I'm sure you'll be stowed away in a lighthouse in Singapore with Jeff Bezos and Ryan's toy reviews it'll be fun it's become increasingly difficult to find a short video of this nature the majority are 20 minutes minimum going up to 35 please stop why do all of you start the video like this it's not gonna save you the monetization is coming for that ass wait one [ __ ] second you [ __ ] he stole that for mine CTP there's one idiot who started it putting that warning screen and then all the other dark web guys were like this will we do that we gotta warn the audience just spooky you stole someone else's disclaimer and it was the only one with a [ __ ] typo in it [ __ ] hell let's get these [ __ ] out of me what is the censored why is there like a slam effect in addition to the squeak if you listen closely it's not just a squeak my guess since you ripped someone else's intro you ripped someone's squeak from their video and did not trim it correctly also your ASMR Amy from across the room so I have to max out your volume only to then so in this video this guy finds a severed head don't believe him good it was surprisingly a breath of fresh air which apparently he had plenty of because he'd never once mentioned the odor of the severed head but seriously with this guy there is no puzzles there is no manipulative call to action it was just a fun little lie in a horribly edited video I love it opening a real dark web mystery box scary disgusting Chinese Shane Gillis is that you you know it's funny these guys made a parody of dark web unboxings and they somehow had better acting and the people actually trying to convince me wait what's that the end of jasc and ho if we ignore all these videos that came after so today I made a 100% sure to burn gloves for a simple fact that in my last video I opened an open syringe inside of the box and it was labeled HIV decided it now I'm really grateful that I didn't you know poke myself with that and then I really took precaution with it because if I hit myself on that I have AIDS latex sometimes fails in stopping jizz you are awfully confident it will stop a [ __ ] needle and hey look you still got stabbed by Ram this trend is not gonna die as long as the dark web brings in views dark web mystery boxes will always be somewhat viable as a choice of content at first it was silly it was shipping myself in a [ __ ] post office staying somewhere for 24 hours silly and now it's become this corner pocket of baiting interaction for gullible normies and for those seen that mild success bring profit regardless of the expenses of what's inside the boxes it becomes a no-brainer and speaking of jasc and home it sucks to see someone who was once an innocent goofball with mediocre content become kind of a shady douchebag with worse content let's put that negative energy on the side support good creators in an era where YouTube doesn't I will now be
