products and these are the controller grip cover with strap that is this here actually and i'm going to show you in a moment what's cool about it and the kiwi design facial interface bracket and face cover pad that also i have installed here on my quest so first let's talk about those controller grips and why i like them so first of all it's super easy to put them onto your oculus touch controllers no problems whatsoever you don't even need to read how it works you simply put it in it's very very cool and very easy and well here you can adjust those straps very easily for your size of your hands so that is very simple and straightforward and then yeah you can do this you can throw the grenade and yeah it's this kind of valve index kind of feeling but what i really love about those is that you have an easy way to access the batteries should you need to replace the batteries for your controllers and we all know you don't have to do that very often but sometimes you need to do that for other controller grips you have to detach the whole thing and it's kind of finicky here and that's so cool you have direct access to the battery check this out so here's the compartment right and then you simply open it and here you have access to your battery so how did they do this well let me show you that so for that for showing you that i am going to get this out here of this grip so actually they give you this this is a replacement for the original cover of the battery so this replacement it comes with this hole and this kind of little strap that will help you to get the battery out easier so i think this is really really a good idea and well for these grips this is exactly i think uh yeah what what was missing right an easy way to access it so let me show it to you this is how it looks this is how it looks and yeah then you would simply put the battery like so and this here would even help you to more easily get it out very cool and yeah let me put it back the other product is their facial padding their own facial padding and their own yeah interface this here so if you want to exchange the original quest padding with the pure leather one like this you can do so and kiwi design offers this product now what is the difference as compared to other companies well it's very similar obviously but you do have more ventilation going on here so this whole thing these are like little ventilation channels i would call them and no light can go in but air could go in so if you are one of these players who sweat a lot and probably yeah this is a problem for the normal covers or for other interfaces this here is actually pretty cool since well there's so much ventilation going on here and also down here so you shouldn't have big problems than with the lenses fogging up so that is nice and well of course for the pu leather you can simply easily more easily clean it as compared to the original face padding that comes with the quest so that is cool so in my opinion a very cool giveaway win the quest to 128 gigabyte with a kiwi design accessory package and all of this is sponsored by kiwi design so thanks again kiwi design for running this ammo tv for the
