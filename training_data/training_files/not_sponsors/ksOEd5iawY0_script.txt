oh it's cute wow this is so cool okay do you know what the first thing is that you need to do in minecraft i've i've never played minecraft i've never come on no no no you've seen streamers right you've seen videos surely i've i've seen like clips but i i'm not kidding i legit don't know how to play minecraft punch a tree right wait am i doing something am i doing it funny am i doing it yeah yeah yeah yeah oh no don't push me okay okay why am i punching a tree oh we're all right hold on uh there you go i made you now you can break here right maybe uh i'm punching the tree i am very angry i'm getting all my i don't i don't know if it's okay okay try to block below it can i close that one yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah how do i crouch oh there you go all right all right all right all right all right so you see the little oak log right drag it into the crafting table or click and click and yeah wait i hear sheep yeah yeah well we'll do it later okay just just okay you get the planks uh uh see the planks that you got from it oh yes yes okay grab those and then now you got planks so now you turn the oak into planks now you want to turn the planks into a crafting table oh yeah yeah there you're getting it oh okay and we need the crossing table okay okay so now put it in your hot bar which is the lowest inventory bar okay what about that yeah there you go so put in those get out of your inventory with e again and now you turned oak logs into crafting tables magic guys i'm a professional minecraft player you don't need the dirt you don't eat the dirt you don't eat the dirt you don't need the dirt you just need you just need the logs just the logs got it got it okay turn all of your logs into planks i can do this do it just do it fundy eyes i smart fondy i do good i need one more okay hold on that is not quite how you want okay aren't they doing it no no you uh get one more yeah you get one more okay okay no i know my goodness wait a minute wait what okay so now you figured out that making dumb recipes gives you nothing okay so if you shift shift click the planks they they go all in your inventory shift clicking is like fast just making x try and make an axe if you can now get that okay now if you go out of your inventory and scroll towards the axe you can then start using the axe oh my okay oh i actually killed the sheep oh yeah oh me yummy uh-huh oh my god look at me mine i'm a fundy are you proud of funding i you're you're getting somewhere you're getting somewhere you see what you're standing on right right so don't don't think that don't take that um okay let me place down a crossing table down here there you go uh i'm gonna give you a pickaxe there you go i dropped it you can get it what the sound that's a zombie don't worry about it don't worry he's dead okay so now you have a pickaxe scroll to the pickaxe and use it yeah okay so that is um that is actually iron oh so don't actually mind that yet we can't mine it yet okay okay um just get a bit more a bit more stone okay you need a bit more stuff before we do anything because we we want to make a stone pickaxe and then we can get an iron pickaxe oh that makes sense wait what happened to my okay so you broke your pickaxe but you probably have enough stone now so take some planks and make a stone pickaxe okay a stone oh there you go there you go all right get that okay so now you upgraded your tool you upgraded your tool you can now get the iron and upgrade it again okay get that dig it up getting the i did i did it okay so there's only one sadly i thought that would be more um we're probably gonna have to need to get to like a cave or something okay okay i like tights what's that me why are you why are you what are you doing with that meat did you smoke it did you take it actually no i actually don't know how i got this yeah you're right thank you thank you for taking thank you for giving back my meat you're welcome i was just holding on to it i was just beating up the dirt with my meat okay that's fine everyday thing to do all right let's get down here here's a cave so this is cool mind coal okay but do you hear that yeah that's a zombie oh okay okay stone pickaxe but there's yeah yeah that works that works that works get all the coal but there's a fire do you hear that yeah i hear it i hear it i hear it oh now it's all private again wait do you think it's like something it sounds like a human like i mean a zombie was a human but that that right there sounds like a human recorded it you know maybe i mean i mean i don't  know how to did it okay man would you okay okay okay okay would you voice over a zombie uh if they get oh oh okay okay there is money yes uh well there he is um yeah you're gonna want to watch out for these guys okay well they're going after you not me oh get him get him get him get him get him get him get him keep kicking keep oh my god you were useful i am i am useful i did it what is this you actually contribute to helpful i am always helpful funny what are you talking about do you think i'm a statistic bastard yes what why um because uh you're murdering animals oh touche for bacon though i got it i just got it what did you get minecraft because you mind stuff yup that's true my you got it and then you craft your crafts thing you might have craft things and that's why it's called mine and now it's melting adding mine and iron can you get is is fine times a game you can get good at like yeah yeah no okay okay speed running is okay so people speed run this game and basically try and beat it as fast as you can and like it's very competitive like there's a lot of stuff that is involved in minecraft it's like a very big thing how do i combine these together oh it's like this yeah you can just combine them so in minecraft um every item stacks up to 64. that's the maximum why not 69. i mean that's kind of like what true speak your mind what why did i stop at 16. that is so true yeah man much you're kind of being a weird champ right now not even going for the funny i agree i agree that's why i said wait what's that i fell lava no one touched that uh you're good did you know that lava is hot oh yeah i'm like i'm on fire yeah you're literally dying how do i fix this just keep walking keep walking just keep walking just keep walking uh shift shift shift keep shifting keep shifting shift unshift shift shift right now right now keep doing it no i'm not on fire anymore i'm good i'm good no you gotta keep doing it otherwise it starts again wait really no you just look like an idiot now all right so open up the crafting table okay um and what i want you to do is i want you to make an iron pickaxe i have a pick cast uh okay right so now with that you might even fasten like even faster oh my god okay and what i also want you to do is i want you um to go into search bar and type in um iron those are all the iron stuff you can make iron chest plates yeah make that
