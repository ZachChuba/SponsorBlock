as a lot of you know gambling in runescape has a long history and it's partly due to the fact that runescape's currency has real world value on the black market so if players can find ways of acting like casinos and making gp they can then sell that gp for real-life money games of chance on runescape like dicing used to be allowed but jagix eventually cracked down and made games of chance against the game rules obviously though that doesn't count staking in the duel arena some gambling host evolved by making gambling bots the gambling hosts could set the odds for the gambling bots and the gambling bots would advertise and operate their own mini casino in-game the inner workings of these bots have always been unknown except for the people who run them how fair are the odds how much gp do they actually bring in and how many of them are there these bot farms have always been so secretive so when i saw this tweet from mod twisted at the anti-cheating team about removing a lot of gambling bots i reached out hoping i could get some answers it turns out the operation is a lot more widespread than i imagined and is linked to a bunch of other cheating methods in runescape let's get into it but first if less than 30 percent of my viewers are actually subscribed let's start with the scale of these bot farms first i want to note that there are bot operators competing against each other there are massive gambling bot farms vying for position and customers they go by different names and the anti-cheating team told me they identified four of the biggest jad followed by four numbers gamble followed by four numbers cree followed by four numbers in vegas followed by four numbers jagex said that these bot farms have basically every variation of these usernames which means there are up to 9999 bots in each bot farm that would mean these four largest bot farms make up 40 000 gambling bots obviously though not all at one time the next day after jagex told me that mod twisted tweeted again that they had just removed 3941mm gambling bots and that was already after a massive ban wave the day before so it's safe to say there were tens of thousands of them we'll get into a lot is in the description jagex was able to track these accounts back to their origin and they told me that it seems like gold farmers mass create the accounts complete tutorial island and then sell the accounts obviously jagex focuses on tutorial island to make sure that bots aren't mass creating accounts so the black market turns to hand played gold farmers to mass create accounts it's crazy to think that there's someone out there whose job is to just create accounts on runescape those accounts are then sold to other groups of people who bought quests to bypass trade restrictions in free to play once that's done the accounts are sold again probably to various bot farm owners but in this case gambling bot owners are one big customer for those accounts once the gambling bot owners buy those accounts they're traded 10 mil for a bond and to buy the gambling bot classic outfit of course this changes between bot farms but one example jagix told me was full vire gear a scarf a cavalier and a black cape i've seen other bot farms where the full royal outfit once they're bonded up and have the outfit they're ready to start taking bets at this point jagix says the average amount they usually start with is about 350k and this is where it gets really interesting because you might be thinking how could a gambling bot take a bet of 10 mil when it only has 350k if the customer wins the gambling bottles the customer 20 mil jagix says the customer win rates when these bots just start out with 350k are much lower than otherwise basically the bots cheat at first to make more gold than the 350k so that they can take bigger bets and even out the odds later on jagex said that the bot farm owners build up their reputation by having huge discords with customers in them and letting the customers verify their bots somehow but let's get into how much gp these bots actually generate the bots average trades between 5 and 100 mil daily to mules obviously gambling bot earnings depends on the bot popularity and the time of day the bot's operating it's unfortunately crazy that one gambling bot can net 100 mil in a day but these bot farm mules were tracked down and a lot of them obviously sell the gold some of the mules jagix found had 50 mil but others had up to 30 billion gp on them which if it was sold is worth over 10 000 on just one mule account but jagex also tracked that one gambling bot farm feeds into another form of gambling on runescape instead of selling the gold the gambling bots would trade it off to max accounts meant to stake in the dual arena each trade was exactly 2 billion gold jagek said these accounts were ready for sale to players who wanted to go staking in the dual arena gambling whales could buy a max staking account that already had 2 billion gold ready to go gamble at the duel arena so the money collected from players gambling a few mill at gambling bots was then aggregated and sold to players who wanted to gamble more at the dual arena i guess it's kind of fitting that smaller gambling operations just feed into bigger gambling operations there are also other bot farms i found that end up feeding staking accounts and i really didn't even mean to find this bot farm it's incredibly well hidden because these accounts just stay at the grand exchange under stacks of players i only noticed them because on one world there were two that had the exact same levels and bought like usernames i ended up finding six or seven of them spread out across a bunch of different worlds all in the same tiles on the grand exchange alking they have all 50 melee stats 25 range and between 70 and 80 magic i sent the names off to the anti-cheating team at jackdix because i was super curious how many of these accounts were out there anyway they told me they found 30 of these identical accounts those 30 accounts end up sending 150 to 200 ml per day to their mules the account age ranges between 5 to 10 days so like 120 to 240 hours-ish jagex told me that apparently they're mainly buying you long bows and elking them obviously they mule the gold off but it looks like the mules then distribute the gold and fix trades of about 200 mil to random accounts that jagex says look as though they're being built up to be stake accounts all roads really do lead to the dual arena but there's another connection i made because that 50 attack 50 strength and then high magic level reminded me of the mobile zulra bots i found in my last video this bot farm could totally be one of the earlier stages of zol robot they hire alk bot to make money and get their mage up to make their account ready to do zera this is probably the easiest way a high level bot farm has been discovered i got a tip that a bunch of really really high level accounts were banking at feroc's enclave and then typing zero and teleporting away the tip said they thought they're vorkath bots because most of the accounts have over 6 000 kill counts so i hopped around various worlds at the ferrox enclave to see if i could find any of these accounts that were just typing zero over and over again eventually i did and a lot of them are like over level 120. i didn't check too many worlds but i only found four accounts that actually typed zero of course i sent the usernames off to jagex to see what was going on jagex confirmed that they were all bots which means that the reason this high-level bot farm was caught is that for whatever reason they type zero when they bank the anti-cheating team found a total of 20 accounts in this group botting forecast they also found the bot farm's two mules and each forecast bot traded over 20 to 25 mil to the mules at the time of being caught the two mules had 5 billion gp on them the bots themselves averaged only about 4 million gp at the time of the ban probably because they mule their gold pretty quickly the bots that i found had six to seven thousand forecast kc on them though and with forecasts average kill being worth about 126 k that means each bot had generated between 700 and 900 million gp i'm guessing these accounts were all hacked as well because they had a lot of high stats on them the quest requirements for voracath are huge and their play time averaged between 70 days and over a year so these are some really long time players being hacked and turned into four cath bots now there are a lot of rock haram fishing bots out there some of them with like 20 plus million fishing experience so i sent off a list of about 20 usernames to jagex to see what was going on and the information i got back kinda puzzled me each account only had about three thousand rakharamwans on it none of them had sold any karamons on the grand exchange they didn't have much else on the accounts they weren't really mulling any karamons off either so what's happening to the karamwans and or gold that the botfarm makes i don't know if the kuramon bot farm has found a way to offload its items without being detected it's kind of a mystery though this is one of the most ridiculous bop farms i've ever seen i don't even know what else to say about it so i'm just gonna explain what it does basically at the grand exchange in the most popular worlds there are accounts that now say will be rsgf for one gp as soon as you trade them any amount of money they start following you and doing a bunch of emotes behind you they all have the same script it starts out with saying your username and then is my dad so sir pugger is my dad and then within like 10 seconds of giving them money they say they love you but they would also like more money and then it escalates to advertising that someone can steal them for more money than their boyfriend currently gave them and then and i can only say this because i'm not streaming on twitch they start saying out simp my simpser pugger and trade me x amount more than him the script continues and says you're spoiling them and you're their sugar daddy i found like five of these bots and they actually get pretty annoying because if you stay around they won't stop following you and typing stuff until someone trades them more gold people are programming robots on runescape to be virtual girlfriends for runescape gold and then making some sort of auction style bidding to get other players to outbid people to be their boyfriend to generate more runescape gold i think after this gigs you just gotta shut down the game
