oh my god it hurts you hey what's going on everybody for first we feast I'm Sean Evans and you're watching hot ones it's the show with hot questions and even hotter wings and today we're joined by Chicago's own chance the rapper he's a three-time Grammy Award winner and one of the most exciting names in hip-hop check out his debut studio album the big day which released earlier this year and you can see him on rhythm and flow a music competition series airing on Netflix now chance the rapper welcome to the show yo what's up so many people credit you with bringing back spicy chicken nuggets so I take it you're pretty good with the heat I'm actually not a spicy like I don't like to like no no that's not at all true I'm terrified right now let's face the fear let's face the fear chance okay [Music] which direction am I going in so I definitely eat though we'll start at the handle started the handle if you get lost along the way that sauces are funny because like this one has like a nuclear bomb on its you know if like you're working your way too far you're getting to the sort of like the dicey zone okay [Music] so I want to start by talking about your Netflix show rhythm and flow which is this music competition series where you alongside fellow judges TI and cardi B try to find the next big rap superstar watching the first four episodes so I feel like maybe you're the Simon Cowell yeah it does feel like that they kind of put me in that position right I don't know I think that's the edit cuz everybody was be keeping it real it just seems like like I was shutting [ __ ] down I don't know and then in the Chicago episode you guys shoot on location at two places one the Harold Washington library and then another Reggie's over on State Street what role did those two institutions play and help him launch your career well Reggie's was where we we had a show that we sold out and it was like the first hip hop show to sell out at the spot that didn't like to book Hip Hop shows definitely not local Hip Hop shows and we were like local local kuvira fresh out of high school also this was before any of us I really like blew up or like anybody on the internet knew who we were and then yeah and then the library that just completely built me like that was like my rhythm and flow like I used to go to a hunk of mic there and every it was I think it was every Wednesday or every other Wednesday they would have this big home for Mike where like everybody would come through and do their poetry or dance or stand up a rap and there was a guy there named brother Mike who used to just like pulling on the side pulled me to the side and be like you know practice your rap so you can't rap anymore I like stop you know cursing so much you know do a new piece I would come there and perform the same pieces every week because I was comfortable with them and stuff but yeah it was just like he was a huge influence on my life and a lot of artists most artists that came up around my generation from Chicago [Music] actually hate jalapeno as a flavor so but you like Chicago so this one's like a real I like just show fun doing outside said to just like hurry up and finish it if you keep it in your mouth it's it gets hotter I like that you traded notes with offset so when Shia LaBeouf was on the show you push forward this theory that your favorite comedians are probably good freestylers because it's the same skillset and ability to ad-lib do you think that it might be true the other way as well like do you see a connection between rap and comedy yeah the most stand-up comedians they do like fill out the room and stuff but they're more so like they have a piece that they wrote themselves that they go through and even if they ad-lib a little bit it's like mostly their piece when you're an actor it's like someone else gives you words you interpret it and then if you're lucky if the director doesn't hate you then you can ad-lib a little bit you know what I mean but Shia LaBeouf is one of the best freestylers of all time swaye said he's the best freestyler in hollywood yeah definitely definitely in an active but I mean like period like he's fire he could do that you can put him together that doesn't sound bad at all the heartbeat pineapple Oh habanero pineapple habanero catching that habanero a little bit yeah habaneros coming through so throughout your career you've wrapped the Chicago White Sox from throwing out opening pitches to narrating pregame pump up videos - even today rocking the Hat here on out once this was the one I found Wow do you have any insight to why White Sox gear from the days of eazy-e and Ice Cube to you and Kendrick Lamar why it has such an esteem place in hip-hop uh I don't know that's a good observation I would say it's probably the colorway the black and white over way over like ever feeling you know connect it or accept it in baseball I think it's more so a like a rebranding of something that we find to be cool well you know like jay-z he puts his money and he puts his like brand behind the nets to make that cool oh you have like the Toronto Raptors and Drake like what do you think a team has to benefit by partnering with a mega famous super fan you know it just makes them cool obviously I feel like it's also like about the city appeal you know I I like the White Sox cuz they represent the south side of Chicago to me Drake has a whole voice the team is a bunch of people's voices funneled through to just be like hey where are gear are like come to our game I mean they just have a surgeon like fluidity with the fact that they're actual people and not just entities as go Cubs go a Bop no go Cubs go why do I know that go go why do I know that that's the Cubs theme song yeah I guess it is about cuz I don't even know how I know that melody that you just put that song maybe it's from that World Series who knows [Music] when is the big jump it changes person-to-person over here so you know it's it's in the it's in the mouths of the beholder I suppose but speak science to me back like right here I would say is a significant jump I'm like 5 to 6 into 7 and then just a like a the size of the Grand Canyon its I'm sort of jumped from someone to date and we're on oh we're on force I thought we were going to stillness alright so in this instable ease clickbait ha take age that we're living in the nuance relationship between vans between artists between critics it seems to be more complicated than it's ever been so with that in mind what I want to do is hit you with some quotes from famous musicians covering the topic and I'm just curious if you think they're true if you think that's false if you have any sort of chance to wrap or take on it ok yes this first one is from Knoll Gallagher who actually said this on this show fans they don't know what they [ __ ] want no one wanted a Jimi Hendrix before he came along no one wanted Oasis till we came along no one wanted the Sex Pistols they don't know what they want until you give it to them I feel like that's a hundred percent jura and I feel like it is a brave decision to be an artist even if you're not famous especially if you're famous but to be like hey I've made this myself and put it out there for you to enjoy and also judge I definitely feel like people don't necessarily always know what they want because there's a bunch of songs that I didn't that I probably heard tastes evolved and people change yeah this is from jay-z at the 2009 American Music Awards men lie women line numbers don't numbers lie I really like numbers I sometimes just because it's like it's still like a representation of something but not all the characteristics of it because no no yeah no I don't know do I disagree with him or do I agree with them on hounds I agree with that all right two more for you this is from a since deleted tweet from Liz Oh people who review albums and don't make music themselves should be unemployed well that's oh really that's a strong take on it I don't necessarily feel like they should be unemployed but I do feel her to a certain extent I feel like I don't I don't think that that job shouldn't exist I like they should be unemployed I think it's just like maybe there's just a different process to it I feel like the idea of like being a critic I need to listen to it find out if it's good or not and then write up a piece about it you know there's a certain way that they systemically ingest music it might not be the same way that you know the regular consumer might take that [ __ ] out you know well set one more for you this is from Lady gaga I actually don't want a throne at all because I don't view myself as a queen I view myself as one of my fans yeah I can see why somebody wouldn't want to be considered someone that's being exalted or like the finite top of something that's kind of wack but yeah am ia fan of myself definitely so yeah I [ __ ] we got on that and I feel like totally [Music] habanero horseradish garden era [Music] it's a little bit of a jump here yeah [Music] well it was great doing this interview all right chance we have recurrent segments on our show called explain that Graham where we do a deep dive on our guest Instagram pull interesting pictures that need more context so we'll show you the picture you just tell us the bigger story does that sound good yes all right first things first do you remember what happened with the birth of the bucket voice okay so I'm with Doug McDermott and Jimmy Butler and this is at a time when they all play for the Bulls and the bucket boys are the bucket yeah isn't Chicago we played the drums and I don't know I was wasted and I was like hey we're the bucket boys and they was like yeah I was like take this picture so you remember where it's taking this is a Gabrielle union's birthday party in Chicago like a few years there you go Wow the caption here is don't put ranch on my chicken ho yes Skrillex I could definitely tell you what's going on here so Skrillex sunny great great guy mazing dude this dude has like five houses in LA he let me stay at the one that had a studio in it and he came over and he was like I got these chickens can I put ranch on and I was like let me take a picture of how ridiculous you sound right now scorpion for pepper sauce blend and it says very hot at the bottom so should I have put it in my body for TV I guess so [Music] [ __ ] that was an offset bike right there [Music] approaching the ceiling a little bit huh I'm a real [ __ ] man but that [ __ ] is insane c'mere milk yeah yeah all yours all yours so looking at your career in public persona I think one of the more complicated things to unpackage is the way people react to you being a Christian rapper at least putting faith in the music that you make when you see headlines like vais saying it's tough to be a chance the rapper fan when you're not a Christian what is your reaction to that maybe maybe that's true I don't know I'm how to sail right now does that sound like it makes sense though No [ __ ] is obviously Kanye has been generating Kanye levels of interest in this Sunday service thing what's your milk and ice cream hey let's bring you the ice cream let's bring it Leah what's your initial thought on that kind of music sharing and how is it different than like tearing down a concert at United Center [Music] I guess slightly more important because it's doing what we're supposed to do which is shouting praise seeing Kanye get all these people together reveal these songs of worship that have been around forever to people that may not know them or it's an important thing that I think it's supposed to be happening right now it's dope that he's doing it Dom she's a lifesaver what's the word again for the for the [ __ ] that they put in there to make a hot capsaicin conversation so this is actually an extra creamy extra fat extra sugar ice cream that I got you like looked into the science a little bit yeah you got to understand like this was the dumbest [ __ ] I've ever done in my life because I don't like hot [ __ ] and I'm highly aware that I sweat where I [ __ ] I read you guys our piece on it too on the web yeah I'm impressed chance I'm not no goofy dog [Music] could you just start to prepare a second bowl yeah cuz I think Dom's on it Tom's on it you're doing grass that was only like the first that was the first like officially hot [ __ ] right but look now how far down the line we are you know we are close to that finish line look at all that's behind us just a couple in front of us we're almost there word I just want to point out I wasn't really like an athlete in high school like a lot of people that I know that do the show or like they used to like they have like this athletic drive to like beat something I don't feel like I'm necessarily winning by eating all of them yeah I could at any point tap out it would not feel bad about it I would be fine okay it would be fine what you all one side well they dropped out over there did you read that on some sort of yeah so in 2015 your younger brother Taylor Bennett actually did a first we feast guide to dining after hours in Chicago so now that we have you here we just want to hit you with some of your little brother's recommendations and I'm just curious if you agree or not okay haha psychological thing bring up my little brother Oh we'll keep you in the game yeah keep you in the game according to Taylor the best pizza in Chicago is Connie's pizza on 21st and Archer career disagreement I highly agree with that actually yes he is correct Giordano's or Lou Malnati's I'll go with lose hello it lose but Giordano's is still fire ones got to go Harold's Portillo's Al's Italian beef house Diane beef out of here where is the best three am drunk eat spot in Chicago isn't cheesie's is that is that the grilled cheese yes but I'm not careful ready I didn't get mad but the I think probably that strong food spot have you ever been a Sully's over on like north and Clybourn it's like a black hogs pie that's the spot yeah they have a like a these Sully sticks there [Music] No all right look like I'm gonna take a 10 a 10 a 10 a bite that's fine I'm gonna keep it pushing chasin the bite with the ice cream smart I think [Music] why does someone make that I think specifically for this show you worked with everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Lil Wayne to Justin Bieber and Ed Sheeran who has the most fascinating work process in the studio Lil Wayne he just stands on the corner behind you oh my god it hurts you I wanna fight you I understand I understand we're in this together we're in this together but I understand the impulse Lil Wayne stands behind you and just quiet he doesn't even really bother it kind just looks around at a certain point he taps an engineer he goes away into another room and genera turns down the music and goes on headphones with the holidays fast approaching I'd be remiss not to mention your 2016 Christmas album with Jeremiah which is called Merry Christmas Lowell mama what rap song would you put in the pantheon with like jingle bell rock and all I want for Christmas is you whoa there's a song called held it down by Chancellor a Pancham pie and it's up today it's a pear stuck there I want to go down in history as the negative quit I feel I don't feel bad at all about tapping out you know I think that if anything chance has been hot you should be proud of yourself because you really pushed it because I know my yeses and my nose right so I could look at these last two pieces of chicken sa no [ __ ] oh it's so hot all right let's bring in a new fresh napkin fresher napkin whoa what can you tell the people about chance the snapper and did you follow that saga as it unfolded yes Chancellor snapper has a blessing and disguise because I was getting ready to drop my album nose whoa I was in the studio my wife was getting more and more pregnant I have a lot of time to go do radio interviews and stuff and then the chance of snapper thing happened was huge promo I don't know why this was like global news everywhere in the country they were talking about this alligator in Chicago that what happened alligator got stuck in a swamp yes they're gonna swamp in a [ __ ] humble Park hmm that's the story and someone named it chance to snapper and now it's like Emma knows everyone you know what I think is like the most interesting funniest part of that story is like they had like Chicago's local Gator guy like Gator Bob out there who is a misleading around that look he was even one who got it though know what they did is they brought in some Gator expert from Florida and in like three seconds he like caught that thing and there was like the weight of this city was on Gator Bob to try to find get out the water Bob we're calling in a real professional all right xxx you're gonna do it yeah you know duty calls this is the last dab we call it the last tab because it's tradition to put a little extra on the last wing you don't have to if you don't want to yeah you're so right about that I don't have to since we're since you're actually in the wings and I'm not is it cool if I interview you a little bit if actually some yeah that would be my existential question sure sure sure I feel like it's good content so first though mm-hmm okay so if a tree falls in a forest no one's there to hear it doesn't make a sound no it does not make a sound where do you fall you're correct that is the right answer [Music] why why why not you're amazing at this man you did a great job today yeah thank you and I just have one more for you yeah come on why not because one thing that we haven't touched yet is how you are so unflappable independent but now that you're distracted by some of the hottest sauces and chicken wings we're gonna try to sign you to hot ones records so I'll just throw a couple deal points at okay and then you you can maybe point a poke a hole in whatever I'm offering okay give each one one by one all right eight album deal for you a sizable advance and a generous 25% on royalties no but let me let me negotiate against myself okay okay let's go total 360 partnership deal all right we want to go in on a hundred million dollar advance 10-year deal fifty-fifty on everything the albums the tours the merch let's crush it bro no all right all right listen listen you might as well empty out my pockets here okay okay you drive a hard bargain chance but how about this okay 200 million
