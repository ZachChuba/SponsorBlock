[Music] hi everyone welcome back to another video today we're having an inktober video I know that this year I said I wasn't gonna do any weekly inktober videos as I'm very very busy and last year it done nearly killed me so here are some of the October's that I've done so far and today I'm giving you a little bit of a tutorial on how I've been doing my inktober this year but first a word from will all be in the description as well so with all that said and done let's get into today's video so I have a little inktober plan on my iPad that I did late September so this is where I basically sketched out and did a little plan for colors and everything and today's prompt is day 23 hula-hooping and I thought that for this day it'd be really cute to do like a little girl with some cool space buns and have her like hula hooping her with her neck and her space buns I thought that'd be quite quite cute yeah I just sketched out the idea that I had planned out from my iPad and I normally use just a regular mechanical pencil or just any pencil for this and I'll go in and make sure that everything is nice and proportional and then everything makes sense because obviously you want to make all the mistakes in the pencil section of the drawing because once you go in with inks and everything it's a lot harder to backtrack so I sketched her out with my my pencil and I've been doing all of my inktober illustrations in my tail ins art creation sketchbook it's a great sketchbooks got great paper and it holds all the materials that I've been using for October really well it's great for mixed-media stuff and I've been using my pasta pens and some brush pens and some alcoholic markers so and it holds them all perfectly so I've been doing them all in here and then I'll go in with my tombow food a nosegay brush pen for all the line art and this is kind of my Holy Grail pen for this year in October it's just so great for line work and it also works really well to fill in some areas that are black really nicely and it doesn't smudge when you add alcoholic markers or pasta pens so to me it's been a really good pen to use for inktober so I go in and I line everything with my pen and I'll start off quite light and then slightly keep adding details later on but always being really light with the pen because it is a brush pen so you want to start off as light as possible and then kind of go in a bit harder for thicker lines also I forgot to mention but for this year's inktober I'm using Cora Louise illustrations prompt list for it's like a circus-themed prompt list and I decide not to do the original promise this year because I found this one by Cora Louise and it is so so cool and I love circus themed things so this one was perfect and I'll link her Instagram down there if you guys want to go check her out she's got really cool art and yeah I probably should have mentioned at the beginning so then I will go in with again same pen and I'll just add in all the details in the hair I'll try and like just you line everything with this pen so that then I can rub out all the pencil of course there are some details that I sometimes can't erase because some things I go in with my pasta pen but I'll try in line as much as I can with this pen so that I can erase all the pencil as soon as possible and if I do make any mistakes but because those do happen if I need to like it raise something or just go over a an area that I filled in with black that I shouldn't I'll either use a white pasta pen or a jelly roll white pen to just kind of mask it a little bit so don't be afraid to make mistakes obviously it's very normal if I have to I'll go over them with my red pasta pen but normally did you get masks quite nicely so then to erase all the pencil markings I go in gently with a putty eraser I have this one from faber castell which I love very very much and I'll go in and do that and then to add some color this year I've been using my oh-hoo-hoo alcoholic markers and I've been using just this selection of gray tone markers as this year I wanted to keep everything very gray scaled and very like you know classically inktober II and I've been using just these markers and then a red pasta pen which you will see later so I'll go in obviously starting off with the lightest shades and then building up in darkness so I shoot it in her skin with the lightest color that I've been using and then I'll start adding in the darker colors for shadows and makeup and stuff like that it's been really fun working with a very limited color palette especially to figure out like hues and values and color valleys and stuff like that it's been really like interesting to learn to make illustrations using such a limited amount of supplies I think it's just it's it's always really good to do inktober it just teaches you something new every year and this year I learned how to work with values and just grayscale colors things yeah I also always forget to put in my little bleed sheet but underneath my page because that's me if you don't know I'm talking about in who who comes with like a plastic sheet that you put underneath your page that you're working on so that the markers don't bleed into the next page and it's really helpful when you're doing you know back-to-back alcohol marker two illustrations in your sketchbook it helps you save up as many pages as possible without colors bleeding into each other so yeah then I'll just start coloring in the hair and just slowly but surely adding in all the shadings I find this really therapeutic because I don't really have to think too much about it I just keep going in every once in a while with a darker color and just work my way remote work my way up really every once in a while I'll go in with the lightest color that I have and use it to blend in the new darker shades that I've used this really helps to make everything kind of blend in seamlessly and yeah then a little while in I'll go in with my red paska pen I've been using a medium tipped Posca pen and I'll go in and add all the color highlights that I had planned out this is why I used a plan in my ink in my iPad so I could figure out where to lay down the highlight red colors and then I wouldn't you know straight off the plan but yeah I'll go in with my pasta pen in line and color in everything that I want to be red and the cool thing about this is that I figured out that where the pasta pens down on the paper once I go in with my over whoo-hooo markers they actually add shading onto the pasta pen really nicely so I can actually shade any items that I have colored in with red and it doesn't ruin anything and it's super cool so I've been really loving this combination this year so yeah as you can see I then just go over the Reds that I want to make darker with my ohoo markers and it just creates different shades of red which is really cool and then I'll go in with my Jelly Roll white pen and add in all the highlights and all the like little little shines to their to her face and the illustration and this always makes the illustration really stand out and like look really finished which is great and last but not least I'll go in with the one of the darkest markers that I have and just add those last few really dark contrasting bits for the illustration and that's normally you know like around the hair and the darkest shadows caused by other items on the illustration and then of course I'll go in and blend those out with a lighter marker so here I am again going in with my jelly roll white pen to add all the highlights in the hair this is my one of my favorite parts because it just really makes the illustration look really finished and just very professional-looking I think and it just makes it very realistic I think so yeah I'll just go in and add a way to any highlights obviously and after that the illustration is done and that's my prompt for inktober today I hope you guys enjoyed watching me work on this illustration and don't forget to sign up for audible the links will be down there in the description thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys in my next video bye bye
