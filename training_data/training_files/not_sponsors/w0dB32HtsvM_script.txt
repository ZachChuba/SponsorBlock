oh hello many magic the gathering players asked the question what are the laws of commander the rules to gain power and keep it within our favorite multiplayer game which often involves politics cunning and on occasion skill well to go over just what we even mean by the laws of commander i have invited the gang from or two of the three of the gang from one more mana sed and ken are here today to talk to us all about the laws of power for commander said ken thank you so much for being here thank you for having us and for those unfamiliar the one more mana youtube channel is an awesome place to go for all things commander uh they have covered the rules of power for commander as well as deck techs other fun stuff everything that you could really want involving this and so i will be sure to leave links in this video's description go check them out throw them a sub i'm a big fan and i think you will be too today we're talking about ideas of how to acquire power or avoid being manipulated by those politics at the table and so this is a popular series that ken and said do on the one more mana youtube channel and they're going to come here and just highlight a few of the laws for us so the 48 laws of power is a book that was written by robert greene and it basically summarizes or details 48 principles that you can use in the business world to maintain dominance and power over people it sounds pretty sociopathic psychotic i'd say it sounds very i've actually i'm on the record as saying this sounds really psychotic though i i would apply that that has to do with how you interpret the rules and interact with other people more so than them as a business and really that's why we wanted to kind of break them down to first see if they can even be applied to magic the gathering because it is a political is a strategic game uh you can look at it almost like a business setting there is a player who's going to be more dominant than the others and so we wanted to see how these things apply and if they could apply and so that's why we break down each law uh one by one and see how you can use them in game and outside of the game and so it's not just about necessarily using them but also recognizing when people are using them against you and understand how to defend against these and and recognize them when you see them so it's not just going to be a catch-all i'm going to use this law against this person today and they're going to feel my wrath is it's about understanding how the people across from you are playing the game and and basically how you can also just kind of defend against them as well absolutely and i think it's important to note that intent and use is is very critical here that we're talking about these as kind of just rhetoric for commander and a fun way to look at ways to get ahead in commander or possibly to be aware of what your opponents are are doing in commander versus other instances we may have heard of with these rules being taken into uh more the realm of i don't know american psycho or something like that uh that you know at the end of the day uh rhetoric itself is is not so dangerous as how you use it uh and i especially like as someone who used to teach rhetoric that you mentioned to be aware of it so that you can defend against it uh which i'm definitely very excited to hear about in this discussion just coming into the game uh when ken and i first started playing this we heard about the um the psychographic as far as what uh i guess what mark rose water said that you have you have reasons why people play the game and also how they play the game so you have your johnny your spike um i forget the last name but in your temp yeah and so we just always felt like something was missing so we don't necessarily know if this slots into this or if this goes against it but we feel like this is just another tool that you can bring to the to the table but this essentially it breaks down to this game is essentially like other games like chess where it's a form of mental combat you're coming to this with an appreciation with your opponent that you guys are sitting down to compete and try to out thinking out with each other and like the things like this where the 48 laws of power or the art of war you can uh associate some of these things so to augment your play style to confuse and of course subdue your enemy yeah absolutely and i know like you just mentioned art of war i know jim our friends jimmy and josh over at the command zone are uh quite obsessed with applying uh the ideas of the art of war to commander and i think that's another example of being able to uh have an interpretation like this to just get better and better enjoyment out of the game yeah and very last thing one thing that we also one reason we also brought this into this is because we feel like people get so absorbed into just playing the cards um i'm coming to the game shop i'm coming to the table to just do what the cards say and do what the cars do pack up and leave we feel like there's a human interaction that needs to happen with magic and that's that's also one of the reasons why we focused on this is that your your cards aren't just a resource the people at the table are also resources and we feel like there needs to be more um i i guess what's the story i'm looking for um in intuitiveness uh maybe when it comes to how you're playing the game and just being more mindful about the people at the table don't just be so absorbed into the cards that you're playing but we can't we can't forget that first more important rule about magic that reading the card explains the card oh my god there's some that that hits home for me very true very true all right well with that with that being said let's start getting into these rules let's start with the first one uh i'm gonna guess at them we're gonna start with me making a guess so what is the what is the first law that we're gonna cover today for commander take it away yeah so first we want to talk about never outshining the master never outshine the master so this is what i think of you tell me if i'm right or wrong and then you can go over it in a little more detail but when you say never outshine the master i think of how we always say that the least powerful deck in commander always comes in second a joke being that the person who is the least threat gets targeted the least and then ends up sticking around in the whole game so i think in commander never outshine the master means don't be don't be too powerful or too in front of the game or you might just find a big bull's-eye on your head try and keep it on the dl until your opponents have faded away and then you can strike am i thinking along the right lines here so yeah you're actually right on the line right there see the thing is with commander when you come to the table there's a lot of things that you know can get a lot of information that's given before you even put down and you know start shuffling up and dealing so when you sit down and we say don't never outshine the master there are a couple of commanders out there that when we see instant target on your back we coming for you you know everybody that guy yep so cali is on my list uh or dragon is on my list edgar markov is on my list sensei is on my list oh yeah yeah ever since commanders ever since planeswalkers became legendary i see you sensei but yeah but pretty much when you come to the table you don't want to be the instant arch enemy you want to come in smooth undercover just like everybody else that's why we do things sometimes called secret commanders where we build our decks and we put ours a commander that we want to focus on in the deck yeah and overall it's about your play strategy and your mindset so you want to make sure that you're not affecting the game too much and also you don't look too threatening while you're playing the game as well so there are some things you can do along the way as far as drawing attention to a more powerful player or making another player seem more powerful than they really are but essentially yeah come in number two or number three let the most powerful people battle it out waste their resources and then you come in and scoop the game away that's definitely i think really good uh uh commander advice and i never ever follow it i get too trigger-happy when i get a good hand especially early on and i'll just go full force out the gate i don't i'm not guilty of playing with the overly powerful commanders like i won't play with edgar markov i'll do something silly with uh uh anna when the ruined sage is my vampire commander perhaps but then i will still want to show off what i can do way too early become an early threat and then usually get taken out first or second so that's definitely something i need to work on yeah when i first started the game i had to learn that listen real quick i was like why is everybody beating me it's only at nmr what's going on wait to strike wait to strike maybe there are some things that you can do some actions you can take to make sure that you seal the deal make sure that you come in first place and make sure that you're undercover throughout the entire game so through this you can kind of build your deck in a way to either play low threats or just do just enough to the board to make a little bit of a wave but not put yourself out there too much but by the end of the game when you're ready to make the final strike um one advice that i have is use your opponent's resources against them so cards like reign of power insurrection basically your board shouldn't be as powerful as your opponent's board and you can use their boards against them that's cool that's really cool that's definitely good advice so the next law is always say less than is necessary always say less than is necessary this is already i feel like you have stacked these laws against me because the one thing i can't help but do is always run my mouth anyone who's ever seen me on game nights knows that for certain always say less than is necessary but if i'm going to be analytical about this law i'm going to guess that you don't mean my actual chatter at the table so much as what i reveal about perhaps what my deck's intentions are what i have in my hand whatever information that i can withhold from my opponents knowing that's what i should say less uh as talk less as it were you're pretty much almost there um it is about not just revealing information verbally but we're also talking about uh body language as well yeah so some people when they sit down to play this sometimes if they're in a really tight spot you can see that they're sweating you see that they're really nervous that you're about to take out their creature so you you want to keep like a poker face you want to keep it straight you're like what you want to wipe my board you know what i'll help you wipe my board i don't care what you want to blow up my lands and you don't want it you don't want to right you know where you're weak so basically you like like some people like as soon as you target something they want to jump up and say wait why don't you target their things why don't you target somebody else why are you coming at me well okay thank you you just told me that by taking out that one piece i decimate your game plan it's not just about what you're saying verbally but also listen to what your opponents are saying because they're they're definitely listening to what you have to say so you can listen to their weaknesses what their strengths are and use that against them throughout the game so i do over like again i feel like you're literally describing me because that's exactly how i behave uh with over-the-top stuff are there any more subtle signs for those a little less exuberant than myself uh that maybe i could look for uh in my opponents in this area try to make them reveal more things about their game plans and themselves throughout the game again while you can give out information about what it is that you need what it is that you're looking for maybe you need a certain piece off the table but you make it known that that piece needs to be going because it's going to affect everybody not just your game plan uh you want to make you want to make threats central to everyone not just yourself and you can also tell within the play styles too for example if there's a bunch of monsters on the table a bunch of creatures and everybody sweating but one person you know they either have a fog effect or a wrath effect or maybe even some ferris protection over there like you can you can tell based on their color combination what they could possibly handle they have in their deck too especially if they're playing blue or as i like to call it the no fun deck interesting interesting yeah i definitely see how that's advantageous all right i'm going to start changing i'm going to start changing my approach in this area especially because i think i'm very guilty of violating this law as a matter of being so i'm going to work very very hard there uh the next law what is the next law that i should be paying attention to that we're going to discuss today law three is conceal your intentions so how is that different than say less than is necessary so this is a little bit different because you can still uh try not to say more than you need to say but also still uh this is this is also looking at like body language uh i'm gonna cheat a little bit because we we've been playing cards for a long time uh ken and i and so we have poker faces we actually look at how people hold their hands um if you put your cards down on the table i don't think you have confidence in what your game plan is also uh because of how we used to play like me and him we've been playing different card games and for example if by holding your hands i can tell which side your lens are on and which side are your power cards on and i can also tell by how you're moving your cars and repositioning where's where as we like to call it that fire is where the heat is coming from because whenever you move your cars you repositioning your heater cars to wherever your dominant hand is so it's a it's a it's a lot of little many many traits that we can see people that we can isolate to figure out what they're doing and also when i say conceal my intentions sometimes i use my commander itself as a faint for example one of my favorite commanders is newmont the devastator and i'm pretty sure you've heard of him uh break down real quick was it three in jessica it's a six six body with uh flying and when it makes contact you can pay a two and a red to destroy some uh two target lands now the second i put new one on the battlefield everybody's like oh my god he's it's a land destruction deck run for the hills but secretly it's a soldier deck and they can never tell so while they're sitting there focusing on new month my soldiers are just marching in interesting that's really interesting you know one of the problems i have a lot is when i play a combo deck and i start assembling those pieces people immediately go to shut me down i like the idea of distracting them by trying to build in a fake theme for them to be focused on instead of a surprise combo win that i might try and sneak out very interesting also real quick one thing i love about his new mod deck um if you hold up seven mana and a player is playing blue what do you suspect seven mana and on blue you're gonna absolutely get cyclonic rifted until they eventually ban it not not when you're playing against ken because like oh sometimes i just hold it up just because just to scare you and i'll be like yeah go ahead put down something and then as soon as you get back to me yeah i don't have nothing i'm just playing around with you but but uh one thing i noticed specifically about newmar i'm not scared of cyclonic riff when seven mana is up he has angel of the dire hour this is a seven mana five and two white uh flash when it enters the battlefield exile all target attacking creatures gotta conceal those attentions baby that's clever that's super clever the next law i see on the show notes here is protect your reputation this one i can't for the life of me guess on except perhaps that i used to have a bit of a problem with enjoying kind of lying in uh uh multiplayer games of commander where i used to love saying i won't attack you and then attack people which was despicable and i now absolutely have a rule that i make very clear which is that if i give a word in a game that i uphold it without question that that's like almost as though it were a rule of the game and so i want my reputation in the game to just be that if i say i will abide by a politic rule that it's my word is gold uh in that regard but i don't know if that's what you guys are getting at here what do you what do you mean by protect your reputation well in our play group especially we play with a lot of people but as you play games with people you start noticing several patterns about them whether there's uh spike players or um uh brand new players but you they they build a repetition sorry a reputation about their play so some people when you see oh there comes kevin you know kevin he gets upset when he break up his combos oh there go mike right there uh mike likes to drag out the game because he takes five minutes between each turns this is the reputation that you're building as you sit down people don't realize that so and some people well when they when you walk in the door and sit down at the table they were like they already made up their mind if they want to play with you or not mostly when we're talking about this is having a very positive reputation i actually notice how you affect your play group so if you are a man of your word or you know or you're not maybe that's something you might want to work on uh if you feel like you bring positivity and enjoyment you play fun decks you keep a positive energy or um you know you're just very positive about yourself and very caring yourself and that could really liven up a play group and that's you will be someone that you want to play with yeah and as someone who like i admittedly in my early days uh did not follow that law i'm proud to say i do now uh i also can just say it's it's for the good of the game you have a better experience i had less fun playing commander when i would pull that kind of antagonistic shenanigans with people and i have a lot more fun now and you're absolutely right for people it's the sort of thing where you might not get invited back to the table but uh looking to have that sort of a bad reputation or bad behavior is not going to lead to any fun games of commander or uh perhaps too many more games of commander so yeah absolutely an important law yeah you know it's bad too when you walk in and all of a sudden everybody takes a deep breath because like here we go again absolutely absolutely but again that's where they're gonna stop inviting you or perhaps just gang up on you first or things like that uh it's it's not doing you any good it's not doing you any favors yeah that's happened several times over like hey okay look guys the first three turns yeah we gonna knock him out and then we'll have a real game [Laughter] okay so what's the next law on our list so law seven get others to do the work for you this one i think i know this one i think i know uh it could be a dangerous one this is where if there's a threat on the table that affects everyone you want to do whatever you can to convince other people to use their resources to take it out so that you don't have to use yours this is where you get into a little bit of a game of of chicken if you know an opponent is likely to have a counterspell and you have a counter spell and it's like all right who's going to counter this is it you is it me and you want to try and be like i don't have it but we also can't let that spell resolve is that a bit of what this law is exactly you hit the nail right on the head see that's the that's the thing you want to make the other players flinch first because let's say you use all your removal and your counter spells now you're just sitting out in the wind without any clothes on and just being attacked by anybody who comes by you don't want that just you want to use your resources sparingly and and like i said just look them in the eye like yeah i can take the hit but can't you but yeah but then don't you run into trouble that what if they go yeah actually i can take the heat and they they really can and they let it resolve and then you're up a certain creek you take the gamble you just you gotta do it it's it's just a game and if you constructed your deck correctly then you should be able to bounce back from anything and so this is the mindset that we really want to try to instill in players is that uh don't try to do all the work yourself you're going to be outnumbered when it comes to resources also don't think of this as a 1v3 game because now you're thinking about arch enemy and that's not really the mindset you should have try to figure out how to delegate resources and responses across the table you know very by by varying threats see he's being very gentle with it i call it cut bro all right we're all trying to figure out how to escape the escape the cave at the same time with the treasure right all right but then once we get to the uh exit i'm gonna trip you up that's all we're doing see who can outrun the bear right you don't have to be you don't have to be faster than the bear you just have to be faster than the other people trying to outrun it exactly yeah so there are a few few cars that we can talk about um that actually point to this one that our guy derek loves to play derek handles our deck techs he loves billing as well great card so yeah x and sultai and derek is known for just generating oodles and noodles of mana is this ridiculous how he does it i can't stay in this car so he's like i don't have the answer in my hand may not even be in my deck but i think the answer is in your deck so let's see what you got and the best mechanic i think that works for this is actually gold gold is i get your creatures they won't attack me but they got to go somewhere else like they don't got to go home but they got to get away from me uh and one last card we want to point out is scheming symmetry so i think that the mindset that people need to have when it comes to skinny symmetry is that yes it is a tutor for you to go find a card that you need for yourself but negotiate with the other player that you're uh having go search their library make them go search for the answer and to get rid of a threat on the table so you essentially just played a tutor for one free card or two free cards however you want to do it so moving on i see that law nine says win through your actions i feel like that's pretty self-explanatory in uh commander but i think maybe you'll uh correct me it went through your actions go ahead and just actually make moves and make plays that have a purpose towards winning don't just do silly things for the sake of being silly or uh try and gain advantage that you don't have anything to do with have a plan is this just a fancy way of saying have a plan that is one way to think about it but there's another way that we consider this one so there's a difference between politicking and arguing and trying to beg your way out of the situations we've run into situations where we go to attack someone and they're like don't attack me while you're attacking me go after somebody else you're like just shut up and take the hit i feel like you know we've never actually played a game of commander together and yet you describe me throughout this entire video it's it's fascinating it's it's just you you might as well have a tape recorder going at one of my commander games so that's exactly what i sound like so so prof can we call can we call you prof [Laughter] we wrote these laws we we were applying these laws just for you you figured this out that's right this is a commander intervention this is basically everybody that i've ever played commander with secretly contacted you guys yeah like you need to intervene here set it up as like a an episode premise but the truth we're just doing an intervention yeah pretty much we're here for you all right all right well then if you're here for me tell me a little bit more about when when through your actions then i gotcha so when we talk about went through your actions we want you to focus more on the gameplay and not necessarily argue like can say argue your way out of situations or spend time at the table debating about what should happen or why you made a certain play um threaded says everyone can't really thread assess the exact same way uh you may think that this permanent on the table is a threat to you so you want to get rid of it but you know i may want you to get rid of this other thing over here and i'm i'm gonna wonder hey why didn't you help out the greater good or the entire table uh again this is not a team sport like everybody like mike tyson once said everybody has a plan until they get popped so when everybody comes in about how they want to take advantage of the game and they already have a plot and plan and your plot and plan may not align up with everyone else's so you can't get mad if i won't come in and help you at the final hour when this person's board state is overwhelming it could be that i'm planning to take this person's board state you have no idea what my plan is so just try your best and and thread assess and and take over the environment and make it benefit you play penny don't be petty there we go love it yeah love it so don't i hope you guys have that on a t-shirt or a play match near you all right all right yeah so we're down to the last law then law number 10. avoid the unlucky and the unhappy i i feel that's a very unfair law because that means just avoid playing with me because i'm just unlucky and unhappy when i'm playing no that's not true i'm i'm unlucky but very happy so gosh if i were to guess at this one this is just about your own attitude enjoy the game you know i i if you're coming out of competitive magic 1v1 and you're you're maybe more used to tilting out when you lose or or or taking it really bad know that commander isn't always about winning and that uh if you're going to obsess over bad draws or or bad state of mind then you're playing the wrong format that's that's right so as they say in the actual book 48 laws of power uh you can die from other people's misery um yes other people's negative attitudes and negative negativity can bring you down it's an energy that drains your energy and could possibly put you in a bad situation so i look at the exact same thing when it comes to magic you may have some of those players who are just like i just can't seem to draw enough lands i just can't seem to fend off um these attackers and then you might find yourself wanting to help them out or you know be gracious a little bit no don't don't do that because that's my thing baby like my favorite thing is when people like are stuck on lands like they might still go two or three and i keep attacking them because my i have a i have a theory about this because once you let off them they eventually know they eventually build up enough resources to overtake the table so i kick you while you die that's cold you basically you you call the weak then you're you're just going in for for someone that is is down on their luck and you're just going to totally wipe them out of the game there we go because the least they can do is change decks power shuffle like they should have you know maybe add an extra land or two in there that's their fault oh no oh no cruel it's a cruel game but yeah at the end of the day what we're talking about also is just your state of mind like you said um have more positiveness about yourself and if you are having that bad game that bad draws don't try to bring down the energy of the play group don't try to you know bring other people down to your your negative level uh try to keep a positive mind about it and remember it is just a game because i have definitely been in situations where after someone has that bad game and then they go grab their stacks deck and says all right since i have fun last game nobody's having fun this next game right very true oh and i think the perfect card that represents the statement oddly enough is gamble uh the red spell that says go get a card and then you randomly choose a card from your hand to this uh to put in the graveyard which happens more time than not to be the card you just went to go get that's the way it goes though sometimes although also you can have a felden deck where the fact that that card went in your graveyard can be put to good use that is true that means that you actually thought about this and you have a plan a rare a rare but occasional occurrence for me for sure all right so these are just seven overall of the laws that you've gone over and if people want to go check out more and also hear more detail because we've of course just offered an overview of them you have a whole playlist on your channel going over each individual law for commander at least many of the ones that you've covered as well as the other content that i mentioned earlier so again people can go check out those links in the video cannot recommend it enough uh ken said thank you guys for coming in today uh why don't you take an opportunity to tell people a little bit more about what to expect on your channel in addition to finding it more about the laws of power for commander yeah so of course you can check us out on our youtube channel uh one more mana you can find us on twitter at mana squad where of course we'll post the links to our videos we do our mainstay show command center where we talk about certain popular commanders and unpopular commanders and talk about synergies that should be played with those commanders we also talk about like things like how to beat certain commanders commanders or how to beat certain metas in the format because like we hear how you know how to build these commanders but also we want to teach you how to tear them down too that's right so we also have our deck techs deck doctors deck derek handles we have a audio podcast called mtg fam magic the gathering family of magic where we talk about how you know a lot of us are family people so we talk about how we blend magic with our family life and just tips for uh people who are in relationships or have or parents as well we also are holding a magic the gathering trivia show that we've created uh that's gonna be up and running once everything goes back to normal uh we have our first episode up it's a brand new take on magic and uh test your know-how and your knowledge and skills uh and coming soon we're having the magic academy where we're trying to teach uh people who are just coming to the game how to play fantastic just a wonderful library of resources again i'll have links to all of that in the video description one last question before you go you mentioned that really cool sounding new mod deck is there a deck tech on the channel for that one uh we did cover in command center and just went over some synergies but we can have derek uh do a deck check on this one i think that's definitely one that i hope to see in the future because that sounded like a spicy spicy deck oh it is very amazing especially like people never see it coming it comes out of nowhere um people people wonder why i'm the only one attacking ken when he plays this because i'm like you just don't know don't don't be fooled by it and then it's funny because then people look at him like he's the antagonizer and they'll start attacking him it's like i don't have six man at the southern new mod why are you attacking me beautiful beautiful because at the end of the day commander is a format for playing with friends and of course beating and torturing those friends with sick plays like that because that's how we show we care and i'm stuck with this card forever and i'm basically dead in the water
