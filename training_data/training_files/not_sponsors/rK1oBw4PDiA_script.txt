Hey so unless you're some sort of superhuman being you've played before and when you've bled it stopped and it seems like it just stopped somehow like as one is course and now it's done complete comfort but how does it actually stop what's going on inside you that actually makes us up it's all quite complicated stuff really but it can be broken down into five phases so we have vessel spasm formation of a plaintive blog blood coagulation or development of an insoluble fibrin clot clot attraction and plot the solution so first off we have the vessel spasm and this is initiated by tissue injury a spasm and tricks the vessel and reduces blood flow and this all usually lasts less than one minute boom done thank you next so step two for me plays a plug the platelet plug is initiated as platelets come in contact with a vessel wall small breaks in the vessel wall are often sealed with a platelet plug and normally don't require the development of a flip of the blood clock so platelet plug formation involves adhesion and aggregation of platelets basically the gather and stick together and they do this by using a protein molecule called von Willebrand factor which dissolve circulates in the blood as carrier protein for coagulation factor eight so at this point you may have gathered that there are a whole bunch of what we call factors mostly proteins and each one is super important in the process of stopping at lead they can promote clotting as in pro coagulation factors or they can inhibit it so anticoagulation factories so safety of missing one of these factors or proteins and you may have a bleeding disorder for example an affiliate a is due to lacking factor 8 and haemophilia B is due to last one factor 9 and each of the procreation factors identified five four numerals performs a specific step in the regulation process the action of just one correlation factor for enzyme is designed to activate the next factor in sequence so tonica's abdominal are cascaded factors and the chemical events in the blood coagulation process involve a number of essential steps that result in the conversion of fibrinogen which is a circulating plasma protein to the fibrin strands and mesh platelets and blood cells on plasma to form the clock so the overall aim of the coagulation cascade is to form footprint that is the general endpoint and the fibrin acts as a sort of web entangling the platelets and cementing everything together after the clot has formed clot retraction which requires a large number of platelets contributes to hemostasis by squeezing serum from the clot and joining the edges of the broken vessel then finally we have plot the solution the dissolution of a blood clot because shortly after its formation this allows blood flow to be re-established and permanent tissue repair to take place the process by which a blood clot dissolves is called fibrinolysis and as with clot formation kata solution requires a sequence of steps controlled by activators and inhibitors but but but to be brief plasmon which is formed from plasminogen digests of different strands of the clot and certain clotting factors - such as river engine factor 5 factor 8 prothrombin and factor 12 and this allows blood flow to be re-established and tissue healing to take place and that's it this video is brought to you go check it out and tell me what you think on a big thank you to my patrons on patreon and thank you for watching bye you
