platform to build a beautiful online presence what I'm about to say the bravest thing that you have ever heard on YouTube for years 80 years I Jordan have been telling you to respect women's bodies by how not touching them just leave them alone only in very very specific situations should any of you touch any of her and people said Jordan don't be a prude don't be so blessed ik Jordan Jordan Jordan well guess what boo yeah I think over the last year I have been completely vindicated and so I will say once again loud and proud if anything you were doing is making a woman uncomfortable what do you think I'm about to say stop it do not pass go do not collect 200 bucks do not put yourself in compromising situations avoid the appearance of evil it's not hard just do not touch women what what if she's hot no but what if I'm pretty sure she's flirting not touching if I just really wanna touch your especially that I understand this goes against everything every urge inside of you I need you to find the courage and bravery to not do this do not go through with this for two main reasons one she may not want you to touch her every thought of that and two it's just not worth it you could do something that you think he's innocent but it's not taking that way and you know how this could have been avoided by you just not touching her in the first place I don't think it's absurd to say that the only women you should probably have physical contact with are ones that you have built up a lot of trust with and depending on what kind of contact we're talking about here I would argue you should probably have some sort of long-term commitment to them as well but I don't want to be presumptuous what if it's just casual and for fun think about it like junk food it's momentary satisfaction you eat a potato chip and it triggers something in your brain oh that was a good one let us have another says this is how we were hardwired do you understand me we've been set up and you pay no heed to any negative side effects of eating potato chips because it's always just about that good fleeting feeling that you get in the moment it's like a primal urge look well I am NOT trying to liken women to potatoes I could have just as easily said pizza and Josh wrote this script so I'm just talking about help you're not thinking about the other person involved I mean she might as well just be a potato in your mind because you're just thinking about how much you want to talk something anything I cannot believe we're touching my shoulder oh no touch your hip oh wow we're touching a female oh I say all this to say this it shouldn't be a big deal to abstain from initiating physical contact it's not like you're doing it for some greater good you're doing it because it's fun and it makes you feel good that's the same reason why I jump on a trampoline no I'm not I'm not I'm not comparing women to trampolines I could have just as easily used pizza people for so long have said to me oh come on Jordan lighten up it's just casual don't make everything I guess what it is a big deal physical contact is a big deal and that's why wouldn't you break the rules it's bad so don't touch women please even if she half smiled at me last week no I didn't call or smiled no that never happened do not underestimate how many fractions I know what hey are you website or domain that squarespace.com do it with me guys slash cow what if they just really wanted do not underestimate how many smiles I know and fractions even Wow words I think a female
