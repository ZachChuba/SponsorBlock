[Music] uh video so it's always the same thing at the beginning of a bigger trip like i realize this is only a four day trip but we're doing legit kilometers like 30 clicks a day type thing maybe 25 one day or whatever so and then on the last day it's the fourth day we're paddling almost all day still unless we make up some crazy time but my point is i always start these trips thinking like man how am i gonna do this for that long i've been paddling for two hours not even and my arms are shot feels like my new super heavy i'm huffing and puffing that's what happens when you live in such a spot where you can't just get out and do things right and that's that is an excuse i do have the detroit river i can go paddle on and i can go hike on the old dump that they put grass seed on and stuff yeah it's a million degrees and and i'm just sick of it so the thing is i'm moving soon i'm moving up north and i'm going to be able to be doing these things every day i have a lake in my backyard literally i have trails to go use and i have land to go use i'm going to try to become a healthy joe a healthier joe but that all said i start out all these trips like this and by the second day third day i'm in my groove second day's a bit rushed but by the third day i'm in my groove and uh everything's good this is not going to be the last canoe trip of the year either i want to do a legit longer trip maybe up in killarney once i'm there but when life gives you rivers paddle them so we're not far along at all yet we've only been going for a little short amount of time but i'm hungry it's almost 10 o'clock eats up for a few a breakfast a few hours ago so i'm going to stop and grab a couple snacks on my backpack and put the rest of the food near the top so i can grab them as i'm going we're just heading out of tim lake back into the tim river and we will be coming up to our first portage shortly it's a short one it's only 120 meters and that's really most of them for today are like that and few and far between pretty short that's a good thing and we're going with the current so we can make up some time today supposed to really start pouring down tonight at around seven so get a good day's paddle in set up the tarp and hunker down for the night i did end up finding my tent for those who watched my gear video i went to my storage locker and i found the trusty old big agnes start to see some fall colors coming in over there nothing too crazy just yet some oranges some rusty looking colors another couple weeks will be probably peak it's september 20th right now maybe yep september 20th coming up to our first portage even though we're on a river and we're going with the current it's a very wide river and uh it's late in the year so the water's down a lot tons of lily pads piling right through them actually so we're hoping that once we pass the portage up here it narrows down and speeds up the current speeds up a bit i have been down here before probably four times at least but old joe doesn't remember things too great so once i see landmarks things start to come back to me but i can't remember what's up ahead at all so we shall see we're being followed there's a group of like 20 people that stand pretty close on our tail we really uh took our time at the beginning messing around taking playing with our cameras and stopping on a island site i guess we should not have so we'll bust through this thing and uh try and lose those guys that's the thing they said it's a busy weekend so i guess it is so i think i'll show you guys my setup for portaging what i do when i come to a portage everything i really need to do just to show you how convenient it is how efficient and easy it is so here's my yoke we keep the yoke just loose in the front of the boat what we're going to do is look for the tape on either side just pop it on i usually i definitely need two hands for this then i'll just squeeze the boat together and it pops on and nothing's solid i got my yoke pad makes life easy i'll normally tuck my my gopro down so it's not banging around inside my boat whatever's loose inside my boat this time it's my water bottle my sunglasses and a piece of paper so i will empty my water bottle by drinking it or pouring it out put these away my fishing pole gets tucked up in the front underneath and then rest back here on this thwart what a weird word a thwart thwart i got these small gear ties i just kind of wrap them on i only need one i just have this extra one for extra so my sunglasses and my water bottle will go in my pocket for now fine like that and i've got my map as well loose that'll go in my other pocket i'm wearing my fall raven vita pro trousers had these things for quite some years now okay so all that's left is my paddle and my backpack i sit my life jackets attached to my backpack and that's fine to stay there i used to put my seat down i used to put my seat down i just don't anymore because i don't need to the backpack doesn't hit it i always used to think it would ride on it but it's fine so that's all good i'll carry my my pole i'll hold the rope and then we're golden uh so what i normally do is put my camera away it really kind of sucks carrying your camera your tripod your paddle on the portage but people were coming and i was running running away so anyways that you saw how i did it it's pretty easy i took longer because i was showing you guys because i'm out of practice and it was the first portage we've done in a couple months so things will get smoother backpack will get later the life will find a way all right i will meet up with you guys on the other side well we're on the other side now we're getting exactly what we wanted nice tight narrow stream creek river that's it river it's a river oh our first beaver dam look at that she's a drop and it's a long trip i am not trying to just surf down it that's a danger waiting to happen oh yeah she's soggy bud she's a soggy one graffitis are getting wet oh graffitis are getting wet that's the fulcrum point right there right here oh it looks bad come on come on well i don't know if you can tell but doug did it without getting out of the boat major dog strikes again okay buddy almost danger joe sketch pad mcgee despite what it might have sounded like by my incessant whining my feet did actually not get wet they stayed dry and i'm wearing those new solomon boots that i that i bought and wore maybe on the last trip with dog actually i had them on i told you i'd tell you what i thought about them so they're doing good so far so far so good last time we were full of muck we got out here from falling in the uh in the dank remember that that danky muddy water but uh yeah doing good what's that what the uh we think we've lost the people now for good they uh they're taking their time on the portage one guy accidentally took a little tumble so uh he's all right but we are fine to continue on and we are probably not going to see many people i would assume now from from now on but uh yeah man this is my favorite time of year to be out it's cool in the air overcast no rain it's a huge thing no bugs can handle this handle this boy [Applause] you you muck peace bro how nice it is out here oh it does stink that's the way we came from that's the way we go i gotta jump across this thing i think with my camera too huh i don't know i don't know about this i did it isn't that a nice looking tree i believe it's a tamarack so soft the uh bristles what are they called needles needles soft needles we're in like a tamarack grove these are all very pretty uh oh doug's saying it's getting narrower and shallower over there we might be pulling these canoes before the day's through we got some real low water here i'm talking like about a foot and it's a good thing that our boats are small okay we'll throw it now but very narrow very shallow you can see on the banks [Music] look at that tree it's a yellow birch that's a batula alaganensis well we've stopped for lunch it's almost one o'clock i'm really hungry i've been using this kevlar bag for my food lately again i go over it in my um in my gear video it's better more convenient um don't have to try to find a branch to hang it over a lot of the times depending where you are trees grow like this in a conical shape and a cone there's not really far outstretched branches and for a bear bag normally you you look for an oat stretch branch you hang it over that down a bit from it so the bear can't crawl onto the the branch and get it or get it from the ground but with these kevlar bags they can't get into them so i just tie it to the bottom of the tree and call it good never had a problem so for food i've got uh pretty good staple i think i've got all homemade uh meals my my wife makes whenever she makes uh spaghetti or chili or whatever like stuff like that we don't have leftovers i take the leftovers and i dehydrate them no leftovers for them so i've got spaghetti chili and surprise surprise another so we get spaghetti so those are all decent meals for supper hefty amounts in each but for lunches i've got sandwiches this is what i normally bring on canoe trips it's just convenient my stomach does all right with it and it stays pretty decent in the heat so i've got a flat bread i brought four of them because on our last day our fourth day might be a longer day we're not staying here a fourth night but we might here be here for most of the day i like to get dry salami like a german salami or a hungarian genoa genoa and i ration out four or five pieces for each sandwich before i uh leave home i don't just throw a bunch in there so i know this one i did five normally i do four but they're thin right then i also got some cheese and because it's this time of year it's not so big not such a big deal it's not so hot i don't mind bringing cheese i got some swiss oh of course just you know rip the bag right open this no big deal no need to don't need to put it back in there or anything bam now normally and if you watch my videos you will know this i am a mustard man but mustard packets are few and far between these days so no mutard no muttar on there i almost squirted some into a bag and brought it that way but it always just gets so messy and it's like a one-time use tape thing so cheers a little bit of a heavy uh heavy birch bark from that yellow birch the canteen kit for my whole cook kit this this round so what are you talking about well that sandwich was good it hit the spot i'm still really hungry i'm gonna try one of these epic performance bars that i brought this one is the peanut butter chocolate if you guys heard me do the whole spiel earlier on in the video hmm peanut buttery it's got a little chunks little trunks not too bad they caught back up to us we thought we lost them we gotta get out of here man we gotta finish up our foods and get out of here yeah they're all camping on that we were we're in the park office with them and we know that they're camping on this this lake here so this will be the last time we see them but it's just uh it's just funny it's not even a big deal we've just been laughing and joking about the whole time but doug's cooking up a little mountain host dealio and uh i'm all done mine so oh that bar was good i liked that bar a lot i got a bar for you a lemon bar for you to try doug i like lemon you like lemon perfect because i don't well as you can see i've donked my alley g outfit wait wait wait wait wait wait here we go there we go what it is boy all right we uh we're obviously done eating lunch doug is 30 yards in front of me yeah and it's coffee and it's warm lunch belly's all full now so we were there for a little while maybe an hour tops not even um we still got a ways to go it's 145 148 so we still got four hours or so to go it's not so bad making pretty good time now for the longest time on that tim river it was very windy and uh meandering even so we took our time in there and no fishing yet there's no real good spots to fish yet um hoping tonight we can troll a little bit we'll be off the river tonight and uh there's some there's some trout road trip where we'll be staying so hopefully some trolling in get a fish or two it's no big deal if we don't we got food but it's always nice to catch a fish tomorrow it's supposed to storm so it might be just a good day to get um distance done and then the day after that will be on the petawa river and the petawa river is the river that doug and i took last fall right around this time actually across algonquin park the whole way it was like a seven eight nine day trip i can't really remember getting read by yay check it out we're just paddling by and there's this uh upturned tree oh there's all its roots there and it's ripped out some rocks out of the ground and toppled it's actually pretty common to find that man nobody comes this way or else there'd be paths cleared through the lily pads we're going right to the black cortages i see the first one in front the black portage means they're unmaintained and again these are the big chain of them that i did on my solo trip maybe two three uh maybe two springs ago so i know these these ones that we're doing today there's like five of them or four of them whatever are fine but the ones tomorrow are the big bad boys and those are not fun we're just coming up to our first portage here i'm gonna grab myself a little snacky poo i'm hungry already little joe didn't bring enough food he's realizing this is morning one afternoon one oh look at this doug we're gonna go that way um this is such an unorganized trip for me not having all my stuff at home kind of thing but i'll survive i'll be all right maybe well hello halfway through the first one this is only like a 250 or something my backpack is heavy when i put that camera in there the tripod it really really made it heavier okay this is not good i'm having this much trouble on this one this is nothing compared to tomorrow absolutely nothing the rain has found us all right well the rain is here i've already got my big camera away for this last portage i'm just going to leave it away until we get to camp 300 it was only 300. bog pond to longbow we came longboard a bug pond and i can actually see the next portage right here across well we just did a 700 or what was marked as 700 and i look on my map and it says it's actually a 560 that's just signed 700 and it was long you know it's one of those ones where it's like this isn't 700 meters this is like a thousand meters a kilometer and a half but it really was only 560. backpack is very heavy i moved around some stuff so i had my tripod just at the top laying it flat like this across i moved around some stuff i stuck it down on the side uh the long ways it seems to have distributed the weight better put the cameras down lower and stuff so it's still super heavy and um it's gonna suck tomorrow but it is what it is even if i have to do a little bit of a double carry uh for some part of it we'll be all right so we're just looking for our next four times we're on these little tiny puddle lakes say like very very small there's two campsites on this one but we're going to get over to devine and there's some brook trout in there it's nice it'd be nice to camp on one of these small little lakes i have it completely secluded nobody comes back in here and nobody does these black mortages to get back into these black campsites so actually probably would be a good idea to even try and troll through here i'm not really in a rush it's four o'clock now i'll be up camp by five plenty of time it is raining still it's just spitting though it's not a not a big deal so i got a egb lure on it's a decent size i'm just going to paddle slow to the portage and troll it like i said there are brook trout in here go ahead clap with one hand what does he do oh this what does he do casey neistat that's like the high thing we're not gonna do that okay last portage she's raining it's no more no longer spitting you peeing it's raining he's peeing we got a 410 to get into from ranger lake ranger joe lake into divine well we're on our last lake this is divine divine lake i'm not feeling very divine feeling pretty beat be honest with you my hips are taking the brunt of it on the those portages the pack the weight of the pack is just wearing me down i'm not in good shape i guess um tomorrow is daunting yeah if i'm being honest concerned about tomorrow i'm gonna have to double carry the rain's coming down now as you can see i'm not even putting on any kind of rain jacket or anything just trying to get the camp it actually did calm down a little bit from what it was a minute ago too so when i looked at the weather before we left it said at seven it was going to start up real bad tonight and start thundering some thunderstorming all night kind of thing and it's just after five now so we'll be at camp shortly within 20 minutes and not even and um yeah get with you then you gotta eat supper i gotta eat something got a headache and i'm not doing too good it'll be fine i just gotta get back into the swing of things it's like this every time earlier today when i talked to you guys about paddling and how i was like i don't know how i'm gonna do it my arms are dead and i feel that way every time my arms are fine i can paddle forever now reportage it's kicking my butt doug's found our camp so it seems the only one on this lake so it's not like we have uh an option to choose from it looks pretty hilly pretty hilly so mean to his boat so you're so mean to your boat oh fancy oh some wood look at that oh we're ballin yeah lots of flat area place to hang a tarp we're good we're golden and it's really protected yeah it is actually it's nice and dry under here okay look it's chad here chad you take it first order of business is to get this tarp up there's a decent spot here i'll show you between that tree and that one over there then we can sit have our fire um protected have that bench protected what we gotta do shut your face wow doug ladies and gentlemen doug oh my goodness sounds good gotta get higher up go up throw it up throw up sir okay loosen a bit we're just tying a taut line hitch two on the inside one on the outside just look at the shirts look at the shirts i can't remember no all right there you go on this side i'm just gonna get the uh line stretcher and make it bigger doesn't fit this one you can go to that one that's not so protected though no this is not here no we'll go it's not my uh my line i'm just going to tie a regular knot i don't think that we should do it to that one 14 knots here okay you need some slack no but it's not going to be no fancy i don't care just get her on bud all right cool so we do have it up onto the perfect trees there to there and then mm-hmm yeah bunny goes around the tree down his hole good job emmy over there that's actually uh too short we can slide it down no this will be this would be great for the the fire won't be under slide her down a bit oh you don't want the fire under it well a little bit yeah a lot halfway to it yeah for sure is that there yeah i like that perfect all righty some paracord up in here uh up in here uh all right i'll get some all right i figured it out so this is handy to have got this little paracord wrapped around here take out as much as you figure you need i need about maybe five or six feet for the one spot i'm gonna make a little bit longer just in case i should be safe and then it's got this little cutter dealie on the inside someone sent this to me a long time ago oh look at that would you look at it oh speaking of that too ed bassmaster i've seen some new stuff from ed bassmaster the old um well would you look at it look at that car what judger watch it just look at it that guy remember that guy no idea oh man i'm going off on a tangent new videos from ed bassmaster comedy gold so we got our cord nice and easy way to to attach it to a tarp tie out would be looping it putting it through and then running both the ends through that loop and then that bites on there really easy easy to come out or sorry to come on undone and you don't have to tie it so there she is do you know the name of that doug sheep no it's not sheep bend okay perfect there she be shout out you okay done [Music] and we would laugh all right so that one's rigged up when i say rigged up i really do mean it it's just like wrapped it's just like wrapped around this tree a million times you got that covered over there injuries okay shout out to not saying shout out anymore oh i see you're getting back to your roots look at that that's pretty slick that is pretty pretty slick but where does that go to the tarp if only there was a way to attach it well i got a little trucker's loop there already i'm just gonna come through look at you all the way through excuse me this will take a minute because it's all knotted up again okay i'm gonna stop filming that doug's trying some fancy little toggle dealie boys scouting it up here um oh look at you pretty fancy you got ripping that little thing already no way already it's like 25 years old oh that's brand new i don't think so well that's new to me what'd you do richard kyle oh thank you my finger looks like et it's so long it's like a like a wormy worm [Laughter] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] what song is that even i'm a believer by the monkeys oh yeah shrek shrek hey shrek no not shrek you kyle shrek it's from hey monkey shrek princess fiona shrek don't tell me are you eight years old i know these [Music] things all right turn this down yeah this time that's good y'all so we've been in this campsite for some time setting up it's actually really nice um when you see a black portage or a black triangle on the on the oh man on the map um it usually means it's not a good it's unkept it's not maintained or whatever but this site is awesome it's literally raining out there on the lake i can hear it hitting the tops of the trees it's not coming down we're protected by like um i see a big white pine i see a yellow birch see a bunch of white pine so some broad leaf trees and a big white pine with lots and lots of needles on it we're just sitting here no rain under here which is great um and then we will be over here by the time it starts to does start to drip through hopefully by tomorrow or or if that thunderstorm comes tonight maybe not but all we got to do now is just kind of get some firewood tents are all set up i'm just finishing up this and uh it'll be time for supper it's six o'clock now so yeah it's definitely time for supper get in your home i was telling doug i'm really glad i checked in this sleeping bag uh compression sack before i came i had my summer bag in there this one's a negative two i think that one was a plus two so i'm a cold little boy i need the little extra extra comfort so i when i went to the uh storage locker to get my tent out i grabbed this guy too no pillow though it's a it's a peasant kind of trap you got a pillow you got a pillow i got a pillow he's got a pillow i never bring a pillow i always brush let me have it if you're not used to using it anyway just let me use it yeah my clothes bag just let me use your pillow yeah my pillow oh that's not funny i never use a pillow no i'm just joking letterling's little camp ideally all right got my little uh wetterlings uh cam hatchet and uh silky saw gotta go find some wood for the fire and i have my adventure sworn scout so that's all the processing tools i brought i'll put this on my belt real quick and i'll head out as well try and gather some more wood did have a little bit here left for us which is very helpful from the previous person water all right off we go no oh i see a piece of wood perfect good thing about these back away sites here is that not very populated a lot or often i guess so firewood is abundant right off the hop there's this big hardwood it's probably a maple it is a maple so we'll get that with the adventure sworn scout see what she does on that boogies no boogies no boogies nice can't just break it off i had hoped it could nice didn't even break where i was chopping it all right that's a good decent size but i'm not gonna just get that i'm gonna get as much as i can from here carry it all back to the camp together perfect i still take this one too now oh uh that's not good that's not dead that part okay oops all right so we got these two at least i'll go bring these back and try and find some more okay there's the starter and some meat for it [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] still damp oh it smells so nice there we go bushcraft fire camp one so oh you can't see me you can't see me hey rip they go okay ten to seven i've already filled up about two thirds of this with water just from the lake and untreated water or anything like that i'm gonna boil it up and drop in some spaghetti and then let it simmer so i just threw a bunch of wood on as you saw i think i might be able to nestle this in pretty pretty securely yikes not securely at all not securely at all joe there we go that's secure right that stick won't burn so i only lost a little bit of my water it'll be okay my lid's a little bit dented i hit it with a piece of wood last time on accident i was trying to i was trying to split a piece of wood that came down on the lid whomped it up in all wampasy bumpity wampus lumpus i might have drank a liter of wine oh man gotta cut down that weight though right now portage and wait i need a haircut and this needs to go this is too much this is too much tash much sash mustache you want more starch do you want moustache having fun oh she's boiling only spilled a little bit more perfect all right check this out super good homemade spaghetti i think you will look at the mushrooms oh shut up scramble though all right well bam son now it's just got to go back on i think actually that amount of water is fine so i actually meant to spill that water that i spilled earlier because i knew we do this and then we eat oh yeah she done bud cheat on all right guys check this masterpiece out legit leftover spaghetti style i have a red flashing battery the rest of my batteries are in my backpack i really want to eat this so i'm just going to eat this up and i'll get with you guys in a little bit it's what i can talk with your mouth open well you know i thought i'd change it up just switch it up for a little bit and blame it on the battery you know so i think part part of the reason that my bag is so heavy is because i brought a little bit extra clothes i brought extra camera um just a couple different things but i did bring a little bit extra clothes i brought two pairs of socks big thick ones which i'm gonna change into right now one of them one of the pairs i brought a couple shirt big long undershirts nylon pants another shirt and a buff underwear a towel and my fleece pajama pants i'm always the person to say don't break too many clothes camping but i was concerned this time with with the the rain and the temperature and time of year was so i could have probably got away with without the extra pants and maybe only one of the extra shirts but it is what it is so i'm going to take advantage of it now tomorrow i'm going to change into my fleece pants and one of my new shirts and just throw my uh puffy jacket on new socks and my camp shoes i'm all changed now nice and dry and very warm i'll probably lose this took actually my puffy on new shirt on my fleece pants tulums and my dry shoes so not only did i bring i brought extra shoes which i normally never do i brought on like an actual distance canoe trip i brought um a tarp and a tent which i normally don't do i brought a gps and a spot these are all new things to me right i bought i brought um what else extra clothes like i said uh not too much food at all but my backpack is definitely heavier and i'm concerned suck it up yes papa all right what you got going there dougie uh epic performance bar and the flavor of lemon have you tried one before no non-gmo dates almonds cage-free egg whites sea salt lemon oil no sugar added the ingredients are pretty legit all right six ingredients or so i'm a fan of lemon but but hey i smell your boots i think oh i might be wrong but it smells something they're warm but anyway going in what's the texture what is the texture chewy gummy gummy i don't know what i would compare that to how's it taste it's good i like the lemon like really tasty lemon well guys i think it's uh about that time it's just after nine i'm ready for bed what do you say dougie i can sleep you sleep i had enough of this all right try not to snore too loud and chomp the air and i'll see you in the morning all right peace man it's thundering out there like crazy lightning and thunder it's uh 3 45 in the morning it's been raining all night getting back to bed and can you guys hear that rain out there it was coming down like crazy i literally just heard the loudest thunder the longest hunter i've ever heard by far in my life i started one part of the sky and traveled throughout the rest of the sky it was crazy lightning tons of rain i really really really hope that it calms down when we get up but tomorrow the fact was it was supposed to thunderstorm all day so not too uh not too hopeful for that so we got oh just after four now i've been laying here away for probably about 15 minutes i want to go back to bed until about 7. i went to bed about 9 30 and crashed hard till almost four i didn't get up to go pee so that's really good wish me luck well guys it's just after seven in the morning the rain seems to have died down a little bit i can hear doug out there talking a little foggy in here so we're gonna get out there see the damage and uh get ready for the day gotta make some breakfast so the rain has calmed down for right now but like it's a very white sky out there you can see lots of fog it's gonna rain again for sure but but uh it's stopped right now so in the woods here it's um it's dripping off the trees like crazy so it's still coming down but we got a little window so stupidly last night we didn't put any wood underneath the tarp and uh it got all wet and that's okay we can split some down and burn it i got my little i'm gonna get breakfast going right so i got my twig stove my bush buddy i'm gonna do some oatmeal and granola mixed but in order to get the fire going because we didn't keep any dry wood i'm going to use my wax wood stick you guys have seen me use this a couple times before this is from um production hanger 51. he might have changed his name on instagram but i think you can still find him on there and yeah it's actually wood i can shave it down it lights very easily and i can even split it down baton into little pieces of fuel if i wanted to um that'll definitely get any kind of little split down pieces going how you doing all right i'm just about dry at the fire last night put them under the tarp here and i might as well store them in the lake overnight five pounds seriously they're just yeah oh well the wind could help a little bit [Applause] helped whip that heat right away from us well it's gonna be a warm day so yeah but not with rain and 30 kilometer an hour winds the warm is not warm at that point i'm not warm sitting here i'll tell you that i'll tell ya would you like one for your twig stove yes please i'm gonna save this for tomorrow there's plenty here doug so i've split off a small piece of maybe pine or spruce it smells resiny just got my little pieces and this will be more than enough to boil my water for my oatmeal bam [Applause] not that i'm afraid of rain i ain't afraid nice curb see how easy that lights up i'll just sit on the edge of the turret and get the drip you should do that [Music] all right and i already got my my water just left my pot open last night but i am shiny ma'am sonny bam bam son in my car good for you yeah i didn't want to take them all right so for my not lunch the other meal breakfast normally you'll see me joe it up with the instant oatmeals and just pour the the the water right in there and that works but for this trip i wanted something a little bit more so i got granola and put it with my oatmeal it's got chunks of almonds and chunks of cranberries and stuff like that so i put a decent probably one extra portion that i would normally eat so three as opposed to two and then this is just gonna go right into the um the water because in the pot because i don't have the packages obviously for it to eat it out of so it's a little bit more messy a little more time consuming but that's okay i need some food in my belly oh buddy that'll do it oh look i gotta boil comedy having definitely having a good hair day all right yep michael landon would be proud i still put look at that look at this is soup that is not acceptable oh no i'm going to drink that perfect well

the the one we thought one came down but it's like two or three over there and then we heard like a um well while we were looking at the two or three that came down another one came down behind that one like holy crap what is happening it's just kicking up again and the key is so before you say don't put your tent your dead widow makers those are all live green trees every single one everyone they're coming down green literally we saw the the fulcrum point where it broke or whatever it was way over a foot big a foot round on a live tree so it's like and i swear this isn't even the windiest it's been today by far yeah so we're gonna hang out by the fire a little bit longer before we go to bed yeah i hope that wind dies down but yeah because i don't think i can lay in my tent and sleep with like i don't even want to go that way you know i don't like it over there anymore we were sitting here right here at the campfire and we ran we ran because these trees came down what what is that
