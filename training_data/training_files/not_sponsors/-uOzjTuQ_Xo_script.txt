(CHAEYOUNG ready?) (Everyone turns their backs) Time to TWICE TWICE (Our members are awesome~) The third game of the second round is... Cone Hat Limbo! As you can see, we have to wear this and do limbo while looking through the tiny hole. Each successful member will receive 500 points. (OK Got it) We go at the same time?
(All 9 members start at the same time!) If three members succeed,
that team gets 1500 points! If all members are successful, that team gets 1500 points. Wow, it's a bonus game. - Shall we begin?
- Yes.
(Putting the hat on!) - Do we wear it now?
- I can see from the side! MOMO is looking from the side! I can see!
(MOMO can see everything) - Done!
- You see everything up close... (Frozen Tofu)
Like this. (Trying her best to put it on) - I feel like we'll bump into each other.
- Make sure you don't get hurt. (Looking around)
(What do I do?) (SANA is gone) - Like this? - Are you ready?
- Not yet.
(They're ready) I can't tie the ribbon. Whoever has a hoodie, put it on.
(Walking around) Elephant.
(My game is fair play) - Like this?
- Oh, like this.
(Elephant nose) Alright, let's begin.
(They're all ready!) We have to turn three times? Ready, go!
(Obstacle) - Ow.
- Sorry.
(Walking around everywhere) I don't know how to turn three times.
(Where's the bar?) - It's here.
- Let's go!
(Moving forward) Where is it!!
(Tofu is completely lost) I can touch it, right?
(The people in the back aren't moving) Oh!!
(Stay calm) MINA success!
(Team Brain) (Falls) - I completed it!
- It's not there! SANA success! (JEONGYEON is here to catch MOMO)
(JEONGYEON & MOMO enjoying a different game) Hey! Hey! Hey! JEONGYEON, you have to hurry! DAHYUN, NAYEON!
(And JIHYO, success!) (YooJanggoo is back)
(JEONGYEON catches MOMO) (I won't let go of Hirai MOMO)
(All she needs is MOMO) CHAEYOUNG, just go!
(They won't let go of each other) (Slides through)
(Success?!) Go!
(CHAEYOUNG succeeds) There isn't much time!
(Two lovers still haven't passed) (JEONGYEON returns to try and win) - That's right!
- JEONGYEON, success! Go straight, MOMO!
(MOMO heads straight) (Sorry) No.
(She's finally at the finish line) (Passes with ease) MOMO, success! We all succeeded
(Everyone succeeds) We all passed within 1 minute 30 seconds. Everyone succeeded so... Everyone gets the points!
(All 9 succeed!) TIME TO TWICE!
