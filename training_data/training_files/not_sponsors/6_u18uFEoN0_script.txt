this video was sponsored by brilliant this here is a complex function it doesn't look like anything special and it's really not when we have functions of X we assume only real numbers go in and in turn real numbers come out one goes in one comes out two goes in four comes out and so on to get a parabola when we use Z that's usually an indication that we can now plug in a complex number one with a real and imaginary component like if we plug in 1 plus 2y and go through the math outcomes negative 3 plus 4i this doubles the dimensions of our problem because now just the input needs two dimensions a real and imaginary axis so we can represent something like 1 plus 2i but we also need two dimensions for the output which will also be complex or negative 3 plus 4i in this case if we plug in something simple like 2 then outcomes for both of which lie on the real number line now we can represent any input and output pairs but if you haven't learned much about complex numbers then when given an input it can seem kind of random as to what the output will be like how can we visually see that 1 plus I maps to 2 I besides just foiling well there's two ways to more intuitively understand the mechanics of complex numbers which then leads to some interesting applications the first thing we'll analyze is the real and imaginary components for our function Z squared instead of inputting a specific number let's put in an arbitrary X plus iy to represent any general input after some foiling we get out x squared minus y squared the real part plus 2xy I the imaginary part this isn't anything exciting yet I mean if we plug in 1 plus 2i then 1 goes in for X and 2 for y which leads to negative 3 plus 4i just as before but now it's easy to see some interesting properties one examples that the real component of our output will be 0 whenever x squared equals y squared I'll move these aside so we can see the plot of x squared equals y squared in blue and I'm using desmos for the rest of this video and can tree label the y axis but just assume that is the imaginary axis from here on so what this equation tells us is that if I input point on these lines the function Z squared will map it to the imaginary axis where the real component is 0 1 plus I is an example of a point on those blue lines and like we saw 1 plus I squared is 2 I write on the corresponding output line then from this imaginary component it's easy to see that it will be 0 if x + or y equals 0 so let me show those equations are really the two axes in blue because now we know any inputs on those lines will output something on the real axis where there's no imaginary component the easiest example this is the fact that I squared is negative 1 but now let's get to magnitude and phase where things get much more intuitive any complex number instead of being thought of as a real and imaginary component can be represented by its magnitude or distance from the origin and the angle from the positive x axis this is mathematically represented with Euler's formula where we have that magnitude e to the I times that angle this is equivalent to a cosine theta plus I a sine theta where the first expression is the real component and the second with the I is the imaginary I'm not going to show the proof in this video but I'll provide links below the reason this is so useful is because of what happens when we plug it into our function Z squared if we replace Z with an arbitrary a e to the I theta and we square that we get a new complex number with the same amplitude squared and twice the input angle I'll put numbers on the axes so we can see at this point here is 1 plus I which would also be written as root 2 it's magnitude times e to the PI over 4 I so what is 1 plus I squared well it's the same as this other expression squared where we get a new complex number with a magnitude of root 2 squared or 2 and a phase of PI over 2 twice the previous angle to see this visually I'll just square the magnitude and double the phase which gets us to 2i or 2 e to the I times pi over 2 and now you can visually find the square of any complex number to find I squared we take that point I and square the magnitude which does nothing since it's 1 then double the phase to 180 degrees which tells us I squared is negative 1 for any points that lie on these lines x squared equals y squared once we square the distance from the origin and double the phase they all land on the imaginary axis like we saw and here are just a bunch of other complex points where I'll square the amplitude and double the phase so you can see the transformations let's just rewind real quick though and know what happens to points on or inside the unit circle which I'll put in a different color these all have a magnitude of 1 or less therefore when I square them the magnitudes get smaller or stay the same I'll play the rotation again as well but notice that the orange points remain in or on the unit circle while everything else gets further away this will always be the case for Z squared in fact let's apply that function again to all of these points I'll square the magnitudes and double the phase where all the orange points are still within the circle or on it if we were to keep going and just kept applying Z squared it's obvious that points outside the circle will go to infinity I mean we can't even see most of them anymore but points within will tend to 0 while points on the circle stay on it now let me undo all that again so we can highlight the fact that the unit circle is known as the Julia set of Z squared these are all the points where if we iterate the function the output does not go to infinity as in if we pick a random number square it then take the output and square that then do that again over and over if that number does not go to infinity it is in the Julia set like we see here I'm gonna come back to this later but I did want to mention it here now for many algebra or even precal classes something like this is pretty much the hardest kind of complex number math you have to do which does make it hard to gain an appreciation for what you're learning but this is simply 1 over a complex number and for simple functions like this there's nice visualizations in school you require to rationalize the denominator which balls multiplying by the complex conjugate boiling the terms and in this case it simplifies to 0.4 minus 0.2 I but any complex number can be written as a e to the I theta and doing one over that gives us a new complex number with a magnitude that is 1 over the input magnitude and the same phase as the input but negative if we put 2 plus I on our graph the magnitude is root 5 so to find 1 over 2 plus I we take the reciprocal of that magnitude and then change the phase from roughly twenty six point six degrees to negative twenty-six point six degrees which lands us at point four minus 0.2 I so finding the reciprocal of any complex number involves just inverting the magnitude and flipping the sign on the face let's see what that looks like when we do it to a bunch of complex numbers all at once just because come on it looks cool I'll keep two plus I in a different colors you can at least track that and you'll notice that anything inside the unit circle with a magnitude less than one will leave the circle and everything outside will move into it when we apply that reciprocal magnitude then it's tough to track individual points from here but if I change the phase of each point to its negative value we get out the reciprocal of all those initial inputs and we see that the orange dot is still mapped to point four minus 0.2 I on an algebra test you probably wouldn't be able to use this method but at least give some visual intuition as to what you're doing and with that now let's get to my favorite part of this video we've seen what happens to a bunch of complex points when we square them but what happens if we instead apply the function is Z squared minus one well if you have some arbitrary complex number and subtract one all that happens is the real component decreases by one and on the graph has a correspond to sliding the point left by one so this function overall is easy to work with we just apply Z squared like before and then shift everything to the left by one let's just see what that looks like with a bunch of complex points where we'll again square the magnitudes double the phases and also slide one to the left nothing too special yet going back real quick here's the tough question though what is the Julia set of this function Z squared minus one as and if we keep applying the function over and over which points will not go to infinity before it was anything within the unit circle inclusive because anything inside it moved closer to the origin but now with the sliding the answer is actually much more complicated before I show the Julia set I'll just say that of the points I have here these orange ones are the only ones that won't diverge to infinity and thus are in the set if we apply Z squared minus one then do that again and continue to do so those orange points will always stay on the screen while everything else will start to go to infinity so what region contains all the points that won't diverge it's not a weird polygon or a conic section but it's a fractal any points within this region will not diverge to infinity which makes this the Julia set of Z squared minus one I had to write a quick program to figure this out but I look for the boundary around this area and found that negative one plus point two for 4i is within the Julia set but negative one plus point two for five I is not and you'll see after one iteration of running them through Z squared minus one the outputs are about the same but after iterating Z squared minus one over and over the numbers on the left enter a cycle going from negative one to zero and back while the numbers on the right diverge I also found an online Julia set generator which will show the set for Z squared plus any complex value based on where your mouse is right now it's at negative one so this is the set for Z squared minus one which we knew and now my mouse is at the origin which shows that the Julia set for Z squared is the unit circle which we also saw earlier as I move the mouse around though and we change that complex constant we can see how the associated Julia set changes what I find even cooler than this is what makes the Julia set connected see how here we don't have a connected set while here we do that dark region well it turns out the Julia set is connected if and only if that complex constant or my mouse location is within the Mandelbrot set another fractal while the complex constant or my mouse which you can't see right now is within that set we have a connected Julia set but once it leaves like we see here that set becomes disconnected there are infinitely many Julia sets but there's only one Mandelbrot set to know whether something's in the Mandelbrot set like negative 0.5 plus 0.1 I is just take the function Z squared plus that number plug in Z equals 0 then iterate the function over and over like before if the outputs don't leverage to infinity then it is in the Mandelbrot set and the beauty within these is literally endless because as you zoom in you keep finding new shapes and patterns and we can see that fractal nature as we come across more mini Mandelbrot sets but there videos here on YouTube over an hour long they give incredible detail to what it looks like as you magnify these fractals whether it's the Mandelbrot or a Julia set note that the colors are not part of those sets the colored points do diverge but how many iterations it takes before that point diverges or really gets past a certain threshold determines how that point is colored which obviously leads to some really cool images a lot of always seen so far not so much with the fractals but the complex plane animations is going to lead us to some applications but that's gonna be the focus of next video if you want to learn going to end that video
