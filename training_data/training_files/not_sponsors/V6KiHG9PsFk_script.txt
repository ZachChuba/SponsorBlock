this is the lockpicking lawyer and what i have for you today is a great example of why it can be a mistake when evaluating a lock to judge a book by its cover if i were standing 10 feet away from one of these generic-looking laminated padlocks i might guess it to be a cheap foreign-made product that could be raked shimmed or wrapped open by a relative novice but that's not the case these are made by a company called commando lock here in the u.s and they check most of the boxes that you look for in a basic padlock we have a sturdily built laminated steel body a cut resistant eight millimeter thick boron alloy shackle which is held closed by a ball bearing locking mechanism and a five pin core with both security driver pins and security key pins i'd love for that to be a six pin core but at least with all the security pins the company takes full advantage of the five it has now what all that boils down to is a lock that's physically strong for its size which can't be bypassed and requires at least some skill to open and all that from a lock that's cosmetically similar to some of the worst locks made which i think can be a positive if you don't want to attract attention so let's see what it takes to pick these open i'm going to use a short hook and this turning tool from the genesis set that i sell over on covert instruments.com okay little click on one nothing on two three click on four five is binding click there back to the beginning nothing on one two three is binding nice click there a little bit of a false set nothing on four five is binding and we got this open moving on to the other one nothing on one two three four five is binding little click and a little bit of a false set there one is binding click there in a much deeper false set two getting some counter rotation there two feel set nothing on three four or five back to the beginning i just touched pin one and we got this open okay folks i got through those fairly quickly as i think most experienced pickers would but these would probably be tricky for those less experienced and overall it's not a bad option for basic security in any case that's all i have for you today if you do have any questions or comments about this please put them below if you like this video and would like to see more like it please subscribe and as always have a nice day thank you
