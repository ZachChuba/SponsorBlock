[Music] hey everybody and welcome to AGS news where we're gonna do a weekly roundup of all the gaming news but first let's and get to the news and thank you so much to Connecticut's well not much happened this week right no what everything we didn't do seven videos on the blizzard because they're kept little updates cuz I was gone over the weekend I wanted to do some videos but I think it did you know seven videos so there are plenty to talk yeah we got a lot of a lot of updates so if you've been under a rock last we don't already explain it everybody really explains it Blizzard is [ __ ] okay their response is [ __ ] so they finally did ride a an official response Friday at 5 p.m. which is the no news hour if you want to sneak something in while giving your response that's when they did it Bourgogne and so there was a response from Blizzard hey I like that one Minnesota Vikings from there oh I'm sorry alright back to the blizzard stuff yeah so we got a non-apology if you actually read the garbage PR so let me let me let me suck the summarize everything for you let's jungle I'm trying to avoid that we don't need a summary guys you need a summary of the letter for sure on the letter yeah yeah so blitz Chung went from one year suspension to six month suspension the casters went from totally fired never work again to a six-month suspension haha and he gets his money back still but they're what Sonic that's still unacceptable it is and it's still there was no apology there was no like admittance of wrongdoing there like we will try to be better and it was kind of like a nonsense letter that was it's not gonna help anything people are still absolutely pissed yeah voice manners right no just when we say unless it's the Chinese voice of the executives saying do you really want your uh what is it Activision's call of duty mobile over here in the Chinese do it right so here's Blizzard has [ __ ] up and they're [ __ ] up over and over obviously you have that one I thought it was an official Blizzard response but let's actually correct some people unfortunately some gamers have reported and some gaming channels are reported that Blizzard said that we will defend a pride of our country and you told me that that's not exactly yeah that that Weibo account is actually run by a company called net ease and that eases the company that Blizzard is partnered with I mean it it's there but it's a hearthstone account so it looks like it's officially coming from Blizzard but it's not it's run by a separate Chinese company yeah but lizzard probably doesn't have direct control over what they say but they're still partly responsible that shows they partnered with it it looks terrible like that looks really terrible because if Blizzard said that I'm about to be like hell [ __ ] no yeah you know what I mean but it wasn't exactly them and then they had this PR nightmare but it was on Blizzard to stay silent for so many days if this wasn't a big deal as they say it was in in your response at all this wasn't about China this was about no politics yeah there has nothing to do with China at all we made this decision because someone said a naughty message that could have offended any [ __ ] that's because if that was the case they would have addressed it right away yeah they you know but no they stay silent for five days while their employees are staging walkouts while they're getting roasted on social media while politicians are coming in here and saying something and they still have enough to say and then finally when they have something to say it's a half-measure it's all k fine we'll we'll take it we'll give him his money back and then ban him for six months and by the way those two broadcasters are also reduced to six months no if you really cared about free speech if you really if it wasn't an overreaction then you would unban hiss just give him give him his money back unban him and tell everybody you know what you know we did this we did it wrong has nothing to do with China we're showing you that's why it has nothing to do with China but we would prefer if people would keep political messages out of our turn now from now on for no more maybe people would have accepted that but that's not what they did and it's here for them to say that China played no part is a bold-faced lie in my opinion obviously but you know and honestly any time you try to tell the Internet not to do something you know you can't talk about political future you can't do this or you get banned they're just just gonna spread more barbra streisand learn this the hard way Beyonce - hard way it's worth if you tell the internet what service there's something called the Streisand effect then in the 90s someone took a picture of her house cuz it's on the cliffs of California and so she sued the photographer and they they should document it's like look only six people have seen this picture two of those are your lawyers yeah yeah and then it was all over the internet so they called the sky psychic when you try to tell the Internet not they can't do something and by doing so you don't picture okay we'll delete that picture here's 40 thousand more pictures from other people and that's what this my take on in this Blizzard should have been like you know what guys go ahead if you want to make a short little free if you want to exercise your right to something that you believe in go ahead if you win the tournament you number one you got win the tournament number two keep it short and he didn't if they'd said that and if they kept it short you might get one or two more hongkong you know a protest and maybe somebody will say something about Trump or something like that but then it'll die down and it'll go over with but no they had to stop at least let's Chung though because we were talking about the there is a US base I think it's a use hearthstone team that put up the sign saying like liberate Hong Kong support Hong Kong and they didn't yeah not only did they not get banned they got their full schedule they get to play the next game they actually in in there what was cool of them is they decided to forfeit in in like solidarity which was like really nice to see that them let them do this well it's also cool cuz uh Brian Kuebler I think ok blur yeah yeah yeah he's a hearthstone cast no he's a magic player that is a traitor to manage yeah no I don't like what you're doing of course I'm not coming back until you change so he also took a stance something that I want to make like the audience aware of is there was a really big movement as far as cancellations of Blizzard products and Activision products and that was really strong in the first couple days and it's almost completely stopped actually someone put out I think it was this morning the sales data as far as we don't know anything I won't release it but as for hearthstone it like spending is is creeping back up again so if this is something that's important to you stop spending money in hearthstone yeah okay and but and then what you just said there basically proves that that it was motivated by the you know China and the politics over there versus the politics over here cuz notice they didn't ban the US players and they the US players went one step further said boycott Blizzard boycott and they still didn't ban them but you're gonna ban blitz chung for six months yep you don't go from a year to six months but you're not first for the god for the US people doing the exact same thing even worse you're not banning nothing's being said if that's not proof right there then then you're an idiot and Blizzard [ __ ] up on this one and I'm curious to see what happens at Blizzcon yeah because I heard that they were first yeah two weeks we got miss Kahn coming up and there's a massive protests that were announced I mean hopefully not going you're just doing a protest by not going to Blizzcon yeah I don't know if there's gonna be five people protesting or 10 or 100 it's still important I think you don't care about free speech and if you care about the way blizzard handled this horrible well we know that they're afraid because just today there was supposed to be a major release in New York because overwatch is coming to the switch and so today there was supposed to be this are you gonna meet the the voice actors and interact with people and with one day's notice it cancelled everything so I don't buy them that has to do with it because it's overwatch you think people are just gonna start asking overwatch voice actors about blue I think they didn't want the percolated but I could be wrong yeah I think that it's a blizzard run event and they things are still too hot right now for them to have anything and I don't like Nintendo necessarily wants to be related to anything so I don't know if it was a Nintendo decision or Blizzard decision but I do know that if I'd been open today there would be people protesting okay yeah I buy that protesting it's Blizzcon is gonna be super interesting man if they have the open mics if they shut down open mics there that's the huge wrong move cuz you're shutting down free speech and we know why you're taking away our free speech because you you're afraid of what people might say like you know execute like red shirt guys show a second red shirt guy because the first red shirt guy is the WoW song remix and then second red shirt guy is uh you know is this April Fool's joke yes is this a you know rights violation do you guys not have a human rights do you guys not have fun it's so bad for them with their working with you know the Chinese companies on the upcoming Diablo and more it'll be huge division with Call of Duty which you said is one of the biggest mobile yeah it's surpassed Pokemon go and you know Mario Kart tour and and they want to protect that that Chinese Marcos is that big over here they think will [ __ ] and gonna be even bigger in China I mean their market is much larger than ours and the people who pay more on average for mobile games than they do in the United States people over there have no issue with pay too and it's a status symbol for them I for to pay more than you in this communist country and it's not supposed to be that way but that's exactly the way it is so great your social standing with the state is hot yeah well we also got some other news from fortnight I don't know if you guys we're keeping track of the black hold you saw the whole oh yeah I got sucked into the black you got like a hundred subscribers just putting up cats all over the black hole oh good on him all right Jojo maybe we should do a little for tonight oh no for tonight no but that was actually kind of an ingenious marketing move of course you piss off a few people like why can't couple they right now million people who wanted to play for the last play but now it's open and so they opened up the new island we've got a reveal of everything it's less urban areas they added some new features like you could fish you can go on a pogo stick you can coordinate your dance moves with your friends all things that I don't want to do so I'm not fishing Pogo yeah dancing on a shooting don't you be talking [ __ ] jokes I'm just wanting to praise them for that you want to know why I praise fortnight for all these creative things because they're [ __ ] trying it's a free to play game and every season they bring something fresh and new and although I don't play it and although I'm outside of the economy of youtubers making millions of dollars off all the kids watching the fortnight videos and I want me a piece of that know I do what I do they do what they do but I respect at least they keep their game fresh and when I see other battle Royales dying you know and getting ignored and being very stale and taking forever to update it's really annoying because you have a prime example right there for tonight doing you know what for tonight does that's how they made all that money and that's how we got that big storm yeah yeah man we keep bringing it up and we brought it up so they did their job I'm sorry well speaking of black holes mixer lost the other coke so we've lost both co-founders we've lost the VP of Microsoft that was overseeing mixer everyone is just running away from the mixer I thought they were doing well they saying well who was doing just doing well I don't know if anyone else is doing I'm so busy have you been on mixer no well this is the problem no one's actually been on mixer everybody I'm not a ninja viewer that makes it we came the ninja Network yeah in my opinion and you know I I do appreciate I think without the ninja viewers they'd be in worse shape yes I think they are probably the lowest viewed of you know them all twitch and YouTube gaming but I do don't want make sure to go away I don't because I think it's good that there's competition in the marketplace you know and and put a little fire under Twitch's as those which serious no YouTube has you know good numbers not not not twitch numbers not twitch popularity but YouTube gaming you know all of these platforms have their problems and the competition in the marketplace is good yeah you got the big three consoles I look at these like the big three of streaming mixer YouTube gaming and twitch and I don't want the competition to go away because if competition goes away then twitch implements the rules then it's you know draconian you better follow cuz you ain't got nowhere to stream you know what I mean so we'll have to see if they can survive I mean I want them to be able to because like you said that the competition is good for us viewers the consumers of the product but at the same time like they keep messing up yeah a mixer keeps stumbling in their first little like as they're opening up they're not gonna do anything unless twitch makes a huge series of blunders like twitch has to like mess up in order for for mix there's a lot I mean if yeah yeah we got more our suspensions and more banning and week after week we get small content creators that are doing the same thing as their large content creators getting banned or getting warnings just because for weeks on just doing something for a week meanwhile people are showing off their forfeiture and they're getting banned for only three days anymore subscribers and getting a bunch more father so it's hypocritical I'd I hate it you just gotta implement the policy and and then implement that universally yeah don't don't change that founder say anything when he left he's going to Percy has some things that he wants to pursue he wants to I think pursue lighting at he was it what's gonna be a light light person at EDC or he doesn't matter Joe just trying to figure like the captain's are like leaving oh yeah I promise you they've signed something that says they're not allowed to discuss why I want to pursue other interests that are not mixer it makes it blowing up and having the greatest time and then they're gonna be a lot of money involved no no he's [ __ ] leaving that's like leaving Walmart before they started blowing up I don't be super-rich if we had Walmart stuff way back and in bed yeah but uh Microsoft's continue to have it you were telling me about halo infinite right yes yeah another person so yeah it seems like people are leaving and then people were you know people take the sign of creative leaves or lead producers leaving as a sign of trouble yes and there's been many examples of that you know but you know it doesn't always directly mean that there's something going on but hey lo infinite creative lead left Tom something left and then the Mary Olson is this new person just left campaign lead lead producer leaving but the community manager swears there's no creators job everything create drama going on behind the scenes we have a vision we're sticking to that vision is gonna be [ __ ] great guys we promise because we can't they're leaving because they want to make more money or be happier somewhere else somewhere else halo involved all right this week we also got to finally get some information some real concrete information about the PlayStation 5 so we actually have a time frame now so if you were wondering if you can get one for Christmas this next year holiday 22 I came up on us really quick yeah apparently the delays were trying to make sure that the hardware could actually deliver what they wanted to so they were worried about announcing when they could just because they didn't want to oversell but everything came through so officially we're gonna get Holliday 2020 and that's what it's gonna look like and well okay there's no we know that's not what it looks like people keep reporting this is what it actually looks like that's what you were about to say right Allen there was there's a a person apparently a insider who leaked a bunch of information and confirmed that that's what he has and what was mark my words I don't know it will not look like this or my name is Joe Dirt are you yeah will make you read a picture of know Joe garden I'm gonna new well we do actually get great you have to keep back yeah the controllers the DualShock five you don't like that I don't like it I'm not gonna wear my console in Texas Joe maybe in the hot in the cold winter states up north that make you feel all nice it does look like a little toilet seat though right yeah anyways that's not what the PS 5 is gonna look like guys don't let nobody tell you otherwise that's alright well they did good for us we've got ray tracing we've got adaptive trigger so you can actually you'll have be able to like pull the trigger back like it's a bowstring or you'd be able to get feedback whether it's just a machine gun it's not just like a normal vibrating rumblepack like they used to be we have actually got more intelligent things where you'll actually be able to simulate whether you're driving on asphalt into gravel and you'll be able to feel everything yeah looking forward to that I wonder how much they're gonna charge us for the controllers probably throw it see ten more dollars yeah like Nintendo sort of song books are once and the control has already come damaged you know I'm not talking about that bro the pro controller for Nintendo's too expensive and that's probably what they're gonna prize gonna be on that but I'm worried uh whether this is gonna have backward compatibility I've got a big ps4 library at this point because honestly Xbox [ __ ] it up yes and I went to the ps4 and I've been happy ever since so I'm looking for to see if PlayStation can keep that momentum going I mean they're practically computers these days there's an AMD processor in it it does have ray tracing in quotations because I thought that was like RTX technology but no they could do something similar and I just would like it very much if it could be backward compatible especially at the price point which I'm sure it's going to come out expensive yes and I'm also seeing you know the VR stuff I'm interested to see where they're going with PlayStation VR because I enjoyed my PlayStation VR but I thought it was just a [ __ ] hassled bill these wires everywhere and every time here this johast sensitive it's and oh yeah those movement rollers not appropriate cuz you don't get like the individual digits on your fingers like you do with like the rifts controllers are really [ __ ] awesome and they need to upgrade that and and I've seen you know concept pictures of it there's some pictures out there it looks like it has more cameras around it even around the back because it didn't have that in this older design over there and if they can make it Wireless if they can you know somehow track your hands I saw this like demo where like you weren't wearing any gloves you weren't using any controller and your hands were being simulated like what is this this new technology is you have leechcraft but you have two kits because Joe the cameras are looking at the hands but what happens if you look this way then it can't track the hand unless there's cameras on them everywhere but if you could do that if you can do where your hands are real your real hands without controllers wireless headset and cameras everywhere we got the VR revolution go get that by place not happening not happening but I am curious to see whether they abandon VR or they they keep the VR going they can't abandon VR because they said the psvr will be compatible the old one the titles will still be compatible with the PS 5 so they got to make that allowance so I wouldn't expect too much on the psvr 4 yeah I'm gonna wait probably another generation or so unless they can surprise me and everything be amazing in this case some of the games are great but you're right mind mostly sits there and collects dust no man who likes sales the PSP okay maybe another PS 5 but the PS 6 that [ __ ] is gonna be great VR as well as that PS 9 that PS 9 sony if that BS 9 is not exactly like the commercial I saw when I was like 12 I'll be [ __ ] pissed there's gonna be the biggest angry rant I'm be angry grandpa Joe by the time line comes out like the real grandpa Joe you'd be lying in your bed and then you find the PS 9 isn't the actual PS 9 and you'll get you magically start angry grandpa Joe Joe alright alright well we also got some bad news this last week Bethesda has delayed doom eternal and so I was supposed to come out next month something I was really excited for but I understand I'd rather they would finish it polish everything up and release it when it's done cuz I don't need another Bethesda release where you know they tell me oh it's not how you launch it's where you end up yes sir model yeah no I agree I you know when I was younger I used to rage about video game delays but now that I'm older and you know I buy my own games you know now when as when you're kid you have your parents do it so video games not only are we gonna get a better video game or polished video game one that's been you know worked on some more and had time to cook in the oven and it's getting out of a busy time like there's a ton of freaking games right March next year though there's some there's some stuff coming out point yeah good point it's going from one busy time to another busy time but you know more time for the game to cook and work on and get just right I'm fine does it raise your expectations at all though now even giving them a couple extra months if it comes out like an unpolished turn again yeah it actually does if you you need to take those extra months and hopefully it's at the level it's buggy my motto is get it right the first time you know and that that ties into our board gear because obviously our Street Fighter the miniatures games has suffered a delay and I think we might actually suffer one more delay because we're getting really close over here to Chinese New Year where everybody takes off so we're doing our best to try to get it manufactured before them but I don't know they've been telling us that the outlook is not good because they kind of get flaky or as they go towards that thing so I could rush production and we could go right now without approvals and in the middle of the back-and-forth process or we can let this process complete and deliver a 4-wheeler it is rushing things never turns out exactly right if I'm gonna pony right for sourcing I want to apologize for something being late not for something being bad like we never we get one chance to like wow everyone with our things and they kind of do the same thing with you and they want to wow people with the product they put out and amazing music yeah I mean and Bethesda they need to put something out the first time sure because I mean they're yeah that doesn't get to piggyback off id Software's success because I know but there's so much to do it they're gonna get the credit and they desperately need some credit right now that is their their reputation is gonna get it for five more months oh there's another five months of them just being like we have fallout 7 delicious fit 76 means yes you want to you want to pay $16 for a backpack how about a potted plant anything laman gaming check them out they have the best mayonnaise yeah love those guys in Australia okay that that was it that's all we got this week it was a really big week with lots of other little things but those are the big important ones we did this one quick probably because we had to rerecord the whole thing because Jose thought the camera froze that's what we got do this when you touch the camera and it was that I think I forgot to mention that we are wearing Connecticut shirts Connecticut shirts they do shirts check them out at their website thank you so much for partnering up with this and yeah appreciate you
