everything the hundred and $20 tier offers but for free now enjoy the video you know who you are the one who can't wait to leave town and rough the wilds with your companions perceptions the name of your game and you can't help but asking to roll it every chance your party gets you're the Explorer fantasy worlds are your bread and butter and there isn't anything you enjoy more than wandering around the wilds and uncovering some ancient secret I found some tracks you want to know everything about this strange place which is often a lot more than the DM actually prepared can I eat this what kind of fish live here what is this what's the altitude like why is this so hot well everyone else at the table is more intent on perfecting their combat abilities or devising their master plan you're poring over the local map wearing a Hawaiian t-shirt staring in wonder at the dead Colossus only a week's travel from here a ranger or a druid would be your go-to but as someone who employs utility abilities more than others I'd strongly recommend trying out a month or a fighter in your next game but as an explorer you'll find that most campaigns fail to provide what you crave your party nine times out of 10 wants to get right into the action and in order to grant them that the Dungeon Master has to streamline the bits that some people find boring take for example games like breath of the wild risk of rain - or subnautica worlds with beautiful environments that not only provide a sense of wonder and scale but also beg you to find the secrets hidden in every corner now let's look at the average D&D world the count is two weeks away you must go the world is ending ok we go to the town roll initiative you are at the town yeah does it doesn't that just always happen ok maybe I'm a cynic who exaggerate but my point is valid no one wants to waste time when they play the game is a respite from your daily life and is very hard to schedule as a result most games are on this epic scale with huge stakes where every second counts for the sake of the story but explorers just want to go fishing visit a monument to some ancient hero or make an actual campfire you stop to smell the roses get ambushed by a bandit kill the bandit and read his journal because learning about his way of life might be interesting dear diary I did it again I snuck up on those adventurers peed in their water schemes and made a poopoo inside the gnomes Coppola pouch and then I put sand in their bed rolls and solid glue on their fingertips no one noticed on on second thought not everything you search is worth your time the major risk you bring to the table is single-player mode where you're meandering in the woods leaves everyone feeling ignored for like an hour everyone handles this differently usually just saying flex that and then gluing the party together but I'd be happy to see more parties do their own thing for a couple ingame weeks and have the session circle around the table while everyone enjoys watching each person's crazy escapades drunk is just looking for love I only have two days left to karoz so my advice for your players and your DM don't rush the game take weeks or months in the game just to do things you never get to do and hopefully they'll feel just as rewarding as felling a giant army wow this is so great I love it and even if it wasn't worth it at all at least you tried something unique I'm gonna go over there would you're a blessing to parties with no instigators where everyone just awkwardly sits there after the DM describes the scene assuming that they can just autopilot from one encounter to the next I don't like that for people with an explorer in your party find a way to enjoy their exploration if you can I know wandering around a creek won't earn you magic items or a huge wealth of gold but there's a chance to find some buried treasure or a hidden temple somewhere I actually just found this hell yeah just keep that sense of childlike wonder I mean you're roaming around a made-up world fighting monsters and evil kings for [ __ ] sake don't take it so seriously that you treat it like a job okay we only have three days I know I have to get at least 50 gold to get the entry fee for the city okay so I'll be doing that I think I can get a job so you're gonna use the 50 goal to go to the entry I have another 50 gold we have no reason to take them because it's an extra five pounds that we can take with us we don't need that so in order to get there faster why don't we spend the 50 gold on something or bury it near that tree okay um yeah we can get but then okay so if you very near the tree we need to get an alarm scroll special okay so we need to go get a shovel and then if we get the shovel we can we go to show but then we won't have enough money because we have to buy shovels so we're gonna have to go do an adventure get a shovel and then spend the money to get the shovel and then come back and then bury the thing and get the alarm spell to put it around the tree and then we can go back to the town reducing some of our weight to get that little bit faster and the 10 goal that we're putting under the tree will be safe it should be I mean yeah frapp okay we're gonna have to get a higher level alarm spell that in order to probably do that so we'll probably have to go to that wizard do that wizard still he is okay like two month quests okay well then we'll kill him this is stressful dude I know I know not all who wander are lost and the journey is never about the destination boy that was an original closing statement if I ever did say one bye we got to put you in we got to marry his you to his daughter or to his entire suit that might be able to help with that a bear suit to help marry his daughter and fight she loves bears I forgot okay she'll marry the bear person and now everybody there is dead I'm a zombie me as well watch our zombie - my car manual it fell apart anyway no you ever know how to drive it I don't know what the how am I gonna get home Logan doctor cowboy he's also a wizard that sucks you
