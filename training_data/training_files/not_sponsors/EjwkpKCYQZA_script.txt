ask what's right but in the middle I [ __ ] [ __ ] like 325 times five or six yeah that sounds like my nothing for so many years maybe that's time something honestly I probably do the same wait so you never with like Sunday school like not like it's like over here okay did you have like classes on the weekends no I had religious class to my church offered like Saturday schools and stuff and had to go and the worst part is like you'd have to pray before it's cool actually that's different from Sunday school this is Saturday school Saturday Korean school in the morning and a Sunday I Bible lessons and the Monday to Friday was right another Sundays I've just oh I had like after-school programs - I'm almost so kind as I was going into like a really good crowd my parents exactly the same way I took Sunday and Saturday classes so today a place called the CCC in Houston it's called the Chinese community center oh wait I watched an episode of fresh off the boat and they talked about the CCC how boring it is with Asian cultures like we go in there and like I would learn how to draw I mean I would learn how to [ __ ] him like I have my Chinese classes there and I'd like study random [ __ ] like it was like stupid actually I'd go every weekend and Shay got so sick of it I was like I can't go anywhere yes yeah it's like it's like an area where you just like sit and just do your work day yeah yeah oh I was like that's cool I tutored you tutored I had a I had after I had summer school okay so you were the tutored same yeah like elementary school when I was away from that and to going uh I worked at a Chinese company that was famous for famous they were like known for being like Western companies into the Eastern Market so they would like help them like merge into the culture and I did like oh that's cool I know I didn't do anything good I was like an intern we did like [ __ ] like I was like there's a person who's like okay just like do all the English and make sure all this boats checking is good on our english website and I'm like I feel like it's traveling yeah I finished and they never used my things all right all right whatever but I didn't like my last job oh the job I almost got was my mom wanted me to have hands-on experience so he went around to turn your phone off hospitals during the movie please turn off also use your phone thank you no but okay so my mom wanted me to get hands-on experience for a job so we would go around these places these warehouses and look for jobs mm-hmm me my relative and so the one place I went to I always remember this it was a sweatshop but they didn't say well but it was a [ __ ] sweatshop you go in there and there's people who are obviously underage and look I get it like an Asian girl can be like 14 or 48 but obviously she was like borderline very close to like underage [ __ ] moving of that insert point that's so sad and like baby like all like there be rooms where people would sit down like stitches that's like when you look up sweat shop that's like a stock image journey and it's like I'm like in there and I'm just like looking around look here and I think my mom was with me as well as the relative she wasn't me to work with and my mom was like yeah this looks like a good place and the place was selling [ __ ] I remember this they were selling Calvin Clank cashmere sweaters odds legit they're selling Calvin Klein I'm just like this is what it takes what the [ __ ] get me the [ __ ] out true and also I never went back because my mom's reasoning for not signing me up was wasn't it was like on how on health healthy life I'm still an ethical it was that it was too far away from where we lived so she was worried about mom I was like holy [ __ ] I could have been in a sweatshop dude that's sick that's a good story I remember you telling me this story and for some reason the way I remembered it is that you're working that sweatshop no no did you do come on attorneys teach come on I okay I did come off a little bit I didn't I talked come on that's a nurse that I like so many Asian kids at my school just [ __ ] did it I've watched like by the sidelines like no it's cuz every Asian parent wants their child to be yeah yeah and they see all the other Asian parents is because it okay right all the Asian parents talk my mom talked to every mom on the Asian block that was Chinese he always I companion and they were just like so like yeah my son got a hundred in the last minute company exactly oh my son only got a 98 I keep telling him I do like sex anymore because he watches too many too much TV they did a [ __ ] and then my mom would hear that be like you're right and then send me to [ __ ] him like how like get like math lesson like Pokemon yeah no it'll JIT and like that's how it works no joke for everyone so everyone I knew to like volunteered a shitload of hours I was my mom like my mom quarantined me this is a good topic my mom corns me in the library for like a year a year and a half straight cuz she wanted me to get volunteer hours looking like for college yeah interests but she know how else to do it so what she would do is she would leave me my wife my school would end she'd leave me at the library until all my homework was done and all my voluntary hours heard that I was like forced to volunteer like an hour or two a day of the library yeah I would not be allowed to leave until I finished my homework and my volunteering hours and a vet but but we got this eventually I was just like okay [ __ ] this so I just started reading like to elongate my time and ended up just meeting I went to the library to do volunteering homework and I read and I would spend like five to six days of the library providing six hours that's why you're every so much yeah that's what my parents had a similar thing where they tried to find me like tutors oh I would always just like figure out how to not get tutored by them like I'd always just like ass about their lives and I'd be like like three conversations one really good guy I'm like the island a mountain just like randomly out of the blue he turned out to be on nuclear physicist Lord if you weren't like it on bikini app like he was at the nuclear tests sites at the places where you like have to wear sandals because if you cut yourself on a chunk of a radiated aluminum you just died he swam in the water in some of those places it's like he's [ __ ] crazy he has like a shed full of chemicals and I was just like they're tutoring and he's like trying to teach me about [ __ ] but

waitress gonna be so fun I'm like yeah how hard can it be and back then I was very self-conscious did people uncoupled with like [ __ ] my clumsy [ __ ] hands yeah oh really okay you know when you have a tray of food right you have to be careful of the weight balance right because if you put like a heavy cup of water off it'll zone so I didn't know that right it was hot miso soup in the water I put the water down at tips it and then it spilled some miso soup on the poor lady but I was okay because they were having a lunch after church and they were very nice don't worry sweetie don't worry we got this and they handkerchief and it was really nice oh and there were a lot of entitled I don't say it say their race Oh so um I needed to take out arteries and I think a Karen called and they're

to yourself and you're like huh okay you're right others are just like seriously brain damaged and like whatever you say they're just like they just and they say something and they have a blush emoji after what they say and like it's like the most like there are people too right they have their own motivations and why do they do these things like they have their own reasons it's interesting to think about in their minds they're always right no matter what yeah yeah that's frustrating yeah they see like like two things like super far apart and they're like yes I see the line but that's like confirmation bias to like if you want to believe something yeah if you see anything it'll just confirm your own believing that goes for haters and fans I think yeah that's fine I turn it on funny so we went through jobs huh anything else interesting Lily I almost ate all my sorry yeah oh yeah please okay and this guy was like 2019-20 my college and that big great so they let me be a tutor right

point it was like a hundred hundred fifty an hour 75 I know is very rich area so it was all that you know Obama graduated from Punahou that's cool I was right down the block for me so I'd be like [ __ ] come to you H write you it just a call it I'd be like yes and so they'd think I'm a you H student no I'm just a goblin who lives near there Oh like come to the you H library I won't even [ __ ] I'm not even enrolled in you age like like I [ __ ] like I'm a student there with a backpack on and I said not only yes come over to my table yeah come over to my table one of the parents who's actually

like to get ice cream after and like he took me in his Tesla those the first time I was ever in a Tesla he took me I was like model took me in his [ __ ] Model S like with Ludacris mozu mache there was one time when like we were on a break but his daughter had programming work to do over that break and I was like do but I was on a different Island so he was like hey I was like hey man I ought to tell you you want a video calling it's like I just fly you over I was like huh yes you can booking like flies me from an island to an island for one day and like just for the whole day we're just like running to electronic shops getting stuff I'm putting together this [ __ ] like art rat [ __ ] Arduino project and ended up being like a like a theremin you know theremin is not at all no no isn't like a music thing okay it just makes sounds depending on how billy you should know this it's a music thing music thing anyway like we built it it was a really fun time and then you took me to like a really nice steak house afterwards you got really nice thank you pay me like 500 600 bucks and just like ship me back it was so so nice that smells great I still talk to him like he asked me he said his youngest daughter was trying to get into streaming and I recommended her a gaming PC wonder how she's doing now yeah turns out that girl grew up is no Leslie I was just kidding I know the Mimi were going for Billy Irish yeah yeah way more adult you want to talk a little bit but Dom oh I mean I did used to work for I will dominate I love me let me let me let me let me preface this so before I poached not poach sorry asked fed to be a part of offline he was heading for Dom at a time I remember being like I don't think I can get fed because she's making so much money with Dom as a highlighter he wouldn't move for like a lot less money because we had like no incoming we we make money offline for like [ __ ] two years three years yeah so I think that wouldn't move like no money and he did because he was really bored yeah yeah I mean it was it was cool like I guess that proves the point more time earlier I was doing the same thing every single [ __ ] day wake up before I am edit till 12:00 1:00 or 2:00 and then post a video we go and then yeah the Monday Chris message mean he's like eight looking for a new uh right here that was like [ __ ] it what the [ __ ] why and then I didn't even know you were living at pokey mm-hmm yeah or I think I did but it wasn't because even though I left this I even know she was like what about like and yeah but talk about I guess I can talk about Tom when we gonna be doing all I know about when you add with it but you have a predominance he's always back to you I had sick edits for Doc good only thing I know about your edits yeah pretty problem and it's that was a funny guy and I just helped like amplify even more dude yeah it's a grind as a time like the three biggest youtubers where it was dyrus cutie pie and then it was well we weren't big yet but I wanted to be just as big as like keys channel like that was my goal and so I would literally take I would practice doing I'd practice taking a very shitty [ __ ] game II had I'm just trying to make it really buzz Iike yeah yeah good practice one point he got mad at me he was like dude this is a shitty [ __ ] game I don't want you to 14th yeah he had a very bad said you wanting game he's like I don't want you to make a video this is like first time he ever like like raised his voice and I was that oh it's weird the contrast because for a while Lily has only losses on their YouTube a it was so boring only was everyone's yelling everyone's having fun and I want to capture that I don't only care about the loss but then after a while people are like what do you mean you upload all says I'm like fine sorry the whole story no it's re complete tangent no no big buff Teemo jungle on this patch after to its rivals they buff Garen and then this passive buff Teemo like twice as much damage to jungle camps now [ __ ] joke is actually I don't think that's gonna impress telling you we could watch with rivals odd that on this patch 1% is occupied and yeah dude honestly there's I mean there's not much to say other than like you killed the game I don't know I just got to ever better yeah no dude it's just like III come from like a film and digital media background I've always wanted it like work and like the film industry and like wait I've know if you guys did TSM Legends yeah like have you guys seen tsm's old like game cribs yeah like I wanted to do that and so I actually applied to do that for TSM and Lena told me like two months ago like yeah so your application like like three years ago four years ago and like you just didn't have enough experience man they're just like I know just like yeah okay well and so I actually did that from an internship at a internet teamliquid and I actually did did that for their team and it was honestly oh so [ __ ] boring I love being I love the guys they pose so I wanted to blow my brains out so yeah this is like perfect because now look at the talent you surround yourself with you got yeah so this is obviously much more creatively fulfilling especially for all of us you know I did landscaping like I think in lieu of kind of my service industry time instead of that I did like landscaping in high school it was awful it was for one like really rich guy on the island of Maui yeah me too I thought there's so many rich rich guys like I think when you like that old and successful you just like move to Hawaii yeah and end up being like some Rando who's a genius I'm gonna move to Maui just so my kid can like work it was wild he was like like seven years old but he was like like a massive guy he was like in the military and you're like crazy strong who's huge and like he was all but he would like work with the like landscapers every single weekend like he'd still work on his property that he built his whole house and like last week this whole property yeah I know some way it's like it's like guys who just like never stop working you know until like they [ __ ] die they always wanted to like improve something or like yeah I respect the amazing house oh no I'm gonna lay down and die at like 45 sure so I thought is being optimistic that structure what my every time I go and they grow someone comes in the garage I could just be lying on the ground dead for sure with them in about 14 mm so this is day five of quarantine I've talked about being corn okay does that you remember where you go to the podcast where I was like I thought corrode the buyers kind of a joke it's like a little bit I was no no we don't think you were alone and badly I think a lot of people didn't seriously early I think that's the only reason that spread like is because people didn't take it seriously yeah yeah that's the only way I was just like a Hut's a little bit of a joke like like I would have done anything different like I can't protect myself more than I already do because I protect myself very well yeah I'm very good at social distancing that's the word yeah yeah but uh hey Lily was on the podcast like two podcasts ago I was like coronavirus is a joke you know want Allie rape for people under 30 is like 0% you know for people like above 70 like 100% but you know I line recommend you those people and it's even home Carey it's okay so like yeah I'm sure it'll be fine and it turns out [ __ ] the mayor of Los Angeles shut down everything you know all the bars all the nightclubs I go to no restaurants can only do delivery why are you looking at me like that fat that's just funny because we don't go to any of those I don't know what you're talking about now it's like a big [ __ ] deal like we're the world's shutting down actually yeah yeah it's actually actually pretty scary cuz like the u.s. hasn't had like correct testing methods so we don't actually know what the [ __ ] is going on well the thing is that you can have it like most people who have it don't feel like carrying yeah you're just like a like a [ __ ] aircraft carrier for people - yeah it's been five days since I've interacted with anyone I think all of us it's been five days right I didn't even interact with anyone yes oh no you went to the missus podcast Oh other than that how many days has been it's been five yeah that was a while ago it's like five years okay yeah so yeah I think we're good right I'm pretty good thank you for Spears five days I think oh is it was too weak oh [ __ ] I must be off I want Timmy - Tommy and then we stay at the quarantine thing Johnny you predict just [ __ ] leave out the door yes leave Timmy I close the gate what hasn't gone you guys feel like you want to go outside no actually no uh yeah wait have you guys seen those like the people who are like being like I don't know what to do now that we're being quarantine had to stay at home all day like I don't know like I'm just like yeah I feel it's so good not for us because we just stay inside all day at the very least like I mean you're raging you're raging parties up sorry I mean yeah I was actually really bummed we're actually throwing a party the end of March and they were like right when coronavirus like just started getting announced that was like what throwing the party end of March like two weeks later we're like so about that like a few weeks it'll be fine right no stay inside wash your hands don't interact yeah and I remember them me like yeah it's just you know you should practice good safety and they can't um hygiene stuff like don't touch your face and ever since they started saying that I realized how much I touch my face and I'm like I if I ever get anything deadly I'm just gonna kill myself yeah that's my face a lot like a problem I got like I kind of I kind of want like I miss you know going outside but I just like leave the garage door open when I'm working the garage that's like enough of the house side you're like a cat that looks oh yeah but no one's like coughing in my garage unless I walk so what is ha if Michael got Corolla from that that would just be a funny story like his like I would that be like the weirdest way yeah I guess throw them possibly you can survive on stuff for a long time that's the weirdest thing about it incubation yeah even how it travels like you're just like if if if teammates like next to someone who has it you can have it that's [ __ ] wash your hands look stay safe out there guys in these trying times as a North American stay safe do you guys think it'll last long I don't know I think it depends on how serious people take it I think it's just getting started dude yeah dude I kind of feel that way too I remember talking to you you like this fine man because this is the first I was like fed I'm doing it dude I'm going to EDC that was like old broad I can't wait I will show you it why is the greatest [ __ ] festival I've been asked me to go for five years straight and then it's like so uh it hasn't been announced that's getting canceled well no they're still moving forward with it yeah but in my change change I expected to change I expected to change too it's it's in Vegas that's a long time for them I think VidCon is gonna get kills as well well I do I yeah so twitch colors in my bad one of them it calls June accessed July twitchcon as usual is September cancel I have no idea no II theories cancel oh yeah sure so so it'll be goodbye twitchcon right you think like August there's like oh goodness banished for us oh no I think we comparing it's like all the flus like that like shouldn't make sense because we are so much more technologically advanced now or some reason like I think I feel like we're stupider well I think it's like I was thinking about it and I saw the mortality rate and I was like this is like not that bad a disease but like the more thing about them I like this is like for this time in history this is like the perfect disease to [ __ ] people up because it's not bad enough for everyone to like stop talking to each other like because if it were like influenza like the Spanish flu or something it no one would [ __ ] go out like people would be actually you know scared of it but with something like this like people are like I don't like super give a [ __ ] all the time and it like so can spread of [ __ ] everyone every single [ __ ] I think this video is for people with like kids afforda who would like to you this just be break those for like yeah I'm just on the beach you know if I get it I get it bro and I'm like [ __ ] yeah I guess it's not about you it's about the people you spread it to yeah so so so what do you guys think about the fact that it's called the Boomer killer fitting it makes sense it's not only that those like people with compromised immune systems it's very young you know I mean Italy's mortality rate though for like the thousand deaths were zero people under the age of 30 that's amazing one person between the age of like 30 and like 35 died like what hurts here they were probably like immunocal I didn't like everything else was just above it's like you see that thing we're like they tested a whole town in Italy and like the no no they had it but like most of them had it was like asymptomatic Oh a bunch of them are asymptomatic carriers while this part is like we don't show symptoms any but have we been public that we're quarantine offline TV yeah okay so so we can't cook some of us he can cook I see what he does every morning is okay yeah and but like generally speaking so we've quarantine ourselves except for postmates it's like you know order always every apps so what we do is avant has this box of like gloves that we sit somewhere - gloves like pick up the food take it take off the gloves throw away wash your head eat the food I just don't grab the bag from where they're touching it and bring it in the house I ripped the bag off and throw out the trash and then wash my hands right there this is lips yeah it's like what would you do if this was like a [ __ ] horror movie like the economy collapsed yet I'll just let the government loses our good faith in humanity I think we'll always find a way you think offline and survive this I think we're best position to survive this really yes we have many weapons we have you know not only that it's like we have a lot of disposable income so if the price of toilet paper does go let's say 250 dollars a roll we have a bidet okay let's just say you asked I just say the bidet oh we can buy bidets the price of bidet is go to $500 you know we can buy a bidet - $500 wait what - I've gotta go okay five are one thousand two thousand dollars we could do that and it'd be okay but for some for other people like you know the price of toilet paper goes up by like 200% that's that's a [ __ ] big expense you know it sure is so we are in prime position to wait out the apocalypse the key like if there was an apocalypse still people would want to hoard supply to themselves like no ma no money is gonna be able to 500 million last 20 of the economy collapses then money is Wars I don't think I'll ever get to that point yeah like maybe right before that like someone would sell their toilet paper at like eczema price you know it's [ __ ] capitalism you're gonna be like okay well you know if I'm gonna sell that 10 like a dollar roll about two dollars roll three though at some point there's a number there that with sell my my toilet paper room it's gotta go yeah my son was green displaying what my phlegm if he hasn't we already have it man normally we do boring out roasts and
