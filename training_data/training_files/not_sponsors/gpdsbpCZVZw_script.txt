McBride tried for a comeback hit when he published a 1981 paper linking another morning sickness drug with birth defects to Bendix turned out he deliberately falsified his data and that drug remains in use today under different names and it is widely considered safe and effective and of course money influences science the person perhaps most singularly responsible for linking fat consumption with heart disease was dr. D mark hagstead a nutritionist at Harvard in 2016 Hegg stead was named in the Journal of the American Medical Association as being among those researchers who were paid by the sugar industry they were paid to find something anything other than sugar to blame for heart disease so with all its flaws why am I so willing to accept the scientific consensus and to pass it on to you because it's the best we've got because it's simply illogical to go with anything else science represents the best available knowledge we have at any given moment I'm not qualified to question the scientific consensus and you probably aren't either this is not a super comfortable argument for me to make because I'm generally down with questioning Authority and encouraging other people to question authority but I try to only question things that I have grounds or qualifications to question in the journalism world that I came from there's a guy named David feau conflic he's a reporter for NPR that is the nominally public public radio network that we have here in the United States anyway David coined this term that he calls an earned opinion in the mid to late twentieth century it was pretty much common practice that mainstream reporters in the United States would keep their opinions to themselves they would only say facts now we've gotten into a period where things are very very different and we could argue all day about whether that's a good thing but all David was trying to say is that like look if we're going to say what we think instead of just what we know let's reserve that for when we have earned the opinion when it's a story that we have put a ton of work into we've really learned the facts we've done all the investigation really what we think kind of matters we've earned it that's an earned opinion a few years ago I tried to augment David's coinage by coining the Antonine [ __ ] opinions call them [ __ ] opinions not just because they are so often voiced by people who are themselves [ __ ] but also because [ __ ] opinions are like [ __ ] in the sense that everybody has one if you've been researching a scientific topic for years and you think that the scientific consensus has it wrong you've earned that opinion and if it's about food I want to hear that opinion I want to put it into a video although I will tell my audience that it's a minority opinion so they can contextualise it as such but if all you've done is spent a couple hours listening to some fringe theorists to rant on Joe Rogan's show then you've not earned an opinion that there is an [ __ ] opinion you got there I think sometimes that when people say they don't believe the scientific consensus what's really going on is that they're just opposed to what people want to do about that consensus the giant example would be climate change right there remains scientific consensus that the planet is get warmer and that human activity is a significant causal factor you might disagree with that but unless you are an accomplished climatologist I don't really care what your opinion is you shouldn't care what your opinion is it's an [ __ ] opinion and maybe deep down inside you know that you know that the science is there you're just opposed to the politics that flow from the science but if we accept that scientific consensus the plan is getting a warmer and that we're causing it to some extent it does not necessarily follow that we should all just push our cars into the sea and start weaving baskets in vegan agrarian communes I mean that might actually be the best response but there are other conceivable responses as well like trying to eat less beef and dairy beef might not be all that bad for you after all but cow farts still account for a substantial chunk of human-caused warming says science or another response could be to do absolutely nothing about your carbon footprint and just rely on science to provide technological solutions to climate change for what it's worth that's really the only thing I have hope for anymore not that you should care about my opinion because my opinion doesn't matter I haven't earned it or maybe you think you have earned your opinion not through rigorous scholarship perhaps but maybe through good old-fashioned common sense I don't need any of that fancy book-learning I've got common sense well the problem with that is that science has proven time and time again that reality is weird what is true what is empirically true is often really different from what common sense would predict a perfect example in the food world is the searing myth in 1847 German chemists used to svan Leaburg wrote that you can mitigate moisture loss when cooking meat by quickly cooking the exterior surface quote the albumin immediately coagulates from the surface inwards and in this state forms a crust or shell the flesh retains its juiciness I think part of the reason why that myth persists to this day is that it just makes sense common sense for millennia doctors have stopped bleeding by cauterizing wounds right you apply a lot of intense heat and that coagulates the blood coming out of the blood vessels and the bleeding stops it makes sense that the same thing would basically happen with muscle tissue when you cook it except it just doesn't you can disprove this notion empirically as people have been doing since not long after Escoffier popularized vonlee Berg's myth you take two stakes you weigh them you sear one of them you cook them both to the same internal temperature and then you weigh them again searing does not seal in juices it just doesn't common sense is great when it's the best you've got and it often is science has not addressed every single question you might have in your life but when there is some science to address a question that you have that's gonna be your best bet and not the common sense this brings us back to why I'm talking to you from this historic cemetery Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon Georgia I love this place if you like that Southern gothic vibe come walk around here it goes on forever look around for a while and you'll start to notice a lot of very small grave markers this little lamb is Kerry Burke died 1867 11 months old here's little Charlie sass net died 1883 he wasn't quite to Martha Winship 1881 she lived a week look at all the dead children they're everywhere and this was the fancy cemetery in the 19th century Macon's elite families are buried here many of them would have been slave owners they had the best food shelter and sanitation and even they couldn't save their babies the near global collapse of infant and childhood mortality rates over the last century was achieved by science science saved the babies I want to make every anti-vaxxer walk around this place with me for a few hours here's one grave marker for two sisters Annie and Fannie they each lived a year and they were born three years apart they never met that kind of thing almost never happens anymore two families with access to modern medicine without science my first son would have lived about a minute he couldn't breathe when he came out I would have set him under one of these little stone cradles and that would have been the end of his story but thanks to science he's 5 now and he's making pancakes with me that is why I believed in science if you've got something better to which you would like to entrust your children do let me know about it I believe in thanks to Skillshare for sponsoring the video also in the description is a link to another video that I made here in Rose Hill Cemetery me and a former student of mine named Burgess Brown the Allman Brothers Band used to hang out and write songs in this cemetery and they wrote a beautiful tune called little Martha may have been inspired by little Martha Alice's grave here we arranged the piece for string quartet and we shot a performance of it right here I hope that you'll have a look and a listen I'm really proud of that one [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
