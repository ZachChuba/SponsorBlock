[Bangkok GGG Rehearsal, Sowon dances the 'Shy Boy'.]
The guest. We are here at GFRIEND concert in Thailand. [Q. I saw you dancing the 'Shy Boy' during the rehearsal!] Oh~I am the first one to dance the 'Shy Boy' I was the one of the first members of the 'Shy Boy' So I am making a surprise appearance. Did you get it on camera? Didn't I do great? Look at my footwork. If we have a chance later I want to challenge the 'Hug-Hug' members. I will give it a go! [Let us have high expectations for SOWON's 'Shy Boy'] How overwhelmed would I be today.... I will be probably overwhelmed by feelings but I am curious if I will be overwhelmed by catching my breath.
