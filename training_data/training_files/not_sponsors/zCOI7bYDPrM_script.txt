[Music] so this is the sony a7 mark 3 is one of my cameras is quite a popular camera at the moment because it's full-frame it's quite small there's one thing that you will hear a lot when you watch youtube reviews of this camera and it is this impressive dynamic range and this camera really does have a very good dynamic range and that means that you can pull loads of details out the shadows and loads of details out of the highlights you can recover it all and get loads and loads of detail in your images but with all these very techie reviews on YouTube with this big emphasis on getting the detail back out of the shadows I think this plants a seed in your mind it's just something there in the back of your mind when you're taking photos when you're editing photos that if you lose details in the shadows of the highlights that's in some way bad and you shouldn't do that I think that is a mistake because I get a lot of portfolios sent to me people want me to critique and review their work I would love to get back to everyone but I simply can't just because of the sheer volume of emails I get asking me to do this and also I think a lot the time the feedback is more complex than I think people think any quick comments were maybe too superficial and too clear but one thing I do see a lot in these portfolios is very often people will be pulling back their shadows and pulling down their highlights - quite an excessive degree and I find this problematic because what happens when you do that is that everything in the shot becomes a kind of equal tonal value and that means that everything in the shot kind of has equal importance and while this kind of look can be appropriate for some things when it's done with portraits and street photography and other things I find that the image has a lack of focus and I don't mean focus as in sharpness and blur I mean narrative focus I do not know where I am meant to be looking in the shot it's too busy is visually confusing and when people do this to an excessive degree you get this HDR look and common comments I see when people put this kind of HDR work on social media are from people who maybe aren't photographers and they go oh wow that looks like a painting and you get this comment a lot and sometimes people actually won't believe it's a photograph they they will argue in the comments that it is a painting and what I think they mean by this is it has a kind of unreal quality to it what I think they mean is that it looks like a Caravaggio or a Rembrandt because those painters popularized a technique known as chiaro-scuro chiaro-scuro comes from the Italian words Kioto meaning bright or clear and Oscar Oh meaning dark or obscure it refers to a technique that became commonplace during the Baroque era where painters would employ strong use of contrast to achieve a sense of volume this was quite revolutionary for the time well before every inch of the canvas will be filled with sharp detail now painters would leave large areas of the composition was pure shadow with no discernible information visible and this technique has carried through strongly into photography take a look at this image by Horst P Horst from 1940 this is a great example of chiaroscuro in photography it was a shot for Vogue magazine of ballerina and movie star Irina bad Innova Vogue editor at the time edna chase expressed her dislike for this image as it threw Arenas face into complete silhouette and didn't show her outfit clearly enough but imagine just how much atmosphere this image would lose if Horst had lit this shot differently with her face brightly exposed while the lighting in horst's photo was all meticulously calculated to achieve the exact look he wanted this portrait of Zadie Smith by Linda Brownlee achieves chiaroscuro using only the available light in the she positions her as a small figure surrounded by this large expanse of darkness this really adds to the slightly pensive expression she has on her face this image has a sense of isolation similar to that which was so characteristic of Edward Hopper's work this photo of Billie Holiday by Dennis stock shows very little detail of the singer with most of the shot falling off into complete darkness we get enough information to understand what's going on but with such a minimalistic composition every part that we can see gets much more attention than we would normally give the details presented to us gain a value and a significance greater than we would normally ascribe to them Trend park is well known for using light to isolate elements within urban landscapes here we see a group of people waiting expectantly for a bus the hard light of the Sun is so bright that exposing for it throws everything else into extreme darkness the effects isolates and highlights the figures while the street becomes a scene that seems less familiar than it should be the darkness here simplifies this composition darkness in your images is not something that automatically needs to be corrected it can be used to evoke atmosphere to draw the viewers eye in order to tell a story or just to simplify a composition try using darkness as a canvas to showcase light really think about what you can do with lights look first shafts of light cutting through gaps look for reflected light from buildings look for diffracted light where sunlight is passing through some glass and the color spectrum has become separated the more you practice this the more you'll start to see and understand light but darkness is just as important as light there's no such thing as a correct exposure the right exposure is not an objective truth it's a matter of opinion use exposure to create the feelings that you want less can be more there's no need to be afraid of the dark [Music]
