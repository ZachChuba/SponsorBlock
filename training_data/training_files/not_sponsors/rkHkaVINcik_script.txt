hi guys girls I'm obsidian aunt and welcome back to League dangerous free carriers are easily the largest vessels a player can buy yet why this is true they also come with a whole range of possibilities and questions so in this video I'm going to look at 17 things that you should know about flea carriers firstly then what our fleet carriers well in brief they are gigantic space ships that are owned appalled by the individual player they offer a place to dock store your ships replenish your essentials repair and much more the carriers can also in the theory at least be used as a mobile market to sell goods to other players so if that sounds good to you you might be wondering where you can purchase one here's a list then of some of the location that free carriers can be purchased both within the main inhabited humor space as well as out in Colonia the price tag is a rather steep of five billion credits and remember that even after purchase they are going to be ongoing costs we can reach as high as twenty four million credits per week more on that in just a bit so to make your purchase into one of the relevant star systems stations which sell carriers are instantly recognizable as they have a fleet carrier drydock located outside of them when docked look for the vendor within the contacts menu on the main Services screen and from here you can make your purchase now he carrier is far too big to be delivered to directly to you and instead will be parked in orbit around a nearby planet or star it's quite likely that you will find it located within the same system that you make the purchase however it's also possible that it may instead be found in a neighboring star system you can I hate your carrier via the galaxy map it will display as an orange a flee carrier icon so then here are a few things that you should know about fleet carriers flea carriers have an upkeep cost this is an ongoing fee that you'll have to pay on a weekly basis the fee is collected from your carrier's bank during server maintenance each Thursday the toll you pay for upkeep will vary depending on how many services you have act a traditional service that you have active will add to the total amount of upkeep they have to pay the services fleet carriers offer include commodity trading and tritium depo these are both standard core services additional optional services are refueled in repair armory outfits in secure warehouse and universal Carter graphics now flick carrier services can be paused if you're not using a service on a fleet carrier you can basically deactivate it and this in turn will reduce the cost of weekly upkeep but not remove it as a cost in total services for fleet carriers can only be added to your carrier when in a carrier administration system one of the players use services onboard your fleet carrier they will pay a small surcharge that will go directly into your carriers bank this is basically your profit free carriers couldn't run up a debt when you carry as bank runs out of money the upkeep will cause your carrier to go into debt when the debt reaches the debt limit your fleet carrier will be a decommissioned and sold it will get a full refund of the five billion credits that you made on the purchase minus the cost of the debt anything stored on the carrier will be delivered to a nearby station blink carriers have verse 16 and landing pads split as follows its large for medium for small there are no limits to the number of ships that can be docked at a carrier if your carrier is full and someone is getting a docking permission denied message they can move to a different instance by relogin or by super cruising away and then return in the carriers are persistent when you as a carrier owner look out of the game the fleet carrier remains in the galaxy carriers are persistent across all game modes and platforms that means that that if you park a carrier around our planet in open on PC it will also be visible to a player in solo on the PlayStation 4 in short once you have of your carrier everyone will be able to see it at all times free carriers cannot be destroyed if other players target and attack your carrier they cannot do any damage to it however your carrier does have some huge weapons on it and will make a very short work of anyone who attacks it anyone who attacks your carrier will face consequences if they are destroyed they will be sent to a prison ship if you attack your own carrier accidentally or otherwise you will also be sent to a prison ship so here's a handy tip don't do this a bigger point carriers can make a 500 light years on it used a carrier services menu to set a destination for your fleet carrier and once the destination is set in 15 minutes timer will begin the end of which the carrier will make a a hyperspace jump to the destination upon arrival earth a carrier will begin a 5-minute cooldown process before it can jump again a free carrier takes a wear and tear damage for every jump that it makes the cost of repairing this damage is added to your weekly upkeep costs you don't have to be doctor your carrier in order to issue a jump command this can be done that remotely even from the other side of the galaxy flick areas require fuel known as tritium in order to jump tritium can be mined or purchased from stations a carrier can hold a 1000 tonnes of tritium in his fuel tank additionally you can store another 25,000 tonnes in the carriers of personal inventory space if you so wish of course this can be tritium or indeed any other commodity but it carriers cannot jump into a permit to locked systems and this is true even if the carrier owner possesses the required permit space within star systems is limited only so many carriers can exist inside any single star system and this will be dependent on the number of orbital bodies as well as the size of those bodies that means that a system with dozens of planets will be able to hold up many more fleet carriers than a system with only one or two small planets once a star system reaches is fleet carrier limit you will not be able to plot a jump into that system until a space becomes free fleet carriers have a personal inventory space and this is accessible to only as the fleet carrier owner here you can store commodities or tritium fuel and other things modules and ships can also be stored on a carrier by default and to not count against your storage space linnaeus to access your personal inventory space use the right panel inside your current ship whilst docked of the carrier from here navigate to the cargo hold menu and are then into the transfer screen there then and covers the 17 things that you should know about fleet carriers if
