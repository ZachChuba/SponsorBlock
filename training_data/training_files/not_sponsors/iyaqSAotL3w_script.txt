in April of last year AMD went from always a generation or three behind to blindsiding Intel with their shockingly competitive first gen Rison processors based on their all news in architecture fast forward a year and second gen rising with Zen plus has been around for a few months now with no response from the blue team yet but in spite of all of this among many enthusiasts there's still this attitude that persists that goes well if you're not poor people then you should just get Intel so we decided to challenge that perception and we've got some interesting findings to share with you today after we tell you about Linus and get 25% off glass wire 2.0 through the link below [Music] we know that some of you are just gonna skip to the conclusion anyway so we're gonna make your life easier the short answer is yes AMD is a viable alternative to Intel but the long answer has a few what's in it now initially we had wanted to do an in-depth exploration into things like cache hierarchies and IMC peculiarities plus you know did you know like infinity fabric connecting the dyes inside of Rison running at half of the memory clock but I mean let's face it if you guys cared about that kind of stuff you'd be watching gamers Nexus so we're gonna focus on the results frames per second in games render times and professional applications and a side dish of power consumption and storage before we even get there though we need to talk about price when we built up and priced out over two competing test benches it became obvious why some people see AMD as the the poor man's choice between Intel's higher CPU price and lack of a decent included cooler on their case series chips our AMD platform was over $60 cheaper finally you guys probably noticed that we're running at different memory speeds Intel's IMC actually does tend to handle high frequency kids better than AMD's but their spec is actually more conservative and we're leaving overclocking out of this comparison today so this is bone stock apples versus officially supported apples first up then is our gaming benchmarks in a huge surprise to only the small group of AMD fanboys who insist on remaining willfully ignorant for some reason in the overwhelming majority of cases Intel's 8700 K defeats the rise in 720 700 X and in some cases like in GTA 5 by a substantial margin I mean I'm talking twenty to thirty percent greater performance depending on the resolution not 4k result really stands out I mean bad is a resolution that should be GPU bound on pretty much any processor if our recent video about system bottlenecks is anything to go by with that in mind you can put down your pitchforks hashtag AMD Red Team because we are going to point out that not once did we encounter a situation where our gaming experience at the same graphical settings of course went from playable on the 8700 K to unplayable on Rison it just doesn't change that the 8700 K is better for gaming . and that's even before you get into anomalies like csgo for the record in our testing enabling gaming mode via am DS rise and master software actually dropped the FPS across the board with like two exceptions and requires a restart in between modes so we're not huge fans of it our risin 720 700 X did win in some of the synthetic gaming benchmarks though thanks to its two extra cores which doesn't indicate anything about real games but does foreshadow our productivity results out of the eleven tests we ran a AMD's offering outright 1:9 sometimes putting significant distance between itself and the blue team I mean 7-zip was 50 percent faster which it should be noted does affect aspects of your systems performance beyond just unzipping the files you download from the internet asus real bench encoding was 32 percent faster while multi-threaded Cinebench was 28 percent faster I mean Intel did remind AMD who the single threaded boss was by beating it by 15 percent in single threaded Cinebench but that was its only win with our last result the real bench image editing test almost as close as the results of the last scrapyard Wars so basically a tie depending on who you ask but there's more to life than CPU performance let's take a look at some of the quality of life differences one thing that we noticed was that game load times were affected when we moved between platforms even the exact same drive we found a variance of up to 15% each way with Intel on average ending up about 5% faster than AMD and like the differences in gaming benchmarks this isn't something that you would immediately notice in our in a Pepsi challenge taste test but it is their power consumption was also about 10 watts hired idle and 20 watts higher under load on the AMD platform finally we wanted to touch on the accelerated storage options that each platform features because we really feel that this is an excellent way to get better than hard drive performance while not giving up on capacity now we did a more in-depth piece on this a little while ago but in summary Intel has obtained caching which we have seen work wonders on game load times and then from our testing AMD's store mi is more cumbersome to use with some unpleasant limitations though the big winner if you watch that video which you probably should was actually a third-party software called primo cache so there you have it Andy is a less expensive solution compared to Intel and it mostly loses in gaming so you know what the trolling from the gaming crowd about AMD being a second-rate solution mat does have some merit to it unfortunately but the easy comeback is well it's great that your machine games faster but I've got real work to do and if that is actually true of you then Andy is a great choice I mean really the only thing that could disqualify either of them at this point is platform stability and Rison has matured a lot since its initial launch to the point where as long as you don't need storm I the final answer comes down to what your mix is and as usual it depends are you a sixty percent productivity person who games on the side go risin and don't look back you saved a buck but you still got a great system what's wrong with that meanwhile are you the gamer who throws together the occasional headshot compilation vide well you might want to consider paying the
