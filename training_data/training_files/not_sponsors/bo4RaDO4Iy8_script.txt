what's happening B's and g's and welcome back in to another episode of upgrade and unlock as you can see I'm currently on the thieving grind we need to get ourselves 50 thieving here so that we can access Marten Thwaites shop because as you guys said getting nature runes to alcohol those bows was just it literally would cost more to get the natures /a lots of time to get all the natures together so what we've decided to do is get 50 thieving and use Marten shop to get the high out value and be able to sell stuff there so it's gonna be a bit of a grind to get this 50 because as you can see I'm getting stunned a lot it's not great certain ones and doing actions unlocks new chunks as you can also see we hit 875 total levels so it is time to go and open the chunks straight away here we go where are we going oh that is quite close to barrows we're gonna use that we'll probably use that fairy ring up there to get some barrows that's huge super happy with that genuinely that's brilliant I know berries is a way off fur that is a good one and this is gonna be would have been 50 thieving coming in but we've been stunned brilliant and there we go 50 thieving coming in which now means we can go ahead and hit up the rogues den and as you guys said in the comments section it's a lot better for me to just go and sell the willow longbows rather than get all the natures together because I guess I do have 563 natures but obviously we have a lot of bows to actually be selling off so we're gonna go ahead and help Martin Swain and he buys these for high al-khali so if we go ahead and look he'll be buying them for this value 96 each he will drop obviously we probably gonna sell like 10 a world because we have so many to sell but it means we can make such a huge profit probably like 350 maybe 400 K from these and added on top of the few we have here as well we should get decent amount money and we can buying some chunks to give ourselves a broader horizon to work with so let's go ahead and do it it's gonna take some time to sell all of this so I'll see you in a bit no way no I thought it was just 50 see even you needed right well it's time to go and get ourselves 58 jealousy isn't it ah ah cheeky cheeky [ __ ] Martin's right alright let's do it this is gonna be 30 agility coming in so we can move on over to the vowel rock a dirty course there we go beautiful and we are actually nine levels away from it 900 total level so we will get a chunk over at the agility course in varrock but if a jump cut here because I actually went live and I just did all the agility while I was live-streaming so yeah that was me waving to the camera and fifty girls he came in which means a new chunk and access to the shop okay I did go a little bit further right she got 51 and a half agility just because we're gonna need to get the marks of grace to get the whole graceful outfit so I thought I might as well do it while I was on livestream but we didn't open up a chunk for the 900 total level when we were over at Varick getting the agility so let's do that now and then let's fire on over to Martin Thwaite here we go guys the chunk for 900 total level where are we gonna go Oh the Warriors guild we're not too far away from being able to get into that actually so I'll take it that's not bad opens up a bit more berth up doesn't give us another chance of getting over this side though which is a little bit annoying but we'll take it you know what that's not bad at all might be able to do death plateau I think you need to go all the way up here actually so we probably need 45 unlock to do it but I'll take it we can get there we've already got as you can see here 60 attack and 52 strength so we're not too far away if I grind that a little bit we'll we'll get the 65 65 as you need 130 total between attack and strength to get in there but we can now use Martin there we go look at this this is amazing this is where I am then so a lot of their thing because he buys things for high alcohol use so if we grab out all of these we will now be able to sell these at high alkyl you to Martin obviously it does go down like a normal shop so if I sell one we're gonna get ourselves seventy six coins for it I think that is because yeah as you can see someone's already sold to this shop so he should be buying 496 but it will go down when we do sell more than one c96 is the price he starts paying them for but I'm gonna be selling ten a world and we'll get around 700 GP and I'll sell ten will a short those as well just to get this cash deck up as high as we can now unfortunately the game servers were actually attacked recently and they've stopped world hopping you cannot world hop like more than ten times really in a quick amount of time otherwise you get banned out the server's raagh did it yesterday and he was banned for four hours I know a few people who have been banned for up to 12 hours and I really don't want to be cut out of the game for that long so the next chunk unlock was 16 K so we have to pay 16 K to get ourselves the next chunk unlock and then the next one after that will be 32 so seeing as I can't really hop at the moment I think I'm just gonna use the 16 K now and I hope we get a good chunk from it but we're about to unlock the 16 K chunk let's go ahead and turn this into platinum tokens taking 16 K out using it on the banker into platinum tokens and that goes into our chunk fund which will never be touched that just stays a splatling tokens for the rest of the account here we go guys let's see where we're gonna head off to the other side of catherby gets unlocked starting to move over that way now awesome okay I don't think it really opens anything up but it does mean we are starting to push towards Sears and Rd and stuff like that where loads of new content will get unlocked so I'm more than happy with that doesn't really open up anything at all in terms of content but we're getting closer to another allotment as well which would be so nice to speed up that farming grind very very nice indeed I'm pretty content with that chunk and with the whole world hopping thing I don't want to risk it I don't want to be locked out of the account so we're just going to leave that for now but we do have a load of money so we could get ourselves probably two three more chunks we out going mental on our money because obviously I do want some reserved money but while we're here as well we might as well trade with Grace and get ourselves some of the graceful pieces because it's recently be changed that each one now does an effect rather than having the whole set effect you could just wear one piece now she helps you out with running and stuff like that and stamina so definitely worth doing it the most efficient way to buy it is the graceful cape then the graceful boots then the graceful gloves and then we can't afford anything else at the moment except the hood so I might as well get it so we're currently missing the top and the bottom oh they're graceful in the on the chunk account loving that so have been doing a bit of farming in the background haven't really spoken about it too much we are only level 8 so nothing too crazy but it is just passive levels that get us closer to the next goal which is going to be 9 to 5 and the farming is going up super quickly and as soon as we get that 15 and we can start doing oak trees we should see some serious XP difference I think I've got a few oak seeds as well so it's gonna be quite useful for when we do unlock those but yeah farming there we go level 9 farming coming in we can now grow guam leaves which I did bring with me so we can start using that herb patch now as well just for a bit more XP very nice to see ok so we got 10 farming in the end and everything's planted and ready for us to get some more XP in a few hours time but now I'm gonna go and get 16 construction and the reason for that is if we get 16 construction I will be able to do all of third or easy which I mean I'll be able to unlock a chunk and also if we get 16 construction that will take us past the the 10 levels we need to get another chunk so effectively doing this will get us 2 more chunks which would be really really nice out there's some really cool stuff unfortunately doing this means I need to cut a load of logs myself turn them all into planks and by the nails as well so I'm gonna have to do a little bit of we're cutting then make a bit more money so probably gonna have to get back to birth or up sell a few more bows off and then make them all into planks get the nails and then fahren over to the house and complete sixteen construction which to be honest I'm really looking forward to it's the only skill we have level 1 in so after this we would have trained absolutely everything got myself 107 logs but I've just realized I don't actually have enough money to pay for all the logs I need so we're just gonna quickly go to fill up cells and bows off and then we'll be back and we will get our planks there we go 16 K that's definitely gonna be enough so let's teleport over to varrock and get all of our stuff ready let's see how much this is gonna cost for an inventory okay that was good there we go like 2k and imagery but we do have enough I've calculated it or we're good okay this is the last planks I did leave one plank out just so I can buy more than like I want bronze and of course iron now it's just because I want to get these as quickly as possible and we still have the world hopping issue and I really would rather not get banned yeah that should be enough we got ourselves almost 700 now and I know the iron ones have way less chance of breaking than the bronze ones so we should be good right build yes there we go okay awesome I think we have to make about 65 ish chairs something like that there's level two coming in awesome and as I said earlier we're super close to getting ourselves another chunk another nine levels so that's gonna fly by and obviously we're gonna get it doing this Construction grind up to 16 here we go guys this is going to be 9 two five coming in so that is another chunk to unlock so let's go ahead and unlock this bad boy what are we gonna get for nine hundred and twenty five total level we got the Sorcerer's Tower the magic trees and the flax we just absolutely push through here loving to see that it doesn't open anything up again really I don't really think there's anything the sorceress tower that helps me at all right now magic trees I guess a nice but I'm nowhere near being able to cut them flax I guess we could start collecting some flax and going to the going to the bank with it if I wanted to I could string all of those long bows I could string all of those longboats for a decent amount of fletching XP to be honest the main good thing is pushes us close to seers village that's now a potential chunk the ranging guild is also a potential chunk and the the legends guild which to be honest right now it doesn't really matter because we're not going to be opening that for a long long time but there is the iron and coal there as well so all in all just one of those sort of chunks that just gives more potential for better things and here we go guys this is gonna be sixteen coming in I am gonna use the remainder of the planks but that is everything we need full falador easy so we're gonna go ahead and do that next but yeah as I say just gonna finish these off just so you know I get that little bit more XP because every level counts it really does at this point took us all the way up to 930 total level Sorachi only 20 levels away from another chunk for the totals we absolutely shot up through those there let's go and do this far door stuff right the diary just made me brutally kill a duck didn't put that in the video though we go talk to I would serve rent II probably pronounced that wrong it's some sort of pun I haven't I haven't got it I don't have the IQ to understand it he's gonna tell us what our family crest is here and I didn't even say it but we got it done now this is actually really annoying I've got to spend a grand which is a lot of money to get a different hairstyle and I hate all the other hairstyles I hate them that is probably the most livable so let's go with that oh god I don't look like link anymore but boom there we go we have completed another task and just outside here we've got to fill this bucket up there we go now I remember that when I did this quest I said ah I'll do it later I'll get the blue right later so here we are getting the blue right later let's go ahead and grab ourselves the blue eye and try not to get attacked because I would rather not be worried but we should be good there we go straight away just need to make this into a bar and then we need to make a mine tiara and then we are done guys let's make the blue right crossbow limbs and that is gonna be our second-to-last falador easy done and we're just gonna head on over to the mined altar now and get ourselves this my tiara made up and then we are done just realized I can't go that way I was about to be a mad lab and go through the through the old wilderness but we don't have this chunk unlocked so we're gonna go all the way around use this on there maybe or do we actually use the tiara on the actual altar maybe ah there we go congratulations you've completed all of the easy tasks in the far door area let's go ahead and unlock our reward here guys here we go big man I've completed all the tasks in the easy I can see well done yes please go ourselves the shield there we go the farthest shield which gives us a recharge of Prayer I don't think I really need to speak to him anymore no we're good the antique lamp I really want to use it in her blog but you need to be level 30 I can't remember if you can bank the achievement diary lamps so we'll see if we can bank it if we can I'm gonna save it until I have 30 herb-lore because I you know herb was hard to come by it's a difficult skill to level up as an iron man so let's have a look no my other plan was to just use into Hunter because I at the moment have no way of really getting hunter up and there isn't gonna be for a long time and it sort of feels like that's gonna stay at level 9 for a really really long time and everything else like I'm pretty much level up but we do have a chunk to open up for completing that easy diary so let's see where we're gonna go bit more of Kurama opening up not super useful at the moment just yeah as I say another Khurram to chunk really we're getting close to getting this pretty much all done as soon as we get these sort of ones done that is pretty much all the Quran that is gonna worry us for now because we're not going to be doing the legends quest for a very very long time so I guess yet not too bad but not too helpful that should also be a chunk that's possible to unlock yeah okay I'm a massive idiot I can't put it into Hunter because that's level 9 isn't it littering the reason I couldn't put it into her blog was because it wasn't level 30 and I'm there like oh but I might do in Hunter eating it idiot so I think I know what I'm gonna put it into we'll go ahead and put it into prayer I have no way of getting prayer XP very easily at the moment like I have no altar I have no hope you alter I have no egg don't fund us there's literally no way to get easy prayer XP so that is where it's gonna go and it seems a bit unconventional but I do think for this account it's not a bad idea 33 prior coming in so we didn't get to levels from that which also didn't unlock anything actually but we'll take it to levels from that more than happy and that she seems like a really good place to end it there guys I am gonna leave the the whole map that's unlocked at the moment in the description if you'd like to help me out because it's getting so large now and there's so many possibilities I don't know if I can do certain quests or not so if you feel like helping me out and you want to go through the map of what I've currently unlocked I will leave the link in the description and you can have a little route around and have a look to see if I've missed anything and leave a comment just letting me know that would be very much appreciated guys thank you so much for watching don't forget to Like and
