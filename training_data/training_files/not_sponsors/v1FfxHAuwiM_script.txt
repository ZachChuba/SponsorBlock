these are the heart of your system hi and welcome to a new video I just got out of bed I was reading my comments on my youtube channel now I saw somebody posting an into the document that just got released I think either today or yesterday where they were using my Reisen 3000 boost survey slides inside a marketing marketing slide do you remember that I told you in the intro versus aim the topic that in 2000 have a marketing I was really wrong because enjoyed clearly has a marketing and it's absolutely terrible we will just go over those slides in a bit before we would go over those slides I want to make some updates to the rise and boost or just some additional comments to the boost survey there was a comment from Yuri not sure what if that's his real name or I don't know but he's also or claiming to work for AMD I'm not sure what exactly his relation is but he kept posting on Twitter and on overclocked dotnet and also on my youtube videos that everything we're doing has nothing to do with what AMD is doing like AMD started two months ago working on this software update to fix the boost problem that's what he's saying and that it has nothing to do with like the boost servi or any other video that was published by other tech tech youtubers for example that really doesn't make sense that really does not make sense AMD kept denying that over the last two months why would they keep denying that the problem exists if they're working already on a fix that doesn't really make much sense also one thing I would like to address is that I'm not the only one who's making videos about this boost topic obviously everything just exploded last week when we did like this public survey but like gamers Nexus was doing a lot of videos about this topic previously they were for example testing the cold scale with the rise in 3000 under ln2 they were also doing like updating testing on agiza one zero zero two versus ones here's your three a and a BB so they were also doing a lot of testing I'm not the only guy who is doing testing about this topic because some people might get this impression but that's wrong there are plenty of other youtubers and media out there who also testing this and who are also we should also get credit for this whole thing that's something I would like to address but let's take a look at this brilliant intel slide I think it was released for Aoife which is an exhibition next week or starting at the weekend here in Berlin we have this Intel real world performance slide it starts with where it all begins the six pillars process architecture memory interconnect software and security putting security in here is kind of hilarious considering the whole meltdown spectra things over just yeah no comment to that the other stuff is just to become marketing blah blah there's nothing really we can talk about desktop leadership desk top leadership now it's getting interesting obviously they're marketing the new I $9.99 hundred KS so all core five years if you totally fine with that if they're addressing this as world's best gaming processor probably it is it's like a ninety nine hundred km clock to five gigahertz or manually across all course should probably be the best in gaming that's nothing I would argue with now it's getting more interesting because Intel is pulling the I'm a 15 year old high school girl fighting versus another high school girl called AMD and we're doing just random slides and bashing each other in marketing slides that's yeah I think it's starting off with the Guru 3d news I already told you about this in my rise in three thousand boost survey that shamino was working at Asus did a statement on overclocked or net but not as an employee he was doing it as his personal opinion why he thinks that the boost doesn't work mainly because he thinks that AMD wood limited due to longevity and for Intel taking like a personal opinion of somebody even though if he's like a highly skilled engineer working at Asus using a personal opinion of somebody and quoting it in an official into the document I mean they could just call any one of us and giving our personal opinion that's yeah there's not much I would say about this and then we have a benchmark slide next to it which is kind of okay you can do that if you want to you can always pick the benchmark that's most beneficial for your product and put it in a slide that's kind of okay to me then we have my slides it's nothing I knew about it's not like Intel would ask me to use those slides as long as they use it in a correct context find me and from what I can see that's fine then empowering creators that's one of those typical marketing slides were they using relative performance so nobody has any clue what's exactly going on then we have Intel cascade like X which is the upcoming into a cascade like X CPU compared with Intel skylake X it's not stated which CPU exactly versus and exactly stated aim B CPU so 2990 WX 32 core thread deeper than the other 1/3 Uber's as well but for example for Intel skylake X is it 7 800 X or is it 7 920 X we have no idea same goes for cascade Lake and then doing those like relative performance claims without giving real information which benchmark was used which CPU under which condition is it again a cascade egg X at 5 gigahertz with the chiller we don't know so that's yeah really highly questionable then real-world not really 82% showing Cinebench r20 with an 8700 k with a score of like 3,800 what what do you want to tell us with this like what's the 82% I don't know is this a figure that a and B was claiming in the past and I maybe missed that I have no idea there was no additional information to this real well not really 0.22% showing some cinema4d stuff in the background so it's probably related to right professional creators and keep in mind that we're still talking about desktop this part is still part of the test top presentation of the slide now real-world not really again users in the segment do office application media consumption games steam csgo lol light content creation Photoshop Illustrator wait what and then the source is inter product Improvement Program I had no idea what into the product improvement program is so let's simply take a look at this here we have the insert software improvement program which I found out is a software you can install on your device and give Intel feedback what kind of programs you're using and interests saying what we'll introduce with the information that's collected the information collected will be used to better understand how consumers use Intel software and how to improve our software in the future ok this is an automated program that requires minimal effort to participate customers simply choose to participate granting in to the permission to collect data ok ok going back to the slide this means that Intel is using their software to collect data to further improve compatibility or performance of their hardware used with consumer products that's fine to me obviously that's fine but if we take a look at the source in the end it says 10 million systems all notebook and two-in-one so the data this is based on is all notebooks and 2 in 1 but we're still in the desktop slide of the thing and they're comparing this with like thread Ripper and cascade like X and then saying only 0.22% are creators that's what's listed here on the bottom like rank 1331 cinema4d 0.22% really I mean notebooks and two-in-ones who in the world if you're a professional creator using cinema4d would do that on a tablet this makes no sense whatsoever you cannot compare like tablet and notebook data with like professional creators and like thread Ripper and Cascade like X users obviously somebody who's using a tablet or notebook is using Chrome words Media Player Excel winner are that's all fine but you cannot just compare like desktop versus notebooks and tablets it's completely different use case even comparing desktop to like professional stuff like cinema 4d and using 3200 chorus abuses not correct that's still a different amount of people like different user basis completely wrong to take this out of context especially keep in mind if you're a professional creator if you're an enthusiast like us would you ever install like a tool like the internal product improvement program this software on your device and give into a feedback I personally never did that I would never do that I would never install such tools those are tools I immediately uncheck and not install them in the first place and I think you would also do exactly the same so the data they have like the popularity of the different applications like is so far from reality from what desktop users are using and to compare this with like rice and thread ripper or like a scale ax is so far out of context it's really embarrassing to put this in this light in the end trying to tell people that they cannot compare a core i7 with the rice and seven it's more like a core i3 versus horizon 7 and a core i5 versus horizon 7 but I mean it's just there's like no data to it typical marketing slide but this part where they're taking notebook data and compare it with like professional applications streaming rendering work it's yeah brilliant brilliant work and thanks for having me in there in this slide it's I would not like to be in there but nobody asked ok so much about this video and let me know what you think about this brilliant slide see you soon [Music] you
