hey there it's Adam here from Tesla Australia welcome back to another video well this afternoon I am a little bit dreary eyed it has been a long day so today was obviously the day that we had a successful launch of SpaceX so crew dragon is well and truly on its way to the International Space Station so really quite a good day in terms of witnessing that launch so myself in the Phantom Lane fall crew were up about 3:30 this morning that we started kind of getting ready to start the the livestream around 4 a.m. this morning to cover that so that was a lot of fun had a couple of really cool special guests on as well so if you haven't checked out the Phantom Lane 4 channel on YouTube you should have seen a card pop-up to link you to that channel and kind of all the content we're bringing as part of that podcast but this afternoon I wanted to do a test it's a kind of outline the idea actually came from one of my followers on YouTube around kind of a fairly steep and winding road on the Central Coast actually called the carrion hill it's quite windy quite steep I'll get some stats around kind of the elevation and the kind of the length of the of the road and things like that just to see how it performed on autopilot I wasn't quite sure how it would do and I actually haven't driven that road I don't think in the tesla at all actually to be honest so I wanted to give it a good test on autopilot to see how it performs so we're going to do that today I guess one thing I wanted to highlight before I get in the video there is a bit of a blooper in this video so it's going to take a bit of a keen eye to spot it but if you do please please comment below and have a guess or I maybe give it a week or so before I kind of go through the answer in terms of this particular and what caused and so as you're kind of going through the the video and footage keep your eye out in terms of what may not be quite right in this video so something to just add a little bit of a bit of spice to this particular video so stay tuned we're going to get to the drive and we will see how we perform going and down carry on hill and we'll go back up and see if we get a bit of a pass mark when it comes to the performance of autopilot on that route all right so here we are at the top of carrion Hill so I'm going to turn autopilot on as soon as I get some lane lines back which I now have and let's see how we go we are going to stay in the left-hand Lane just because we are going to we're just going to cruise down at the speed limit which is 60 kilometers per hour on this stretch now there is some some quite sharp turn now there's no cars around me so there is like I said some quiet kind of steep turns and the cars slowing down pretty well and taking these turns actually quite well considering how kind of sharp they are so I took that at about 47 odd kilometers per hour which is which is fine and in a 60 kilometer kilometre per hour zone this corner not not quite as steep so did that pretty much at the speed limit alright looks like it's actually 70 here so the it's just flipped up to 70 in the screen on the computers actually detected that so that's pretty cool so we are gonna just cruise along here there are people that do like to absolutely fly down this hill as that guy there so I am just gonna keep it or keep it to the speed limit there's also quite often police that like to sit at the bottom and wait for people coming down the hill and pull them over at the end so I don't want that to be me today so I'm gonna just literally roll down this hill on a Sunday afternoon so that it bends bends a quite steep but car handles are really well for the speed limit or ever break here for this turn just a bit more steeper and windings we've dropped into just below 64 this turn and that's pretty good that handled that really quite well so what we might do now is I will find somebody to turn around and we will venture on back up back up the hill and see how we go heading up the hill this time alright here we are back we are now heading up the hill so we're gonna turn autopilot back on and do the reverse trip up the hill so as you saw coming down was no problem at all absolutely no issues there with that even with some of the quite steep turns there wasn't really anything to to worry about in terms of the way the car handled those turns so some of these turns are graded at kind of 40 odd 50 km/h which which the car is definitely slowing down it knows that there is a kind of a sharp bend here so it actually has slowed down to 46 kilometers an hour obviously it didn't didn't read the sign but that was what the car believed needed to do to actually make that turn so so that was pretty cool so again another quite steep turn here coming again a car kind of coming on the right-hand lane so just being overly cautious again 45 kilometres an hour fine a bit of acceleration as we get up on the straight which is good speed them it's going to drop to 60 here interestingly the car hasn't lowered the speed down itself probably because it is dual lane so it hasn't forced her I guess a speed change so I don't think the cars gonna go to much more than that here anyway with some of these turns so again this turns rated at 55 and it's done it at just over just over 60 which is which is good okay bit more evil winding to the uphill cars had a bit of an issue a bit of a fan and break coming into that corner but no problem at all handled it okay other than like I said it obviously thought there was a thought there was an issue with the turn or could have even been shadows on the road potentially it might have detected there and obviously prompted me to to confirm I was still driving and take over if necessary but that's okay get it where he is supporting it again same thing wants me to confirm I'm here which I am I have two hands on the steering wheel just at the bottom of the wheel you probably can't see them in in these pictures son right in my eyes and that's it we now are at the top of the hill so again that was that was no real problem at all a couple of instances where the car wanted to confirm that I was still driving and enjoyed here the car is not going to do anything here just yet unfortunately yeah a couple of times the car I wanted to just confirm I was still there and driving and just just kind of touched the wheel slightly just just to confirm that so so that was that was pretty good so no real issue there all chat to you down below on your thoughts so thanks so much for watching and I will catch you on the next video bye for now
