okay this is [ __ ] crazy 133k xp an hour at the moment this setup just oh my god i'm gonna die oh my god yeah 730 total level we're really getting up there guys we're really getting up there this gives us faster xp for training so we have ourselves about 200k xp off 70 range which is uh pretty pretty nice actually i feel pretty good about where we are right now after episode three we're a total of 24 hours in we have eight hours to go so 24 of the 32 hours we got that 64 range 46 defense sponsoring today's video hello guys hello and welcome to episode 4 of the pvp challenges so of course like i said we are kicking off this episode with killing some crabs to get to that 50 defense then we're going to wrap up 800 total level and then it's right back to range training so i will see you guys at 50 defense because this is pretty boring content not much is going on at the sand crabs right now but this should probably take about an hour maybe slightly more than an hour from this point going forward i have to reset the crabs on literally my last kill look how close i am so let's just attack this one guys we are officially under seven hours the home stretch the moment we hit this level we're off to the ge i actually don't have a teleport i do have a teleport all right castle wars then varaxelli [ __ ] me those butterfly nets really did not want to sell okay so we have some bird snares and we have a butterfly net actually we need some hunter potions because this will greatly speed up our hunter xp because that means we can catch ruby harvests why are they so expensive but anyways we can catch ruby harvests at level 12 instead of level 15 and it speeds it up massively uh i just don't want to under buy oh gosh that is so freaking expensive right what's gonna be the quickest way to get to the woodlands next to the tree gnome i don't really want to overthink this or the grand tree not trinome let's just get out in order and tell you am i out of arduin telly's everything is going so wrong right now i'm wasting so much time right let's get an art you can tell him let's head to the grand tree or next to the grand tree and just start getting her hunter up and that's what's going to get us over or to the 800 total level for our next experience reward i forgot my dumb ass actually did the tree gnome village quest which means i could use that tree i can't use it to leave the grand tree but i can use it to get to the grand tree oh my gosh look the music is even called tree spirits runescape is just yelling at me right now oh the one trap waiting game go go little birdie come on i'm on a time schedule here right because welcome to the last episode the last eight hours i got myself a plan and the plan is to go ahead use the rest of the cannibals we have um and then i'm gonna have to assess the situation with how many levels and stuff we have left obviously i want the 70 range i want to have a fury for the final fight as well so we need to make enough money to do that realistically we're going to have to get 850 total level also feel like the hp level isn't high enough and the defense level needs to be 50 as well and of course 70 range needs to come in as well hp is something i'm really going to focus on so after this i think we're going to hit rock crabs uh get 50 defense and 50 strength um and yeah get as many hp levels as possible to stop him being able to spec me out with uh light blister or a dark bow okay so i'm afk here at the rock crabs just getting myself some defense levels i want 50 defense i also want 50 strength because i am going to get myself granite the reason for this is granite has a massive range bonus kins always goes range and on top of that if i wear a granite helm and like a granite shield then i can probably get away with wearing a black d-hide body and a black d hide chaps so we'll get range bonus and we'll get huge range defense bonus if he does go melee i think it's still you know it holds up pretty well especially as like the highest melee weapon he could probably get is dragon dagger in dragon dagger and dragon scimitar probably and that probably will hit but it won't out dps a dragon crossbow with dragon bolts and if i can have that range bonus and make sure i keep hitting him i think it's going to be so worth it 70 range is gonna take an hour and a half max with how quick the xp is over at dagenhauts so i need to leave an hour and a half at the end and then i need to also get a 150 total level because if i don't i'm not going to be able to afford the gear i want in the final fight this is gonna be 50 strength coming in what do we need 47 more xp uh actually a lot quicker than i thought it was going to be uh we're sort of averaging 30k xp um and i just realized what i didn't just realize but i realized i wasn't wearing my climbing boots so a little bit fuming about that and i'm sure a few of you have dropped the old uh the old comment in the comment section but what am i doing i'm wasting xp we're now gonna go for 50 defense and then we'll be able to wear granite armor yep yep yep yup yup see in the next one little [ __ ] bird get in my inventory actually i can't i can't even bury the bones that's right gotta make sure i don't do that by mistake both these little shits just flew over my trap literally both of them yep yep yep yep yep [ __ ] stop hanging out in the corner oh yeah here they come here they come nope wrong way all right yes yep target located [ __ ] sake yo bird boy get over here oh here he comes here he comes here he comes oh yeah we got him we got him we got oh my gosh oh i hate this [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] dude this is supposed to be a quick episode oh my god i've been here 10 minutes 10 minutes i forgot butterfly jars no no no no no no no no no i hate hunter i hate hunter i hate it at least i know i can get back there quick but i i'm done 24 hunter let's just say guys let's pause the clock because if we look at our total level it is 800 which means we get nearly three million coins in my most favorite part of guillenore the butterfly fields blondie boy get over here because we have two nine one nine k seriously just shy of three mil guys three mil coming on the count pretty much guys that is so much range xp you know exactly what we're going to be doing so let's teleport out of here i guess we [ __ ] up again on teleport it's great we're going to tell you out of here grow the ge buy some more cannonballs and go back to some range training but the cool part about this time is that i have a different spot because we're going to full send for 70 range if it's possible but what i want to do is buy a fury guys i really want a fury it's going to be great for the fight it's got decent defensive bonuses it's not too expensive and it solds check me out i mean this is the first time you guys are checking out the dragon crossbow the amulet of fury the combination 170 range attack bonus is that the same as the glory yeah it is but still 170 absolutely ridiculous anyways how many cannonballs do we have because we have 1.8 mill in the account i think we actually used all of our cannonballs up yeah i think that's what i expected let's go with 5k we could always buy actually let's go with 6k we could always buy more that leaves us with the mills they sold for 139 gp each just incredible it's incredible still one mill left guys still one mil left um definitely have to be careful now because we still do need the final gear but that's not going to be too much money especially since we already have our fury and our dragon crossbow so let's go to the new spot guys and i will see you there and we'll seriously just full send the range training um actually i might buy a few more myth bolts and then we're gonna full sound the range training all right so we're just approaching the spot now guys we are going to be canoning the ghouls but check this out hold on let's reset our xp because i really do want to you know test this xp and then i think i stand here possibly is this it this this might be it i'm gonna have to get used to it i don't think this guy could attack you because um i don't think he normally spawns over here it's just because he was here when i walked over here um obviously it's single combat so if i'm being attacked i won't get any um xp from the canon because i won't shoot at anybody except the one i'm attacking but um okay okay and there we go that is 50 defense coming in so we're gonna go back to the ge we can now wear granite which is huge but we need that 70 range before we go to that fight so that is huge now uh we've also got to get 850 total level if i want to be buying all the things i want for the final fight so it's still a few things to do but we are looking really really nicely on track and here we go guys 70 range is about to come in we have three hours 45 minutes left so i can go ahead and get myself some more levels we've got time to get the 200 the 850 total level let's pick the cannon up that is 70 range oh yes uh let's go ferox we can use black d hide awesome so so happy that we made that i think without the cannon there is no way i would have got 70 so i'm happy we went with it so we need 850 total level so i am going to start doing some runecrafting well i'm actually just gonna do a couple quest room mysteries and enter the abyss um so we can get ourselves like nine rune crafting i believe and then i'll probably go ahead and do some hunter because hunter training isn't too slow at that level um and then if i need a few levels after that we'll probably do a few more um room crafting levels but there are a few levels that we're really close to like i could rake some weeds and get uh 18 farming i think there's another one somewhere where i'm really really close as well so uh there's a few things we can push along we only need 20 total levels to get that 850 so we're really really close and this is gonna be room mysteries complete it took like two minutes so so quick boom okay a lot of talking a lot of talking there we go beautiful and now we're gonna do the enter the abyss uh quest which will give us that thousand rune crafting xp boom there we go quest completed 1000 xp coming in level 9 runecrafting so we're now 12 levels away from getting our gp rewards so what am i gonna do uh probably gonna go rake a couple of uh farm patches just while we're here i think there's one there's one just here i don't know if we'll get enough xp um from just doing one so we might have to go to a couple but we'll go get level 18 farming uh crafting's really close as well so i'll probably do that i think i might have a few emeralds in the bank um and then hunter probably just do a few hunter levels and then jump down but we'll see we'll see i'm excited i can still get some hp experience we have the dragon crossbow now we got a spec too since when does the dragon cross a [ __ ] special attack i don't even know what it does hit your target with 20 extra damage and in multi-combat zones hit all adjacent targets by 20 less damage wow i quite like that and yeah it looks like i'm pretty safe over here the only hazard is running out to reload the cannon but i can do it like at times like right now and then run back and it blocks him off ooh okay good luck me good luck me i will check in with you guys in a bit to show you how much experience per hour i am getting as to be honest i tried a few cannon placements and i'm getting the exact same xp per hour that i was getting at the ogres or actually like 2k more but i do have better gear this time now so i don't know if i am just not doing this right i looked at a few guides as i was doing this and they all say they can get like 90k experience an hour but then i read the comments section and everyone's calling bs on it um so i'm actually going to just pick it up and go back to ogres i'm actually quite upset i was i was really expecting to get better xp per hour i feel like a muscle going through cannonballs much much quicker but it is what it is but i don't want to waste too much time there it was the same xp rate so we didn't really waste anything just a two minute walk to um to actually get to the ogres but it's gonna be the same similar range training guys and you know still still a full send still a full cent to get our range up also another thing i discovered when really trying to fine-tune my gear um so i'm looking up everything i want to buy for the final setup um it looks like i'm gonna have to go with roon two main reasons one i forgot that i actually need 50 strength to wear granite equipment and if i was gonna get 50 strength i did it in the reverse order first of all i should have gotten 40 strength or 50 strength first then 50 defense but as you could see we don't have much time could i get it yes it's possible although of course i sacrificed a lot of range levels because that would take about two hours and actually probably would be about two hours because as my strength goes up i would hit higher and it's not like defense where i don't get any extra dps per level um so the problem is i can't wear granite but i was looking at the stats of granite and it actually gives a massive negative range attack bonus over roon now it gives a lot higher range defense but it also gives a much higher negative range attack bonus you have a lot more penalties when ranging with granite and i don't regret getting 50 defense in fact once i get 70 range i really do think i can get it because i'm getting 75k experience an hour ghoul's backfire but i still think i can get it any extra time i think i might just dump right into defense anyway because i could get a few levels really quickly versus ranging past 70 i don't really see a point in especially if i can't get 71. i think my worst nightmare would actually be him going melee imagine him with a dragon scimitar and full granite i'd cry i think he would win i think he would win i did have a few emeralds in the bank i might buy a few more i want to see how many i need 32 yeah i'll buy i'll buy whatever we need which is gonna be like 25 or something just to get one more level just make it a bit easier on us um seeing as we're gonna have so much money to spend when we get this next upgrade yeah it's not gonna quite get me a level but if we use the spirit tree just over here we can get ourselves to the gnome stronghold and there's a fruit tree patch right there so we can get ourselves that 18 farming there we go 18 farming coming in absolutely beautiful let's get ourselves back to the ge so i'm actually really close to a room crafting level so i'm actually just gonna do a little bit of room crafting we'll see what we can get i'll probably do all hundred or you know three inventories of it and we'll see what level we get because if we can just boost this a little bit it'd be nice because i don't wanna spend too much time doing hunter um and you know the earth the earth altar is really close to the varrock uh east bank and we'll just be able to run back and forth get a few levels hopefully get like 12 13 but we will see and thanks for doing the quest we also have a pouch as well so we can get a few more at a time i forgot an earth talisman or tiara is what we're gonna get i'm gonna grab herself a stamina as well because this is too slow all right let's see how much xp we're gonna get here oh 175 wow that's really not bad level 10 coming in let's empty this and bam we'll go back for can we get yeah we'll get uh hopefully two more levels hey there we go level 12 runecrafting coming in so now we need six more total levels to the 850 so i'm just gonna get six hunter levels we're gonna go to 15 hunter and then i've got three hours to piss about with what's the next i think it's like 4.3 mil or something i get for 850 total level so i don't know what i'm gonna do with the three hours i didn't realize i have so much time uh obviously we're gonna buy a fury i probably want to get ancient d hide boots as well or god boots maybe god d hide we'll have to look into this because i've got to spend that money wisely okay so we can use the fairy ring to get straight to the feldic weasels and uh yeah i think the wiki says we need to catch 37 of them to get ourselves the uh level 15 is this weasels where are they felt at weasel's nice okay once i finish up these cannonballs i mean we will definitely be past what is that 68 range if i buy more cannonballs and come back again you can still easily get 70 in that time frame the problem though is that i'll have money left over i think so either i i have two options here i can go to a place where i use cannonballs quicker like daggeth's or i can chin chinning does give hp and or defense experience i think i might just power to 70 make sure i have enough money to actually get 70 range and then have extra time at the end to then just get out my roon simi get out some super attack and super defense pots and hopefully get two or three more levels with defense i i i i don't know though i don't know though i think that might be my best bet so right after i finish these 1.3 cannonballs of course i'll have the range level i actually want to buy some of my setup some rune equipment uh the roon legs room full helm room kite shield just so i don't overspend by mistake on range supplies so i can start securing my gear now so i don't say oh [ __ ] [ __ ] i didn't have enough money 968k okay okay so let's first buy the rune our our final gear so roon full helm oh maybe i should buy like a g helm now let's let's let's not [ __ ] around guys let's not fight around uh room kite shields rune plate legs oh i should have bought a skirt oh well okay there we go so we have that um let's buy some recoils i'm only gonna buy two recoils definitely better than an archer's ring anyway even if i was able to buy it recoil is amazing i gotta make sure i put it on that's the big [ __ ] thing um there are definitely a lot of other things i could buy for my inventory um but for right now we're gonna leave it at this just want to make sure i have those so i almost got my prayer dropped to zero already almost died but i think just walking around haphazardly throwing it um it's a lot faster xp for me granted it might be less gp per xp but right now i am on a time limit anyway and i'm getting a lot more xp per hour 114k xp per hour and that's with me sucking up so bad in the beginning roon med yeah i'm getting decent drops at like this is actually pretty cool place to chin but i can't get any of my money back this is all just a big [ __ ] money sync to me right now okay really getting the hang of it now we're up to 120k experience an hour um just took a second to really get the hang of it i gotta make sure i really don't die i'm gonna be aggressive on the ranging pots from this point forward keep you know not drinking those but um yeah these xp drops are what i want to see anything like 130 plus and of course since i said that the last two have been [ __ ] last three have been [ __ ] last four have been [ __ ] great i mean i'm going through chins really really quick i might finish this trip on long range and see if i could get a defense level i mean yeah 187 chins let's see if i can get 10k xp i mean i should theoretically 64k defense experience per hour and that's i mean i'm assuming then 64 range experience an hour as well um it's a bit tricky though i'm still struggling a little bit guys but um you know i didn't really have time to practice this oh my god get up prayer i'm gonna [ __ ] end up dying although i really can't let that happen oh my gosh i can't believe i just tanked a bunch of hits there right this is proper boring and slow i'm not doing it anymore [ __ ] this this is so [ __ ] i got one level that i yeah forget that i'd rather go back to runecrafting honestly that was horrendous just getting a quick easy fletching level here which will take us one closer we are very close that should do it beautiful 43 fletching coming in and i think i'm just going to do like you know construction and then try and get like one or two skills here and there to get it up there because i really do not want to do any more i might do one more construction then just get it all in room crafting actually i think that might be the way we go let's do that here comes 850 total level guys 850 total level so what i'm going to do there we go i am going to use the rest because you know it just feels wrong not to do that there we go 850 total level coming in i'm going to fire back on to varrock and then we're going to pause the clock and put the amount of gp on the account we'll get link over and put it over um i'm gonna buy all the gear i want for the final fight that's the first thing i'm gonna do and then any money left over i can just do whatever the hell i want with that's the plan the big one bees and geez the big one look at this 4.379 k just short of 4.4 mil and that's not all we have let's uh look at a link and that is not all we have if we start the timer again we also have the money we have in the bank so we currently have 4.8 mil i've already bought the dragon and dragon crossbow so i don't need to do that let's go for the ga i'm going to buy everything i want for the final fight i'll show you my setup and then we're gonna have money to burn we're gonna have money to burn which is just so lovely to hear with what two hours nearly three hours left wow okay i'm gonna show you the rest of the purchases but this is a huge one i reckon onyx dragon bolts e now i'm gonna bring a dragon fire i'm gonna bring an antidote i'm sure he will as well that there's no way either of us are going into this fight without protection from those two things onyx dragon bolts have a 10 chance of giving me 25 of the health or the damage i deal to him as health back to me they're a huge investment 724k i think 80 is going to be enough uh you know what i'm going to get grab 75 because it just takes the price down so much let's try and buy these they're not going to buy brilliant but i think they need to be bought i think they're going to be huge in this fight just that passive healing is going to be so so helpful uh let's put the price up boom a little bit of money back it's now spent it's done i'm not used to having such slow prayer i mean i still suck at keeping up my prayer even on my main who am i kidding such good xp though it's just so [ __ ] expensive it's so it's not like i could have really done this maybe if i would have grinded for like 850 total level but even then that takes time you know that that would take probably more than a few hours to even get 8.50 and then those few hours i can't be training range so i don't know there's obviously no going back now are they unaggressive i think i just walk up the ladder so it's not a big deal but um guys that was so expensive i was just doing some calculations and i didn't even finish because that's how expensive it was i'm gonna buy one seven five zero cannonballs we have two 15k left or two 18k left for gear let's just oh my gosh i'm lagging now um let's just bank everything get out more range pods the cannon go back there then when we run out of these cannonballs it's right to sand crabs was it worth it that's the big question i mean yes and no i'd say because i don't really know the right answer to that question i mean i used up my cash jack which is you know obviously very good but there's a lot of walking involved and the chinning itself was very very short-lived the problem is is that it is just really expensive maybe if i had a plan from day one to rush 850 plus total level and then just spend all my money on great chins or maybe red chins to be honest i don't know what's better gp parexp but i would have also gotten um you know more xp per chin just because i would have gotten the hang of it much better i mean i wasn't there that long at all but our cash jack is pretty much fully depleted but we have enough to get everything that we want to get so we're gonna get 70 range here or if we can't get it with these cannonballs it's not going to be a big deal because either way we're going to sand crabs to finish off 70 if we didn't get it and then get um our defense up and hopefully we can get a lot more defense levels and by a lot i mean two or three so that is all the cannonballs um we are 11k or just under 11k from 70 range so we we will definitely get it the problem is is that i now need to focus a little bit on range rather than trading all defense it's a bit annoying guys i have to buy a lot of stuff right now so i'll get back to you in just a moment after i uh buy it all i'm going to buy everything i need right now with the remaining 217k and i will let you guys know what i bought afterwards right that's everything bought now i don't want to talk about it too much right now you guys can take a quick look at what i decided to buy the baskin potion antidote anti-fire the opal bolts i mean i'm not going to read everything it's going to take way too long i will talk about this a lot i have 5k left not even by the way got some spec weapons i actually need these we can unload these um i will talk about those after my time is up but everything we need is bought i'm not gonna go on about the setup for too long guys because i'll get into it when i'm done training but this is what it's looking like this is how i'm going to go into the fight i was going to buy um blessed hive but i don't think it's worth it i bought it here and here because the boots massive upgrade but it's only a one plus prayer on the body and the legs uh i think the ground like it provides enough defense bonuses that i don't have to go in with like roon or granite legs uh gone with a granite ring instead of a recoil i just don't want him hitting me um and as you can see the defensive bonuses are huge in everything it doesn't matter what style he goes magic we're destroying it range we're killing it melee this granite was huge it was so big and because it's so defensive it means that we can also keep our range bonus at a nice one five eight so that's why i've gone for it i think i need to get some hp levels so i think i'm gonna go rock crabs okay an hour and 25 left i actually upgraded to roon knives in the end because i thought i've got so much money left over anyway i still want to buy a dark bow which we're definitely gonna get um but we've got enough money for everything i want really um if we're lagging we keep lagging dude uh this next kill should get our 71 range i looked into it 71 range is actually a new max hit uh with the setup i'm gonna be going with so actually gives me a 30 rather than 29 so that's really really huge it's going to add dps to the fight i thought why hasn't this happened there we go very nice uh i didn't actually bring a telly out but 71 range coming in i'm now going to go to melee and i'm just going to get as many defense slash hp levels as i can i mean i might get two defense levels in an hour and 20 possibly uh hopefully get one more uh hp level but there's no way i'm getting 84k without spending you know money on cannonballs which i really don't want to do so we're gonna go with the roon sim go back to that melee setup and get yeah a few more defense levels hopefully one more hp level and then we'll uh show you the setup um i also realized i [ __ ] up with the gothics with the armor i could have gotten like a gothic sound really cheap for a prayer bonus but that's not too bad we got our black d hot and everything so let's get out all the pots that we have uh we actually need some ranging pots um we don't need much ranging pots though actually and now let's um let's just get a telly go to foulder i think we still have that stamina pot to get there really quick uh we do perfect uh fally telly if you don't even need tally back because i mean we're gonna finish our time there and then the time's up and then we'll go to the bank and show you the final setup oh my gosh i missed the recording of the most hypest level there freaking was guys we just got 70 range it's like literally just got it and switched to my defensive training gear um of course i don't have to buy the chaps or anything because we're not actually gonna do any more range training um instantly switched to my defensive training gear and we were really close we were like one point something k away from 51 defense um are we at an hp level we might get one i'm not sure i'm not going to bother doing the math to stress myself out but um i do really think we can get 53 defense um simply because we really only need around two levels because we were so close to that 51. um if i'm doing prayer flicks which i will probably start doing i'm pretty um diligently the moment i finish this recording i can get around 33k experience an hour if i keep podding up and you could see how many pots i have to go through in um an hour so i'm gonna really guzzle these down try to get that 33k plus experience per hour and we should be able to get three defense levels all right guys you're coming down to the last minute of the pvp challenge we were really shooting for that 54 defense but with around you know 15 minutes left i knew it was actually much more than that but i still had hope um as a 15 minutes ago maybe maximum prayer flicking and maximum potting i've been slacking since just because i know there's no way i'm getting this defense level in the fight i won't be using defense at all so there's no point in me trying to get it because it won't happen hp we pretty much got that to where we can get it so 53 hp pretty happy with 53 defense i'm not gonna say i'm happy with that but i'm certainly not unhappy with it i wish it was a bit higher um we got that 70 range but guys as soon as that time hits zero we're going to tell you and out of here probably just the castle wars and i will show you guys my setup but i'll spare you that loud blaring noise so i will end the clip here and i will see you after the 32 hours are complete okay here we go this is going to be the last level i'll possibly be able to get it's gonna be 53 defense coming in that is going to be us done with our training 53 defense 53 hit points i got as well 71 um range and we are now going to buy the rest of my setup and i'll show you what i'm going to be going for i can't get another total level i can't get another combat level so these last 12 minutes really are um just just time to get ready for the fight so i'll i'll show you the setup this is the setup i'm going to be going for and i'll talk through everything as we go so the granite was you know huge because it gives such a massive range defense it meant that i could you know wear all my blessed hide bought this and this for under 300k i think it was or around 300k which is way cheaper than i thought it was going to be so uh swapped the black dehyde out for two of the guthix pieces and then also got the gothic's pieces in the boots and the glove slot dragon crossbow obviously the onyx bolts i looked at the opals the issue with the opals were they do actually have a one higher max hit than these on a proc but they only have a five percent chance of activating in pvp whereas the onyx bolts have a 10 chance of activating in pvp so this should proc double as much as an opal would have so that's why i've gone with these and obviously they give a heal as well so i think you know they cost a lot they cost a lot of money granted but i think it was worth the money to invest into them obviously the avers and then i actually switched out the uh granite ring i don't think this is going to be the longest of fights um i think both of us are going to have high damage depending on whatever we've done it's going to be high damage output and i don't think having a granite ring was super worth it only gave small melee defensive bonuses um and i just don't think it was worth having i'd rather have the 40 damage output and then another 40 output so 80 damage if we go through two recoils there um and then i've gone for the light ballista over a dark bow now i looked into the dark bow and the dark bow can hit a 60. so with its speck it could have hit a 60 um with my levels and what i currently have in my inventory but the problem with the dark bow is it's way lower it only has a 90 range bonus whereas the light blister has let's just quickly have a look so i can actually make sure i get this right so the dark bow gives a 90 range bonus the light bliss gives 110 so it's got a way higher chance of hitting also the dragon javelins have a 150 range strength bonus whereas the dragon arrows only have 60. so this has a higher percent chance of hitting and with its special attack it can still hit a 47 which uh i'll take a 47 over a lucky 60 any day of the week i think this is i just has such a such a higher percent chance of hitting him rather than if i went for a dark bow and tried to get a lucky speck off so that's why i went with that gone for a bastion potion i was going to look into getting a divine but my thought is i can just keep you know spamming the bastion potion every minute or two to get the stats back um rather than taking 10 damage using a divine bastion so going with that got anti-venom just in case he got maybe mage or range and he has some sort of venom um through the blowpipe or through the uh stuff the dead not staff the dead you know what i mean toxic trident um so i brought an anti-venom and that also gives like 15 minutes of poison immunity as well so you know we're covered on poison and venom if it comes brought an anti-fire as well because it's it you know it's deadly it's deadly if he brings dragon stone bolts it's deadly without it needs to happen so i brought that then i brought you know manta ray's obviously 22 heal and some karaab ones because of our low hp level i'm very worried about how much damage output he's going to put into me you know he hits like a 30 or some sort of spec throws me into a 40 50. i really need these quick heals you know to get myself back up so we've got those um and i've also brought a graphics rest which we can overheal with so we can go to 58 hit points with that so i'll be using that primarily to sit at higher hp than i actually can do i was thinking about brews but at my hp level brews only here like eight or something so they're totally useless and then obviously i'd have you know the the stats go down and all that so it really wasn't worth it um i think what i will do is probably get rid of one manta ray and bring a super restore uh i don't think i'm gonna need two yeah i'm gonna bring one one restore so there we go guys if he goes magic he's not winning i've got 108 magic defense if he goes range i think our range is really really high uh defense wise and i also think the attack bonus we've got 158 range is massive as well uh but if he goes melee as well we've got really really good melee stats uh a dragon simi would probably be the worst we want to see because uh that is my lowest defense stat in terms of uh out of the melee so dragon simi might be a bit of an issue but i think we're gonna be okay this is the setup let's go to the fight wow the 32 hours is officially over and it actually kind of feels weird this has been my life for the last few days just grinding i feel very attached to this account um just overall quick thoughts um i do think my progression was pretty good although there are many many many many many flaws that i could point out i didn't show a lot of them because a lot were just me wasting time like forgetting to buy a stand when i probably should have or doing something a bit too long or taking too long to a quest it's mistakes like that i do think my plan was good um there's definitely overall things like granite should i have gotten 50 strength for granite i saw it as it would have taken two three hours to get i sacrificed melee defense for extra range defense and also it gives a huge negative range attack bonus so if he's going tank range of granite it might be a bit difficult i think he'd have the better setup then um but if he's not then i do think the setup i have now is is just as good um and who knows maybe he didn't take granite if he goes melee with granite i think that's my worst worst nightmare if i really had to pick something here um everything you see in inventory nothing is officially locked in i mean i have two spec weapons and a weird assortment of stuff just to show you guys i do have extra supplies um extra manta rays an extra cram blonde stuff like that um so if i swap any of this out you guys know uh two recoils that'll definitely be in the fight we do have the opal dragon bolts because of their spec um it's it's it's the same principle as like dragonfire as in the spec hits extra although you can't protect against it we can't use overhead so this thing will hopefully hit like 30 pluses in the fight i know link has actually trash talked these bolts in the past like putting them down i don't know if he'll bring him but every you know high tier pk or i see actually uses the c engineer said he uses these when we did that pvp challenge so i'm gonna just hopefully follow his advice and get the win on these maybe i'll snake him on better bolts uh we have the bastion potion the antidote and the extended anti-fire now i feel like i have to bring these if he brings dragon fire i'm literally toast no pun intended i i will literally burn like a [ __ ] toast and i think he'd win dragon fire is much stronger than opal bolts so i definitely like i'm scared not to uh same with the poison i mean i'll definitely bring the poison i'm mainly scared of the emerald bolts but if it's like a little spec weapon that poisons like this then it's definitely worth you know bringing the antidote it's just it's not something that you want to lose on i do sacrifice 22 heals or 18 if i decide to bring an extra cramp on but but it's so difficult to gauge on what the best move is in the inventory set up because i don't know what he's doing i have no idea what combat style i have no idea what his specials are i have no idea what tricks he has up his sleeves it's it's difficult i also have the t's um they actually reduce poison by one but that's not why i have them they're a combo eat my hp is 53. i think these balls can hit 30 plus um with 70 range potted and you know if he ranges with a spec and then hits it with this spec like i'm dead i'm i'm dead you know it's i i can go from literally max hp to zero hp in a second i can't really bring anglers because they only heal 11 in this in this hp range so for everyone thinking that that is off the table definitely won't be bringing any of those um in terms of the spec weapon i'm actually very confused on which one's better so this one hits twice i don't think they have any increased accuracy but you could like spam click it at knife speed and get twice the amount of hits in four attacks and this is an instant attack we're not instant but it's one game tick it hits stronger it's only one attack but you do have improved accuracy and in that case it would be like bolt and then spec in this case it would just be like spam you know i do feel like i might have more chao potential with the with the throne axe still not sure which one i'm going to take i'm leaning towards the axe to be honest because he's going to have high range defense no matter his setup i have 83 range attack here and only 75 here um also the range strength is way higher but this would hit twice so i guess minuscule the poison i'm gonna really assume he's gonna have anti-poison so i can't you know factor that as the saving grace here if i'm gonna win this fight the stats need to be close the armor needs to be close and uh if if it is close it's gonna go down to the better pk or um it's gonna go to the person who remembers to wear their second recoil but i am rambling like crazy i'm so nervous i don't know if any of this is gonna pay off properly but i'm proud of the plan we have let's go fight guys i will see you at the reveals with link right hello everybody i just want to make a quick note and say [ __ ] you link for bringing that atrocity into this fight um if you guys watch season two that scars me that whole setup that that purple ogre it's just horrible it's disgusting i'm actually pissed off right now i started winning episodes once i changed gender so that's why you know oh my gosh winning episode i've been so out of touch but i've gotten a few like hate comments like apparently i started straw because as of right now obviously episode four isn't released but episode three has been people messaged me on discord i could see people talk during streams apparently you had the stronger start link and apparently i i went wrong somewhere because i got uh you had the strongest start yeah oh did i not say that i had the stronger start then i did something wrong apparently i also think in this type of challenge there was only one real way to go oh yes and i the fact that you said that really does make me believe that you figured it out and you did it yeah so yeah i think i i i have based pretty much my last two episodes on thinking you are going down this route oh really yeah i well i thought myself i was like i could try and outplay him and try and do something to counter that but i thought no i'm gonna i'm gonna go with that he goes with it and i'm just gonna try and do it better and i think that's the only way that you can really go about it then we definitely did the same [ __ ] thing dude 100 percent [ __ ] sake you use the cannon you use the fighters there's no other way to get [ __ ] i mean maybe if you boosted your stats to 850 like the first thing you did and then chin your way there maybe that's quicker i don't know but there's so many like cost calculations and how much money it's gonna take to get to that point that i wasn't gonna risk going for like nine total level i looked into 45 range monkey madness tunnels grating chompers to wrench and chompers and it's like grades are like one mil an hour and you get about 100 range xp an hour and then reds go to like one point four mil an hour that's very expensive though anything red plus it wasn't ridiculous it wasn't worth it i looked into it it's not worth it three yeah yeah yeah i'm go i go three this tells a lot by the way guys three two one go oh my god are you [ __ ] me you won't just have exactly identical stats all right link this all right like like like i'm gonna say my hp level you tell up if it's higher or lower okay okay all right all right 53 [ __ ] off mine's 53 i'm done all right you're trolling no i'm not man you're [ __ ] true range level hold on hold on that that's the juicy one prayer which i'm assuming is 44. that was a pretty uh strength and attack i'm 40 40. i'm 50 50. oh no did you so you did monkey madness i'm assuming that i can't figure out how you grinded those stats up you probably did the other uh gnome quests i did all the i did i i when i thought i was going melee i did grand tree i did fight arena i did monkey madness i wasted a lot of time going down that route and then realized because i wanted chivalry i wanted chivalry and a dragon scimitar and that was actually better dps than going down the range route but then i realized you have to do [ __ ] one small favor jungle potion all that crap before you can start doing the knights waves and i was like that yes yeah i i mean because monkey madness gives that huge xp reward at the end but i kept like weighing the options and i was just i kept telling myself like it's probably not worth it because i get sure i might get some levels but i get worthless attack xp for me i stuff the grind to 50 and then 50 strength and to get my defense up because i i just wanted my defense up i don't know if those combats affect it enough to actually change that our range levels will be different here do you want to do it over your head yeah sure i'll go sure all right you call it how you call it all right okay three two one go okay come on i'm not i'm not even that stressed one range level is it does it either it's a max hit it's about here that's why i went for it so okay so depending on your setup i don't know where you'll set up well okay with the fact he's talking max it he's gotta be going crossbow cause i'm like a knife it's not gonna [ __ ] cause a difference is it okay okay all right i i still i still feel okay i still feel okay same combat level though same hp defense ridiculous arrange a range [ __ ] level in terms of things we're going to be using in this fight 32 hours and here we are with the same [ __ ] combo okay well you got a slight slight advantage here fair enough well link it is now time for the reveal man we're waiting i just want to know something yeah how have i managed to do all of that and still beat your range level i didn't want to grind any more xp total level rewards past 800. i knew it was possible but i just i didn't want to do it yeah i only have 816. i got 800 and then just kept sending range what xp were you getting at ogres i was like after i got a dragon crossbow it was like 75k an hour but i gotta remember i was getting like 20k through the crossbow alone dude i i did daggernuts i did the whole horror from the deep mm-hmm with with the full set up i was getting 135k xp an hour yeah but you probably went through 2.5 k cannonballs an hour yeah but all i had to do was get the 850 total level when it paid for [ __ ] everything well yeah but that's so easy to say in hindsight you know as as as we're planning these out you know oh god i really do well yeah i mean i could see that now but i bit the bullet and i went through knives down at rock crabs for an hour or two i think it was through knives wow yeah yeah yeah wow well with 850 total levels so much [ __ ] money mate yeah that's 400k in the bank right now that's true that's true i mean i have one farming so i'm probably gonna hear [ __ ] for that to be honest but yeah i've got 18. like i will give you the honors of the first item here man i'll give you the honors for the gear reviews good boot tonight let's go boots i mean we know we're going range it's just yeah and i you had that extra xp reward so i mean i'm just gonna expect it you're rocking the blessed dehyde boots right yeah yeah yeah okay yeah i know where this is going down gloves he's probably got the brace yeah i did buy those though those are cheap they were cheap [ __ ] weren't they uh i'll get legs mate okay the rune i'm expecting granite to be honest because you have 50 strength really i as you say granite i'm relying on the granite elsewhere to keep me protected oh that's bold i don't know i wanted to maximize my range i wanted to maximize my range attack right i feel like because we have low hp levels yeah so constant hits are going to be more important than the defense so i don't know it's going to be a playoff i thought i'll [ __ ] give it a go and see what happens yeah dude because i was comparing the numbers of full grade in full root and the negative range attack on granite is like especially for the legs the legs is like ridiculous the legs i don't think are worth it something like the shields and the hell maybe but the legs were like negative 18 range attack i was not putting those on and then i was like you know what [ __ ] it let's treat ourselves let's see you know okay let's go body yeah okay i figured you have a bit of the luxuries i i mean my one [ __ ] up was i could have gotten like gothic's plate legs but dude i was zooming the last few hours and it didn't cross my mind until after i bought it and we can't sell it but if if that was my biggest mistake here not getting guffix plate legs in it you know um all right let's go shield i'm pretty sure this this is going to be a room kite and that means you're going crossbow but yeah i'm i'm i'm expecting granite kite or granite shields yep yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay i was like you look like [ __ ] oh yeah it gets worse don't worry oh no all right i'm gonna go necklace okay fury same oh i was hoping you'd have a glory though oh no no no i definitely wanted a few of the final fights dude plus 15 in all defense i wasn't going to hang up on that i know it's huge uh let's go home let's do it i mean you know what i'm putting on i feel like i know what you're putting on i look like a tortoise you look like a [ __ ] alien dude oh oh my god that is a hideous um your pick mate you're playing all right keep [ __ ] i mean i yeah i know i'm gonna see here yeah yours is way bigger than mine on a male character that's because i'm better bigger means better funkier mate bulkier thick boy okay um i've just got a weapon now mate same i think it's pretty it's like i'm just putting it on yeah like if you didn't have that i would have been actually a bit concerned because there's no way you were getting armadillo unless you somehow got in like 1.1 k [ __ ] total level what bolts let's have a look i'm going with the bolts that you actually trashed oh wow that yeah i'm like i'm taking c engineers advice right here man although i'm oh okay i don't even know how good they are or bad they are or whatever so i looked into the opals they have a one less they have a one higher max hit than the onyx for my level okay but they only trigger five percent of the time whereas these pro trigger ten percent of the time in pvp so they trigger double the amount they're [ __ ] and they heal 25 percent they heal 25 of what you hit back oh that's not bad yeah i mean i can't afford that luxury anyway so i'm not even upset i wanted a hundred and i was like nah no way yeah yeah yeah okay you put yours up then because i don't i actually don't think i did oh wow oh no no i didn't oh my god is it knives he went with knives a ballista interesting interesting our thought process are very different here wow i looked at the blister and thought the the chance of that [ __ ] hitting is huge yeah you take off the shield it's slow i don't know i mean yeah that could definitely pay off because her hps are so [ __ ] low um it can hit a 44 with the spec oh that's so so that's like terrifying that is 30 like dragon ball into a [ __ ] 40 you're gone you know that's that was my thought process i mean you do know what the speck of this is right yeah it's just throw through i throw through a throw which is yeah but i can bolt and then throw so i could hit like a 30 into an 18 which is probably i mean i'm obviously that's not 44 but i'm estimating also it's probably around a big [ __ ] hit and you can't even drink lower carrying potential but you have a lot more chances is effectively what you've got yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean you have to waste two inventory slots for that thing with the right correct oh my god uh real quick because i'm very curious what is your um oh we forgot ring slot i forgot ring slot oh i got a recoil okay same i don't think that out there okay um so it gets even deadlier um just real quick what is your range attack and range defense compare those in this setup yeah uh 158 range attack uh and 209 defense ooh 141 range attack 195. range defense yeah wow wow is it the all right this is canon not that it's going to help me but it's always been canon so far do some following xp for them for the video it's not even gonna get me a level but all right guys don't say i didn't do farming on this account um because i did i i couldn't sleep at night knowing that you killed me with poison so i made sure i did bring an antidote and the same with the dragonfire as well because i didn't want to lose one of those [ __ ] [ __ ] things where you hit a 55 with dragon slide which is more than my [ __ ] hit points or agree and i was like poison he's definitely either going to try it or if if you did try it and i didn't bring it i would have been fuming with myself exactly right you had to bring it i agree i agree so we're both there on that um i only went with one restorer so did i ah okay speaking of which at the top off on my prayer remind me before we start uh one of these oh i brought two of these combos my main thought was over heels allows you to go for an overview oh right that's true i'd even think of that but yeah oh yeah you really [ __ ] shouldn't have and uh yeah recoil okay uh one more manta it's see the the big problem is if one of us hits big the other person is just scrambling and i have powerful specs you have powerful specs recoils are going to be firing left and right oh this is going to be a horrible this could be like a 16 second link this could be like oh just eat link piece of advice when you have low hp just click on a food okay thanks brian so guys now usually of course we do more than one fight like in season two when we have these long progression ones but we only have one fight so that means one worlds so if a coin on screen heads and tails two sides and whoever calls it essentially gets the ping and we go to that respective world so link i'll let you call it before i flip it and um uh let's go ahead heads all right let's flip and it's tails i just like i i i don't think it's gonna be as big as we think it is because it's a lot of just like attacking and waiting for hits to happen but hey still still good to know i have the uh ping advantage i'll take it i'll definitely take it okay all right i'm going to start porting mate all right same here we go oh the trains go oh my god drink it what what happened did you do the quest to do the gothic's rest i can't drink the gothic's rest [Laughter] okay hold on hold on what oh [ __ ] say thank god he's wasted two infantry slots there i've only waited oh [ __ ] no way this is oh this is gonna be [ __ ] bad yeah this is this is dreadful a zero really yes really oh [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] definitely [ __ ] not definitely not we can't use overheads and we couldn't bring brews i don't think we mentioned that so that's why that's it my setups that's it look how they look come on big hit okay we're not hitting anywhere near as much as i guess we thought we were going to well you're you're hitting a little bit i have to like every time you hit me i have to eat that's the problem oh that's a huge hit [ __ ] gothic's rests are gonna [ __ ] do me dirty i can't believe this man i think you just have to talk to sam pew i think that's all we had to do i actually know you have to do one small favor i knew that as well i knew that [ __ ] oh no ken stop stop here yeah nice nice come on hits holding out we're holding out here just hit please hit please hit no no more hit skins no more yeah i dude i don't think i hit at all with my specs bye dead dead oh that's such a poor hit such a poor hit two inventory slots wasted i'm i can't believe this [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] hits oh no oh [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] hit the train the train the train no no no no hit hit hit yep nice and again come on hit hit hit hit yes oh god oh my god two [ __ ] sanford serums dude yeah that is that is so unfortunate i was out i was out i was out i was out for a long time there mate i was out for three hits i think so
