I love them today so it's going to need to pose in a few separate parts that being said it's the main theme in the video it's going to be your skills going to share any choice because of my own I don't know everything about work that means that I have a student experience on a large canvas a lot like my camera's large yes that is what we're doing a painting on a very large not only that we are doing a sister painting to my melting moon painting but we were going to paint you guessed it a melting Sun good job good job first step this is fun it's fun you're not scared of a big canvas it's that's exciting that's a big canvas you had to go for some of the supplies you'll need we are going to use acrylic paint to start out acrylic it's a water-based paint and it dried as quickly that means that it we are also going to use some oil the base of an oil I think is obviously oil an oil doesn't dry not quickly at least this is both brilliant for painting and awful as if you accidently swipe your hand through it if you can this falls off your easel which does happen frequently and I'm after how clean your around is it will get dust in it it will have collected dust moving onto other things you'll need a sponge for blending it is a very big painting need a big sponge or a big painting small things are really fun as always we're going to start with a colored pencil if you're making a mirror you know what I'm going to say I use a colored pencil sketch on my canvas because a graphite pencil don't bleed and a kite pencil will not you don't know what I believe I believe basically when you paint over graphite from a normal pencil it will run into the paint and you can still see it so I use a colored pencil I don't know when I thought through this but I did welcome to my classroom my canvas and our son maybe get a trip every as well we're doing a very wobbly artistic son shape here in the background I think I'm gonna go for a mixture a daylight and sunset so you want more right and pizza because the idea behind the painting is that the Sun it's nothing into the ocean of the oceans actually collection melted paint now I'm going to break our painting down into four separate sections so we're gonna start at the sky move on to the Sun the boat and then finish off with the water the sky is gonna be done fully an acrylic paint and for this I'm gonna play mix the colors out in these glasses now let's mix some paint to start out I'm going to use a sky blue and yellow to mix a bright blue with a hint of green the next one I'm taking the blue that I mixed and adding the white to it to make it even lighter and this will be the main main color then I'm going to mix a pinkish orange and a golden yellow color given how large the canvas is you will need to mix a fair amount of the paint to cover it now I go for the canvas I'm just gonna go for it we're gonna have a lot of fun I'm going to take the yellow paint and do a thin two-inch strip of paint along the base of the sky then I'm going to take my orange paint and paint a larger section just above that I'm not going to make it completely straight at the top I like adding diagonal lines on my skylight makes it feel a bit more whimsical next I'm gonna blend the two colors together a little bit better now using the light blue we're gonna go over the whole top part this is just the base coat paint so it's not going to look well blended yet it'll have gaps will appear to be too thin in areas you have to build the ping depth so this is just the beginning one more detail we get to the top coats of paint now we take our sponge and cut it into little pieces I know it used to be such a big sponge it was a bit too big though oh and this time we're going to paint the entire sky again but this time we're using our sponges to blend [Music] now we're gonna paint it one last time at this time I have a palette for more colors and I paint it all again and keep adding colors back and forth until you're absolutely happy I didn't like to mean the orange into a panic [Music] this time we're adding white highlights blend and randomly across the top then we're going to clean up the shapes of the Sun on the boat easy liked acrylic think in any areas he kind of crossed with a sponge made it a bit messy so we're just trying to make it shine for now it doesn't need any perfect [Music] - I touch-ups that should be it for the acrylic paint and now we're gonna move on to do a little for the rest of the painting the Sun is going to be a circle with darker orange on the outdoor arena and pale yellow tones on the inside I've also kind of made chunking rays coming out of it so when it melts it looks like it's literally melting out of the Rays the shadows I'm using pale pinks and purples - ed towe and when working with oils I tend to start from the top of the image and work my way down the painting this way I don't accidentally rest my hand on top of the wet paint and then being back and forth and trying to get rid of any excess oil paint in a cave in there and since I'm using the lighter colors for this I didn't need to do an undercoat of acrylic paint if I have darker tones neither do you like to do it under coat acrylic because it makes the oil temp a lot better but in this case we lucked out we lucked out I'm looking my way around making sure the more vibrant yellow tones are on the edges of them some shapes fading to white in the center I'm also adding green tones in places that I want to look more liquid this is because the Sun is yellow but the sky is blue and blue and yellow make green [Music] as aren't some pale green and blue tones the middle of the Sun this way the high light shine points will come through a bit more and I'm making the trips mostly white to give a bright to glow effect [Music] and now on to postal vote this is based on my golden art ship in for my weekly giveaway I just figured in a parallel with the Sun with colors plus I needed a boat needing a boat now for the locker I'm doing random waving lines and lots of different colors that I can pull from the sky one painting watch her it does essentially reflect the sky but here I'm also making the Sun look like it's melting into it so I'm definitely making the yellow times thicker than Omni which a bit more exaggerated the yellow then fades into a seafoam green with the darker blue shades around them and this goes on super quick and I see I'm throwing in darker tones every now and then but making sure to get plenty of that yellow and reflect the Sun [Music] on the other side under the little our ship I'm using blue any darker purple to create death here keeping it darker at the top and blending it into a lighter blue at the bottom and across the canvas I've added a very intense of a blue [Music] I'm going to go over and fix any details I think need fixing and then I'm going to use my airbrush to clean up cloud texture and it adds a little glowing dots and here is the finished painting [Music] thank you for watching I do hope you enjoyed the video also be sure to check out skill sharing if you'd like to improve as always I do have my weekly gold opinion away the very same golden pin that inspired the painting like a chance to win a golden hit -
