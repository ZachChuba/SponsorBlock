all right this BMW is coming with us okay it literally did not do that I'm so glad I filmed that because what happened there folks like genuinely what happened I'm not a hundred percent sure just over a year ago now on the 25th of May 2019 I was rocking 2019 16.2 on my hardware to model X and I made this video which blew up and got really really popular when navigate an auto pilot came up it's been over a year and there's been loads of updates since and navigate on autopilot has been tweaked and changed it's now really good at Lane Assist is really good at Lane changing and it's pretty good in construction zones however on and off ramps is still a bit of a struggle so I've got nine off ramps on ramps and junctions coming up and we're gonna test every single one leave a rating down below of how well the car did out of ten in the comments we're going 53 as we enter our first exit here and this is a good speed to be going for it you can see people are coming into our lane who are also coming off so let's see how well it does this of course it will do the indicating and changing lanes all by itself when it comes off of a motorway so you ready and there we go indicated off really nicely done where's the car going to go is it going to keep to this left lane or is it going to go over to the right it's kept to the left lane and that was absolutely perfect okay on to the next one coming on to the motorway is a little bit of a different story though this has been really hit and miss with the model three I found so far so let's put it on and you can see sitting in the middle of this lane nicely let's see if it asks us to go left before it goes right at all it's asking us to confirm our lane change to the right here which I will start trying to confirm and you can see that we're going to run out of time here before the car to do it so when you get to the end the car actually just squeezes out I wasn't going to do it there because we've got a van quite close to our right-hand side there but as you can see it doesn't come on like it comes off which is really natural and smooth and you don't have to touch anything whereas when you're coming back onto the motorway it always asks you to change lanes but that's not really what you're trying to do you're trying to merge and I don't see why the car can come off of a junction really well but when you try and go back onto the junction it just fails it literally every single time it has issues unless there's nobody on the road let's go to the next one and see if we can get better results I've got to say things like that really scare me when I'm on autopilot because I'm worried that it can't see the trailer and I don't know it's just something that I don't want to test my car with but I'd like to see someone else test by going as close as possible to one of those like lowdown trailers and seeing if the Tesla recognizes it here we come in off at Junction 27 hopefully this will be as flawless as the last one again hands-on touching anything at this point and will it stick to the left a little bit a little bit odd there and where's it going to go now this is technically one kind of laying down the middle but as you can see everyone up there knows that it goes into two lanes the cars accelerating hard is not picked a lane it's still right in the middle and yeah it's going to decide to sit in the middle of these and there we go now it's picking to go around them which which is correct this is the lane we actually want it to be in so a little bit left a little bit right but it did do it correctly and then of course it won't it won't do roundabouts so I have to take it off four roundabouts so let's try and go back on then shall we and see if we can get a better result this time coming on to the motorway than we did last time because last time was just a big fail basically okay nope it said they wanted to do it twice there you go third time's charm and here we go so again really short runway here these are just standard like UK onto motorways on ramps and here it should just merge by itself but look it's gonna ask me to change lanes now and look at how much time it takes it just doesn't it takes a long time for that to happen and usually you've either run out of time or if you're unlucky enough to have someone else alongside you while you do that it's nearly impossible Junction 26 is coming up here on the left it is asking us to get in now but I'm waiting for that line to appear that's like four hey you really need to get in now but it's not appearing for some reason so I'm gonna try and get after this Laurie I don't know if we're gonna make it off this Laurie actually but Wilson oh we definitely not okay so what if we're a bit panicky there we go that was a nice break it's not behind us don't worry I was making sure it was safe and it'd break nicely and hopefully it should just bring us off to the left here no problems at all really nice and then again here will it take the like this is one lane will it think of its two lanes it is two lanes and it has put us in the left lane so again that felt really good when you come off of the motorway it does kind of swing you off and then sometimes when you once you come off it doesn't know if it's the single lane or double lane and it kind of just flings you about a little bit so I would hope that in the future that is sorted and it basically just woke filling you about that would be quite nice there's no one coming on the roundabout so let's just see out of interest where it take us it would definitely have taken us left down that way but we don't need to go that way we're heading back onto the motorway and we're gonna test it again on the on-ramp so this is actually a nicer looking on-ramp than the others were let's put that 260 I'm not sure why it won't do 70 but it won't get you up to the full speed limit of 70 before the motorway for some strange reason so this is why meant so you can see now I'm coming in between the two lorries that I just turned off that and is it going to do it luckily we had quite a long ramp and there was a good enough gap in between the two lorries there that actually was pretty smooth and that's how I want it to come on to the motorway every single time this next one we're coming off at is actually a service station so hopefully we might be able to get some a little bit more auto piloting through the service centre here let's see how well it does and see what it looks like go into the left lane now and you can see that it's bringing us down to 60 which I've got to say doesn't feel natural and does feel too slow on a motorway so I have put my foot on the accelerator there to speed it up just that little bit and again here as you can see it kind of goes a little bit left a little bit right and now it tucks us all the way over here to the right-hand side and now it's bringing us over to the left no actually we're going this way we're going this way and it wanted to take us through the drive through which was really interesting because we don't want to obviously go through the drive through and we do just want to go straight through the service center so let's just let it kind of do its thing here sticking us to the left sides I'm not sure why it's sticking us to the left but now it's sticking us to the left rather than the right and it doesn't seem to want to go over this like central no it's not a line it's like a crack almost in the floor and it doesn't want to go over it let's see here will it follow the Mauri it was definitely following the lorry we can't go in there because we're not HTV so we're not going to go in and take their spaces and whatnot but that was interesting actually because it definitely was following that lorry and where it wanted to go okay no one's coming on that's perfect just got time to set this so actually in theory I don't even need to be on navigating on autopilot for this to work here so Oh actually yeah yeah so let's just try this without navigating autopilot on and just gonna do the lane Crossing myself and look at that without navigating on autopilot there is absolutely no difference with coming onto the motorway Junction 25 might be quite interesting we're in a 50 speed check area and there are roadworks about and it does say that there's like cones and that the lanes are gonna move ah here we go the lanes are moving and I'm really intrigued to see how does that Tesla react to this so you can see it's asking us to move over and change lanes here but it knows that we're coming off so it's keeping us in the left lane which is correct and this trucks now indicating left is our car gonna go left no so far we're not it's not asked me to go into that left lane it is it gonna take me off is it going to do it are we going off construction navigating on autopilot interrupted and just gonna wait and see if it does anything at the end no interesting look at that so even though the lane itself was actually open and working because there was some construction the car simply was not interested I did not try to go around as and go around those cones and go into that little extra construction zone okay onto 24 there's no construction as we get to Junction 24 at bridgeheads and we are going to go down it and hopefully again this is going to be a nice flawless off-ramp and rampe if we can get both that would be great I don't think we've had a flawless on and off yet so I'd really like it to be nice and smooth off here jump down and then just back on and indicate on there's lots of cars here that I've overtaken and have overtaken me about six or seven times already since I've left the motorway and they are so confused every time they see me and go past me like what is he doing he keeps on being behind us that in front of us hey-ho okay so we're gonna be taking the left here again the car should indicate yes we're not gonna miss this one as you can see which is good and is it gonna stick to the left or it's going slightly to the right no it did slip stick to the left which is really good for us and we're gonna be heading straight on over this roundabout so that was actually really nice that was a perfectly smooth off the motorway if we can get this perfectly smooth on to the motorway then we might be in big business here for a perfect run let's see as we know from last time we don't actually have to have autopilot on for this bit it's the exact same there's the same lorry that we came off at we're going to try and capture it back up this is a weird fun game that I'm playing like on the motorway off the motorway so here again it goes pretty wide as you can see the cars are not asking me to move over but I'm gonna start indicating and doing the lane change myself and really nicely done and that that my friends was potentially flawless so we're gonna be coming off at this one here and trying to see if it will pick the correct lane for us to go off and left here I'm intrigued to see if it will do actually and if it will follow the Sat Nav to take us off left so here we go come in onto this one I will put it or I will put navigate on autopilot back on as well for the next coming back onto the motorway pretty quick actually yeah that's pretty quick coming up to this Junction I've got to say and then yep pretty firmly it's picked the left lane here and autopilot turning off in a hundred feet which is brilliant so I'll move over to my lane and you can see it's actually bringing yourself all the way down here traffic lights Oh No okay so these traffic lights are real but they're not actually on they're not working there's no one coming around this corner so I'm just gonna let the car do it and we're just gonna just gonna see what the car okay it bought straightaway I think now they've updated it so it knows that it's straight away onto a motorway because it just like abort straight away now as soon as it gets onto the motorway which is really really annoying but that's just that's just what it does okay well we're back on here now and we're going to go to where am I going to my supercharger so navigating autopilot should turn on and tell us to go across but it's not there we go now it is so I'll do the lane change and we're doing the lane change across now we have got a van behind us there you could see and he was actually really close to us while we were doing that lane change and I was actually worried he was gonna turn the system off or at least make us like try and shove us back into the lane by imagining impressed that it didn't now this Junction 22 on the left is going to be quite interesting because the motorway itself actually continues off even after you've come off at Junction 22 and I want to see if the navigate on autopilot will actually take us around the roundabout there or we'll just kind of see what it does and kind of figure it out as we go okay so we're going to sit in between these two lorries here as you know you know what we're gonna go around this lorry and we'll go behind the the DPD van that we came off the last junction with keeping our convoy going here so again it's happy to push forward and go around the lorry but it is asking me now to get on in because it is it is time to get in so yeah so this Junction here you can see that it comes off and this is still part of the motorway so Junction 22 is all of this and it's also all of this over here this is gonna be the last one my battery's on two percent I really hope it doesn't cut out halfway through this okay Tesla show us what you've got show us what you're made of indicating off really nicely and coming off a nicely breaking pretty hard but I think that's because of the other cars and coming off this Junction yeah we've got some traffic so this could be quite interesting and navigate an autopilot has completely turned off there as you can see however we are able to go around this corner not like really slowly because of the traffic so this has actually worked out relatively well for me and what Matt you're going to do now is navigate back to the supercharger that we're going to and I'm gonna hope that I can cross the lanes here let me see if the car will let me will across lanes no interestingly enough it won't cross lanes even though we're still on a motorway the end of the motorway that that's what that sign means end of motorway so even though this is still part of the motorway this has now been taken off navigate an autopilot previously when you used to drive down here because I did it ages and ages ago when navigate first came out it actually would try and do this roundabout and get pretty confused thinking it's just like a circle so yeah they've obviously taken that away because that caused potentially some problems or they just need to to figure it out before they dropped it to the masses so let's go all the way around on this roundabout back up and onto the m5 and here we go back on to the m5 and it's into a 30 here navigate an autopilot turning on no that's not navigating autopilot that's just a bit of what that is it's just normal autopilot that's on at the moment it is a 30 up here but oh it's a 30 sorry it's a 30 going that way okay it didn't realize that so we're gonna put it back up to 60 and see if it reacts in this corner it should slow down nicely yeah this is good this is the kind of test I wanted and all the way rounds it is very very slow but it did it correctly and now we really need to accelerate this is where all that vans done something strange by pulling off there that never happens so don't know what's up with him so the car again not pulling out for me and now it is now that I indicated again it's just the juice just the joining it's the joining of the motorway is definitely the problem that we're having here once you're on it it's fine coming off is pretty good now actually it used to be pretty scary but now it's quite good I still don't do it just so you know I still don't do it when I have other people in the car because it still doesn't feel natural enough for them and then they think that my driving is pretty shocking if I went off and did a little wobble I obviously expect the car to do it because I know what's coming whereas other people don't so that's why I'm super careful and also I don't like to use this when other people in the car because they don't have as good of experience as I do I hope you enjoyed or any other ideas you want me to go and check out the beach towels all my over on patreon.com forward slash tears the driver until next time don't forget drive safe actually we've got motorway services in one mile Tesla drivers and I think we should yeah we've definitely got this don't worry don't worry I've got one more for you I'm actually getting used to these like extra like extra little ones at the end of each video is quite nice and we'll be taking this left here to the services as our real real final one let's see how well or bad it does please do well oh this is actually official services okay cool all right this BMW is coming with us okay it literally did not do that what was I'm so glad I filmed that because what happened there folks like genuinely what happened I'm not a hundred percent sure okay let's see how much of this it can do then it's bringing itself down to 25 which I'm not sure about ok speeding back up again that was so strange even though it showed that you wanted to come off it just wasn't coming off for some reason so the BMW went that way which way we go in okay coaches only apparently we are now parked behind a lorry we are parked behind a lorry in completely the wrong area oh well let's go this way then shall we and try and get on to the motorway that was such a fail I can't believe how badly it failed at the end but I'm really glad that I got it on camera so that you guys could see that and you could see the issue here we go again so we come back onto the most way but because there's no lines the car itself won't actually do anything there's no one is there anyone in that Lane no good [Music]
