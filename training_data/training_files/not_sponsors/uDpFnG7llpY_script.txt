in this video I embark on a new journey to take on a brand new Minecraft challenge today I'm going to be playing Minecraft but I'm going to limit myself to only be able to walk in a straight line of course I can go up and down on this line but I'll never be able to move off the line I mean I haven't used any plugins or world borders for this so it's all going to come down to my honesty with this one but I'll have to go over and through every obstacle hill and mountain and although there's no clear objective I think the main goal is just to survive Oh also did I mention it's in hardcore mode if you go on to alright that's all let's get into the bloody video and welcome to a brand new minecraft adventure as you can see by the title today we're doing something a little different and we're gonna be doing it in a brand new world we're gonna play Minecraft but only in a straight line I'm gonna put it in hardcore mode I'm not intending for this to be a series hardcore mode can only make it more interesting I'm saying that if you guys go on to enjoy this video and actually want a few episodes of this I'm happy to do so okay so we've loaded in and immediately first thing I need a check I think since we were facing this way it only makes sense be stuck on this so we have to stay on x equals negative 70 forever we can never leave this line so yeah that's the entire idea that's exactly what we're gonna do I don't really know what my goals are I think maybe trying to build a house might try and do some caving but I don't know how that's gonna work when you know stuck on one block or else get some staying quickly we can upgrade our tools alright let's go exploring in our world I think we're gonna remember we gotta stay on this line very important that we never leave this line conveniently this tree is directly in our path Oh a cave a ravine actually I see some iron down here and I think we can get it oh yeah and that's all legal right there oh look at this is one dry keeper you kidding me oh I'm mad with that alright well that's that ravine explored carry on exploring hey the sake of the video and then dig straight through the middle of this hill who knows maybe we'll find coal something helpful oh jeez I just remember this is on hardcore mode I'm gonna take this serious I need food I regret this decision I can't oh is this gonna end it's like a dig up what we got myself into let's carry on hopefully we can find some coal I know I am oh it's such a tease oh that's some coal we can get that okay looks like we may never get one we'll know we got multiple blocks of coal here next mission we need to get some food oh don't know what the best strategy here is so many shapes down there but I can't get to them we're heading back this way food food we need food probably stop sprinting I guess seeds okay a potential farm it's not a wheat farm we have 80 years to spare yeah down here we're starting a wheat farm you know it's getting dark challenge cleared that's how we made a temporary little house [Applause] [Music] isn't it beautiful isn't my house beautiful what is that I still don't really have a clue how we're gonna end up with food maybe we should hunt for diamonds maybe that should be our mission I mean just cuz it's night time and it's hardcore doesn't mean we have to be inside we can explore Oh a spider yes good oh you're joking no string string killing a spider or a skeleton would be absolutely huge right now from either a fishing rod or a bone meal because it's like obviously food is gonna be our biggest issue I don't know why I made this dummy what do you what do you got to offer me you dropped nothing either what a joke honestly a zombie wouldn't even be that bad right now rotten flesh yes please maybe I should try breaking down trees for apples when we got an apple it worked I am big brained ha ha sweet sweet food [Applause] [Music] Oh No Oh Oh Joe Ridge in my hearts yeah the sun's coming up nice shot we just successfully beat night one night 'one of Minecraft done without ever leaving my line seriously can these mobs drop stuff some trees let's explore far this way let's go far so we can get I believe around to some animals or something for lucky that is a cool mountain peaks with our line we're here we're here we're here we our line in fact was not there but let's just ignore that for the next 15 minutes of gamplay why do i literally dig myself into holes the service oh that's a far drop that's a very far drop why do I not look cheap do this leap incentive to walk over here one shake no no please no close I should just hit it while I had the chance yeah I'm on the run laughs yeah I must be oh there are stuff up oh I stuffed up already no no it's fine get back to the original oh hi thanks for checking in I'm still a piece of garbage two more seats for the pile and now we play the rotten flesh game okay we need to fix our mistakes we don't need to fix any mistakes I'm going home just gonna wait for day time I've got bored I'm out adventuring again I've got some zombie friends on the way Oh God waiting corner buzz on bees hey did you break my farm this is actually a lot harder of a challenge than I at first imagined I didn't actually consider food as an as a challenge that creeper walked right onto my line that's food we can get it where did that go we got food yeah I don't know how I'm gonna come back from this it's maybe a dumb idea so guys we did it all right we make it atop another mountain getting very lucky with our seed so far all that chicken looks very killable oh we're getting that chicken oh hey I just realized chicken is finally an animal we can lure to him or should I start a chicken farm maybe I should just start a chicken farm I'm gonna heaps of animals for sure gain some food here for sure peak nice nice Oh what was a bit scuffed bit we got there hey nice for pork chops two mutton one rabbit yeah weight you good haha yes we got pork chop baby we have actual food buy complete luck but we have actual food and this guy give us any rare loot or anything yeah whatever [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] right my chickens laid eggs already all right now we gotta get home maybe we don't I think we should proof I'm not really interested in but spider I am alright flow it please thank you I don't get this spiders attention maybe it'll just run at me anyway come on yes give me two string or heat me off my line that doesn't count we have one string one more string and we will have a fishing rod which will be incredible for food oh don't want to be a freak Cole oh yeah then your spider boy we about to string Dylan fishing rod I'm gonna get home safely I hate this spot his attention Oh small string got two fishing rods we just need to run straight run it straight another spider oh this is our nice little string [Music] oh boy we met at home and we have a lot of junk but you know most importantly we have food we actually have food there's only one way that makes sense the end this episode off - that's to be fishing by our house oh yeah food is no longer a problem you earned a bronze medal and if we're lucky enough we'll actually fish out more fishing rods and have infinite fishing rods as well twelve seconds later oh my god okay it's not the best pretty broken but what do I say what advice to say about fishing out more fishing rods and literally like pretty much the next thing we catch is a fishing rod hey it's only the start it's only the start you know I ended up enjoying this little challenge a lot more than I thought I would I mean we didn't get heaps achieved I don't even know if it was entertaining in the end but if you guys want to see more of this stupid little idea of course let me know show your support on the video let me know in the comments and I might just come back with a part two but for now all right it's time for this videos comment question which comes from the user I want to say mimic who asks what would be your dream job and if you were to blow up on YouTube would YouTube be on main job and we've had a similar question recently but since this one actually got a few likes I thought I'd answer it so if you ever really ask me my dream job I'd have to say YouTube because it would be an absolute dream to ever do it as a job across my life I've made an embarrassing amount of channels and videos that you will hopefully never see so the idea of wanting to do YouTube has been with me for a long long time saying that though I'm not doing YouTube for the money I'm doing it because I really really enjoy creating videos and I've done it for the last 7 months now and I'm only really just seeing success and rewards now so regardless of where I get to with YouTube in the future I hope I never stop oh well that was a long answer if you have a question for me leave it down below using hash tag question and thumbs up all the questions you like below to get my attention and also I know it's a bit scuffed and light but I'm doing a 5k subscriber Q&A soon so need lots of good questions for that so go go okay let's end this video now thanks heaps for watching this video right until the end of course you know the drill if you're new here press subscribe and drop a like in the video for making it this far and also irrelevant to Minecraft that use code wads II when you get your past fortnight chapter 2 and DM me on Twitter when you do this video was made a few days ago but hopefully season 11 is heaps of fun right now and fortnight makes a bit of a comeback and yeah I hope you had an unreal day and I'll catch you in the next one Cheers [Music]
