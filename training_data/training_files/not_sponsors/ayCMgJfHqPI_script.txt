this is the new Hui on 22 2019 edition looks like last year's version but there are some nice upgrades under the hood we're taking a look at those today I more in a minute until then let's get on with the video so what do you do if you already have a pretty good product that people like well you tweak it and you put out the new version next year that's exactly what whoo Yan is done with their latest the canvas Pro 22 and that's a good thing this is a pen display it's a monitor that you plug into your computer and you could draw on it using the included pen it's big though it's 21.5 inches the screen is from corner to corner it's full HD 1920 by 1080 pixels and it has a pen with 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity a lot of folks asks in these videos if this can be used without a computer the answer is no it needs to be plugged into a computer it also needs to be plugged in the wall for power so it's not really portable and since it's so big it's a little heavy when you open up the box everything you need to get started is included here there's the stand and all the stuff that you need to attach it to your display got a little baggie with instructions warranty even a cleaning cloth a box with all your cords an HDMI cord all of your power cable stuff your USB cable even an old-school RGB cable if you need it I didn't use it I just use the HDMI cord the pen a fancy pen holder and a drawing glove like I mentioned before this product looks identical to the one that came out last year same case same buttons same inputs the biggest upgrade here though is the display which is now bonded that means they have reduced the distance between the glass that you're drawing on and the screen below it this leads to far less displacement of where your cursor appears when your pen touches the screen even along the edges of the display I found that the pen can be pretty accurate and older displays the further you got from the middle of the screen the more offset your cursor would be this is something many people refer to as parallax and it really decreases the accuracy of your pen so in a nutshell what do we have we have a display that is far more accurate than last year's version now Wacom has been doing this for a while on their displays but what we're seeing now is some of these bonded or laminated displays as they're often called rolled out to some of these lower-priced manufacturers most of these laminated screens have becoming in smaller display tablets over the last year or two we're talking about the 12 inch 13 inch 16 inch versions but this size 21.5 inches this is a big step up in size there is another 21.5 inch displayed that I've seen a laminated screen on that's the Pablo Mass 22 which I used earlier this year and if you're wondering how did I miss that review don't worry you didn't I didn't make a review because I never actually got that one to work so as far as I'm concerned this is the only 21.5 inch budget-friendly laminated display tablet on the market right now the canvas pro also boasts an etched glass screen so it's not glossy gives the screen a little bit more texture when you're drawing on it I prefer this to drawing on a slick glossy screen feel like it gives me a lot more control when I draw in fact I like the feeling I'm drawing in this kind of texture so much that I end up putting screen protectors on many of the devices like my iPads or Android tablets that have a slick glass glossy screen I do that in order to simulate this kind of feel now the downside with these kind of screens is that any texture on a screen is going to reduce your clarity a little bit it's going to refract the light that each pixel produces this is going to create slight graininess when you look closely at the screen it doesn't bother me and in general it's a trade-off of more than happy to make for that increased control of drawing but I bring it up because I've gotten comments from some artists that this sort of thing it drives them nuts especially if clarity and super accurate colors are important to you the colors on this display I've seen a boost to now there is a 120% srgb gambit compared to last year's only 100% we also get a faster response rate going from 14 m/s all the way down to 8 m/s one thing worth noting here is that this is only an HD screen that's 1920 by 1080 pixels pretty standard for this kind of display at this price point but at the same time it's it's worth noting that if you see this on a 12/14 even a 16 inch display you're taking all those pixels and you're mashing them down to a smaller area when you blow it up to 21.5 inches you can definitely see pixels it doesn't look nearly as crisp essentially since we're used to looking at our phones which have a much higher density of pixels on them the jump to 4k is the next step for displays of this size right now it's just a trade off what we're doing is we're reducing the quality of our screen so we can save a lot of money on the cost of the product now I talked about the enclosure it is the same enclosure that we've had for several iterations on this tablet this is the third one I've reviewed that looks identical to this so if you see this on Amazon or wherever you're buying it make sure that it has the 2019 in parenthesis next to the name I don't mind them using the same case again because we get a ton of hotkeys there are 10 hotkeys on each side of the display and a touch bar on each side as well of course all of these keys are customizable so you can jump into the settings and plug in any shortcut you need you can use this slider slash touch bar in the middle to zoom out quickly or increase or decrease your brush sizes one thing that happened that I never really noticed before when I was reviewing the other tablets is that my palm would often brush along that touch bar and accidentally zoom me in or zoom me out you can jump into the settings at any time turn off the touch settings altogether but you can't turn off just one touch bar like the one on the right you have to turn them both off at the same time like I said before this isn't something that I noticed last year when I was using it it might just be the weird angle I was drawing at so you don't see my big ol head blocking the camera while I was drawing we are ready to talk about the pen I just learned to use sound effects I'm so sorry let's read some of the numbers off the back of the box shall we 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity 60 degrees of tilt it's made of plastic that's actually not written on the box just an observation on my part except the grip the grip is rubber it's a nice solid pen it's the same pen that Hui has been putting in all their latest generation displays the pen is no longer one of those plug in charge up jobbers is now completely battery free this is not only more convenient but it also comes with some drawing improvements as well it also comes with a pen donut like all of hue ons current products and inside that you're gonna find some extra dibs and even the tools that are gonna help you yank them out and replace them the initial activation rate on this pen is improved it's it's not quite as sensitive as walk-ons but it's getting closer the initial activation rate is how much pressure you have to put on the pen before it leaves a mark your tablet you don't want it to be too stiff especially if you're a light sketcher here I found the pen line to be it was fine so let's dive into the nitty-gritty let's do a pen test and see how this thing performs first thing I usually do once something is set up is I just start drawing on it and I just try out the pressure and see how it is I try drawing like the lightest lines possible and then slowly apply more pressure just to see how the pressure curve works and overall the pressure curve is very nice which is exactly what I expect from who yawn it's not blowing out like in the middle range or when I'm drawing super lightly or anything like that it holds pressure well which is what you look for in a good pen the next thing I look for are just fast strokes like what's happening when I draw really fast how are the ends of strokes doing how the beginnings of strokes doing we're not getting any check marks here which you'll often get kind of at the bottom of strokes we do get a tiny bit of shoestring going on here where at the end it's it's trailing out a little bit when you're drawing really really quickly I'm usually not drawing lines that's super fast so it's not that big a deal usually I'm kind of a little more controlled with it but that should be something you're aware of is that little shoestring at the end of the lines next up are our line tests and this is a slow angled line and this is usually where the wave or the jitter of a pen is going to come out and so you just draw a slow angled line to see if you can see any of that I can tell because I've used a lot of these these look like pretty organic lines though so it's a very subtle wave those lines do not look good to them at a weird angle for filming this so I'm gonna grab my just say no to drugs ruler and I'm gonna do my slow angled lines with a straight edge because that's going to give me a better idea if there's any kind of uniform wave to the pen or anything like that let me do that with a little bit of a harder pressure and so it is really subtle and this is something that who yawns pens have become better at I could definitely see it here and there in this pen there is kind of a little bit of a uniform wave happening it is so subtle that I bet a lot of people aren't going to notice if you're doing really really clean pen lines that's probably something that you're going to pick up from time to time if you're going around a curve you're gonna say that's more wave than I expected but by-and-large for this kind of budget-priced display that these lines are very good I would is if you use the links down below and the code brad colo i want to touch on the stand because this is something Hui on and other Cintiq alternatives do pretty well Wacom charges a lot for their stands or they just have little legs on the bottom of their displays which aren't quite good enough in the box you're gonna get a really solid stand it even includes the little tools you need to screw it in so you don't have to search your entire house for a Phillips head screwdriver just me y'all know where you keep your Phillips head screwdrivers at all times ok cool cool you can set this thing at any angle you can even pull it up to almost 90 degrees and use it as your monitor in fact this size I've got a lot of people who have this display use it as their primary monitor when they're not drawing on it the stand is an elegant like those argotron arms that have super smooth hydraulics but it does exactly what it needs to do which is get your display at a comfortable angle to draw at one thing worth noting is that at its lowest angle it gets pretty tippy once it gets about thirty degrees or above its rock-solid below that the bottom of the screen is no longer resting on your desk and it's just not really well balanced I've mentioned the settings before and I find in general that the settings in the software have gotten better on who Leon's displays over the last couple years the overall interface is improved bullion's using the same settings across all their devices even the same drivers across some of their devices this is an area though I would love to see them push forward Wacom does this sort of thing really well for example in Wacom setting you can set up your shortcuts for different apps so if I jump between Photoshop to illustrator I can set my hotkeys specifically for those apps so I don't have to jump back and forth between the settings it's not a must-have but man it'd be nice now to the pros and cons what's good about this tablet what's not good about this tablet the pros we got to talk about the screen obviously there's a big improvement here it's great to see a laminated screen and a pen display of this size this this really is the big improvement it's almost 22 inches so having this much room to draw is it's really nice especially at this price point the pen quality is good and overall my feelings here are just that that that this is a good product it is not a great product it's a good product and there's nothing wrong with that and like I said when you factor in the price it's a good value our biggest cons have to be the driver side I usually don't bring up the drivers because some people have no problem with drivers other people have a lot of problems with the drivers it can be really hard to tell if there's really a problem going on there if it's just me being dumb with technology my general rule is that if I can get it to work then I'll give the manufacturer the benefit of the doubt and all all these drivers don't give me as many problems as who ian has in the past but the one thing that I did kept running into in the time that I was using it at least on the Mac is that the pen on the display just stopped working if I didn't use it for a while it was pretty easy to fix all I had to do is reboot my computer and it worked fine but I had to do that twice in the three or four days that I was using it which seems a little excessive it's a little thing it might be a Brad thing and no one else will experience it but I'll bring it up as a con ultimately if you're looking to upgrade to a larger size or you just need something with more space in it this isn't a bad place to look if you can't afford to spend thousands of dollars to buy something that walk-on makes an overall there's absolutely nothing wrong with this product I mean the pen is good the screen is good the lamination is great it's just that nothing really rises above that that level of good and ultimately it's a measure of how much you're spending for what you get and I think you're getting something good for the amount of money that you're spending thanks for watching you may have noticed I'm changing my setup around a little bit I've gotten some new desks I've gotten some new places to film I'm probably going to be doing a tour but not on this channel probably be in my email newsletter so if you want to subscribe down below check that out probably coming in the next couple weeks so they've got some more stuff to do in here before I do that anyway thanks for watching and I'll see you in a couple days [Music] you
