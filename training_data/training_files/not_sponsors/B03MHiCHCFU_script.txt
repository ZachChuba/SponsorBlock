all righty folks welcome back to another episode of RL crafts as always brought your first month of server hosting through them and all is pretty fancy so what up I just organized inventory a little bit in the last few minutes before we started you do anything since last time I run I went ahead and I made a an ironic with the remaining 5 ingots in there because my existing helmet looking a little worse for wear my existing chest plate still looking worse for my existing boots looking worse for wear I might take these diamonds with us here real quick and that way I'll be able to at least make a new couple of boots so you you didn't say we were thinking maybe we'd go and try a different place yeah so you were saying there were a lot of comments about whoa I'll go check out this tower thing that you bypassed we were thinking it might get a bit redundant if we just do the dungeon thing again and again and again because it'll probably take a while to clear this thing so you know the way I don't actually remember where said tower was located because I feel like if I'd seen it I would have gone there right put down the crafting table real quick though I just realized a canteen it'd be great do you still have a canteen I do my canteen is is popping off and I got 9 charcoal filters on me it's going well ok and yeah there's apparently a a tower I mean and I do remember seeing it that is quite interesting in someplace else for us to try and demonetized okay for us to ourselves do you monetize oh I did a dumb though and I I would need my sleeping bag that would be a good idea so that we can end this night time of insanity and end this nightmare although I feel like we're at this point nuts nope terribly poorly equipped to handle night time do you happen to have a sleep on you as well I do okay there's a lot of stuff coming in the door so I mean I guess I could block up the door no I don't have blocks porch all right well I'll just sleep right here there we go you don't feel tired enough to sleep oh yeah there are a few there phew oh boy whoa why are there so many freaking zombies jeez Oh God Oh I almost pulled it you almost pull the year I almost pulled it you I'm so sorry about that Oh God what is what constitutes almost pulling a me you know dude let's you don't remember okay that's fine you do yep okay we're fine so I tried to do my best to get you or maybe let's uh let's just go through out let's just let's just remind my god what hazards like some kind of event Oh actually there is an event there is an event um it as soon as I got on it told me that um something about poop I'm not even kidding it was late that the poop event has begun oh good yeah been waiting for that it's my favorite event why don't I feel tired enough to sleep yeah wait can you not sleep during the poop event I'm not kidding that's the only difference since last time man I thought I had a bag but I don't I thought I did but I think we lost it with that last D monetization the a bag the sleeping bag oh okay I guess we're waltzing away at night then all right yeah sounds good sounds good how do we go my my goal is to have you hey it's daytime anyway we're good instead of me all right so where are we going so we go this way back to the Waypoint or we could actually oh no we can't we don't have way stones right I was confused I mean if it is like at the Waypoint though we could take a quick trip back home so I could get some new armor pieces but otherwise I don't know if it's Oh however it also helps a little bit at the moment and right here thank you surface iron okay well okay um so allow us to continue heading in the general waypoint direction I've made this run twice maybe three times only only that many times yeah no more no more definitely no more than that looks like it's become winter ish again fortunately it doesn't seem like I'm getting SuperDuper cold out so that's good oh I did forget to bring the insulating stuff there's a little bit more iron over here as well if we want to see yeah really quick the weight point is just to the left I believe I is it problematic that I forgot to bring the insulated gear or were probably what is that what's up oh it's just a quill beast okay it was just looking at me wrong gotcha was it a strange angle are they are they bad when I arranged yes shoot spines that you exactly that's exactly what they do there well not anymore they don't oh god we are out here just crushing it anyway I did forget to bring my cobblestone which oh well not terribly difficult to find all right I'm following your lead wait wait I see a tower over there is that what you're talking about no but that is a structure I didn't notice it I didn't notice that but we are gonna check that out later on okay okay so the weight point is right around here ish fire we don't want this do we we don't want this do we okay so you want to go that other structure let's hit that way okay oh god that's that sounds like bad news never seen one of those before but they don't seem good don't seem very good don't they they don't seem good that was a that was a dragon just out wandering okay Wow does that happen often I don't know all right oh hey you know what I I did actually see in the level ups which could be kind of useful is there is a little ability what would you do I just blocked that skeletons arrow and said not today sir nice so there's a little thing over here where if you go into the defense there's this skill called undershirt and what it allows you to do is every 10 seconds there's a cool-down I guess taking a fatal blow if your health is above three hearts will reduce you to half a heart instead of D monetizing you that sounds good that would be nice that sounds really good and I just got it congratulations how do I mean do you feel different we'll see I will probably feel different if there's a risk of getting demonetised at some point anyway there was a spawner in here I destroyed it but there's probably no and different one up here but it's not actually spawning anything so that's pretty cool oh this is nice chase that is very nice chase very nice chest yes is is pretty good I would have to say and a flame book okay all right not that long baby book yeah you gotta love a flop wait flambe one day I was being fancy you were being flamboyant not terrible actually I'll give it to you ah dude well that was a pretty easy one to conquer right there yeah we have just us and a dragon between yeah so I what do we do do we flank that position what's the approach here you're the one who's intimately familiar with dragons so you know I mean they yes regenerate me thank you you're not doing well I mean I just had I bought some skeletons and had taken a little digging shape if she'd hold still oh I'm so close I only have one more level to defense 16 and then I can put these diamonds - Oh buddy I don't like it I don't like when you happen that's a big boy that is a real big boy though that's the goal that's the golden yeesh yeah what up dude freaking only only dealing half a heart of damage a Hugh wish you were better than that noob Oh God really need a new chest plate super badly bounced out dragon dragon I see fire off in the distance that but uh dragon I just tried to make a furnace with a two by two oh yeah no it doesn't generally work though okay it's right to there he's right to there I do not know if this is safe space or not wait is that - oh wait there's a Hippogriff and a dress Oh God that where's the Dragons where's the dragon I don't know that's not the dragon that's a Hippogriff no no no no no where - dragon is around somewhere oh yeah no no disagreement that there's a dragon around Moreau what is this some frickin Game of Thrones yeah okay that's the Hippogriff whose fire our Hippocrates chill I think they're chill okay is that did the dragon just incinerate something into a skeleton I don't know what that is and that's the fire kind of seems to be following that around bro it's actually causing like leaves to fall off the trees this is gnarly okay there's another fire guy right over here okay wait did you pick up the curtain - yes I got it okay whoa oh okay I thought that was a dragon fireball or something get out of here brother bro this guy thinks he can deal them down this dog you can get you wish go hood down here oh what's that one hit willing D monetization yeah what I thought okay we good I am going to try to follow on you and be very scared of this air okay so you have the stuff no this is this is a Dragon Nest right here what the heck wait what how we even here is sad no wait they can just up here oh I got another diamond that's pretty cool manuscripts bone Oh dragon straight about me yeah we don't wanna seeee he's he's out of he's out of aggro range he's like oh he is not out of agri range I don't believe any of what I had is recoverable no is it really like this that just vaporized well no ice it's there but I don't see how we're gonna get there without participating okay kind of rounded stuff right okay so that is fine we're okay I hear winglets oh it's there he's there oh I don't have much to lose so I mean yeah go for it I guess you might as well might as well he seems to have indicated no no no all right all right he is no longer indicated he's no longer indicated he's turned off his blinker all right I believe in you and if this doesn't work then you can go home and it'll be fine if this doesn't work then you can go home okay with you I believe in you I feel like gravestones wouldn't be um yeah okay no he I literally jumped in it was just like fire like not even not even they I picked it up and and then died so you want me to go home and do what are you scared of sleeping berry if yeah if you want to just go home now and sleep asleep yeah on the on the plus side there's some spare item is back in our it a little dungeon so what would you like me to bring house a hoe iron would be kind of cool yeah yeah I've got iron at least a two that would be would be nice I would take that otherwise I'm gonna try to farm up little bit of levels here so we get to enough to allow myself to get to Diamond tier and then that would be a glorious and then we try not to get D monetize by a dragon I guess and go to that tower so do you know where the tower is now that you've been back home a couple times yes we we cut now over it we're in a different areas so okay so we're not actually of course gotcha but that's that's good then because it means we don't have to go through the dragon right right right and I have diamond booties yeah dude oh wait do we have any diamonds back at home yeah we have 15 diamonds oh do you want me to bring yeah yeah yeah let me make a diamond chestplate instead that sounds even better dude that sounds even better this is yes this big plays out here let's do that diamond jail a big boom oh and it's it's normal it didn't subtract anything from me so that's good you want to see where I was at on my iron chestplate check it safe durability zero yeah okay yeah I was i cutting it a little bit close there yeah it's a little bit closer alright so are we going back to the weight point the tower thing that's right fortunately not where the dragon is located yes alright so yeah I'm not crazy go away it's a good place to go home it is it is actually just the exact opposite direction how how did we because I think we came from this direction initially under trees or something yeah maybe notice oh that is uh that's a real big boy though no kidding everybody was like go take that tower and make it your base it's much better than what you've got it's probably not a bad call honestly okay we got it what it is armor state these are rubber stands this is he mill when gold is give you armor what the heck bro well let's leave it out here to start with I guess and I'll just just break your way and is that a gold block I might I might need to yeah I might need to do that I have it I have a stone pickaxe oh go for it yep that's a block of gold um wait what the wait we don't want to we don't really like there's gotta be an entrance right like why are we just breaking everything because I want to get it yeah why don't we just walk around it if this is gonna be our there isn't it just we're on the bone oh my god bro look it's a beautiful entrance and you're just breaking it all beautiful I was just breaking it off oh it hasn't and that what the heck dude this could be totally our new home this is sick right why is this just here for us I don't know but it's got empty rooms and everything is just waiting for us to move what Oh nope nope a couple skele bros in here yeah oh my God look at the storage I didn't see is there like a downstairs or something now okay and wait is there oh that was just those are skeletons who were here naturally huh wait is there like that basement with a lot of storage or something no it was just on the main floor no this place is the best there's nothing but just big rooms oh that's kind of cool oh there's a bed in here bro this is our new house we it's so close to the way stone - we can move things so easily oh my goodness Isis I don't have torches so I have three so you know it's it's going well so far but dude it's really cool you put a torch on this and it like illuminates look remains illuminated I actually I don't know I guess you could break one but I don't know if it shatters or not it is a redstone lamp oh I didn't maybe that's a special thing with the mod no it's just because there's redstone next to it so they're just lamps maybe you have to apply a redstone signal order to turn them on ooo it updated them it updated on my gotcha there's literally blocks of redstone zombie yeah you know I get what you're then get your shadow it's just a block updated them yeah okay yeah we you just need to bring some torches there's a block of emerald in the floor here it's kind of cool oh there's a dude there's an interior farm up on the roof how fancy is that you don't even have to worry about getting snowed on and stuff bro wow this is where it is at eat this guy out here it's our house now dude you get out of here this this is sick oh dude this is this is new home for sure this is the best place we've had and it's because we didn't you didn't build it yeah yeah oh wait a minute that's the oh we just need to block update everything yes what I've been doing oh oh I did a dumb what what did you what did you do I not block updating everything there we go so we I'll just I'll just go through and everything unit yeah or something oh yeah torch would be a good way to do it why good thing I used all my torches but you could put down just an unlit torch which I don't have I don't have let's just go down and snag the torches that I have been placing all over the place thinking like oh this will be good this will this will help with the light not thinking oh let's just lock up the situation yeah what oh my god oh my oh diamond god oh my god oh my goodness dude we need to just repair this floor that's our that's that's what qualifies us is like making it our own as you know just yeah third floor clearly it's abandoned because the floor was left behind yeah they're perfectionists here did yo okay this this is good good times great times out here yeah somehow we have to figure out how to do this without you know having all the sea lanterns and stuff because we definitely don't have ceiling rings so mmm what even what do you can block is this let me go check it out it's hard to tell what the texture packs there's a stone brick oh it's just chiseled okay oh look at this hey man hey man for when you get your defense up there you go my dude also I got some enchanted iron leggings for you if you'd like just so you can have the nice nice alright I was talking about it over here oh nice nice um yeah I have that's my contribution I have a lot of kala stone there we go let's pet it I believe in you you can do it oh yeah nice easy other than the other than the paralysis thing but easy otherwise okay yeah a little bit of dirt just to fill in because we got a little bit of overhang right there that doesn't seem good for the structural integrity to have it just hanging off of the edge right there and we just need a little bit of cobblestone and yeah we should be good or so Phil you do that do you want to do the run like all the way back to our main home or maybe one of us should do a run and we can use the backpack as well I'll run back to the storage area by the dungeon either way you can go to the dungeon and I will go assuming I can find where the way stone is again you like me to point you in the direction of waste I have lost all sense of direction ever okay something about this I just don't have you bed um can you meet me here and I will I'm right outside the house no it's over this way it is over here waste on these of this way I have an impeccable sense of direction your sense of direction is impeccable I hope that I know where the dungeon is though I can get to the dungeon pretty easy from here ya know I kind of I kind of figured as much I mean if you want to if you want to be the dungeon go-getter feel free there's some stuff in the chests yeah sounds good oh and it stays rendered that's pretty cool oh and it's all illuminated and stuff like that that is nifty I am like a little little dirt column just to shows us the DeRay this is the way general direction alright well I guess I will go right well you'll do the home retrieval cuz you know the way back without a doubt oh it's all wintery over here oh very interesting okay I'm gonna make my first run I've got a pretty pretty full inventory just to remember how I actually pick up the backpack is the question it's empty hands shift right-click several times and it takes a little bit to get the do I recall wait held it no come on man you can do this I'm tribal even you oh no I think it's it shift left click no yes what no no I don't know Frick way I got this to work before it's one of the two okay it's it is shift left click but it was being weird about it alright we got it now let's hope that I don't get demonetized well no we're in a freaking chess plate but at least I have the rest of diamond armor whoa alright Oh actually I probably should have brought given you a backpack but anyway which one is it Marsala mum that's what it is it was that one direction marshal laminar Manor Marcille Eminem Eminem Anna okay I think I think it's mostly restored other than I guess I could put a couple stone bricks out here we want to do that real quick stone bricks could be good Oh tie in the whole aesthetic but otherwise the floor is all repaired and all we need is some glowstone and then it'll be completed completed it'll be work complete as you like to say work complete the stone bricks and then what was it for these pillars again those pillars is his old stone blocks so we need it we would I mean it's just as easy to make put its stone block just just regular stone block and then chiseled that's easy that's easy peasy lemon squeezy you do there we go and yeah now it's all set everything's perfect other than the glowstone and that one chiseled stone piece but we can't handle that yeah so I guess it's not actually as different it's different there isn't chisel here so you take the stone brick turn into slabs and use that and then you get the chiseled stone brick and then boom that's how you do it didn't even need to make a chisel all right this crap recipe super fancy okay the only thing we are missing is sea lantern which is I don't how we're gonna get that going to come up anytime we get glowstone dust on occasion ya know I could I could actually we do have some glowstone dust back it away glowstone is also really useful for that's how you make the permanent torches oh okay so yeah maybe we don't really want to just use it for that we could break all the glowstone in our newfound location and just use it for permanent torches that we then have to use to relight this whole place so yeah maybe ribs redstone lamps is yeah it'd be an ambulance basically just exists so you can toggle them on and off which it's what happens dude it's what I mean they look a lot better than basic glowstone I don't know how close I don't know the basic glowstone looks pretty nice with this texture pack size being quite insane the is it just the yellow like the kind of a yellow brick yeah it's the oh we oh yeah that's right the red stuff these are redstone lamps duh forgot about that they just weren't updated um are you gonna make a farm out here is that the idea I don't have an idea beyond just okay I'm doing stuff idea okay you know kind of leveling out the area leveling is like you know my default pad so there's all this stuff some trees but do I have a plans my quest yeah dude actually we wear my diamond shovel go I could've sworn I have that it there's a bunch of andesite and a little bit of a structure that way the way I'm facing hmm oh yeah I got you it might just be a spire or something yeah I just want to like the surface iron style deposits I'll go check it out real quick dude I'll let you know if it's some interesting if it's an entrance to a super sick dungeon bro that's it I got terrified that there was a dragon over there there is a noose hanging by our base which is always nice they seem to kind of stick around right it's ya know I mean we we never not only did we not lose any before we seem to be gathering them slowly they're like three or four by the time we left the other place so there's a ton of cows and a mushroom there's a bunch of sheep over here as well so it would be good I'm sorry not cheap my bad my bad pigs they look the same definitely yeah they're very so I have a very good source of wool at the moment so sheep might be a nice thing to find it's a water elemental oh wow I just find a desert temple I think I might've just found a desert temple alright sorry a jungle temple found a couple pumpkins and some walls Oh gimme gimme these freakin harami so you dispensaries there's a deer oh that's what I like dude oh oh I hear a grew somewhere that sounds gruesome I'm out in the Sun and I just hear a GRU breathing at me I didn't even appreciate what I said here a groove somewhere gruesome come on dude that was quality those repurposing your words in a form of wordplay that was pretty glorious how could you God look at our home do we we made that we we made that made that look at this the best time we've ever had in any series and is because is because we made that dude I'm just looking at it like ones who updated that proud of our work there dude proud of our work tower I know it is with the balconies dude that's like that's got to be a pretty cool person who was able to like put that thing together I can't believe we made that yeah I can't believe it either okay I almost don't believe it all right well I don't know if there's anything imminence that we must hurry could be a timber they're called timbered mr. lumberjack that's the wrong one anyway it gets the point across should we maybe whine things down here on a happy ending a happy ending Wow yeah happy ending I only got incinerated by a dragon twice best episode yet you know but we found this I think this really compensates for all right well little money on my first month play with your friends have a good time same descriptions also gonna have a link to the playlist so you can check out any episodes that I haven't died in let's see if you can find one and then finally that's it actually I think about it you dude right yeah yeah we did you want to throw on no um we're pretty much good I guess we'll spend some time between this episode in the next one just transporting some items setting up a more permanent base here sounds like a plan see you guys
