GFRIEND's 'Apple' take #1 On the road covered 
with thorn bushes The clear footprints 
remain in blood red The cold choice Might be wrong 
Why does it hurt so much? Ooh no this sweet scent And sparkling ruby Drop 
It puts me to the test Ooh no keep tempting me Yes your scent your color Colors me Pleasure Callin' me Callin' me Callin' me The world inside me falls apart Sparkling Crystal Come come come In no time my lips 
want you in red Come & Dance with me We do a hot dance 
Stars rise inside me Clear glass bead shines in red Don't look back 
Don't think about anxiety In the sweet darkness
the witches' night comes We O wow wow wow wow We O ya ya ya ya We O wow wow wow wow We'll color all my grey choices Nothing, not a word can stop me Between the fingers and lips
the red water is running The dizzying scent leads me I like it like it more
I like it so much Callin' me Callin' me Callin' me The world inside me falls apart Sparkling Crystal Come come come In no time my lips 
want you in red Come & Dance with me We do a hot dance 
Stars rise inside me Clear glass bead shines in red Don't look back 
Don't think about anxiety In the sweet darkness
the witches' night comes We O wow wow wow wow We O ya ya ya ya We O wow wow wow wow We'll color all my grey choices When the night gets noisy 
it's irreversible anymore Open the curtains of 
the festival I've dreamed I have a red dream 
digging up endlessly The brilliant light 
of destruction soars Don't think hard 
Let go of the shy child Take me forever
The witches' night comes We O wow wow wow wow
We dance dance We O ya ya ya ya
Stars rise stars rise We O wow wow wow wow
We dance dance We'll color all my grey choices Okay, cut Great job, everyone It's over Apple Apple Please give your love
