with scordalia that's right the first
time i heard the name scordalia i thought for sure that was a viking
princess but i wasn't even close it's actually an incredibly delicious
greek garlic dipper spread made with believe it or not mashed
potatoes and not only is this a fabulous dip for vegetables and breads and things
like that it's also served as a side dish for
things like fried fish and grilled meats so this stuff's as versatile as it is
easy to make and to get started i'm going to go ahead and peel and quarter
this giant potato and while technically you can make this
with whatever potato you want i highly recommend the starchy and
absorbent russet potato and by the way according to the old
school recipes we're not supposed to peel the potato
we're supposed to cook it whole and then peel it so it doesn't absorb too much
water which kind of makes sense until you
consider the fact that most of those recipes also tell you to save some of
the boiling potato water to thin your dip out with later and
that's where they lost me and because of that i think it's just
easier to peel it in quarter and cook it like this
which we will as usual do in some very generously salted water
and what we'll want to do here is bring this up to a simmer and then we'll
continue cooking on medium until these are just tender are definitely not
falling apart but very very tender and since that's
going to take a little while we should probably multitask by prepping
our garlic paste while we wait and for that i'm going to take a whole
bunch of freshly sliced garlic like about six cloves and to that we
will add some nice coarse kosher salt at which point we'll go ahead and
pulverize this down to a paste and because of the friction those grains
of salt provide this is actually not going to take very long using a mortar
and pestle which really is the only proper way to
do this right you're never going to get this down into as fine a paste using
like a food processor or blender so try to use one of these to get it at
least this fine otherwise you're going to have to mince
it super super fine on a cutting board and then use the flattier knife to crush
it down into a paste which will work but you're going to lose
a lot of that garlic oil on the board so to summarize everybody needs to have
this tool in the kitchen and that's it once that's set we'll
reserve that until needed and we'll head back to check our
potatoes which like i said should be very tender as tested with a knife
and then once we've determined those have been cooked perfectly we'll go
ahead and drain those very well and then we'll let them sit just like
that in the strainer for about five minutes
before we transfer those into some kind of mixing bowl and then we'll work those
over with a potato masher until they're very very smooth
and yes if you have a potato ricer go ahead and use it but a regular masher
works just fine here plus i'm going to pass all this through
a mesh strainer later oh besides breaking down the potatoes
what we're also doing here is releasing a tremendous amount of steam and heat
which is good because i do not want to cook my crushed garlic which is what
we're going to add next and by adding them at this point they're
going to retain that beautiful raw sharp garlic flavor
which i think makes this dip so good right some recipes do call for roasted
garlic which is of course mild and sweet but i
don't want mild and sweet all right i want something bold and
aggressive you know like a viking princess
but anyway we will mix in our garlic at which point we'll go ahead and add some
acidity in two forms i will do the freshly squeezed juice of
a half a lemon plus a couple tablespoons of white wine
vinegar and for the record some recipes call for all one or the
other then we'll go ahead and stir and mash that in
at which point we're going to stop and switch to a whisk which we'll use to
incorporate the last major ingredients and that would be our olive oil
preferably something on the milder and fruitier side
and of course extra credit for using something from grease
and the reason we're going to use a whisk here and stir this in in like
three or four additions is so we get a beautifully smooth and
creamy emulsification all right this base mixture contains a lot of water
and as you know oil and water don't like to mix which is why we slowly whisk in
olive oil when we make a salad dressing so sort of the same principle here so
like i said we'll go ahead and whisk that in in like three additions
versus dumping it in all at once and then once that's set we'll move on to
the always important tasting and adjusting step
and that's going to almost always mean adding some more salt
which will vary of course depending on how much you put in your water
and of course you may want to sneak in a little bit of cayenne
and then we'll give it a mix and give it one last taste and if you wanted to you
could also add a little bit of herb here okay a little bit of fresh parsley would
be fine or some chives would also work and i know some people they swear by a
little pinch of dry oregano so if you want to tweak this a little
bit feel free i mean you are after all the socrates
of what goes in these but personally i like to keep this fairly straightforward
and i'm just going to garnish with a little bit of fresh oregano later
and that's it our scordalia is scored on and we could serve it just like this
which is pretty smooth but to take this up to the next level
and achieve perfect smoothness i'm going to invest the extra three and
a half minutes and pass this through a fine mesh strainer which is going to
result in something much more luxurious and by the way you people with the
potato ricer stop rolling your eyes alright we know you're better and that's
it once that's been passed and we finally understand the true
meaning of luxury we can go ahead and serve that up as a dipper spread next to
some vegetables or any other spreadable or dippable
edible things and for a little extra visual interest i
always like to go around with a spoon like this
to sort of create some circular peaks and valleys into which i'm going to
drizzle some olive oil so definitely an optional step but it is
a proven scientific fact that people love shadows
so i think you should do it and then i went ahead and finished that up with a
little bit of fresh oregano and my score dahlia was ready to enjoy
and this stuff would be amazing on like a thousand different things
but some fire roasted baby bellhouse worked especially well
and as far as the taste and texture goes i do kind of like the potato hummus
comparison even though it doesn't have that tahini
sesame flavor but the acidity and the sharpness of the garlic
along with that sort of neutral starchy base really does deliver kind of a
similar effect and by the way making some little greek
potato dipped tacos with fried eggplant ended up being a great idea and of
course no one sits around thinking i wish i was eating something on a sliced
cucumber but this stuff could change that as that
really was a fantastic combination and since there's no guests in the room
let me go ahead and double dip and then i went back and started over
with another roasted pepper which while i was eating that reminded me of that
old saying man cannot live on vegetables alone so i
decided to finish up by showing you some hot carb on carb action
oh yeah raise your hand if you're like me and the occasional mashed
potato sandwich and even though serving this with
vegetables is probably more popular it really is magnificent on bread and
like i said in the intro this is also served as a side dish for
pieces of fried fish or maybe grilled meat or grilled fish as
we've had this with grilled salmon and it really was incredible so next
time you're planning a cookout maybe keep this in mind since it's best
enjoyed a room temp which makes it very user friendly for a
picnic and other similar gatherings but no matter where you it or what
you it with i really do hope you give this a try
