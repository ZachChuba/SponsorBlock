alright folks welcome back to another episode of RL craft long time no see as sponsoring the sponsor of sponsor Ridge so so I've seen that you you did a bit of digging I need a bit of digging yes yes there was there was digging involved it's true we have ourselves similar diamonds yeah but you you were like hey look at all the diamonds and that reminded me of a sad story okay this was this was a sad story where I was out I dug up like stack and a half of diamonds and I was rich in on top of the world and I went outside and I saw a dragon and it was offline and I mean with chat was there and I was like what do you guys think like you know and they were like do it and I was like it's a bad idea they're like do it what why would you do this with the diamonds in your inventory inventory okay in my inventory however it didn't end well and I had the the dragon's eye on me and so I made a deal that I gave up all those diamonds that I had found so that I could get the dragon's eye back and so I did end up going and playing another time and getting some more diamonds so we are okay but it's like it's like about a half of as much as it should have been gotcha and you didn't find another dragon skull by any chance did you there's it I did actually go and find like a village and the nearest one I could find was like 5000 blocks away whoa yeah everybody's like just go find a village where we spawn there's not villages 5,000 so it was very what if there's one that's like two blocks in the opposite direction there's a command to show where the nearest one is we were like at some point like I had explored like hundreds and hundreds and I was like just doing a bigger and bigger circle always want to go there there's got to be some way stones along the way right oh gosh I don't even know if I still have it in my map but I can see let's let's make that our ultimate quest to get to the village we might uh let's see so it was I don't even have an XY coordinate on it I just there's a lot of ocean which is very scary and a lot of forest and several deaths and then our place let's see okay so if I grab my diamond down here right now pick leggings dude you gotta love that yeah I got those things so I have a helmet that's heavy and takes ten percent speed so if I put it in there then I put a diamond at the bottom and then I can read every role protective it does that really do much 400 it adds extra armor on top of the locational armor that's good I like a protective helmet oh now my chest plate has nothing on it what if i if i reroll that yeah it gives it something well your chest plates a little damn damage it's a little bit I could use a little bit of healing on it might be good idea big I'm thick what if I roll again you can do it as many I'm obsessed it just what's fiber armor there we go there we go I just cost you the diamonds okay we do have a lot of diamonds I just wish that we could use them and put them towards your another one of the dragons I think alright let's see make my legs pretty dope Oh what you get all protective and I feel like I should also use the diamonds to actually repair my armor too but cool heavy it's not what you want it's no what you want at all yeah extra armor is never a bad thing speedy few armor everywhere else I'm down with that okay now I'm gonna I'll use some of these diamonds to actually hair even though I really don't have enough levels to do that but you know springy leggings I can increase my jump height that's kinda cool I mean I changed it overprotective I mean it sounds cool but I'll take the protective alright should we get rolling on our incredible journey across 5,000 blocks find the thing that we have needed to find throughout the entirety of this series let's bring a furnace with us perhaps in case we need to cook additional food and grab some food although I suppose we're probably gonna find some way points along the way and we'll be fine there's no way we could not find waypoints you know unless they didn't unless we did not a chance and we should also I guess we have the resources to make those Scrolls that get us back to our stuff right a grave scrolls yeah okay alright well you know the way to where we need to go no I just oh my god right there why are you even decorated that's really cute do this it was I apparently I one of the I have treasure digging or something like that that gives you a chance of getting random stuff out of dirt when you're big so I ended up with like paintings and I was like what and so yeah anywhere you go I just checked the bottom of this place okay pretty cool pretty like what I did with the place oh yeah I mean it's it's a thick tunnel dude three wide three wide no hitting your head I was like I don't have an answer for you right now so we went ahead in the North West which is this way okay which is going right through the defiled lands okay good good sounds great do you have some wood I do not but I have an axe I can use it to chop down and obtain wood if you would like it okay I mean I just we might need boats or something not that I ever want to go okay gotcha but you know but crafting tables well I have a crafting table but if there we go wood we got axes you know that stuff we're good right I need to level up my gathering a little bit more until I can use diamond decks but well find those weights down to I'll be able to go back and forth easy and then it was like yeah that's that's never fun all right so you actually have the village like marked on that atlas is that correct yes okay and it is literally five thousand blocks it I don't know why I don't have x-ray it was very very far bro that's three miles you know what I'm happy about is the fact that it's not terribly hot or cold right now it's like pretty templates it's early spring this is a great time if we dude if we were to pick a time to find the village this at the time it's a good travel time right absolutely it's so I get what you you were so mean to them the maccas their food gives you protection or what absorption anyway show me you're some yeah well hey there's there's thing what is that ship is it a mob spawning thing it looks like it looks like a dock of some sort there's also a there's a thingy over there it's like a rock coming out of the ocean I don't know if it's of any interest and then huh it's kind of cool it's wait does that have a freaking end portal on it are you are you familiar with the what is it the Iliad Homer vaguely yeah view is that though is that where what has sirens in it that's definitely not a thing that has sirens in it don't think I've seen some thumbnail images on YouTube from RL Kraft and I believe that the sirens are there on like a rocky outpost I think sirens are just a Greek mythology in general I'm just I was talking about the story that has sirens in it not this thing I know this thing doesn't know I'm oh okay gotcha I think sirens are just like a Greek mythology general thing not necessarily only in I think they're from the Odyssey are they specifically from that was that the origination there's like dude that's so weird there's nothing in the chest what are these these are definitely end portal blocks oh it's just an enchantment table sitting here cool would have been nice if we found that earlier didn't have to make it nice up here oh we have more uh check these are all the chests empty they seem to be yes every time that I open a chest a bed breaks but yeah it's like the beds are in invalid locations I think on a top half slab of a block or something and I so you know it's not actually an invalid location I don't know why they're breaking that's really weird I'm breaking all the beds get rekt buds I don't really think I need to have all these beds so I'll just put them back red beds yeah what the heck this is so weird dude the whole thing is made from an portals oops oh oops I can build up I can fix this what did you do I just dropped in there can't really break the end for the walks you know no not a good not a good way to get out well I mean it's it we're fine now okay so shall we okay make a boat set off yeah that's all I've got is just nothing but sea between here and very far away really so we traveled about a third of the distance oh but it's all sea until then I feel like that's less than 5,000 blocks so I'm feeling very very confident far away but it's your confidence is invigorating I'm glad that you're invigorated dude that's my goal at all times is to be invigorating that's definitely a siren why is there a fish that was definitely a siren it was beckoning us in oh god that must be where they are you see over on that rocky outpost it was pulling me there dude their beauty was irresistible I couldn't resist their view tiem no I know they're too far away for rendering but apparently their reach is beyond render I I don't like it oh my god what is that [Applause] that's your freaking giant that just floated over it into the sky that's not a sea serpent with the crab bro I killed it it's dead what killed it I killed it how how even well I see it I hid in a corner and then its tail was right there but it wasn't getting to me and I just stayed really tucked away and was like nah is any of my stuff in the ocean sinking probably a fair amount of it yeah okay good good great I'm going and getting the grave scroll okay go grab some more dog stuff yeah I don't know what like some of that looks like I from killing oh I think I might over here I think I might actually have everything oh there's bandages okay cool cool I mean I've got I've got my I've got my stuff Wow yeah I don't think you're in the water I lucked out on that one I just like it I got in a lucky spot where I could kill it like that was happy I'm surprised that it really just doesn't have that much cheaper - sea serpent things oh I hit it a lot oh okay it had a lot of health you know I get it a lot I you know the one casualty has lost me food how did you lose your food I don't know I must have sunk to the bottom of the ocean which it looks quite deep yeah yeah I mean you were like hey can we go in the ocean I was like no no I'm I'm having second thoughts I tell me I've tried explaining to you the fact that the ocean is like the worst thing ever in the ever Ernest like the ocean is bad but I mean if you want to go we can go maybe we go okay we could we could be I can move around but there's we could be naked and then we go and then we find a way stone and then we make it work there's no waste there's nothing between here and there other than ocean though but so either we just hope or you I mean we have chests here we could put all of our stuff in yeah yeah yeah I'm here for sure there's stuff and then and then make it there and then we just it'll be there's no way this could go wrong okay well let's do hopefully we know how to get we know how to get back here right I either we find a waypoint or we die okay well I'll bring the crafting table just really it's really how this is gonna go down okie dokie let's do it I'm hoping that we encounter resistance otherwise I'm gonna be really sad when we end up making it there like we've done all of this stuff and we end up being totally fine just now fine yeah just keep an eye out for big things I mean really we can't do much other than just keep going for big I'll tell you if we like wait wait points or way stones on the ocean side we'll just kind of keep holding this direction because otherwise I will lose my way there's a boat oh that's pretty nifty I want that probably has spawners on it wouldn't you think when they want it we may want to revisit that I don't know what that there is an angry thing shooting bubbles but we probably want to avoid there's a battle tower all right all battle Tower Wow yeah just in the middle of the ocean all right pirate ship we'll definitely come back and we'll uh we'll see you later now we're gonna be there dude we're gonna be there so quickly so is that an underwater monument but not I don't know something's coming up on the front in front of us too so what the heck dude there's so much underwater stuff this is wild there's some sort of sea dragon thing yeah do you want to do you want to change course do you want chain no he doesn't want to change course full steam ahead this is a reaction I've got that go right go right go right [Music] no shoot it with both shoot it they don't have a bow I don't have no wait I'm punching it I'm punching it it's at 94 singing to me tell me more about it come here alright I'm punching punchy wait it's a it's not actually damaging you well I she just attacks like a normal so at this point oh so as long as you punch fast enough and well enough you're okay yes so far like eighty percent so and I mean I believe in you dude I'm just hanging out here like a sitting duck yeah yeah yeah I mean you could come in and poke it or if you wanted but it might be it might be problematic oh no I don't want to actually I know I like I took oh oh oh oh okay okay okay that's that's good nothing is rendering for me so I'm just hearing the spectating here in the commentary spectrum afar I could try and we're circling we're circling each other I'm on one side of the rock she's on the other side right and I don't like part of me wants to make a run for the boat but I feel like she can call me back at any time in the water that's bad no no this is bad Hey okay coke a bad bed off with you off with you she's like an evil face she's like a shark so oh she will dive into the water after you oh I see hold on I see what's happening I'm witnessing stay back oh my god why are you not dead you're not anyway get in your boat I don't know where it is it's behind you it's here letís face what the heck popped out baby up to did apparently Oh baby you have to right there yeah so baby attitude she liked it achieved no you you finished her and then the other thing did did the did the final blow I found my boat oh cool cool cool so you don't care about the stuff that you dropped you're just you're just you grabbed a bit early a torch okay cool cool however I did bring you an iron sword nice we need to try and remember what direction we were going it was definitely this way oh was it that way yeah it was this way okay I feel like so far if we had all our gear you didn't able to like wipe that thing at a sample app I guess so I'm questioning if we were if we were to encounter another sea serpent yeah you could lose all our gear pretty no eggs there's there's a big boy over there you can't yep there's a big boy big boy big boy dead ahead dead ahead big boy I don't I don't see the big boy dead ahead it's okay no it's no it's moved out of the way a little bit let's move down all the way he one-shot me yeah okay well good thing good thing you can just make it back pretty easily not a problem there's a sea serpent on my head yeah but I don't know if it's still there it might have be spawned yeah it's fine there's nothing these freaking things are so disappointing are you on okay you are yeah you're making you're fine so you were so concerned I lost the swords that's that's okay we'll make it I literally have nothing oh that's fine okay so it's out of the wood on this we could do that if we wanted to but I feel like I won't do much against sea serpent so let's continue it was it was this direction I believe so as long as you you have to keep orientation cuz I have no idea what direction I don't know where the village is exactly but Northwest and that's where the Sun is so was just keep just keep going okay I was always holding off so then Frank you're fine don't worry about it is this actual land though yeah this looks like land oh my goodness it's my own use we might have already it you stupid stupid stupid stupid idiot if this thing chases me out of the water and land sharks me I'm gonna be upset oh it's why I'm away ah what an idiot no what an idiot used to owl yeah what a stupid dumb dumb do slap the Jingu it's a lasted on but you know wow dude thinking you're all smart and tough we did we did you bring your sleeping power thing because I didn't no no no situation we're gonna be fine I should have brought an axe well let's hope your waystone okay well there's not much out here it it's an island now it's an island yep definitely definitely just an island dope let's get our boats back see we can sleep it off even though these are basically useless in terms of loot drops we can sleep it there we there we go there we go we slain by baby ab2 sea serpent and she's surfing well let's take these beds with us oh cool bed that's why they were breaking hey that solves that I mean it worked for me what no I'm you got a half a bet a little half bed right there dude nice half bed you know you yeah okay all right there's nothing still in here and that's the easy this is north and that's North West okay you navigating by the Stars by way of the Sun so whatever going more we were going more East than that we were noir oh no it we want Northwest this is cool what is that this looks like a this looks like his actual land yeah I would I would say there's a 12% chance of this being where we're trying to go okay cool just like that there's the that there's the like drain in the bottom of the like it's helpful okay well let's see what this has to offer hopefully a way stone there pretty good to raid if you find yeah we don't have any weapons but now is not the time there's so many things that we're gonna be passing that would just be so cool different check out did you recognize any anything like this on the way to the village on the atlas no no I I went strictly over water so we are either off to the north or off to the west okay well you know if you find a way stone over there okay big boys yeah if we if we find a way stone then we'll be able to get the Atlas and then we'll be able to see how far off we are so those are yetis whoa the violet Yeti is pretty cool do you think they're angry and I mean you know one never forget et Eddie don't forget II the yetis are dangerous dude wait is that is that actually the village I think that might be I mean it's certainly a thing oh my god noodle structures this is officially my sense of direction is absolutely impeccable from nothingness if this is the bra if we found the village I have God Tyr sense of direction is it is this what we have been seeking this is very multi-leveled but it seems village e yeah did they did they forget to do paths to connect the very very changing elevations here i'ma go down i'ma go down okay let's see we got down here dude because their structures that's for sure hey whoa dude is that a villager boy he's locked in his house and for this is very much a village I'll save you don't worry hey what's up dude freakin cartographers out here boys I got some bookshelves the bookshelf or yeah looking there's a bed and here's more books here's a chest full of food Oh food this is exciting it's a hat and it's a trumpet boy that I heard and a note blog Oh or is that a jukebox pick away the jukebox wow this then it shows a very interesting plot to settle here hey you know it goes very very high up very quickly Wow whoa yeah I don't I don't think they appreciate you judging their mountaineering lifestyle how do I even get into the I get into this thing I don't know where the door is it's pretty cold cuz the snow and everything you know that that actually makes sense alright sorry I'm gonna I'm gonna commit a sin and I'm breaking into the church no oh what's up cleric villager this is uh this is quite the entry you've built yourself here in the side of a mountain your homeboy seems kind of kind of stuck where are you what is that what is that what is that what is it what do you mean what it's supposed to be good it's supposed to be good what does it do it's like if we summon an Aegis and a I think it's Gangu together then we can make an imp yes I know it's able to summon it oh yes this is good we okay so it's like it's a friendlies yeah I think so I mean it certainly didn't attack me so but it's supposed to be like in mob and then you can combine it with other mobs and get to where you summon an in thats legit and that's legit bro look at these farming plots like what were they thinking wait what what hold on what are you guys why is chat saying down as a waypoint oh is there there's a way stone oh I see it is there a way stone I see I need to know the ages I know I need to know the ages myself then get the ages oh god this is ah me hey come here come hither mister Aegis how do I get him to come to me like it love it oh my god dude Aegis I learned I have learned where is it where's the way stone it's where I am I am down it's almost okay not see that I literally dropped her right next to it man it's good thing I wasn't live-streaming her people would be upset e spaghetti sandy find a village oh that must be a guaranteed waystone cuz this looks like this this has its own structure for it now it's called snow mountain village that's actually a really nice name from the get-go that's pretty cool alternatively I renamed it oh I was I was impressed makes a lot more sense yeah okay well let's go get our stuff and then we can come back okay okay my sense of directions why can I not selected thing why can I not leave because you're lame get rekt I'm Audi yeah you don't want you don't want that that's a death that's a scary right there that's a scary you definitely just want to reach through okay oh I almost love it see it was always I it was glitch to start off with so like it was open to lava so I walked over and I was like oh is that lava there and then I was like oh pressure plates it was a little glitch it's a skeleton we're gonna want to watch out for who no we don't wanna be here fire we don't wanna be here it's Dragon's nest you don't wanna be here okay let's go over this way instead of being there let's be over here yeah definitely I would agree I don't hear the wing flapping but we don't idea sleep have you there's literally nothing I can do right now yeah that's I mean that's the where's the oh I see them that's not where we were at previously there it seems like there's multiples which is the problem the one that was just one that was fine but this seems to be three yeah I'm maybe we I don't think we were this far west I think we were further down the coast escape oh oh I have a little bit of scape a little bit of escape hey mate okay I'm free I think I feel like maybe we were further that way okay yeah I think maybe two let's let's not let's never be here again we'll just go back down the coast of it and surely we won't run into any other terrible things and search and huff and puff and blow the house down looking for our stuff but thank you to done including this one or other also in those same descriptions you can find a link to the playlist oh that's a dragon that's a--that's a--that's-- dragon yep that's that's only worldly marginally lost we'll find our stuff next time guaranteed wait in that same link in the description you can find in the or in that description you can find a link to the playlist catch up on any other episodes where you might have gotten lost and appreciate you guys for coming out as anything you want to add to this before we died through a crispy death to a dragon um you know wouldn't even be a big deal because we'd be able to reset ourselves back to where we should be and get our bearings maybe make a new atlas uh yep that's it thanks for watching everybody and we will see you all next time bye guys [Music]
