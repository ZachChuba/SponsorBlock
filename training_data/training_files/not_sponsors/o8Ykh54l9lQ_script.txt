[Music] so yeah I I grew a bit obvious obviously this isn't just any bit by the way this is a thesis beard specifically the rule of the thesis beard is you don't shave until you hand in and I haven't been doing this for all my PhD because I I would probably like Gandalf this has been that six weeks worth of growth which I realized is kind of pathetic but this is this is just my genetics by the way I get nothing on the sides like I haven't shaved this I do like I get barely anything and it's like it just it just it just looks like I've got paint splats on my face on the side so I just I shaved those bits like this this isn't a style choice this is just what might be a does I am forever condemned to be like a Poundland dr. strange I'm still getting used to it and I'm gonna lie like looking at myself in the viewfinder now it it doesn't look like me and this is something that pixel go has said it's just like whatever she sees me it's like I feel like I'm cheating on you with a guy with a beard because Simon is not a person that has a beard and I think what this has proved is the Simon is it's not a person who should have appeared do you let me know if you like it by the way this is to split opinion on my Twitter like oh no my strobe light before people seem to either really like it really dislike it so let me know what you think I'm gonna shave it off at the end of the PhD because I'm desperate to get this thing off my face but you know if you nice to know if it looked nice or not now you might very well ask why did you do this to yourself Simon and I can answer that in a word which is curiosity I I was curious I'd never grown a bit before I grew a very creepy mustache in my final year at Oxford for Movember and if my PhD runs into November I might just shave this bottom bit off and go back to that which was you know such a killer that last time but yeah I was curious what I'd look like and also just what it's like to have a beard I had a few observations about having a beard one beard have--is there must be a word for that I don't think there is a word for somebody who just just has a beard I think a hirsute is probably the closest thing just on who is hairy see ya beard hammers of the world how do you drink from cans like this is the biggest thing I found over the past six weeks everytime and it is basically every time I try and drink from like a normal wrinkle can I leave bits of my beard in it this might sound like a small problem and a little bit gross it hurts like it really hurts only rip part of your face off second point that does seem to be like a fraternity of of beard hovers as this guy who works at reception who has this as well what my friend lovingly called a toilet seat beard I think he saw me after I started crying it was just like all right so of course I was just like yeah no words being said but it's like yeah we are it's like it's like people with some bikers do this wouldn't let you pass bikers on the road if you're driving if you're riding a motorbike you're just like hey you're right same with Land Rovers people who drive Land Rovers we humans are weird like that it's like we really desire like to belong to a collective to belong to something I guess it's how like gang's form but like I feel really like I'm I'm a an initiate pseudo member of this great beard fraternity which has been cool thirdly that was definitely a nadir like two weeks in when to begin with because either thing I should point out as I did a time lapse of this beard growing and to begin with it just looks like stubble and then it obviously it grows a bit but I felt like there was a point about two weeks in where I just look like a hobo basically I look like I hadn't I just hadn't shaved because I couldn't be bothered and now by now it's like oh yeah that person is trying to grow a beard I'm not gonna say that I have a beard I think that's generous but like yeah two weeks in not good would not recommend but like you know it gets better well again I don't think this is this constitutes much better and then lastly I've learned that there are lots of weird things you can do to make your beard grow because understandably I mean look at this I was just like I've got to do everything I can to try and get something on my face and it turns out there's loads of things you can do if you exfoliate it stimulates blood flow to the face and that means your beard grows faster um certain vitamins are very important so I've been taking multivitamins exercise is important for the same reason that's like exfoliating so it promotes increases your blood flow so I've been running more then how much of a difference it's made but it's kind of weird how like for any particular thing like it doesn't matter what you want your body to do there will be a specific set of instructions some on the internet that's just like yep you need to do this this this and this doesn't necessarily mean it'll work to return to the point about curiosity though the reason I'm doing this really is because I'm doing a thesis right I'm doing a PhD thesis and the reason I'm doing that is because I'm curious about the world I guess that's that's that's the fundamental thing right I just wanted to know how the world worked so I found myself in the situation where I'm writing a 150 page document that's eating my life and ended up with this small woodland animal on my face you know it's not something that all PhD students have to do I mean like the women in particular would struggle but it's something I wanted to do and so like that's why I feel like this thing is about curiosity because I was curious what I look like with a beard and I was provided with an opportunity to justify it by being curious about the world with my thesis and when you match them together you get you get a beak wrap it amazing time that I had in Berlin and thank you for watching this video hopefully the next time you see me this beard won't be long for the world Oh dietary finish the thesis Simon [Music] [Music]
