oh boy ladies and gentlemen we've got a new series it's the first main channel for me at least modded survival series in just about pretty much a very very long time at least dedicated recorder that didn't come from a livestream zine are you ready to do RL craft I feel like we should prepare that a little bit in the this series might be one episode long it it's well I mean we get to keep trying until it actually works out right I think we gotta keep trying until we give up on life I think is how this one's supposed to work but maybe I don't know this is supposed to be very very very difficult and it is supposed to be very very different from standard minecraft like well it looks a little too minecraft for the videos that I've seen it looks pretty cool it's got some really cool mobs the chunk loading is wild but anyway I guess we should jump on the server which happens go through that link and you can experience this just like we are freezing but I I should say there's going to have to be a little bit of teleporting because it randomizes your teleport so we don't spawn together and so in order for us to kind of like get together we're gonna have to like just randomly pick one of us and teleport in and well I'm in a very cold forest looking place couple of real scary-looking boyos pretty maybe I'd say what's your coordinates but I can't actually check oh they don't exist that's good to know yes that a compass but I'm in a very cold with scary boils - so do you have a giant tower near you you can see it where some lava icy lava in the sky it looks like I also see a fairy that I'm not sure if it's an angry fairy or not wait I see a fairy he's kind of up in the sky yeah yeah yeah there's lava like are you on a kind of a mountaintop no no sweetie melting top really but what I do have is whether those things and I don't like weather ya know so here's the thing is it has random spawning oh my god lightning just struck me help oh the fairy appears to be upset with me the fairy appears to be very upset and I should leave this place at once okay alright I think the fairy is still upset with me and is carrying fire in front of it low my god okay well we weren't together yeah we might want to just do the teleport thingy potentially so I mean I don't really have a great spot but I did see a thing off in the distance so are you alive again I am alive again and in a totally different spot it looks like yeah so if we and if we end up both dying we'll end up just spawning in a new spot and having to kind of start over but the good news is that there is like leveling and crafting error and and like you can buy levels and XP and stuff like that so we will oh come now did not work it not only does it not work it works but we could have drank water no I refuse weather off in Optifine is not working I refuse I refuse this is not how we're starting it with the rain and snow destroying the video quality here okay I feel like we should give ourselves a chance and make it daytime don't you think for the start okay toggle x oh my God look at him he's got a fancy walk and stuff yes that would be a okay here we go give ourselves a fighting chance here to begin with that's good to me oh all right so it's a mod pack with lots and lots of things that are supposed to make it quite difficult to survive I assume you know once you get a start it's probably not insane okay I'm on fire I'm I'm in lava this is probably a poor thing let me go over to the water over here are you using chroma hills and sayers vibrant shaders for those people wondering what's up chroma hills and silver so this is the rotten flesh that he dropped okay so how what's the progress I wonder oh that is weird rotten flesh oh you have to right-click typically you have to actually pick stuff up or you can shift near it and it'll pick it up but it will not just automatically absorb interesting what do we want to start with do we want to get wood that thing looks angry is it not coming after you no these are these are friendly these have been friendly nails this is my this is my friend Steve I don't have we gained acceptance to Yale University by talking to this boy oh I guess that's the only so so far I haven't gotten a rock I haven't gotten anything let's try punching a tree and see what happens there this this doesn't like punch very well believe that punching trees works that's I know that it doesn't so it's simple alright you punch leaves to get sticks okay oh that's a dragon okay our dragons bad maybe maybe it's not a dragon it's to quote the guy who made the modpack dragons are blank holes right what does blank there oh that's it that looks like a mad skeleton boy we probably don't want that yeah that thing either that's the fast that mean fairy stay away from the mean fairy it will lightning you I didn't okay you you're you're wrong about that the mean fairy is is quite bad the fairy and I we have an understanding okay so I got a stick I've got like 13 sticks we're we're crushing it in the sticks yeah oh good so from there from the sticks what would you like for me to obtain we need to find some gravel then and in Flint okay so just regular gravel yeah is this that that's cobble over there okay I can see my breath so I think it's cold so how big a factor does weather play in you're quite a bit actually if you look down I'm about to go to like I'm thirsty but also there's that Center orb that kind of shows whether you'd like your general temperature and you can get too hot you can get too cold wait said you left like water to you shift and then right click but because this isn't filtered it also gives us like oh no it makes us more thirsty I mean I think you I think it's like rotten flesh kinda oh god rotten flesh for my thirst that's no good rotten flesh for my thirst bro we need I don't even know what gravel looks like with this texture I know I know that's that's one of my biggest complaints of texture packs but I figured like if we're gonna do this yeah well you can recommend the settings I agree it looks very pretty whoa dude there's this really cool effect I don't know if it's SIL ders it does it let you go under and hit the water and it makes it blurry for a moment you go back up but it takes a second to focus it's really cool I know it is but it's really nifty is that gravel that's gravel okay okay what is gravel it's this some kind of brown rocky stuff oh okay I would not have guessed that at all actually but now that I look at it that looks very gravely oh there's there's a big giant hairy right there okay that that could yeah looks like a mean ferry once again so we need to get Flint right so I got one Flint whoa the placing is weird so I think then we do remember like the like like an other stuff where we do something to sharpen it like beat it against a rock the flaked Flint thing yeah yeah but if this doesn't appear to be flaking I can't remember maybe are you left clicking or right clicking I'm actually kind of doing both I'm just giving it the old left and the right clicking clickety click and not getting much of anything hmm oh I have flint shards I soaked it I can't get flint for the life of me doesn't have to begin to rock I don't know no I I don't know how I got the Flint I was just digging up gravel and I get ended up with one alright so Flint chard is useful for the knife which I can combine with a stick let's try that give me the Flint shard I keep I keep starting the break on blocks it's very interesting I don't know if that's how it works strange I it didn't it wasn't the wall but as soon as I started it like down like at the ground then it just was a creek oh I don't know did you hold it or you were just doing individual left clicks I was literally I'm trying to show you that it's not gonna be very effective but I was doing left right left right left right left right just repeatedly oh and oh you right-click it on the ground okay okay there we go Flint shards so how would you make a knife it's just a stick and the Flint shard okay cool so I don't have any more sticks and the Flint knife allows you to cut grass so you are now your own lawn mowing service what what what scared you also if you hold the stick apparently it you get the debug information so I recommend not only sick wait when you hold it just a regular stick yeah when you're holding a stick and you hit things then it gives you debug information on the block you hit oh nice that's helpful oh let's uh let's take out as um brother I get right oh my god that is the best punching sound effect I'm so satisfied by this and then I should be able to make a hatchet like now that I have yes okay so with a flint hatchet I believe I can now cut wood but beware the tree will they fall right on you and it will kill you if it falls on weight really Oh timber wait so does it doesn't give you lots of wood is it oh that's frickin sweet I got three of them how many do you get it you got all of it we got three we have three wood out of the entire tree what the heck wait okay I need the hatchet though so plant fiber goes into plant twine or what is it so plant three plant fiber can make plant string where does my plant fiber but why did my plant fiber disappear I had plant fiber and then it went bye-bye I've got two right there did you think plant wait word I literally had in my inventory just disappeared how would I have taken it from you're like yes this is mine now bro I don't know apparently I don't meet the requirement to polarity a birch cat is that what it's called there we are okay yeah nice dude it's time to cut so oh there's some stuff over here it's like where's I go well so one of the things that they talk pretty heavily about in this is that it's have it like exploration is very encouraged and in fact almost required in some ways and they're like basically like look you're not gonna have time to get everything you need and build a shelter and everything so your best option is to find someplace to be and like that's already existing what you mean you're not gonna have time but we see a sass point he's a fast way get back get back get back dude that puns down though I know isn't that sick rotten flesh delicious I owe ya no that's what I was saying is there's a well over here dude the sound of it it's just kind of cool wonderful we should go actually we should probably make a pickaxe before we try to do that I don't know how to make a pickaxe let's see pickaxe I assume there's a flint one yep Lindt pickaxe okay it's a lot of stick some string and a lot of it but we need a crafting table first all right crafting table I assume crafting table is easy peasy lemon squeezy right oh what'd you get paper from wood excuse me wood birch wood makes paper oh so we need to find a different kind of tree no we need to make planks what but what do you do what do you mean make planks nice planks I'm trying to figure it out but you need to make point actually let's do it and I he didn't show it in the video but he know I'm just sitting here standing here going man it is not picking this up to save my life uh oh you can right-click it down what and oh we've shift right wait what how are you doing this I don't know did you do okay I was just right clicking just right clicking it might have any shift right clicking but it took oh it has to be on the top it has to be on the top face oh there we go okay so I'm actually pretty good on food I haven't been running many places so okay and then can we make a regular we you make a crafting table hey there we go now it's pickaxe time boys I don't have that much clintus yeah I need I need to break more gravel I don't like that it's nighttime now no it is not the desire by thing ideally uh come here so we're counting to that distance if you can see oh there's a tower over there there's a giant oh my god we won over there I I think I think we should go look because it's gonna be nighttime and the bad things are gonna come did that drop did you get it oh there it is it's taken him over there yeah well uh off the chat with him about I I do have to kind of like give them are you what are you oh your Pig okay I did you know the jump is like huh huh huh oh I do have to give em CPA chasm credit though like we decided to kind of do this like last second and they they like oh those trees are alive what where did you go I'm just collecting more plant five minutes I'm being attacked by trees there are their ents from Lord of the Rings oh my god the trees are alive with the sound of music I I don't wish to Frank I gotta go across the water I'll meet you in a moment I don't think the trees can swim haha I've got a squid get rekt that squid rekt trees ah there looks like a bad thing on the way to the the place I wouldn't recommend running into the thing it's a very tentacley being I see one of those kind of scary oh crap what the heck is that I don't like any of this I don't like there's a fire there that's why I don't know what that is but I don't want whatever that tentacle thing is dude do you see the tent they're like multiple tentacle boys everywhere I see them I see them trust me there are tentacles everywhere it doesn't okay I got a zombie on me but I am at the tower yeah I'm coming closer spawners in the tower oh so the tower doesn't seem like a good decision then no but breaking breaking spawners is actually pretty a pretty good thing what is it here there's like a lot of there's a lot of smog here ya know we're in the wind the fog or in the fog in the fog I need any other night um where hello I shall stab you oh dear dude I need more Flint this is a crisis we need it to be daytime and also I believe I'm freezing oh yeah I'm very I'm snowy we should we should go back to the not snowy and smoggy okay place might be a good idea why does gravel not like to make flint oh no zombies I'm back on about all weather clear 9 million this move there's a Flying Spaghetti Monster yeah do we I mean we could slowly dig into the mountain I suppose the number you've entered is too thick yeah what what are we going I think I'm just taking damage I don't think this is this is my home now I'm a very cold boy right now my entire screen is going to this doesn't seem good this seems bad oh okay well you can't punch the rock it turns out so what are we what do we do about this how do we be alive wait do we there's this way if we can survive okey we stand next to lava yeah where's it but there was a lot Oh God made mistakes hell what that I'm in a cobweb no that zombie threw a cobweb what that's not allowed that's illegal we was a llama back over here yeah there was a rat around the side that's where we started what is hurting me something's hurting me a lot you you you drowned my gosh um I see aurora borealis and it's amazing I'm sorry that you drowned that's it you might wanna TP back to Bay teleporting stuff yeah it's gonna be that if we both died then we start new if otherwise was just one of us then we return to the previous I think that'll be our rule because otherwise it's gonna be impossible for us to ya figure stuff okay no no these frickin watch out behind you watch out behind you yeah yeah yeah I did I did we got a lot of sticks and stuff so okay we need to find ourselves some frickin lava bro I think it was up here and just around the corner right maybe I remember okay I think yeah because we don't have that we don't have a snowflake anymore in the center orb the blue orb that shows your help was a sheep over there that's right you like it my really approach it then I would get killed I got so as soon as we know this is Oakland right here as soon as we travel yeah that this is all gravel right here that's what I said did you just misheard me mm-hmm so does we make a bed and and can set a spawn then you know things kind of change but for now it we're a little transient you know yeah right shift to pick it up come on oh my goodness bro I mean I at least I have three rotten flesh so you know we're real good shape you're doing pretty good mm-hmm so should we make a pickaxe or another knife next I mean a nice only one but a pickaxe is what we're gonna need to start tunneling into things and such yeah I think a pickaxe is like four Flint yeah okay oh I got a flake of that Flint though oh yeah my flip my Flint is flaked I've got okay so it looks like you just have to right-click it on yes haha pour the top service oh I got eight of them nice cool and I'm gonna make another knife then I think or I can make a soup do you have a spare hatchet then so I don't have to make another hatchet oh I can make a hatchet sure well again Oh a spare one oh yeah sorry I do have an extra haha here you go there ya go thank you the crafting table store items that's kind of cool well that's neat knife let me just make one and I'll let me give you your knife back I know you can pick stuff up by right-clicking on it but at this point I'm just working on everything oh oh you can look at it hey hey right hey hey hey hey can me what you're carrying it around what's our treat okay way Oh big guy so Flying Spaghetti Monster but okay we've got want that pickaxe so we can take shelter from the Flying Spaghetti Monster okay okay one sec yeah absolutely for sure all right I'm let is not look friendly no I would I would believe it's not oh is it seems be coming in this direction let's go in a hill maybe let's go in here maybe maybe first you know I'm be honest we have not demonetized nearly as much as I thought we might kind of expected like we've had a better start than I really expected hmmm well me more than you I suppose well you know we had to have a bit of lightning at at some point so yes we do have rocks the question okay do rock Oh easy sir ten cobblestone now nice we can do basically build everything we've ever wanted I mean we can make it I wanted I wanted to get that tree with the Flying Spaghetti Monster is over it okay okay okay that's fire it turns out if you step in the lava you light on fire that's no longer cold yeah ideally I am no longer coals it's a you're now quite hot now give me your now quite hot but I mean I've had people tell me before Wow mr. modest over here dude dude I think I've told you but like pretty much everybody who ever stops and visits me from listening to us ah that's a treat I just got scared by a tree but everybody who stops in after listening to us on your side is like I thought you were a geeky like 20 year old something or another you are not what I expected you know what you mean they've thought that you were a geeky 60 year old who happens no apparently I sound like a geeky 20 year old and is sorry to disappoint you I'm a geeky more than 20 I was not recording because I was tinkering with some controls and you got blown up by a creeper which is got a little eye contact I got attacked by a tree but then somehow spawned a creeper I don't think that it actually genuinely did spawn a creeper but it felt like it in that moment there could be a thing here that actually is something that spawns a creeper oh man your stuff does not just fall where you are wait does it explode all over the place it falls with great gusto in many areas if you blow up oh okay anyway yeah there's a there's a hole in the mountain over here and it has a distinct shape of me wait really can you see your own no no I was gonna be like that'd be pretty cool I was like I was using artistic license in the description okay like it doesn't look like me but is just a hole on the mountain but you know jeez stone sword hey would you like us don't sort yeah I take a stone sword okay cool let's do that I wonder finding like regular resources is straightforward or not I don't know whatever fight iron exists in places here's a stone sword my dude sound yeah okay you're gonna drink some dirty water I mean better than no water at all I think I still need to find some fluid in order to regen right about that yeah food doesn't really region but there are bandages that we can make that fairly food doesn't me having a food bar doesn't do anything for you yeah no about that it's you need a little bit more than that I see so there are bandages that are made from stringing wool and I know you can use string to make wool so I would assume that that means that we can cut you know mow some lawns and and being a good we want to try to monetize some your sheep or do we want to share some sheep oh there's coal in the mountain no do we want to check out what Cole does sounds pretty cool to me okay cool much closer to where we were but yeah but I just want to check out this you have the workbench cuz I don't have I do have the workbench okay oh hi you come over here if you wanted to hello Barry we're good okay hey it drops like regular coal so that's kind of cool whatever happens I know you made mom very mad like she's nothing to the fairy the fairy was okay sheep did you have to go and do that oh there it is the Sheep the Sheep needed two sheep coming okay I need you you will have Flint on a ship if I like how it says Biff it does like Batman effects when you hit mobs I did get a ramen though is a furnace this is recipes it is we can make a furnace I might not getting grass oh this is a cool gooey this is a sweet gooey you have a nice gooey over there yeah dude okay well we can I have they're muttons I'm sorry and then that should work oh I just created that dude now it's important that one of us stays alive so we can return to this oh I can eat dish shards so we don't we don't end up hey I've got a pic eggs cool did you wait why did you no no no no no no no no no and more no no there you go much better much easier I just what thanks your will I mean yeah no no no no mutton oh you were not read yet my hatchet oops I love that the taking out of the sword effect it's just tringg tringg tringg swing all day long oh my a knife broke yeah they seem to do that but the sword is better anyway oh but you need the knife in order to get the plant coin don't you yeah yeah so there's that again another knife and then you did you kill the Sheep did you make the button I baked the button yes bait here you go cows over here do we have we're in a good way there you go dude oh man yeah how did we spawn in a place that doesn't want to just perpetually be monetize us okay so I need to figure out right okay so if you open up your inventory there's skills on the left you can kind of look at and I think you can use your levels to apply I don't know how that works wheels on the Left three two plenty huh oh those are those are lake skill points hold shift as a rather small chance to mine - Cole / or rather than one when mining with iron pickaxe highly increased speed of obsidian mining this is very interesting I don't know if we have any points though yeah how like I mean do I just dig to get points I'm gonna see if I can make a bandage okay you can make this string I mean you got it hey I got bandage nice this is exciting yeah what's the whoa oh my god dude when you right-click a bandage it shows you what parts of your body are damaged so about that uh you can get a head shot I think something in my computer is BBB oh right right sorry and anyway you can get a head shot because you take damage in different spots I was getting ding ding but it turns out that that's because uh it was MC pH support pinging me oh very exciting yeah bro ok so like it just slowly regens you oh wow this is so you need that you want it you're gonna have oh wait why am i hurt what it what are hurt yeah oh it's good no the healing hurts me it's weird it's like I'm being hurt but it's healing it's very very it's a very rough healing it's like I'm being hit with some kind of Harry Potter spell that just causes me to regrow bones and it's very painful Harry Potter stuff and it rebounds yeah I don't know if you remember do you remember like in Quidditch when he like broke his bones and then yeah God these bones were moved and then they had to regrow the bones it was like a whole bad fun not fun time Oh darkness I wonder if it's the dark nymphets man bad madden lightnings you the dark nymph is is uh is chill oh good yeah where's the dark game okay yeah see that's what I'm in like this guy's totally cool and you're like no that's a bad period I uh I know what to say man that fairy really just obliterated me hard you kind of you kind of did take you down pretty quick in a bad way okay so throw me a hatchet if you would you could you make one too but you know that's alright or you could make it an axe gonna gonna go ahead and make myself a stone axe now you can you have it you can keep it cuz I have a stone now I wonder if the golden nymph is like a cool one is thank you look I bet the gold one like you're gonna find one that's like not the cool one that like just nukes you and I'm gonna laugh again are you chill it doesn't really react though they seem pretty chill I just wanted to say hello to it and and see if anything was was good alright okay and now I'm gonna get a few more plant twine what if they what if they're like spiders and they're only mean at night but during the day they're they're nice that could be that could be also what's going on I okay so let me make okay so I doesn't make a hoe right yeah that's what it's where my life is going is oh oh wait I see Oh careful careful my boy oh you don't want that you don't want that do you need some bandages are you okay uh yeah I didn't take much damage at all actually oh okay Wow look like it seems happy with me like I have gained knowledge ranked one of the nymph with your bestiary I don't want to gain knowledge of you well here how something oh wait I need I need to make a hotel I did I just threw this one I know I made my own we can have our own individual sets of toys it's not like it's really difficult dude I I feel like resources are intensive and you know it's actually not wait so what are you holding this just to increase your knowledge I don't I have no plan at this point okay okay I need to be level two hoeing to plant these seeds Oh interesting I'm gonna go D monetize swings oh god it's nighttime again I know it really it's about to be very scary and probably cold do we need to stand next to the lava to not d monetize i feel like i see my breath oh no no no no good at all we don't want this ya see that kind of looks like death like it literally looks like it yes quite literally looks like death can we do monetize that it's probably like a little bit beyond our power level right now I think it's over 9000 you should go check it out give it a try can we make a bed or we would need to make two beds I guess you want me to check it out I don't know that we want to check it out what the oh oh we have some other boyos oh that's creeper on you creeper on you oh man whoa whoa whoa sorry I was just caught off guard I was I was showing that I was wearing the creeper on man shirt yeah dude just knit my face didn't it hey hey I killed something oh did you what did you deal on it I did i okay I was gonna say we could just like you know go mine into the mountain and and see what's up again and become mountain man like actually go try to find a cave though or something like that be useful there was a slight cave up here but I don't know how deep it went and also we don't have any torches I bet we could get : make them I'll let me see oh I've used up you see that no let me see coal sticks it's unlit torches it's in order to make a torch you need to have matches we're very serious like that a match pocket and they only they don't okay so you make paper which we can make with the birch and then what's that so we can't do that but they don't last forever but we can do that because we have the birch which is actually good since you can use birch to make paper okay so it has averts because I don't have birch yeah yeah I just I just made paper okay and then it you need slabs so I think the slabs I need I believe I'm getting cold I am going to stand next to lava yeah I need and you know workbench workbench how about you forget them giving you a workbench my goodness here take your own you have been usually I'm reliant on you you're the one who's like very reliant on me this time for some reason I look mixing it up we have to it is excite it is very excited okay more food so there's that and then that across there and then see what you're doing it's pretty cool so you're saying porches don't last forever I don't know how long but they don't last forever did you you had some coal did you make it torch or do you have unlit torches I have unlit torches yes okay place an unlit torch like just wherever okay and then I have a matchbox we've invented lights and so what you're saying is that is eventually not gonna be lit anymore I I'm curious how long it'll last okay that's that's undesirable if I'm if I had to be honest with you I'd say that is I don't know that you can get ones that eventually do but not initially I see all right well we need to go and do we want to mine down do we want to try to find iron so that we can get some better slightly better gear maybe get some armor on yeah okay I mean I I like it's an armored-car product yeah it is actually you are correct there it is getting dark and echoey oh god that's so weird wait you were like pushing me around way more than normally that's just it seemed like it hey do you mind sure okay okay I'm leaving you be chill it's all good oh I'm so sorry you kind of skipped lagged in front of me as I was trying to mine and I swing the pickaxe into you would you like a bandage I have bandage for you there have have fun I'm so sorry about that I didn't mean it it's fine I just you know tinkled a little okay so I do you want to light a torch on fire with a match yeah pick where to apply it well you seem to have hit my head sorry this didn't hurt me you know though oh really hidden getting hit on the head with a pickaxe in there yeah yeah I didn't feel a thing would you like to okay there we go that's what I like to see so I think we can do the off hand out apparently my head I've got a headache now but really no do we have off hand in this one that we can't like I believe so yes yes we do oh can we oh yeah that's a good idea so if we break this does it remain lates it does not I don't know whether I can know it would appear that breaking the torch just just breaks it no I got the unlit towards back really oh yeah but you can't carry a lit one in your hand okay and then I went and I clicked on bubbles and it went away so now yeah this one again what if you actually what if you click on it and with the like an X or Y if you right-click on it maybe if I right-click on the lava nope can't light it with lava here let me let me like this one and then you can see if you can like that one nope places it on top so we're gonna we're gonna just be having to place a lot of torches I guess and use a lot of matches oh that's iron I think you don't meet the requirements to break this block I we've got it we've got to conquer this hole not leveling up thing I feel like it's a thing so AB there's a silverfish why is there some fish down there I don't know I've been demonetized how has this happened see you're gonna tell Pope right and and I'm getting a little bit these these these boys do damage they do damage did it work I saw Ricky I'm running back in I'm gonna get ya again this stuff good job good they what they cook the Yale meat I think that was being cool if that was that wait so I can just oh my god I coulda just toss things down next to the law they would have cooked for me I don't know if that's if that's how that works that's cool I was just like it was just out of nowhere I just I was just gone I was down here just hanging out mining and then it was just like you're done you died pretty fast I yep okay so we can make a bed and set our spawn so we don't have to do so people don't have to complain about us teleporting in oh so if we I mean we need to get all this string for it but that might be a thing to do with our newly found cave of wonder okay so how are there spiders in the cave is that how we get string the grass oh that kind of strength what the heck there's also a I know I was gonna I was just about to say that there's a tree that has something Oh spider where you where you we're being still oh my god oh my god it has whoa that's not an okay animation that's not okay animation hey creeper oh my god you've conquered D monetization yes wait is that Oh wither skeleton skull yeah we just got wither skeleton skull this mod packs easy I don't know what people been saying I'm gonna drink already dirty that last words right there okay so I got spectral bolt charges well I don't know use to throw a special bolt can also be fired from a dispenser I kind of want to throw a special bolt at you right now I'm not gonna lie I did not do not I would have none but I I do oh it's daytime oh sweet what's a daytime okay okay deep breaths deep breaths so yeah how are we going to get ourselves so plant string works in order to make wool yes okay for string makes it makes it block of wool so we just need to find ourselves a bunch of grass and oddly enough there's not much grass around here there's plenty of grass over here it is there's also a sheep that has a very like sheep like face on it and yes well I mean I was just like observing the the texture it's not a Minecraft it was like staring at me and but I got a I got a wool from it some rotten but the sheep is no more okay there we go you show a lot of know what you said you want to know what happened I didn't say I wanted to know I said it was curious to know there's a difference well now you know okay yeah you just fall right now business yeah I fell and then the ringing in my ears stopped and Here I am so you actually like it gave you tinnitus yes that's amazing it kind of was never been so amazed with tinnitus in my life also there's something named down below and that's really making me weird why really I don't see it where clown no oh it's a trumpet boy class yes he's not making noises though what are you doing buddy good I hope he never blows his trumpet again and what trumpet sounds wait I'm whiffing what's happening do ting intensifies oh I'm do ting him super hard though he's wrecked your what now I'm do ting him oh right right you got do to you okay so what are you doing in there this is cool okay cool and so waystone over here I think dude those are supposed to be pretty good and we want to mine it I don't know whether you can pick them up in this way now but we can try like shift right click oh and your waist own name cry Crestor forest okay I see I just named it the cry Crestor forest I guess you can use these to go to other destinations yeah I mean I they work the same way just without the stone so that's Oh okay so you just you have to get to one though in order to tell us what else we're okay so we can at least get back to the spawn area when we need it so that's pretty nice well that might have our spawn I don't know probably not but I doubt a B okay so let me let me make more plant fiber we just let's keep collecting that I keep forgetting now we might be able to actually get some wool in here okay so I'm hydrating oh you can't read when you're dehydrated apparently oh wow that's too realistic I don't like it I count some water hang on okay let's check this out I am gonna make a bed yeah you mean oil bed oh hey everything looks right again that's exciting okay I just made a bed this is way bro how did we get such a spot like such a spam location we're just not a lot of things are trying to end us all the time I mean we haven't even been shot by a dragon so I feel like I was misled on what to expect oh there goes another one of you how do you make the cobble is it just just Roxanna goodbye to my god easy peasy he works does K work k does not work that's unfortunate that because K would not be realistic let's be honest this is real life minecraft with chimeras and ogres okay and Harry Potter bone-breaking yeah yeah Skellig ro is that actually what it's called yes that was what it was called nice trust me I'm bout to make you a bed oh okay I don't know Kate go into inventory and then on the left is skills yeah and then you pick your skill and we're gonna top right there's it shows you the next level and you can press the plus and get that level okay so mining probably cuz we want to be able to mine iron III put one into farming so that I could plant some seeds but yes okay so skill oh okay so plus so I do this do it right and I right-click on it no no I do a plus yeah oh oh one skill point two skill wait what I don't know where like how where is it pulling skill points from yeah that's what I'm not sure if it was did it did it take XP from me yes it is okay so it takes expose alright yeah okay cool but then do you oh I see so these automatically unlock when you just level things up I guess not right and what's once you get to level five then you can press the L key you take the yellow over five yeah and you can choose a specialty apparently okay and it'll basically say you get more XP from doing at your specialty okay resting hey bud um let me do let me do a useful thing okay right now where I go and do this and I go and do this and now there you go and here I go and I don't know if this is gonna allow us to it probably won't until it's nighttime yeah I mean I don't do we want to be here I guess we don't need a little cave right here we could build up a you know maybe put down some porches see what's inside and maybe make it home yeah this looks cozy real cozy I've never seen anything more cozy this looks like the sort of place that I'd want to live okay alright so I'm thinking let's um I'll just patch this up a little bit here okay you know or I guess we can mine a couple of hole just get it all good there we go there we go and then oh are you gonna you're making the entrance over here yeah that's kind of what I was okay just gonna dig this down since it was a little hill and then put in a did you make the actual door I have not let me let me do that yeah you know what's gonna be really fun is if these torches just extinguish after a little while I mean I think they are supposed to but we have more matches I do not look forward to that taking place we can work it out and we got three birch from that the heck come on dude give me birch I don't know my computer's really angry in distress really really loud out here oh there is a name thing down there I do see the name thing now oh that's terrifying that's probably what's causing my computer to be angry that name thing is is a big boy it sounds like an airplane is there a dragon somewhere I want to see the dragon I don't want to see the dragon I don't want to get demonetised hey Lia door woo coming from eggs Oriya I'm like does anything work can we make any of this stuff no I definitely understand what you're saying there and there's the doorway alright here we go dude boom we got ourselves a little place to stay at now yeah I've never seen a prettier house in my life probably just because the texture pack is very nice I keep trying to be like big windows opening you keep oh you're trying windows I see it's why I wanted it to be a total dungeon yeah this is this is us living in the dark hiding from our enemies and our problems I'm just super concerned with whatever the heck is down there cuz it's causing lag which means I'm it's gonna be a it's it's a bad news bear oh yeah no that's very laggy over there yeah yeah it's that's not that's a not good place to be we don't want to be there no we've chosen a great place to build our home where we can't even walk around oh my god my computer is so mad at this my computer is so mad help okay alright let's put down beds let's put down beds this is the place to sleep this is the place probably don't want to make another house at some point you know far away from whatever is causing that problem this looks good to me bed down it must be getting close to me it's actually it's actually dusk so let's do it let's do it give it a moment give it a moment yes sweet dreams do we have an actual spawn look at our glorious house we have made so much and done so much like just the prettiest house I have ever seen does it sleep through that there we go yes whoa I think everybody I think everybody's in here with us right now I think we've done great jobs there's not a lot of stuff that wants to de monetize us and good things are happening all around I'd say things are great purse yeah well I mean honestly I was expecting more death and more pain and more repeated stuff but we settled on and kind of just got our start getting it done fortunately I'm really glad that I watched kind of a little intro video that was made by the mob had creator himself on how some of this works because otherwise we would have been very confused agree thanks for leaving the way on that so so fortunate we got that little start and was able to help there but and then I I know that you know we've kind of had it up and down again we set this up very fast so I expect we'll have a little bit of tweaking on the server here but we do as a one-click installer here soon and then in those same descriptions we'll have links to the forthcoming playlist since this episode one not very expensive but in the future and yeah that should be it alright we'll see you guys in the next episode thanks for tuning in bye guys [Music] [Music]
