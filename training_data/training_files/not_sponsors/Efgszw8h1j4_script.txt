hi guys my name is grace I'm back with another video and today I'm reacting to a song that came out I'll be reacting to I you ate and there's a lot of hype around it because it's produced by suga of BTS so yeah I don't really listen to I use music much I know she's super talented and I know she's really really popular like she's I think like the most popular so his stuff pretty sure and I'm I'm an army and I know suga is a very very talented producer and musician so I'm super excited to see what goes on with this yeah okay there are no English subtitles so I'll just be jamming along without knowing what's going on how old is I you I always for some reason I always register her as being like young but I know that's not really true just got to be like - in her early to mid-20s right oh I love that dress [Music] I really like I don't listen too much I you like at all I really don't listen to her music but I really enjoy that she has like a softer voice as opposed to like a Lee's kind of belty voice or taeyeon this kind of belty voice she's a very mellow sound natural [Music] [Music] ah she always seems very like innocent you know what I mean that's why I always register as like young her as young Oh forever young I'm sorry well they changed up real quick I don't really get what's going on but I guess you know subtitles would help but oh it was her dream so she was having a nightmare her lizard's gone oh no where'd he go [Music] well it's so cool I love how they're changing up the art styles and I'm guessing they all represent different things okay drag it Oh is her lizard her dragon [Music] oh and there's the plane that she was on and she's crying there too oh she woke up yeah executive producer oh there's more there's more third like 40 seconds left it's a lot of people that went into this she's smiling at me yeah she looks sad no.8 okay so I liked the song it was like it was very springy almost summery vibes but I have no idea what was going on there were no subtitles for me to read so I don't know what the lyrics meant but perhaps I can make some educated guesses based on the music videos so she went into her like futuristic chamber or whatever and it seems like she was listening to the song and was put kind of in like a coma and she was dreaming about her life in the house and how she was having fun in the Sun with her lizard but then she had a nightmare about being on an airplane and the turbulence and then she woke up and her lizard was missing and then she went and they switched art styles from it being in real life to being on a plane and like 3d animated and then she was back in her house and her lizard which missing and that was real life and then she immediately changed to like 2d animation and then her lizard was a dragon and she passed herself in the plane and then she was crying and then she woke up from the simulation so maybe she was simulating a happy life question mark or there kept saying forever young forever young and maybe she was dreaming as she is as she is getting older maybe she is dreaming back on her her life as a young person as someone who can have fun of someone who dreams of dragons and flying away and I don't know do the movies tell me someone please tell me about IU in general I don't know much about her as she can is she called Korea's little sister I don't know um I think that's something I heard but I'm not necessarily sure and like I said I really like her tones she has a brand of kind of softer more mellow music and I really liked her comeback BB BB yeah let's eat hey Rd better bad about a bum bum oh whatever that song was called yeah so thanks for watching this please inform me in the comments below because I have no tools to go off for this I liked the song but have no idea what it's about yeah and I hope to see you guys in the next video bye bye
