hey guys this is John welcome back for another episode of expert amateur fraud Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals but before then enjoy the video hey everyone I'm Toki I'm Taylor and this is expert amateur fraud where we try to figure out who's the real expert in who is faking it we have an action-packed episode here for you today what is it hope you brought your gym clothes today we're getting three private lessons from three different self-defense instructors and figure out who's who my name's Kimberly Mills my name is Clovis Garcia and Josephine Lou my name is Tavares wings everybody calls me sweet pea self-defense it is for everyone size doesn't matter trust me size does not matter everybody has what it takes you know to to be able to defend themselves it's really a mindset are you ready I'm ready all right let's go that's number one hello hello I'm Kim Toki Taylor Taylor sweet you nice to meet you are you guys you guys nervous so if you actually find yourself in a physical threat we're gonna be learning some techniques that can help you okay all right yeah I'm have your feet about hip-width apart you can take a natural step forward so my goal for the lesson was to teach basic strikes from about a mid range to a close range we're gonna use the heel of our palm for what we call a palm strike oh my god so all I'm gonna do it to generate power we're gonna sink into the ground a little bit and we're gonna send our hands out with our body turning oh here I want you to breathe out contract how do you do that breathing technique okay so hold your stomach really quick and then breathe out like you feel I think I'm just gonna die go for it yes I turn okay I'll say go you open your eyes and attach okay get ready Wow okay I hope you hit the nose because your eyes we're gonna do that a frame kick and law enforcement they use the a-frame kick we call it the groin kick so all you need to do back in that stance hands are gonna be up a little bit your knees gonna come up first and then unfold the leg and come back down so look I'm here and I can't necessarily use my hands down and then you're gonna send that knee go she hit real well with that knee I mean that first knees she threw it was like whoa I actually felt that through the pad we're gonna just basically defend a choke from the front a choke a choke it's very primal instinct people want to go to the throat you see it in the animal kingdom to step back arm up good and turn ba so I'm gonna put my hands near throat I hope you're okay with that scoot a little closer I'm into it okay I feel bad sometimes because I'm pushing people around but it's kind of like you got to get that reaction out of them they did a good job and they were they were cool with it I hope good hold on to the face quickly calm yes turn in turn l'Ã©quipe overwhelming me keep me on my heels this is a little bit of kind of what I teach so hopefully you had some fun hitting the pads and yeah that was that was something else think we was gonna go like right into it and they punch me like whoa for me the highlight was the choking no like I felt like everything was choreographed very well she was very well-spoken about everything and I definitely learned yeah I feel a little more prepared there's only one thing that maybe like triggered something in my brain she was talking about police and like how they like call it this cake but we're gonna call maybe like a police a cop I would have said maybe expert so far but I think she's either expert or fraud it could go either way what's up what's up guys are you my name is Clovis and today we're gonna talk about self-defense all right first of all my first Lynch not English so let's see how it's going okay Portuguese my first language Spanish is my second language five step 5 actually steps right so it is avoid dodgy escape negotiation and face to your aggressor it's not about just fight you know or combat you can always prevent the situation that's the worse situation so you can just punch me Oh what don't worry don't worry just like that yeah let's just make this clear I would never do this you are so jacked okay right it's the first movement step back like this yeah okay yes boom and you go back punch me and so he probably gonna hurt himself because his fingers going to heat your bond yeah that's my man's oh shoot okay that's artsy I like that it's like kind of like ballet not just like you're going to just cross you like this guy's who knows a little bit about punch did they punch Trey real drunk people that just like through whatever they just think they're swimming in so it just but like how is the name in Spain you have this oh yeah yeah yeah what's up like what's the situation huh got problem with me come on just like your numbers commune oh come on don't be self defense that's the last trying therefore action steps [ __ ] huh thank you thank you man is ripped yes that was clear to see he was jacked I was I was kind of scared going up to him I would escape to me I think he's like an MMA fighter or like a cage I felt that way too and then he gave us the steps which I thought like okay that seems legit but also at the same time there was a lot of pauses where I felt like he was thinking like what do I say which I wasn't sure yeah I can't really judge on that if I compare that to the first lesson definitely feels more like fraud I would say amateur just because I felt like he does have some kind of physical background with that so guys how you guys doing nice to meet you to meet you Sookie my name is Tavares sweet pea Weems so we teach you guys some simple but effective self-defense techniques from high Kido Taekwondo as well as CBT are you guys familiar with CBT CBD no guys crazy it stands for commando battle tactics and it also incorporates pistol disarms as well as nice disarms you step forward you grab his right hand with your left you bring around two thumbs on the back of his hand hot bring down go back to you back very simple right that's a right foot grab his right with my left yes pivot around switch hands put it on the back of this hand right here push down that's your right knee goes down no the techniques that I showed them were maybe a little advanced to a certain extent to to someone that's a beginner try to throw a right kick yeah so what I do is step for a catch it step for my left catch with both hands step around Oh God sweep to the ground I'll be safe sweep to the ground keep the leg up and you know the drawing are you ready I'm ready Oh God yes okay yeah okay that's it nice we're gonna go through some quick pistol disarms for safety purposes for sure we didn't have the non-firing replicas you know we worked with what we had point it at my chest oh my that's right what do you mean this one not too tight this is banana this way you can turn his hand downwards slow oh okay oh man that looks locked and loaded give me all your money this way she knows that was it perfect you step back block block wrap or half step under wrap under throw okay you step back and enough yeah you flip forward whoa whoa we do our own stunts here learning so much pistol disarms some Hapkido and a little bit of Taekwondo the highlight was seeing you get flipped for sure oh are you breaking the bananas pretty good I felt like it was too complicated though it was like if I'm getting attacked there's no way it felt like a dance I liked how much more into it we got approaching somebody with a pistol be like I'm gonna take like whoa I just having a shot what if he's like a stunt guy like a stunt the first one at first I thought she would be the expert this last one interesting why do I would say amateur just because he did know he was talking about but like it was less how to save yourself I actually liked the second person even though I think he's a fraud like he's like you should like you know they all got their arms behind their back I feel like I need to do that I thought your lesson was really informative and I learned a lot some really practical I am going to say that you are the expert so I am gonna agree with you and give you expert number two I do feel like we spent a lot of time talking and not as much time actually doing physical stuff so that made me question I'm sure you're so jacked that I was like they're gonna give us this guy to like throw us off I'm gonna give you fraud you definitely know what you're talking about but maybe this is not like what you actually do maybe you do something that's kind of parallel but not exactly a self-defense instructor so that is why I'm going to say for I was getting thrown around which is definitely fun but I think it was still just in a different capacity like something else of a profession like you mentioned maybe a stunt man or something of the like so that's why I'm gonna go with a masher I'm so wrong [Applause] okay I was so nervous to call you I learned those things yesterday feeling that there was definitely gonna be that big dude with the muscles to confuse people they can see right past that I'm coaching people in the 15 industry I'm an actor stuntman so I'm a black belt in Krav Maga knowing that I'm making people stay safe is really rewarding it's the best part you know once you take martial arts and self-defense courses it give you a totally different perspective on life best fight is the one you don't have to be in just using your smarts your mind is your ultimate self-defense tool you have an amazing meet by the way I was like so when I say go we'll just we'll throw that groin kick together so hands stay up chin down and just gonna send that kick on three one two three kick hey guys thank you for watching that episode of expert amateur
