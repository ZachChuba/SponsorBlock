[Music] [Music] all right buckle your seatbelt everyone I have a lot to catch you up on a long time ago I said I would not do runecrafting until I absolutely had to and recently I've absolutely had to quest number 95 is devious Minds which probably has the most tedious stat requirements so far with 50 runecrafting and 65 smithing and both of those things keep me up at night during my streams I mined about 14k pure essence made a ton of rings of dueling so I did fire runes from 14 all the way to 50 runecrafting so I knocked that out I haven't got to the whole 65 smithing thing yet but I'll talk about that later I did however get 40 farming for the ninetieth quest in the series that came out on the 31st of October in 2005 rum deal we're gonna head to the ghost land find a guy named pirate Pete and get things rolling okay you guys will not believe what this ghost over here just said to me I'm about to go talk to pirate Pete wherever he is I think he's on this ship over here I passed this guy right here this ghost sailor I'm minding my own business I'm not doing anything that guy as I'm walking by looks me and my [ __ ] eyes and without any hesitation any regard for my personal feelings he says let me ask you this if I say the name pirate Pete who do you picture probably a guy who sports a peg leg maybe an eyepatch pirate hat perhaps because he's a [ __ ] pirate but my mistake everyone pirate Pete is not the name of a pirate but rather a drug dealer nickname for this hooded sketch ball at the edge of this pier nice to meet you pirate Pete got any quest for me man I love how aware my guy is of what his purpose is here in this world Pete here's given me a sob story that he's clearly making up something about him finding a family sword to prove his royalty somewhere and there's a demon named barrel lore that doesn't exist at all I don't know yeah I'll help you man I'll do it for free why am i turning around okay he just knocked me out dude if this transitions into another ad I swear to God okay captain brain death now that looks like a pirate Hey look I'm awake and this guy is so tall it's disgusting why is he so tall all right there's a bunch

I'll just go let's go [ __ ] myself we need to catch five slug Ling's Hey look it's a carom fool ooh it looks [ __ ] gross we need to pressurize them that doesn't sound humane oh no that is the

captain leader guy he's gonna chug this bucket he's telling me the name of his leader rabid jack captain brain death said he has no idea who rabid jack is well I think I think we helped the cause I think yeah all right that's some good XP we've got a holy wrench so that prayer potions will give us more prayer points all right let's leave the next quest is shadow of the storm which continues the plot of demon slayer from episode 1 I do this quest on every pure account so I'm really familiar with it already and in the quest I need to get dark clothing to appear evil one of the things that are considered dark clothing are the ghostly robes from the mini quest curse of the empty Lord which came out a few months after desert treasure to most players curse of the empty Lord exists strictly to get ghostly robes but it's probably got more lower than most of the full length quests in the game I started off by talking to a ghost named Valdes near Glary oles tomb he was a follower of the good guy God saradomin and he's been stuck in this ghost purgatory for a long-ass time right before he died he found the staff of armadillo he tried to give it to Sara diamond but got robbed on the way there which sent the staff on a journey between random Schmucks who were all cursed because of their involvement with it it went like this this guy found the staff of armadyl in an ancient tomb which got stolen by this guy this guy's a thief and he wanted to sell it so he told this guy that he had it but instead of finding a buyer he told zamorak about it sanrak was like oh [ __ ] that sounds like it could I could really use something like that because I'm a general and not a god yet so zamorak bought the staff and then this girl saw that happen she was a spy she's a Sara diamond follower but you know she's a little sneak sneak so she was like I gotta tell Sara dominance and she was undercover she couldn't risk going and telling it herself so she told this guy about it and this guy was supposed to go tell Sara diamond but he was hammered hence why he's still in the party room so essentially Sara da man ever found out about this so the only guy that can vouch for what happened after that and what zamorak did with the staff is this guy zamorak this guy has zeal and that sketchball lucien that i i think i killed they were all under the rule of some lord and this guy is referring to him as the empty Lord zamorak over through the empty Lord it was this big Kabang kaboom and then as the empty Lord died he whispered a curse they're ghosts now forever and the big reveal at the very end was that this empty Lord fellow was in fact zeros which is the guy that is an influencer for ancient magics and kind of made that popular he was a very evil guy we don't know what happened to him now I'm a spooky ghost guy I can wear ghost robes so that's cool we're at November 14th 2005 quest number 91 shadow of the storm talking to father reen who was posted up outside the alcoran bank just awaiting my arrival father II and his buddy went exploring over to the ruins of user and they discovered a very evil committee over there and he hates evil committees as do I so we're gonna infiltrate and destroy that's usually a foolproof plan when it comes to these things and I'm pretty good at it so yep we are back to user there's our rock guy friend okay so there's a demon named a growth nar and it can jump through universes and dimensions I don't know he's a bad [ __ ] guy we got to stop my user though he just pointed I've never seen an NPC point at another NPC this body move yeah what year is this 2005 2005 that's what your yeah finally figured out how to make the [ __ ] guy point yeah pointed out a weight now he picked up his [ __ ] hand he picked up his hand turned his body and pointed at the [ __ ] clay golem Wow alright we're back inside the ruins and evil Dave is posted up I would like to be in your evil group he said my sword is too shiny for me to be evil Dave I'm wearing a Santa hat in June what more do you need he's taking us in escorting us to the demonic throne room hello everybody so my great plan hasn't entirely backfired yet but I did just sign myself up to be the leader of the chant to summon a demon and that demon has potential to take over the entire world so if anything goes wrong it will be my responsibility that basically everybody dies like literally everyone so to ease the tension I'm going to chisel all of the gems off of this chair you don't need them on that chair what are you gonna sit there it's huge you can't fit blow me so I'm talking to this Matthew guy I asked about the member who I'm replacing it doesn't sound too wholesome whatever Pinu him so I'm gonna go investigate a little bit and then report back rock guys telling me that the member I'm replacing ran out of the temple holding a book and Deneb the leader shot a huge fireball at him and he died and whatever book he was holding is in one of these kilns and here it is look at that yeah this is the guy's Journal he's basically saying that they've summoned this demon before he saw that they were doing it again and he's like nope that was a bad idea last time I should leave and tell someone and before he could get out of there he got [ __ ] don't worry I'm here to kill the demon I'm really good at this undercover [ __ ] man the ritual that this guy's making us say is actually backwards so who knows what's about to happen a magic circle appears and Donets walking right into it and he turned into a sigil oh my god that's right Jennifer a whole sigil I'm getting out of here oh don't leave now let him leave trust me now we need to re summon the demon but three of them just scattered like [ __ ] oh now I have to go recruit people and do another ritual Oh Tonya look out there's there's ghosts look Dave if you don't get back down there I will tell your mother all about what you do in that basement also wake your friend up at [ __ ] rock blanket doesn't fool me get the hell up Eric yeah this guy's actually super dead we're gonna go upstairs and recruit the priests and the rock guy yeah the weather's [ __ ] last time I talked to rock guy I reprogrammed him to think the demon was dead so that he could be peaceful so we're gonna ruin this whole peaceful thing he's got going on by taking that program out of him successfully Kon doll three of them to head down hey look it's a growth nar Matthew how dare you summon me oh I like how I'm telling him that I was the one who summoned him after he just smites Matthew to the depths of hell here I go unload some specs on him tapes moonwalking damn Dave the footwork is unreal buddy God he's such a little baby a growths on the verge of death father reading thought about helping me just now but little out of his comfort zone all right we did it was complete that's it there's no victory speech nothing just casually saved the entire universe on to the next one November 22nd 2005 quest number 92 making history we're gonna go talk to jor-el who's posted up in this outpost northwest of West are going jor-el looks like the stereotype that people that don't play video games think of when someone mentions World of Warcraft control kind of seems like the guy that is gonna ask you to go on a [ __ ] little mission right but the only reason he's gonna ask you to do that so you'll leave them alone so you can jerk off for the other [ __ ] 29 minutes here you're not there jor-el wants to save this outpost and turn it into a museum because this great-grandfather was a guard here once and I guess King Laius his great-grandfather was but basically this building is so important that they didn't bother expanding on it in old school essentially what I'm saying is this quest doesn't matter at all so Charles just like please knock when you come back please don't barge in when you come back this silver merchant guy has a key that opens up a chest that his great-grandfather once buried it's got his journal that talks about all the really erotic times they had in the outpost together so we're gonna go find it I've got the key I keep touching it seeing how hot it gets alright I found this chest and his really hot steamy journal this dead guy has a scroll with the timeline of the outpost he would give it to us but his dead [ __ ] wife hates him the only way he's gonna give us the scroll is if we make his wife jewelry why couldn't they make this ghost wife really hot instead they gave her the spiky hair with a forehead that goes all the way back to her occipital region she must tell like the funniest stories or something you know maybe that's why he gave me the scroll he wants me to report back to him if it works that way he can fulfill his destiny and go go up to his wife this guy's such an [ __ ] I'm not even gonna contextualize what his his role is in this plot if you're ever in the area just spit on him and you'll know you did the right thing I gotta bring this letter to King Leigh this and act like I don't know that he's plotting to just take over the world who are you what do you think about a museum huh oh he loves the idea so much he [ __ ] oh he adores this idea oh yeah sign it thank you so much dude what am i doing alright if we did it we restored this man's dreams I think it's a little messed up that they end it there we didn't tell the ghost that his scroll came in handy so he's just sitting in port phasmatis with his thumb in his ass right now I'm really curious how many people have done this quest and not come back to tell this guy just blue ball the ghost has one chance to have sex with his wife again I've been waiting for ages yeah there he goes off to seduce his spiky haired wife absolutely beautiful quest alright November 28 2005 quest number 93 rat catchers I'm not gonna be showing you that quest I've done a lot of quests during this series that you know they weren't too enjoyable this this is on a whole different level Brad catchers is the the bottom of the barrel of content ever released by runescape I will not be showing rat catchers in this video because I'll be making a standalone video about this quest this took me aback I'm not even upset about the maze the mansion maze thing the dialogue in rat catchers makes Tommy Wiseau look like [ __ ] Shakespeare it's been a week it's been a week since I did that quest and I'm still appalled sorry if you were looking forward to seeing me do that quest for this episode it's gonna get its own video so I'll probably show the completion screen that I you know I did it but yeah I'll keep you updated on the standalone video of rat catchers where I dissect every little shitty thing about it and why if there's one thing that needs to be remastered re-written revamped whatever they need to do is that [ __ ] quest but yeah there's rat catchers there's quest where 93 on to the next one ladies and gentlemen we are getting close to finally getting through 2005 December 5th quest number 94 spirits of a lead led a lead yeah you know what I mean we're heading to the town of Narda apparently they've got some water problems or something and if you know me you know that I'm a firm believer that everyone should have water like dehydration I hate that yep water I'm getting people water we have arrived places bumping huh all right we're talking to the mayor their town is under a curse of some sort their water source has just stopped being a water source and you know that that's not good there's also some jackass in the center of town that's selling overpriced water bottles to everybody completely exploiting this entire situation so we should probably take him out first the only thing this guy can link to the whole curse is that there was a priest of Serra DOM and that came in last week everyone loved them they didn't protect them well enough apparently because he wandered off and died but we'll solve it we'll get we'll get to the bottom of it don't worry no here's the water bottle guy look at him a thousand coins for a bottle of water it's the cheapest water you'll find in this town yeah cuz it's the only water you piece of [ __ ] I want to impale this guy dude I'm gonna use his own water to waterboard on the shovel who is this Wesley dude I think I can make a short joke about someone else for the first time in my life grind oh he's an MLG drop shot 360 fakie fakie wallbang noscope [ __ ] look at him go getting that ehp baby [ __ ] grind it the town elders telling us about some river spirits and and he thinks they might have something to do with it so uh oh boy getting hammered before I do this you don't mind if I draw my mug in your room do you this is just a giant poem I think it just literally tells me how to do the quest I'm not gonna read it hey what's that key on display over there keep her hands off the key no I wouldn't I would never put my hands on the key she's got these robes out of the closet is that cool with you where's that key where the key go by the way you saw me standing here the whole time oh it's actually still right there all right we're gonna head down to the edge of the river go inside a little temple and see if we can find out what's blocking the source okay sir whoever labelled this a lizard has never seen a lizard in real life the lizard in dinosaur times when lizards were goddamn humongous time to get crazy in like Indiana Jones baby there we go not even holding on anything I like the interior color scheme we're working with here very limestone II there's three doors here each door is gonna have a different water channel that needs to get cleared we've got a little rock guy to fight each time before we go in I brought a spear along because you need all three attacks tiles like crush slash and stab and a spear has all three of them so I'm just really good at this video game Oh hot guy there's the first channel there I used my thieving skills to remove the block all right well I'm killing this next rock guy I'm gonna take a second to yell at you all I would love if you guys went and watched my last video I promised myself for every non runescape video I'd make I put four times the effort into it that I would an episode of my release I made sure that even if you've never even heard of the game you could understand the entire thing much like how I approached this series for people who might not have played a runescape it makes making these episodes way easier on my head I think I'm still finding my style and in other videos even if it's not your thing let me know why you like it why you don't what you'd want to see again and what you hated I think making videos on other games has kept me sane so thanks to everyone who watched I am nice little archery target baby that's right clear that channel oh yeah waters back and here's the spirit river gang we're going to confront them and see what the [ __ ] that was about so when that saradomin priest came to Narda and everyone was leaning toward Serra DOM and all of a sudden they proceeded to throw away a statue dedicated to a lead and that pissed them off so they said they'll stop all the ruckus if we get the statue back and put it back in the town they threw one of the oldest ancient statuettes down a crevasse so we've got to go find it I'm also gonna take this guy's souls out of his shoes leave my shoes alone [ __ ] off this has all just been a giant plot to steal that man's shoes found the crevasse let's dive down oh I hate this there's a genie in there since the statue was thrown down here he kind of just took it in exchange for the statue he wants the mayor's shoe soles which I conveniently just cut out of his shoes I was just gonna pull a prank but I guess it you know worked out okay well we got the statue back there's an XP lamp I need that lamp I'm gonna try the oldest trick in the book Oh blow me all right we're putting the statue back where it belongs there we go quest complete some nice prayer XP that's pretty hot getting close to 200 quest points - well we're down to our last quest of 2005 like I was saying earlier just has some very heavy requirements I still have to get 65 of training and you're gonna be forced to watch see you there yeah look at him he's so [ __ ] pissed off that anyone would even ever think about bringing up rock guys named Rock card Rock guy says jump I say into what a second you walked in Rock I knew 13 ways to kill you just standing there watching me leave holy [ __ ] he's out here - oh my god he left a note
