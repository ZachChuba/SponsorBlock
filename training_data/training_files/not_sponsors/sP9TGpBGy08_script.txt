Davis thought leaders and activists across the world have understood that protest is not just some March a mere inconvenience for commuters but instead a necessity for the fight for freedom to make people's voices heard roughly 7.6 million people took to the streets all over the world in September to make that voice heard to urge governments to look towards the evidence to look towards the future and to understand that a climate crisis is upon us but how did we get here 7.6 million is a significant number and the strikes are part of a larger string of actions that have turned the world's gaze towards the problem of climate change and the momentum only seems to be growing with another potential global climate strike slated to counter the industrial gluttony of Black Friday so with these realities in mind I want to take a look at the current state of environmental protests understand its impact and figure out what's the next step after this newest explosion of climate strikes that's the baseline at this point and we have to look further to hold our elected officials accountable that's Jerome Foster the second founder and editor-in-chief of the climate Reporter founder of 1 million of us as well as a climate strike organizer for Friday's for the future and Washington DC needless to say drom has his hands in a lot of climate action pies in the DC area on top of all this work he also happens to be a senior in high school in many ways drum seems to echo the mold of youth activists that have taken a stand against the reluctance of world figureheads to act strongly and ethically on climate change he's young and he's tired of global climate in action and this new wave of climate activists seems unwavering they're lit by a fire of frustration a fire that many point to Greta tun Barry for ignite young people all over the globe have been walking out of their schools every Friday to pressure their governing bodies to create bold climate action plans this youth led movement known as Friday's for the future continues to build as young activists like Jerome start to establish themselves as serious organizers across the globe but to believe that the current protests are solely due to the workings of gratitude Mary would be falling June Barry is a piece of the puzzle but a leader does not make a movement the September climate strikes and for that matter prior environmental actions like those aiming to prevent the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota access pipelines were the product of thousands of hours of hard work done by people at every level especially communities of color and indigenous communities the environmental protest continues to forge a path towards an ethical coexistence with and on this earth through the interwoven efforts of activists like Jaime Margolin founder of zero hour one occult and indigenous activists fighting to protect the Alaskan Tongass from logging and industrial use or the 20 environmental and land rights activists murdered in Brazil in 2018 including those with Brazil's landless workers movement who were shot dead because the group was deemed a terrorist organization so the state of environmental protests around the globe is one that seems unprecedented cities and local movements are interconnecting in solidarity from nairobi kenya to melbourne australia a loud rallying cry has been sounded to shake the world into overdrive asking simply that their governments take action to make the climate crisis but our governments listening has this new slew of climate protests been effective and when it comes down to it can we really know for sure Lilly Gardner a Kentucky based organizer from the sunrise movement thinks the protests and actions have had an impact on how politicians and citizens view the growing climate crisis you might recognize here from this action and Mitch McConnell's office I think the fact that we even see a CNN Town Hall that's entirely dedicated to the climate crisis that presidential candidates are opening their remarks at debate with mentions of the climate crisis that we've made it on the front page of the New York Times I think there's very public pronouncements and integration of the climate crisis into people's just consciousness it's something that you hadn't seen before the strikes in many ways I too feel this hope in the u.s. these new mass demonstrations seem to actually be pushing the mainstream towards a more aggressive stance on climate action but I'm simultaneously wary that I'm viewing this apparent momentum with rose tinted glasses according to the International Center for nonprofit WAW u.s. state governments continue to push for bills that would criminalize protesting near pipelines and quote unquote critical infrastructure with even more egregious legislation like South Dakota's recently passed SB 189 that would allow the state to go after quote-unquote riot boosters or protest funders for aiding in any disruptive protests across the country over 100 bills attempting to restrict protests have risen to the fore in recent years while legislators have struck down many of them 16 anti-protest bills were enacted but elsewhere the recent climate strikes seem to be shaking the system at its core thanks to the highly publicized actions of groups like extension rebellion the United Kingdom declared a climate emergency with countries like Austria Spain and Argentina following suit with over 1,000 climate emergency declarations across local and jurisdictions the pressure of protests seem to be pushing global governments to recognize the necessity for climate action but of course many of these declarations are non-binding so much like the Paris agreement we'll have to see whether these pronouncements actually create tangible change [Music] understanding that this mass mobilisation of climate activists is just a start then is important the momentum and desire are there but shaping the raw energy of 7.6 million people around the world into an actual transition from a carbon reliant capitalist world to one of economic social and climate justice will be difficult jerome foster wants to channel the energy of marches into a strong voting bloc with his 1 million of us campaign so young people really don't have that much money to put into a system but they have a lot of votes so 1 million of us is - is initiative we engage young people on every level from presidential elections to Senate Senate elections congressional elections seek them about the importance of why they should vote and how they can vote but as he admitted to me the way that this movement continues to be successful is if adults join the struggle adults have to join we have to be bigger than just saying like young who are fighting for the future because it's not our future and it's not just young people if we're gonna replace elected officials we need someone to replace them with like a OC or like Johan Omar and like really big champions of the environmental movement meanwhile Lilly Gardner seeks to continue to mobilize young people across the u.s. we are hoping to enter an era in which students across the world are taking active action in the name or in the face of the climate crisis we're calling it in the United States generation green New Deal we will not be Generation Z the final generation instead we're reclaiming this we're becoming Genji ng Jerome and Lilly reflect the countless approaches organisers are using to translate this growing movement into tangible policy and systemic change the green New Deal in many ways is a product of this renewed vigor of climate protests as a proposal and as an idea in front lines the interconnected reality of climate change it's not just about curbing greenhouse gases it's about supplying meaningful jobs to thousands improving infrastructure and creating a just transition away from our current broken capitalist system as we look towards the next couple of years wondering what we can do we'll have to work hard to not only make individual changes but more importantly fight for global and structural changes that will inevitably be made possible by the loud calls of climate action movements so what can you do you can call your government officials March vote for strong climate action oriented candidates take on the labor of educating people who don't think the climate crisis is important and follow or financially support those doing the much needed work and if you need inspiration for all that I put a list of activists in the description below at the end of the day mitigating global climate change is not an easy task while recycling every piece of plastic you find is admirable it won't change the global industrial system that continues to allow thirty six point two billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year to address this problem we need tangible and courageous climate action led by those who are most affected by the climate crisis and supported by all of us we are working to build freedom for all which as Angela Davis puts it requires a constant struggle their annual premium
