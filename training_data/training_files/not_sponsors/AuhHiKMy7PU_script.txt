[Music] hey guys welcome to another video today I'm gonna be doing an IVA inside a video it feels like ages since I've done that I know inside a video I'm not gonna lie I don't even remember the last time I filmed the iron Center video but I know a lot of you guys have been DMing me and also asking a lot of questions a lot of Idol related questions and I thought that I would kind of get back into just filming more I know inside the videos ready to que videos for a while I have been stopping like filming videos and stuff but I am back at it again and I thought that what more than a better way than to stew it with an idol insider video excellently recently took in questions regarding things about managers I feel like I only talked briefly about this topic so that we can kind of go in depth with it there was a lot of things that I wanted to talk about and a lot of questions I thought so many questions and I didn't think that I would so we're just gonna be kind of going right into it fine so the first question that I got and I'm just going to be kind of reading it randomly because I feel like there's no specific order our managers usually close to idols is this relationship only work related mmm I think it really depends on if the manager is sociable and likes to have that type of connection with artists there's all the managers who really are kind of like strict or you know only think of it as work they don't try to get super connected with the idols because they don't know like what might happen yeah that's gonna be kind of like the best way I could put it I know that a lot of female managers are closer with the girl and then male groups are closer with male managers I think that it's just something that is more natural in that way and you can kind of like joke around with them like they're on me or like a hyung but I do think it's a little bit different if it is a sign like a girl group with a male manager and a guy group with a female manager it is just a slight boundary I would say there has to be a boundary either way so I think that in terms of getting close same gender managers are gonna be a little bit more closer with the idols and yeah that question is are they always around the idols do they attend every Showcase award show cetera if this manager is only set for your group then yes they are going to be following you around everywhere all your schedule showcases award shows radio programs music show programs anything that falls into the matter of whatever the Idol is doing they will be with the Idol next up is to keep on managers have strict rules they must follow obviously you can't you know get into a relationship with them because I don't think that the company would want that I do think that in terms of like privacy they do try to keep a fine line of you know knowing when to stop and respect your privacy I think that each entertainment company is going to have stricter policies there are managers who literally wait for the idols to finish a schedule that might be their you know own respective separate schedule apart from like anything that's entertainment related let's just say they're going to go meet a friend but then if a manager might have to stick with somebody because they are assigned to so I do think that it's really different there are a lot of managers who are very free who say okay know what yeah you guys can go meet your friends you know have a coffee but like come in by this time I don't know so I feel like this kind of goes for any new relationship even with like parents to the more are you restrain an idol the more strict you are it is very possible that they will do things without telling the company or the manager because they feel like they need a breather or they need a breather and this is personally something that I went through because I feel like they do give you privacy but sometimes you don't get the freedom you want and I think that a lot of idols struggle with that which is the reason why you see like scandals happening and stuff like I feel like if the companies were a little bit more open about it and said like okay you know what do this do this except tell us and also really we're like on the idols side in terms of like privacy or freedom I think that there would be a lot more communication going on but I think that the communication is restrained because it's so strict that the idols are like you know I don't even want to try telling them then I'm gonna be you know having a drink with my friends or something so they won't tell them it's really ironic but yeah how do they get the job um you apply there are a lot of managers who actually will go to like classes for like management and stuff usually companies will pick them but the number one thing is I think that they do have to drive either way you're gonna be having to take the idols one place to another if you do not have a driver's license then I don't think that you could be like a rule emerge or a manager who's with the idols all the time that would have to be managing something that's totally different either that's going to be like I don't know PR or social like in social media it would be something totally different but you basically apply for the job the companies will either put it on their websites or like job application website places and then you apply and then you have a meeting with the company and then the company will decide if they will assign you with you know a group or if they will have you guys like an internet first get to know the things around the company systems and then they will assign you with an idol what are the typical ages of managers this is really a good question because their managers are really young and then Darren managers who are a lot older I know managers who are the same age as some of the idols so they're like 95 93 you know they just got out of the army they're trying to find a job but I think that being a manager you know some company or just the idol group might be fun so a lot of people actually apply and are really young I've seen a lot of young managers and then also there are a lot of old managers too I would say like thirties sometimes like late 30s and I think that if you're in like your forties they either promote you not as like a road manager or like a manager with them but then maybe like a PR manager so what usually happens is a lot of managers will start off as road managers or they would be assigned to a group and then I think that throughout the years a lot of broadcasting stations will obviously know that you are the manager of a company and then I think that it kind of goes up from there so let's just say you were in the company for six years and they might put you to a higher position like a PR manager it usually just all depends so the next question I got is do artists tell their managers about their relationships mmm I would say that no to be really honest I don't think I told them anything that was really personally deep or just things that were going on in my personal life and that is because you never really know when they're gonna be leaving you never know who they might be telling they might tell their friends and the friends might you know tell other people it's just you're trying to be safe with your personal info too and at the same time it is your personal stuff unless it's like advice and like guy advice I guess like you could just have like not say a name and ask for advice but at the same time like rather than asking a manager I would rather ask a friend or just advice so for me I think that I didn't tell any of my managers about you know relationships or things that we were going on in my personal life but I would say if you are like a solo artist it might be a little bit easier to get closer with a manager because I tend to realize that solo artists and their managers tend to stick together for a longer period of time so you get to really build a relationship with them you know something that is going to be like a healthier relationship and not all hooking a relationship as in like love but I'm talking about like a relationship that you know you can trust them with whatever you tell them so how much do kpop managers normally make mmm I think that this really varies it goes from like really low to really high depending on especially like what girl group or group you might be taking care of what company you're in so this actually varies a lot and also a might vary with how many people you're taking care of because sometimes the managers will be taking care of two teams within the group so let's just say there's a solo artist and then there is going to be a group sometimes they might be managing both because the soloists might not have as much schedules as you know the group or the group might not have many schedules as the artist so they kind of work it out with two of them so I think that it really just depends how much they make do managers watch the idols every move even on dates I really think it depends on the status but even let's just say you are a really big you know idol group and usually big idol groups have sometimes a manager assigned to just them so they'll be like a manager in charge of the and like the group activities but then at the same time when they want to do their solo stuff and just kind of do personal things they will be assigned with a different manager I don't think that the idols will necessarily tell them hey you know I'm gonna go on a date you know and do this because that will probably go back into the company's year so if even a big Idol would to date I don't think that they would know take them and make the manager see them on a date yeah but I think that other things that are like slightly less personal you know either that is like you're out with your friends or you know you might be going to a certain setting and they're okay with the manager being there then I think that it is totally fine okay is it true that there are managers who are manipulative and take stuff and gifts I've heard many stories about this and it sucks because fans give their idols gifts for the idols you know and many times it would be at the company first or the manager will be you know giving it to the idols it it depends because I've heard many stories of when the managers would ask the idols hey like if you don't want this like can I have it I've heard many cases of that personally and then of my managers did that and I think that it's because you know we weren't like the same gender so the types of gifts that we were getting wasn't something that they wanted but a lot of male managers who are under male idol groups there might be cases where the idols get two of the same gifts either they're from different fans or just like a gift you know and they would ask the idols if they don't want it and then they would take it kindly so I don't I don't know if that's like manipulative in no way but I've heard many cases of it and it is true it sucks but yeah I'm not gonna give names but yeah do any of them go as far as helping their idle state I think it really depends on how long you've been an idle let's just say you were an idle for I don't know seven to ten years then maybe they might think that it's okay for you to be in a relationship as long as its secret so you know they might be like oh I are interested in somebody I could kind of like connect you with somebody I feel like a lot of stylists do that more because but they have connections to at the same time stylists are very talkative too so I think it depends the longer you've been an idol I think it's easier for them to kind of connect you with different idols but if you're definitely a rookie that is not going to be possible whatsoever are the managers with the idols 24/7 mmm I think that if it's like a male manager with a male idol group and a female manager with a female idol group most of the times the company will want to save in expenses so they might assign the managers in the dorms whoo so I think that if that happens and of course they are going to be with you 24/7 and I think that if that isn't the case they are gonna be just with you for when they are doing just the normal routines and schedules that Idol does and then when they go home they go home too so that is the question to that do keep up idols and kpop managers date I wouldn't say like there hasn't been cases of that because I dunno like and I heard many rumors like that some group member is dating a manager and stuff I guess it can happen if you think about it because they are you know male female and like there is a possibility that can happen but I wouldn't say it's necessarily common in the industry yeah I would say like more the time it's like like the CEO and like no the next one is did you have any managers you loved working with this is a good question for me I have three managers I would say they all had their ups and downs I think that those definitely some managers who are better at certain things and certain managers who are better at managing certain things oh yeah so one person did ask any bad experiences with managers so if you are interested in a story I do have a bad experience with a manager and yeah I don't think I've ever really told anyone about it like I haven't know I don't think I've told anyone but I think that I am okay with telling people so if you guys are interested in that if this video gets up to I don't know 4000 likes I will make a video on that matter do they leave or do part-time jobs I think that it's really hard to do a part-time job if you are a manager because an idle schedule is never like a routine their schedule is going to be all over the place sometimes they might only have one schedule sometimes they might have three schedule sometimes they might i'ma schedule at all so I think that it really is hard to have a part-time job especially a part-time job because part-time jobs are buy time and you can't necessarily say oh yeah you know you could do a part-time job after you know idle stud with their schedules an idle schedule is always going to change so if you are gonna be a manager you can probably only be a manager unless you're doing a part-time job that doesn't require you to necessarily be there and be present then maybe they might but I don't think so on at the same time like a manager kind of gets like okay pay like good pay so I don't think that a lot of people will be doing a part-time job and they're so exhausted that I don't think they'll even have the energy to do a part-time job but do all of them drive safely I've heard some scary stories wow this is a really good question uh sometimes the company might have schedules back-to-back and sometimes one schedule might go longer than they expected which means that the next schedule you have to be there as fast as possible there was many times where we had schedules back-to-back and as many dangerous situations - like in the car I literally would get anxiety because we will literally be going like past cars going from lane to Lane and that is why you might see some cases and articles saying that you know idle groups get into car accidents because it really is serious and I hated it like I would literally tell like the company I wish you guys wouldn't you know have scheduled us back to back or have them like too tight because you know it gives the members anxiety and by the time we're already at our second schedule were very flustered and stressed out because you know we were like rushed and like we had to be there and leaders in the car like you know holding on for dear lives but I think that most of the time if it isn't back-to-back and you have the time to just kind of go to a schedule normally then that is not the case but I think that safe driving isn't there when schedules are closer to each other do they become friends with the idols they manage I think I think I'm friends with a lot of staff members either that is like stylist or like hair stylists but I don't think I necessarily became friends with managers also because all of the managers that I was assigned with they were a lot older so they were always like in their 30s or you know late 30s they were all like very veterans in just managing and being a manager because they were managers for like ten years so I think that it just never really got to get close to a manager that was the same age because I've never assigned with a manager who were the same age but it would have been nice I think that would have been really fun yeah do they manage your money no the company manages the money the manager doesn't manage the money they might be managing the receipts because when you are with the manager and you're with them most of the time they're going to be paying with the company card so the manager will be in charge of the receipts that they need to bring to the company so that they could write it down in just a bank akari so I think that in terms of like the expenses that they you that you use as an idol when you're with the manager they will be in charge of that and I also the manager to just go home I don't think you can I think they'll think it's shady in a way other than the fact if you tell them the truth like hey I'm gonna be going you know meeting up with a friend for lunch you know I'll join the schedule after don't worry that might be a better option but then if you just tell them to leave you think that it might be weird what I usually did and how I kind of gained the trust of my managers would be okay hey I'm gonna have lunch with a friend and I really do have lunch with a friend let's just say it's it like shinta and then I'm like hey I'm gonna run with a friend at 12 I think that I'll be done around 4 can you pick me up and then he will pick me up with my friend being there and I think that I have that a couple of times and it did that very frequently because it was comfortable to do you know obviously like picked up back because then I don't need to go wherever I need to go to the next schedule by myself so I think that this was a way for my managed to know that I was really telling the truth not me to see the things that I didn't want to tell him probably didn't so yeah my managers assigned two trainees and then they stick with them if the artists debut if the trainees are set for our debut like you know only a couple months there might be a manager who is assigned to them you know it takes them to the company or takes them from the dorm to the company it's only when it is going to be kind of finalized I feel like they are set and they stick with you throughout the whole time and yeah hope that answered your question do they ever have free time or time off or do they work pretty much do 65 days hmm this really depends on the situation there are times when the idol might not have schedules at all but at the same time they're still getting paid to work right so you would think okay if Idol doesn't have any schedules then the managers could just do whatever they want but that isn't necessarily the case I would say that they still have to be promoting you either going to a broadcasting station you know going to give your CDs to people so that they know who you are it is different I think that when idols rest is when the managers rest so for example I should say the idols get a week to rest then I think the company will give the manager a week to rest as well and it usually goes like that so the group is going to be given a day and the companies like you guys can rest today then I think that sometimes they might tell the managers to rest too because managers honestly need time to rest I think that they work harder than the idols because if you think about it there you have to be up earlier than the idols to go pick them up and they're gonna be sleeping later than the idols to drop them off and doing you know going back home so they are going to be constantly more tired because idols can always rest in the car why there that's like a three-hour giant to go to a next schedule an idol can sleep but the manager has to be in charge of driving the car and really just like being there for them so think that just like it's so much respect because if you think about it in the end of the day they're doing so much for you this is a good question do idols get to have a say in who the manager is like gender-wise Oh up to some point but usually the company just assigns you with the manager I remember funny story I remember there was a time where we were assigned with two male managers like back-to-back you know one was our manager quit and then it was another male manager and that male manager at the same time was like you know one and I want to quit so our company was actually thinking about getting a female manager and also living with us we were like no no no no no no no like we want our part of the city you know we've been getting our privacy and if you think that it's unfair that now you assign us with a female manager and you know we're not going to be getting the privacy that we originally had and I remember this is what we told the company that we wanted to continue having male managers because we felt like it was more comfortable so yeah I think that it's preference there are a lot of like girl groups that like female managers and don't mind living with them but honestly like I didn't want to live with a manager because that means less freedom and you can't really do anything much they're gonna be with you in a dorm you can't be yourself in the door I'm like how stressful is this even though you guys have separate rooms like I just say let's just say for example your Ida boob has to be on a diet or they need to do like something you can't eat so for us like a diamond stressful at the same time I should say you want to just meet a friend really quick outside I can't do that because you enjoy your manager cuz I'm living with you so I personally like didn't want a female manager and I'm pretty sure this goes for any male idols who lived with a male manager or any female idols who lived with the female manager there's so many funny stories that I've heard like you know the wait for the manager to sleep and then there's like so many stories of China like sneak out that's what happens like you put a restriction on the idols thinking that it's gonna be obviously like more better for them but they're just gonna go all the way around trying to do things behind the back like that's like the real honest fact so yeah any entertainment companies who know how to speak English they're gonna do stuff like regardless having the manager there they will do stuff regardless believe regardless eat regardless like no so don't do they yell at you I would say yeah I think yelled before I think I've been yelling like like four or five times not like me like separately but like as a group we got yelled at because we tried to lead practice early we got yelled at because we were late you know coming to the practice room or you know coming late for like waking up late to go to a schedule not doing too well at a music show program yeah I think that those are like the cases where you feel that it's not like okay like you know that type of yelling it's more like just the whole atmosphere it's like really tense they really like tell you like straight up and yeah I think that there was many cases we were late to go somewhere and that's because one of the members really really had a hard time waking up in the morning and yeah I think that definitely solve Avaya Donzi managers feeling as epoxy idols during this stage practices are these things where it is pretty rare I think that the manager who do fill in for the members definitely have to be somewhat like good at dancing in a way for them to even memorize the dances I don't think if I think about it now I don't think any of my managers would have been able to literally fill in for one of the members yeah usually it would either be like a backup dancer who would go in for one of the members because the backup dancers know the choreography but if not I don't think my managers would have been able to do that so yes it is a very unique case I would say I've never heard or experienced a creepy manager story yeah so I think that if you guys like I said I have full stories this video gets up to 4,000 mics I will be telling you a story keep my managers control the idols phones I wouldn't know no the company might control like who you're keeping in contact with in the beginning stages of my triny or even like right when you debut but I don't think that the managers will be checking your phone constantly and they're gonna be checking your phone constantly like - what does not even have a phone so what I did to keep most of my comments and my texts confidential is sometimes it would have our phones and if you go to our schedule and then our managers will hold our phones but you don't know at that time you know who's gonna be texting you or just whatever so what I would do it I would turn off my notifications for like a messenger app and then I would give my phone or I would either put it on airplane mode or turn off the data and then give them the phone because I think that it's just a messy situation let's just say they had your phone and I don't know somebody texted you it's not it doesn't even have to be like you're dating Ben we're like you're just like friends with them but they're not gonna believe that you're just friends know like if a guy text teksu they're gonna think something so for me that's what I did yeah and one more that I have is are they strict as the company or are they nice I would say generally most of the times managers aren't nicer that is just my personal experience and I do think that the company tells them to be respectful to and to just kind of really be there for the idols because there are times when the communication between a company and an idol might not be going well it is the manager's job to really tell the company side in a good way and also for the manager to tell the idols side to the company in a good way so I do think that my manager were a lot nicer than you know my company people but yeah I think that that is the answer to the question I think that I pretty much read most of the comments because a lot of the comments were very similar I hope you guys enjoyed this video it was really fun making the video you guys have any more questions I would try to answer it on the comments down below it's been a while since I made Island cider video I hope you guys really enjoyed it it would mean a lot if you guys can give it a thumbs up or you know shares a video even write down on the comments because it would really mean a lot to me and give me more strength to you know film and stuff because it's been a while since I've been like China coming back into it and yeah it was fine bye [Music] [Applause]
