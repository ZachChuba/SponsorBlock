every first Tuesday in November people from all around Australia stopped to watch the Melbourne carp so what is it exactly it's Australia's most famous annual thoroughbred horse race first held in 1861 with a prize pool of approximately 8 million dollars today the race is one of the most popular spectator events in Australia attracting crowds of over 110 thousand people a gathering of horses celebrities freaky jockeys with girly voices - in the game Daryl sandy you get after a v-twin you just can't explain those amazing highs and people who come together to place a bet and watch a race most punters dress in traditional formal wear dapper gentleman in their best suits and elegant ladies in their finest frocks parade around the grounds promoting the events reputation of elegance and style [Music] [Music] but in reality we all know what the Melbourne Cup is really about pissed up bogans and lots of them every year we wait to see the antics of drunken blokes and skanky chicks we've made right [ __ ] of themselves at the races everything from brawls very public vomiting to behavior bordering along the meter movement standards cup day is one that never lets you down and we'll get into lose [Music] I'm drunk I'm Maggie you maggot yeah never heard of that one yeah yeah you know these maggot right a man I'm right in there shit's going crazy it's getting my news on YouTube [Music] [Applause] [Music] you said I had a nice package oh sorry I missed it mr. turbit that I'm just so used to the other one and this year was no exception there was plenty of drunk people rolling around in the grass a buffet of self-declared hot slots cringy dance moves what were they thinking outfits so he takes me years to come out said that he sign up face and horrendous drunk singing [Music] here we see a drunken fight break out at the front of the uber pickup after the company announced it wouldn't be running its service due to technical problems well footage is emerged of an ugly brawl at Melbourne Cup five men are seen throwing punches and wrestling to the ground near the uber pickup area at Flemington it's not known what sparked that fight but a technical glitch meant major delays for punters waiting to over home from the event I have seen blood going on everywhere and security wasn't really really great to deal with this but fight had broken up by the time police arrived and finally adding to the spectacle was this year's group of protesters every year the militant protestors come out to voice their outrage at the treatment of horses they get out their signs and images of dead horses and take to the streets they do all they can to piss people off including disrupting traffic and halting the train line that leads to the race grounds to make sure that line is clear it has been targeted in the past by protesters the subject of animal welfare and mistreatment of horses definitely had opinions divided some appalled at the cruelty and some who thought the protests were over-the-top suggesting that the horses in general were treated very humanely kids in Africa die everyday in the Middle East and no one says anything about it a couple horses died and everyone starts crying I've seen family friends who take care of racehorses and they're very well taken care of and then of course there were those more indifferent I definitely would not have come if I hadn't already paid for the tickets and my friends had to come down yep I definitely would not have come but I did spend a shitload of money on a ticket and organized my whole day around this so you know whatever forces our yemeni was there to talk to some of the protesters who are the protesters from last week I'm telling you give that check it they were charged for punching a police horse in the face he brought up the question of what would happen to seventy thousand horses in the industry if racing was effectively banned there's about seventy thousand horses now in the industry what's gonna happen to some suggested sanctuaries and horse retirement plans you know like a horse pension there's no what there's no kind of retirement plan they go two centuries they'll be looked after and then the whole industry be slowly phased out but the reality would most likely be they'd just be slaughtered they're gonna be unwanted and discarded they're gonna be slaughtered or are you a you the subject of horse privilege was raised have you ever been to the stables where they raise these losses I'll tell you right now you should go and check it out because if they treat humans that way I would love to be the horse as well as horse consent they said that the horses don't consent that's bat consent consent drug dogs they don't consent oh you're against anything that uses you against walking dogs really but it didn't take long before police told him his presence was antagonizing the protesters by you know asking them for their opinions he was escorted away as to not further trigger the air rage mob you leave but they have you have you will you leave you've been a negative influence cow but whether you were there to watch and enjoy the roses or protest them at least both sides could agree it was a great opportunity to have a drink and get pissed hey young brother that is such a chicken in Michigan in my opted to [ __ ] [ __ ] so you guys might actually care about the horses your this year to go anyway that's all for this video but I'll leave you with a mix of some of the best Melbourne Cup drunk photos I could find [Music] so anyway that was the 2019 Melbourne Cup
