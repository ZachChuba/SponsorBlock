this week's episode ooh it is special cowboy beef wellington with a homemade mushroom soup with a little white wine in it you're gonna want to get this and you ain't even gonna have to get dressed up to go [Music] hey thank y'all for stopping by the barn today for another episode of cowboy they'll get right back to you on Pony Express and anything you need to know as always will be listed in the little description for the recipe and everything that we use here in this video so let's get started and let's talk about this beef wellington you won't - now the Duke of Wellington here you know a big victory he did what was it the victory at Waterloo Waterloo where were you at Waterloo he was the winner and he brought home and man they thinking man we have got to celebrate this grand occasion so they fixed him this little pastry deal with beef included in the inside and it was called what what what is the Schengen Beef Wellington and today we're using two six ounce fillets that are certified angus beef and they've been aged to about 28 days maybe a little longer because i had them in the icebox just wait for this deal my mouth has been watered well you can see we've got they're burning it over here under the Stargazer on about medium heat let's take about a tablespoon of olive oil and just splash in there which is about that much because we need a little lubrication to go in there so these things will be just right what are we going to season these with what do y'all expect Red River Ranch originated yes and a piece of meat like this you need to cope very well sides top bottom everywhere now I took these out about 30 minutes ahead of time to let them warm up a little just make sure everybody's got some of that love on it now y'all have seen me use lime juice in the past to tenderize meat because it is a natural tenderizer but folks this is a for life it don't need no help I promise you that so we got them in their little olive oil good and hot three minutes each side that's what we're gonna shoot for that's what we're gonna do we've got the little iPhone or go in there so we'll go to three turn it over do another 3 that's 6 minutes in Oklahoma well 3 minutes one side three minutes the next bring them over here and let them rest now some of you might be thinking well I could have had my dough made that we're going to use and then set them right in no you'll overcook that if you bring these out here hot and then put them in a dough and then back in the hot oven you want to let these things cool off a little and we're going to let them cool off while we make our little mushroom sauce that goes on them so stick around now in that exact same skillet that we pulled them two fillets out already so we've got this good stuff that's already down in here in it we're gonna add another tablespoon of olive oil two tablespoons of butter so our butter has melted but it has mixed without olive oil some diced onion some mushrooms and you can use whatever brand you want just don't dig them out of yours because I don't think they're good for you now we just want to brown these in this butter and olive oil to them onions and the mushrooms get good and soft and tender let's go ahead and pour them two garlic cloves in there and then was honking big ones the worst messed up pretty nice go ahead and stir them around and when you get it mixed well I want you to then take a tablespoon and a half of all-purpose flour sprinkle it all the way around cause we need to thicken that up and we're going to cook this till it sort of reduces down there and gets everybody covered well so you can see things is happening just wrap there are things a brand that flour has got a good coating on everybody so we're gonna add us 1/2 a cup of that peanut grid-view fourth of a cup of heavy cream I wish y'all was here cause the aroma coming off of that you ain't doing nothing but just speaking to me like saying now right now is a good time to what I'd be calling we're just gonna let this go too it thickens and we just want a simmer it ain't gonna take long we're going to turn that down on low when you got it to that point right there and that's what I call thick enough to deal with I got me about three of them little thyme sprigs and I just want to break some of that over there because to me time brings such a great flavor to beef and also to a good mushroom soup this dog will hunt and it is a done deal so let's take him off the burner now a lot of folks would be telling you you got to use a puff pastry dough have y'all ever made that stuff I have you get the dough right you put it in there and you mash it fold it up in a square put it in ice box let it set long get it come back out you do this over and over again - you got arthritis in your hands and you can't bend your elbows that way you can't do the macaroni dance like we did last week so what are we going to use you know the cowboy was gonna throw Oklahoma twist in there we're gonna use some canned biscuits and what you call these kind of biscuits anybody know Shane you know what you call them wackos that's what they are for sure now I've done this with crescent rolls but they don't hold up as well to me so I have done it with sourdough but I really like the way these old grande biscuits come out and guess what I didn't have to make no dough you're gonna need to put two of these together so we can get her sort of to go in here we'll just go ahead and do this with our thumbs and binders for a minute to where we can get it sort of in this capacity because we need to make about a seven inch circle if we can you little flyer both sides get your rolling pin go to work you want to turn them over every once in a while sort of like making a flour tortilla they'll roll out better and help shrink back this fast now I like to go ahead and just take me about a spoonful of this and spread it down here cause I'd hate for the bottom not to see none of this love and then just nestle this creature right down in there with it and then we're gonna put uh some right here on top time to cover the wagon sheet over the wagon it is go ahead and pull it all up everywhere you can get it now if it tries to pull apart which this may do guess what it means either some water or a little egg wash in there to hold it and a lot of folks be telling me this is also what you call the bottom side so we're gonna put him just like that right there the cooking vessel today I want to cook it in is a 12-inch Dutch oven now if he is cooking this in the house you would already preheated that oven to 425 degrees and you want to put this in a big enough casserole dish or piece of cast iron that it don't be binding together no work now we're ready to go but we're gonna give this just a little coating of butter and let's just sit him right in here ever so gently you can see he's got some room on each side and we'll put the other little partner right in here with him now what would a fancy dinner be if we didn't try to get fancy now you notice I am not worried you can't get full-on fancy apron today because I'm fitting to dress these up I'm gonna impress Shannon and the Beagle there's plenty of them biscuits in that can so we're gonna decorate the Trump like it's a Christmas mall we are look good don't they so we're gonna put them over here on a tall trivet really light coals underneath light coals on top because we're just gonna cook this till it Browns and warmth throughout let all that mushroom getting this good with that filet and we are gonna eat some fine well you see me loaded up pretty light around the bottom pretty light on top now we're sitting on a trivet probably about a five and a half inch tribute we are that's one way that you can regulate your heat you can always adjust your trivet height shorter or taller now where did we get them coals I know a lot of you ain't got no birthday and birthdays in the bar and taking a nap so we drugged the washtub up but I don't want to be burning this a wife's fault that's under here and you might not want to be blistering your concrete set it on some bricks or something that you can raise it up off the ground put you some hardwood lump in there and then you can start it you won't blister a thing now this is more like cooking a biscuit in a way because we're going to brown the bottom of that get that crust all the way around on the top sides and everywhere it will heat through back up birds where that filet is and that it'll be fine dining so we're going to just keep an eye on it we will have to rotate the lid one way bottom the other because we do have just a little breeze [Music] [Applause] so while we're waiting on that to cook let's talk about these knife aid folks good people they are you get to think it I've heard that night well they was known short tank not too long ago did y'all see that episode this company has made sharpening knives easy I'd send them this old handmade paring knife because that thing is so hard to get an edge on an old stainless steel knife that I use as much as anything a good boning knife always like this little short chef's knife but I broke the point off of it long time ago now I've been sharpening knives a long time and I can put an edge on a knife but I get dents and I get dings in them the thing that I really love about these people is they took care all that I sent it to him it come back just like it was factory I mean I couldn't even tell it it ever been broke that's what is so good about this company they'll sharpen them they'll do repairs you'll be thinking they're brand new time they got back to you and it don't take long for this to happen it's not a membership deal you can use it once never use it again you ain't got to pay no dues to be able to send all this in that is so helpful Savior just a home cook and you ain't for sure about how to get that precise angle on that edge or maybe you messed it up you can sink it in they will fix it there was a time in my life that I was going away from home and my mother had arthritis pretty bad in one hand and she couldn't sharpen a knife real good she loved a sharp knife but when I'd come home late bee said oh you couldn't understand it she would have used these people too so it's not just for the professional chefs not just for the cowboy it's for anybody that wants to get a good knife sharpened they get them back to you they will fix some of the repairs in there whether it's a broken tip or little dings in there they'll get that fixed it is a great gift ideal Santa will be won't [Music] [Applause] [Music] well it is a done deal it is you can see by looking at this thing it is done all the way around we don't want this to be sakra see I wanted to have a little bit of that doughy texture to it so when we cut in there everything will be good now you see me I had to rake some of the coals to the outside edge all the way around the top of that oven and then pull them a little ways from the bottom around there this is sort of hard to cook because we're really pretty close to that lid as we were getting up there with all this big massive amount of dough that we got on there but it can be done just use less heat than you think you actually need you can always add coals to it but it's hard to take them away after then and got to brown or burn so start with less Heat we'll add it if we need it you see me also reaching there with that fork can pull that edge up to where I can sort of see that browning but really that is about touch - I could tell that that was getting the firm enough that we was going to be done well I think it's time to find out if them knife aid boys did a very good job now I don't know if you can hear that but that's sort of what I wanted on the top and I'm just gonna cut just to where we can see them in there and it cuts like butter let's just go ahead and pull it out of there looky there things are blooming inside they are you got this good mixture of this mushrooms and everything and look at this here it is what you call just right the colour I've been getting chastised for not letting the baby eat first where you get big there you go buddy how many tail wags for some beef wellington quite a few I hope so now it's time for your dad to have a bite are you gonna do the Duke of Wellington down I'm gonna do the Duke of Wellington last time last time I eat beef you all see me do some of these now I'm gonna do some of these if he was at one of them five-star Michelin tire diners is that what they're called chin Michelin tyres we didn't kick the tires this is five-star dining right here ain't it big folks that's our mushroom soup is the star of this deal now whether it's a special occasion or you just want to read some really good beef this is what it's all about this is something that I guarantee you will warm your heart and soul and I want to thank everybody at the knife they what you
