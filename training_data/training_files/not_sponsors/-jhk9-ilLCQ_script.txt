hi guys in today's video I'm trying popular one ingredients lime recipes and two ingredients lime recipe before we the orb cybercafe product find out more in the description for the first note that we're gonna need some peel-off facemask and peel off face muscles great because it contains PVA which is the same thing include which helps them make slime and then for our activator we're gonna be using yogi foot part that makes your feet basically not smell so a lot of you might have this around your homes you guys said that you did and you recommended adding it into glue so I decided to make this no glue and no borax by just using face masks and when I was mixing in it wasn't pulling away so I was really nervous that didn't work with the face mask I like you see here it was still very liquidy so I put it in the freezer for 10 minutes and when it came out it was literally as slow as you can see here I was shocked it really did not look like it was putting together  and then all of a sudden it became a slime after 10 minutes so I started playing with it a bit more and it was stretchy but it did melt down the more you were playing with it I found as soon as you put it back in the freezer it did fix and I decided to customize it with some glitters and like you can see here it looks super pretty out of some nice crunches and I acted just like a slider the only real difference was that this could became sticky the more you played with it and I've become sticky in a couple of minutes and if you put it in the freezer for a longer time it wouldn't be sticky at all but it also wouldn't stretch too much I would say this is a success I was so impressed as soon as I took out of the freezer and it was actually a slime so I decided to add this into real slime to see what would happen then I added it into a bottle slime and at first it was sticky and then the more I was needing it it just lost all of its thick and it came a really nice textured doughy slime [Music] after that amazing experience I decided to move on to another one that I was really excited to try and this is using palm olive dish soap and also egg whites and apparently the egg white cements they're kind of you know activates it pull it all together and I've always found with dish soap things apart from when you add in corn starch that this just doesn't work dish soap for me is always awful we don't have dawn over here so maybe that's the issue but people told me that Palmolive will work and like you can see here it didn't I put it in the freezer it didn't kind of come together I then put it in the fridge it didn't come together it just froze at the side so this is definitely a fail and then I use stick and again this was one that I was very excited to try just because obviously gum is quite sticky in your mouth so I did think this have become a slime very easily and it did I just kept dipping it in the warm water I guess it was kind of acting like a mouth chewing and it became a very stretchy so I had to do the women slime test and I added it into normal slime and I made sure this is sugar-free so I thought it wouldn't melt and I thought would become really nice but the slime actually melted and this gun was just like stringy in it it didn't mix it then I moved on to the most recommended method I have a half cos in ever and this is adding clay dough and shaving foam and play-doh method again a one that never work when you add it into normal slime it melts down so I knew even if this did work I wouldn't be trying will it slide because it slugs do not ever do that but when I was mixing in it was very hard to mix it at first because player has a really unique texture so when I was mixing this in I had to like push it down to the table and like smoosh it for it to even start to and I did find this was very nice and doughy it didn't stretch but it was really really fun to play with in your hands it was definitely a lot more different from the original play-doh texture so I would say this is kind of a success but yeah I was not willing to try Woollett slime with this thank you so much for watching this video I really hope that you enjoyed it and if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up and subscribe and I will see you at the end of this week
