breaking news as we go on the air Memphis freshman James Wiseman the projected number one pick in the 2020 NBA Draft has been declared ineligible the NCAA had said that Wiseman was ineligible after receiving improper benefits like Zion Williamson last year James Weisman is this year's potential number one overall pick and whatever he lacks in the hype that Zion Williamson received he makes up for in sheer and utter controversy today we're gonna discuss James Wiseman the basketball player but we're also gonna delve into the controversy that are surrounding him at the University of Memphis because it's a very incredible story that dates all the way back to the year of 2008 so yes this story has been going on since James Wiseman was a 7 year old but journey James Wiseman was born in Nashville Tennessee very close to Memphis where he would end up going to college just like many other of today's NBA prospects he was part of the AAU circuit and in 2017 he would eventually become United with his potential head coach Penny Hardaway Penny Hardaway went to Memphis in 1991 to 1993 and he eventually would get picked number three overall in the 1993 NBA Draft right after Chris Webber and Shawn Bradley but he would get traded for Chris Webber who was the number one overall pick to the Orlando Magic to form a phenomenal tandem and give Shaquille O'Neal the teammate that he has been missing all of those years and unfortunately for penny these look these next six years from 1993 to 99 would be probably his best years to give you an idea of how good penny was in only his second year for the Orlando Magic who by the way were just in their second year of inception this is an expansion team we're talking about he averaged 21 points seven assists 1.7 steals and four rebounds per game off the 51% shooting but that's not what today's video is about the fact of the matter is penny went to Memphis and he played a huge role in recruiting James Weisman now you might be wondering how that could be well it all started in 2008 immediately after Penny Hardaway retired he decided to donate 1 million dollars to the University of Memphis for the completion of the Penny Hardaway all of fame the irony of this donation cannot be lost in this situation because Hardaway donated a million dollars in 2008 eleven years before he became the coach of Memphis so fast forward to 2016 and Memphis's head coach Josh Pastner decides to accept the head coaching gig at Georgia Tech Memphis responds to this by hiring tubby smith it is official 64 year old legendary coach Orlando tubby smith will lead the Tigers as the 18th head coach of the University of Memphis men's basketball program more than a year and a half later in August of 2017 this is where James Weisman gets into the picture Wiseman moves from his hometown of Nashville to Memphis transferring from the prestigious ends Werth high school to East High School to finish his high school career now this is pretty interesting because if you are a potential NBA draft prospect if you're starting to garner the hype that you are which at the time James Wiseman was completely dominating the competition as a high school basketball player he was crushing it in the AAU circuit and his name was beginning to circulate now this move is pretty much the centerpiece of the argument for why the n-c-double-a is saying that James Weisman is ineligible for this upcoming NC double-a season and it's the fact of the matter that apparently Penny Hardaway paid about eleven thousand five hundred dollars to assist the Wiseman family with their move to Memphis and the reason why this is so shady is because before this all happened before penny assisted the Wiseman family at all James Wiseman was really considering signing his letter of intent to play with Kentucky and I could not blame him for doing so Kentucky has already had a pedigree of grooming potential number one overall big men into even having very successful careers off the top of my head you could already think of Anthony Davis DeMarcus Cousins and karl-anthony towns so you could understand that John Calipari the head coach of the University of Kentucky and Kentucky kind of had issue with this entire situation and after several months of interviews and after you of documentation it was determined in the summer of 2017 while James was a high school student and prospective student athlete Penny Hardaway provided eleven thousand five hundred dollars in moving expenses to assist the Wiseman family in their relocation to Memphis unbeknownst to James according to the statement from the University of Memphis now hmm this sounds a little sketchy in my opinion you're telling me that Penny Hardaway showed up at the Weizmann door and said hey guys I will pay you eleven thousand five hundred dollars to help you with your move and James Wiseman knew nothing about it I really find that personally I apologize for giving you guys my opinion as opposed to the whole story I find that to be a little Shady let me know in the comment section what you guys think but in March of 2018 the University of Memphis would fire their head coach Tubby Smith after two seasons and a combined 40 and 26 record missing the NCAA tournament in both of those years less than a week after firing Smith Memphis hired Penny Hardaway to take over but in the month of September to November 2018 Wiseman would take multiple unofficial visits and he would take official visits to Kentucky Kansas Vanderbilt and Florida State Wiseman would wrap up his visits with an official trip to Memphis on October 26 and then Wiseman would then make his commitment to the University of Memphis on November 20th and would sign nine days later on the 29th after long consideration I will be attending the University of the University of [Applause] if you fast forward to May 29 2009 teen according to a statement released by the University of Memphis James Wiseman was actually declared eligible by the NCAA in May of 2019 following a joint standard eligibility review by the University and the n-c-double-a so in the very beginning the n-c-double-a reviewed the entire situation and said okay this situation is cool were a fairly shady organization anyways we could kind of let this slip through the cracks because he is a very high ranking prospect on Halloween of 2019 the NCAA would send a letter to the University of Memphis notifying them of their more recent interpretation of bylaws one week later on November 5th 2019 the University of Memphis would receive a letter from the NCAA stating that due to their new interpretation of bylaws and resulting in recruiting violations James Weisman would now be deemed ineligible according to this situation Wiseman did not engage in legal counsel to file a temporary restraining order in sue the NCAA and the University of Memphis until Thursday November 7th the day prior to the announcement of the NCAA's decision the very next day through his legal counsel Wiseman would announced that the NCAA ruled him ineligible and standing alongside his counsel and head coach Penny Hardaway Wiseman filed an injunction late in the day approximately an hour prior to the Tigers tip against the University of illinois-chicago the local court granted the injunction and the University of Memphis allowed Wiseman to play the 7-foot one Center finished the game with 17 points nine rebounds and five blocks in only 25 minutes of play and this is kind of weird and ironic because earlier in the day Ohio State's star defensive end chase young was also suspended by the NCAA for accepting a loan from a family friend that was reportedly paid back in full and it's really interesting because it's very similar to the Wiseman situation now if you fast forward to just more recently a couple days ago on November 14 2019 Wiseman and his legal team were voluntarily non suiting the case which means that they were dropping their lawsuit against the n-c-double-a with Chase young suspension being reduced from four games to two games as well Wiseman and his legal team feel like they can work out a similar compromise with the n-c-double-a and that's pretty much where we stand right now - in order to really show good faith in the NCAA the University of Memphis also announced that Wiseman would be ineligible this season Wiseman already applied for reinstatement and there are still no details about a potential suspension for the seven-foot one Center but you know the University of Memphis actually released a statement regarding Wiseman and his eligibility saying in order to move the matter forward the university has declared Wiseman ineligible for competition and will immediately apply for his reinstatement pending that notification James will be withheld from competition but will continue to practice with the team the NCAA is fully aware of the unique nature and challenges in this particular case and the University is confident that the NCAA will render a fair and equitable decision consistent with its mission to summarize the situation a Memphis hall-of-famer or a Memphis Tigers legend Penny Hardaway decided to donate money to Memphis awhile ago and eventually would help James Wiseman move his entire family from Nashville to Memphis before accepting the job at Memphis so this was seen as pretty shady and in my opinion it does sound pretty shady when it comes to James Wiseman as the prospect however I had to just mention this and I know I might get destroyed in the comments so let me know if you agree with me or disagree with me I don't think he should be the number one overall pick in this year's draft not because of the way he's been treated but just because of his skillset currently James Wiseman's game so far based off of what I've seen it's very based off of the post he has phenomenal footwork and he kind of reminds me of Joel embiid to a lesser degree though it's a significantly lesser degree but that's kind of what people are going for at least that's the best case scenario in regards to his post game however his game resembles more that he's getting the comparison to Nikol elusive itch a lot because his game is so raw he could dominate inside but he doesn't really have an outside game and to be a dominant center in today's NBA you need to be able to hit the outside shot so why would you want to spend a top five pick on a player that could only dominate inside is still fairly raw as a prospect is still gonna need to be developed and cannot hit the perimeter jumper I would much rather take one of the more exciting guards as in Anthony Edwards or Alamelu ball with my number one overall pick but that just things based off of how they stand right now I just see a lot of jahlil okafor in James Weisman and that is who I'm going to pretty much compare him to until further notice I think he's just jahlil okafor with way way better defense and a way better ability to grab rebounds but let me know in the comments section what you guys think and if maybe there's something that I'm missing about James Wiseman here that you guys can make me privy about if you guys enjoy the content be sure to subscribe or click on this video on your screen to check out one of my other videos
