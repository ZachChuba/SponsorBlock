many of you criticized our coverage of the Google pixel forest camera when we declared it to be on par with the iPhone 11 pro and pro max and one of the biggest critiques was our failure to address Apple's deep fusion computational photography feature which at the time was in beta so now that it's out for real we are taking that opportunity to reopen the case of iPhone versus pixel 20:19 Edition and for good measure we've thrown in both the note 10 and the mate 30 Pro with pulse weight free account today at the link in the video description [Music] let's start off with a quick explanation of deep fusion and how it works when the feature is active the iPhones camera is constantly buffering in the background in the buffer the camera takes for standard exposure shots as well as for short exposure shots with a final long exposure shot at the very end once the shutter button is actually pressed the iPhone then blends the best elements of the short exposure shots making a reference frame then it blends the standard exposure shots and the long exposure shot making a synthetic long frame the reference frame and the synthetic long frame are then run through more processing pixel-by-pixel to improve the appearance of sky hair skin and textures like fabrics all of this happens within about a second or two of pressing the shutter so that is great that Apple has managed to cram a bunch of processing steps into just a couple seconds of a shutter press but does it really make that much of a difference the answer is yes some of the time so deep fusion adds more detail and sharpness without the undesirable effects that we commonly associate with normal image sharpening so check out this shot of a petrol Canada gas station upon immediate inspection honestly the two images don't look that different but check out these roof tiles in the background our deep fusion shot clearly retains more detail here but without any ugly noise or sharpening artifacts as for the grilles here and the concrete segment lines in this nighttime boat shot while the lines are both easily resolvable even if we zoom way in on both of the images what's notable is that there are no dark pixels that are out of line the line is much straighter and much finer again here in this Bentley parking lot our deep fusion shot is better but this one the effect is definitely more subtle and we can mostly see it here in the sign as for this night boat shot the building in the background here is one of the best examples that we've seen a deep fusion of working its magic it is so clearly so much better defined than the non deep fusion shot as a best-case scenario that one actually makes a lot of sense deep vision was designed for medium to low light so it hits nicely right in the middle of smart HDR and apple's new night mode but the thing is guys if you were expecting this technique to dramatically change the quality of the photos you take on your iPhone you probably haven't been paying much attention to the multi frame capture techniques that are widespread in the industry even at Apple already so while the technique may be unlike what we've seen before the result is not that different in those cases so let's change gears here and compare the iPhone with all of the weapons at its disposal to our other phones this dim incandescent lit restaurant with afternoon daylight outside is an extremely challenging situation and it's one of the shots that actually made me doubt my conclusion about the pixel for the window in the back here is completely blown out and the contrast II look of the pixel is not doing our subjects face any favors the note 10 actually handled this shot the best in terms of skin tone with the iPhone winning out on overall dynamic range and detail thanks in part here to diffusion though I should know that in my opinion the iPhone image makes our subject skin look a little bit too pasty due to the iPhones more lifted look to skin now let's use this shot to talk about the way that the iPhone handles shadows on the face now to me the layperson this image honestly looks wonderful and I would pick it first out of the lineup every time but brandon has an understandable bone to pick with Apple about the way that they processed it now the pixel for image clearly has deeper shadows under the chin and the eyes making our subject look more tired to my eye I mean who would want that but given that this was shot under overhead light the pixels image is actually a lot closer to how she actually at that time so Apple is tinkering with the image a lot here and when they get it right the subject ends up looking like a doll which is great for posting to Instagram but when you tinker with lighting you can also end up losing a lot of the perceived depth and the character of the shot as for Samsung they're clearly going after an Apple s look so if you like that aesthetic then they did great but the image comes out a bit softer than Apple and the only nice thing that I can say about huawei's effort is that their larger sensor seems to be contributing to a really great natural bokeh in the background here moving into a studio situation the iPhone and mate 30 pro both had trouble white balancing to our daylight balanced lighting here in the studio where the pixel 4 and the note 10 both delivered a pleasing warm image punching in even with deep fusion I would actually give the edge in detail to the pixel 4 with the note 10 doing a pretty good job as well and that pattern of the pixel for being sharper overall is one that was actually quite consistent throughout our testing as you can see in these images apple's team with or without deep fusion has clearly made the choice of taking a less contrasting approach to their image sharpening but a lot of the time people like a more neutral less contrast the image and the thing is we're not bringing up Google's better sharpness as a way to prove that Google's images are better every time there's a lot more to image quality than the detail that gets retained when you are SuperDuper zoomed in in this shot for example the iPhone did an excellent job of delivering true to life color the bloom in this photo is the blue of this car straight up the pixel on the other hand ended up making our car look quite a bit duller the note 10 then does the same thing while having less detail when punched in on the front of the vehicle but I mean it's still overall a pretty good-looking image and as for the mate 30 Pro okay actually surprise surprise this is a cooler overall look but while we did a fairly good job here with noise color and detail getting into some low-light stuff just before Apple's night mode would activate defusion is definitely working its magic here the detail in this car to go vehicle is significantly improved and the noise is also managed better than the non deep fusion image looking at the deep fusion shot versus the other competitors I'd say it's close overall with the note 10 faring the worst and struggling to capture much detail going through a bunch more low-light shots taken around downtown Vancouver the iPhone with deep fusion really shines in managing detail with noise performance that in my opinion beat out the pixel for a lot of the time in most cases the note 10 and the mate 30 Pro fell farther and farther behind as the lighting conditions worsened the mate 30 in particular has such an aggressive noise reduction in low light that it just sends up smoothing everything over to the point where it looks almost posterized in some cases in night mode the iPhone has hugely improved this year no doubt I wouldn't go as far as to say that it is better than Google's night sight on the pixel 4 but it's close enough that most people wouldn't be able to notice the small differences that put Google ever so slightly ahead images from both phones show that they're at the top of their game when it comes to nighttime photography now onto video this is a situation where I think Google ended up with a pass because we didn't challenge the pixel 4s camera enough the iPhone has long been the golden standard when it comes to recording video on a mobile device and that is still true today in daytime scenes all four phones in our test did a fairly good job of judging exposure the mate 30 Pro seems to like its color on the warmer side more often than not the note 10 seems to struggle with its dynamic range in the highlights depending on the scene and our pixel 4 suffered the most in low light coming in as the noisiest of the bunch but honestly the thing that stands out most about the iPhone 11 Pro Series is the way that Apple has managed to handle sudden changes in the shooting conditions when we move inside with Dennis here notice how the note 10 Clips Dennis's pants so there's no detail left in that light material and the pixel 4 ends up quite noisy until both of them have some time to adjust the iPhone on the other hand and just not just to avoid this pitfall but if we move over to this walking shot of Riley we actually find multiple situations where as the lighting changes the iPhone is the only device that manages to keep the color of his jacket reasonably consistent throughout the entire clip that ain't easy I mean if it were I'm sure Huawei would have done a better job of it so I have to take back what I said about the pixel being as good there are some areas where it excels it's slow motion is still closed and it's stabilization is pretty damn good but in a wider variety of situations the iPhone is clearly gonna end up flexing its muscles so bottom line were we wrong yes and also no it's obvious from looking at everything today but under good conditions any modern cell phone camera can look absolutely spectacular I mean look at all the praise the mate 30 Pro gets so were we wrong to say that the pixel 4 is as good as the iPhone well for most people probably not since most people view images like this not like this and a lot of the differences do come down to aesthetic processing choices these days rather than quality however where the best get separated from the rest is when it comes to consistency and this is where I feel like we let you guys do we failed to identify the iPhone 11 pros greatness in the quick comparison that we made in our pixel for review it may not take the best shot every time and especially in a deeper roundup like this we can absolutely find situations where it falls behind one competitor or another but between me and Brandon we couldn't find a shot where it clearly came in third once and as a consumer think about it I mean I'd rather have the camera where I get at least a silver every time versus the one where I you know win a few golds but break my ankle from time to time so then sorry guys I was wrong about the iPhone 11 pro and pro max but if it's any consolation for me at least I get to say I was right about one thing while we still
