[Music] hi everyone welcome back to my channel I'm so excited for today's video because I told you guys in one of my previous videos if it gets to 5,000 likes I would do a glam dining room makeover for the holidays so here it is if you're new here welcome go ahead and hit the subscribe button and click the bell so you can be notified when I upload my next video let's go ahead and get into the dining room and holiday makeover grabbing a holiday card a purchase last year i'm going to cut out the message in the card to put inside a Dollar Tree mirror frame and I'm gonna place it in front of each table setting you can add whatever message you want to any kind of frame from the Dollar Tree they have gold silver that would look beautiful too [Music] next I'm going to make snowflake napkin rings I got these from the Dollar Tree this is very simple but looks gorgeous just like I bought it in store you can have whatever ornaments you want for your napkin rings I like how convenient these get wives are because they're done in less than a minute I know what the holidays around the corner you're really busy getting things done so my goal was to make things easy here but beautiful like you took the time to go out and precious these things these are a set of three mini silver gift bags I want to put on each plate for goodie bags for my guests as a thank you for coming you can fill it with candy homemade desserts or whatever you have in mind I got this tree from Hobby Lobby for $5 and you can make this using items from the Dollar Tree I've made several reefs before I'll leave them link below if you want to see them how I made it for each season I needed a bigger reef from my dining room ear so that's why I went ahead and purchased this one and it would have been about the same money to make it using things from the Dollar Tree so I just went ahead and went with this one I wanted my napkin rings to match the reef so I grabbed for snowflake ornaments and glued them on the reef since there's a lot of glam on the table I didn't want the reef to take away from the table because that's the focal point I'm going to show you how I style to table settings I made the holiday candle and napkin ring from a previous video that I will leave in the description box so you can see how I made it if you're interested here's how everything turned out it's so glam so affordable using many things from the Dollar Tree I use the silver rim plate napkins the napkin rings gift bag plastic silverware mirror frames snow flight sea light holders are all from Dollar Tree the clam table setting could also be used really beautifully for New Year's [Music] adding mini photo frames on a table with messages warm up the table and let people feel welcomed and loved you can do what I did and cut out messages from cards or make your own and print them out I like the touch of red in my table for the holidays I'm so excited with how everything turned out I love how glam it looks Arif it's just what I envisioned it to be you can use command hooks to mount it on the mirror and the centerpiece I already had purchased it from last year and I added candles in the middle he's stunning large he are the ones I showed you from Sea gallery I wanted to show you a little close-up of all the sparkle they have I would love to know you thought about this tablescape and everything I used from the Dollar Tree we do use these ideas for your home I like how the plate settings are all plastic but they look expensive you can find martini glasses and wine glasses at the Dollar Tree we don't drink alcohol but I love to fill these up with desert fruit or any other kind of beverages have you guys finished decorating your table for the holidays what colors did he decorate with these snowflake tea light holders were such a great fine because they're silver and they make the table show it's winter season here I wanted to lay a tree topper from Dollar Tree on the plate for a glam festive look I snapped it off the tree attachment part and I really like the way it looks on the table little things like this make it look like you put in so much money and effort to create a beautiful table we went with a real tree because the smell is just divine and I added these crystal lights from Costco I use 3 sets I didn't want to decorate the tree we just mainly wanted it for the smell in the dining room when you walk in here's an up-close of the crystal lights they are so beautiful last year I put them around the dining room mirror for the holiday season let me know if you
