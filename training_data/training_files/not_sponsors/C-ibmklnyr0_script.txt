greetings traveler to SCP Halloween special my name is dr. Raman the undead version of dr. Mara with a British accent for some reason but that's not imported as a friendly warning the tale you are going to be hearing today his best listens to vy headphones with your maximum listening pleasure so settle down get comfortable and prepare yourselves for MTF sigma v pumpkin punches but before we get into the moonlight shone on the open pumpkin field the farm was the picture of serenity until the piercing shout shattered the silence move out yelled alpha the for MTF agents spread out across the field their assault rifles and flashlights casting light onto the fully grown pumpkins why are we even here you haven't told us what we're looking for chief question beta aye well if I don't rightfully know but half a dozen people going missing here and every surrounding pumpkin farm being torn apart during their best season don't seem to add up right chief responded just look for something out of the ordinary they scavenged the field for hours looking for anything that could be construed as anomalous a scarecrow that strongly resembled Delta and extremely angry coyote and a pumpkin that suspiciously looked like a basketball and butter did not bounce like one did not apply rage Julia boss gamma finally said after a deep inspection of a vine fine let's turn around and head back to the site probably some psycho axe murderer some [ __ ] alpha turned around and began to march in the direction of the transport befitting given the date now we might be able to catch the tail into the Halloween party she had Delta and the rest of the team turned to look at the newest member of their team [ __ ] hell kid nobody goes to site parties directors always find some way to make it about how we don't do enough work like to see them get off their asses and do this [ __ ] beta grumbled I mean a party's a party right dammit tossed out Delta interrupted by his foot stepping on one of the smaller pumpkins wait what the [ __ ] was check this out pumpkins like mutated or something indeed the pumpkin had shattered from Delta's steel-toed boot spilling out a mix of various candies and sweets all carried in a rose-colored sludge the troops were fascinated bagged up a sample of the Snickers for transport alpha ordered just before a long screech broke across the field the members were ready in an instant even Delta rifles raised and backs against each other they had been thoroughly trained in high-stakes tactics which is why they didn't hesitate when the first pumpkin leaped out of the ground and rushed at them on its spindly wooden legs three shots later it was on the ground dropping a blood-red Twizzlers rope with it was that it only to ask Delta puzzled good joke you know you've jinxed us snarled gamma as if to punctuate his words another shriek rang out and the pumpkins began rising from their vines a few swayed menacingly while others wasted no time in charging the squad bullets rang out like rain each member contributing their own style alpha methodically aimed at a lone pumpkin and burst it and then moved to another target beta swept his guns side to side shattering any pumpkin beasts that wandered too close and showering the battlefield with enough candy to give an elephant a sugar rush gamma was firing like a madman with no want for ammunition or accuracy reveling in the sugar lust and Delta tried to help but whether it was the combination of his first real ambush or the stress or perhaps his gun jamming for some reason he chose to resort to holding his rifle like a bat and crushing anything that came too close in one instance gammas leg resulting in a swift and light kick to the chest the team worked their way through dozens of small pumpkin monsters whether by shooting or smashing until the shots silenced they were surrounded by dozens of small fruit shaped corpses and enough milky way's Twizzlers nerds Hershey's sweet tarts and Pixy sticks to open a store not to mention at least enough apples to open a small food cart what what the [ __ ] yelled Delta wide-eyed and Chell shot the others simply laughed you'll get used to it kid weird [ __ ] comes with a job advise beta his diatribe about reading fine print on contracts was cut off by the ground and rumbling they studied themselves as a gigantic version of the pumpkins they're just eviscerated raised itself out of the dirt on spindly legs [ __ ] the team opened fire but the pumpkin abominations hide reflected the mass of the bullets a handful preached its shell opening ball holes from which copious amounts of candy began to flow the Beast traveled forward reaching out with one of its legs and driving it directly through gamma stomach gamma screamed before being lifted up in the air by the six metre tall fruit the pair looked at each other the squads still releasing a hail of bullets and for a moment gamma stopped screaming then he burst into a shower of candy Jesus yelled alpha as he was pelted with the sugary remains of his soldier the pumpkin used the opportunity to dive forward and seize beta within its grip instantaneously exploding him into sweets alpha and Delta backed up as the pumpkin advanced on pushing through the various Twizzlers and three musketeers that half of the team and become for a moment all was lost then alpha tore something from his shoulder stealing himself he charged forward and left directly into the maw of the monster the pumpkin rather pleased with this turn of events appellee swallowed alpha for a moment it stopped its advanced as it chewed him chief then it violently exploded as the grenade alpha was holding detonated within its stomach Delta shielded his eyes as a hailstorm of candy fell upon him but was still thrown back by the force of the blast he sat in the field as he was showered with enough glucose to give 682 diabetes and watched the Sun rise over the field surrounded by what may or may not have been the remains of his colleagues you Delta walked through the underground security corridor leading to site 39 the echo of his boots becoming more and more apparent with each step his wide-eyed face was impassive as he scanned his keycard and pushed open the door the Halloween party was dying down at this point a dozen odd researchers mingling and holding cups of some non-alcoholic punch as corny theme music played over the speaker the wall across from the door was dominated by a large banner with the words happy Halloween along with skeletons and pumpkins the rest of the group finally noticed him hey Jeff you've missed the whole party they had a
