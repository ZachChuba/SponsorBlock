Sup you beautiful bastards, hope you're having a fantastic Monday. Welcome back to the philip defranco show and let's just jump into it! And the first thing we're going to talk about today is the heavily viewer-requested story from over the weekend and that is the controversy around Tyler "Ninja" Blevins. If you're not familiar with Tyler he is essentially the biggest name and online entertainment right now. He's been gaming for a long time. He blew up over the past year. I mean just the numbers and the rate, it's insane. But something happened in a recent interview that had certain pockets of the internet blowing up at Tyler.  In an interview with polygon at Samsung Unpacked twenty eighteen he said and part of his reasoning wasn't just the clickbait It was him saying that he was thinking about his wife. Tyler is married the Jago Steve, Jessica Blevins actually just celebrated their one-year anniversary on the note of not streaming with women he said.. and during the interview  he also goes on to say that he doesn't think this decision has caused any problem.. All this story blew up it started on polygon, but then I was on Variety, the BBC was covering this, and online you had some people saying that Blevins doing this was discrimination, it was sexist and people saying because of his size he is in a position where he could change the culture if that's the way the culture really is. He also had some people sharing their non specific aming stories like Miss booth who tweeted.. Some like Emma Evans saying this is punishment of women via exclusion. But at the same time you had a lot of people defending ninja pointing to other situations like two creators by the name of Myth and Pokeman.  People taking screenshot of video after video that seems to just be all about the clickbait gossip. And ultimately here is where I stand on this issue, I understand that It must be extremely frustrating to essentially be told because of the way you were born,  the gender that you were born, you could not get the same opportunity to stream with ninja, get that boost with ninja. It can feel very much like it's even more of a boys club because the most popular people has this standard other people might follow but at the same time I am extremely sympathetic to what Tyler is talking about here.  The longest time any time we had a woman on the vlog or show Jessica Nigri, Ashley Skye Hell even even the first few months of staff and past I'd hire people like Meg Turney, Trisha Hershberger, whoever else, people would always take small key moments and go like oh look something's definitely happening there and from those situations you'd see comments in the comment section on social media, but then also people would contact my wife.  You'd send her stupid horrible shit And then I would end up feeling responsible because I just wanted to make this video.  Keep in mind my show now and my show then is just a fraction of what Tyler Blevins has now. 
 So I understand his position as a husband of not wanting his wife to have to deal with that. And you could argue while he's in a position to help change the culture and a lot of people have been I think falsely saying that this is just gaming culture. Oh, yes the gaming community and the gaming world can be extremely toxic It is now limited to the gaming world for example over the weekend Tiger Woods was trending and it wasn't just because he came in second place He almost won he had an amazing final round It was also heavily because people kept sharing these pictures and short video clips of Tiger Woods hugging kept His girlfriend kept guys the golfer who beat him there's this one still that in the video seems innocent enough, but it looks like she's just like oh my god, Tiger Woods from there was just comments after comments of like, oh, you better watch a girl Oh, Jenna Sims wants Tiger Tigers back in all the ways So I look at Tyler Blevins in the situation and I go well I get where he's coming from I have personally not made the choice to not work with women or hire someone because of their gender I also hope this doesn't lead to more streamers that eventually adopt these same measures because well Why are you doing this a ninja doesn't but at the same time I can't find myself Criticizing the guy for trying to protect the person he cares most for in this world And to me personally It feels like a PR wise he's in this lose-lose situation and he's choosing the lose that involves his wife Most likely getting a lot less harassment But with all that said that's the story my personal feelings that I'm still trying to digest on it and I pass the questions off To you you feel like Tyler is being unjustly Criticized here or know what he's doing is an issue and and all opinions you have on this one I'd love to see those comments down below then and just some quickie random news if you were looking for a copy like a real-world copy of the New York Post today and have not been able to Find one it's because the New York Post has been the latest thing to be supreme And if this is a finger familiar with it's a thing that already exists in the world getting slapped with a supreme logo and all of a sudden becomes a collector's Item that is sold for much higher on a secondary mark Freeman today wrap around promotion of the paper and there were reports that people Are just going to newsstands and buying all of them your newsstands in New York at 7:15 a.m Saying you know someone came in they bought all of them for a dollar a pop We're sold out just hours. Later You had copies on eBay going for 10 12 dollars if people trying to sell them bulk on Twitter And here's the thing while I try to work past it, but I am incredibly Judgmental of anyone that is buying this for 10 20, whatever this goes for in the future And while I find it equally frustrating and amazing that people will pay top dollar for anything.

They're limited edition Make sure you enter an offer code fail for 10% off your first purchase the first but of all we had today was Ken Jeong answering the web's most searched questions And if you're the mode question everything about existence We've got wormholes explain breaking space-time and we got a sneak peak for Ralph breaks The internet knows I need a dough brave teaching you bulgarian slang Cristiano Though on sneaker shopping got more awesome from the infographic show on weird things Americans do if you want to see the full versions of everything I just share the secret link of the day anything at all Links as always are in the description down below then let's talk about what happened at Seattle Tacoma International Airport if you didn't see on Friday horizon air employee Richard Russell stole a plane Russell was a ground service agent his Responsibilities included towing and pushing the aircraft for takeoff and gate approach the icing them handling baggage according to reports Russell used a pushback tractor to move a 76 twin-engine turboprop plane from a maintenance area into a position where he was able to take off and at 7:32 p.m That's exactly what he did He took off without clearance and he ended up staying in the air for over an hour while he was up there He was followed by two F-15 jets from the air national guard's of Washington and Oregon and while Russell was up in the air He periodically spoke with air traffic control and for me. It was it's genuinely heartbreaking he seems apologetic and references his mental health a lot of people care about me and It's gonna disappoint them To you that I did this I would like to apologize to each and every one of them Just a broken guy Got a few screws loose I guess never really knew it till now and there are a few times during the audio that we have where air traffic control tries to get him to land but He keeps either either changing the subject or making excuses. That's McCord airfield. Oh Man, those guys were rough. I tried man in there. I think I I think I might mess something up there, too I wouldn't want to do that Hopefully, oh, they probably got anti-aircraft Now they don't have any of that stuff We're just trying to find a place for you to land safely As long as how he even knows how to fly the plane. He says that he's played video game They're just flying the plane around you seem comfortable with that And their other moments where you can't tell if Russell is joking around or it's just a Representative of his mental state then talks about how he wants to do a trick with the plane Safety same kind of banner think of In which I do a barrel roll and if that goes good, that's good. No Salman And there's also video of him actually doing all of this with the plane, but then you hear in the audio It seems he never planned on actually landing Alright richest captain bill Congratulations. He did know it's let's turn to playing that airplane safely and not hurt everybody on the ground. I Was kinda hoping I was gonna be it, you know and ultimately the plane crash into kietryn Island Which is approximately 25 to 30 miles away from the airport what they found was that there was a fire started from the crash Russell died, but there were also no other injuries and no other structures were hit and following all of this What we know now is that the FBI is leading an investigation into the incident with the help of the NTSB the FBI field office in Seattle saying in a statement We are going to be thorough which means taking the time needed to scour the area delve into the background of the individual believed responsible And review every aspect of this incident with all appropriate public and private partners also at a press conference on Saturday you had Alaska Air Group CEO Brad Tilden saying that he sent sympathy to the family saying that they'll try to learn what they can from this tragedy all 23,000 of us What express our sincere sympathy? To his family his loved ones and his co-workers safety is our number-one Goal, there's nothing more important to us Last night's event is going to push us to learn what we can from this tragedy So that we can ensure this does not happen again at Alaska Air Group Or at any other airline but also seemingly calling into question how Russell could have known how to do what he did saying there were Some maneuvers that were done that were incredible maneuvers I don't know how he achieved the experience that he did but on that note as of right now. It's unclear for us Whatever taken flight lessons are used a flight simulator as far as his background according to reports Russell actually passed all of his necessary background checks and while The FBI says they don't believe that this is connected anyway to terrorism that this incident has exposed a security gap There was also a statement after this from the family where they say they were stunned and heartbroken He was a faithful husband a loving son a good friend right now I'm not fully sure where this story ends even showing his face and name I end up being conflicted even though it appeared that he never intended to harm another individual he ended up being the only Casualty from this does it make sense for us to use the same rules that we've had for years for mass murderers where we don't? want to essentially incentivize people to think if they do something big and Horrible to themselves that we'll talk about that right make their name and image Infamous or do we feature that person because it's important to remember that this was a human being who had mental health? Problems and by showcasing a person and their name you make them more relatable and so you make the mental health conversation more digestible to someone that maybe Scoffs at mental health topics or says it's for the weak So I'm torn on it and I'm trying to figure that part out then the other part of my brain I wonder about security I personally agree with Errol souther as a former FBI agent and Transportation security expert who said the greatest threat we have to aviation is the insider threat here We have an employee who was vetted to the level to have access to the aircraft and had a skill set proficient enough to take off with that plane And I wonder is there ever a way to fully be 100% secure when it comes to some sort of mental health issue? I mean the situation brings up memories and a slight comparison to Germanwings flight 9525 back in 2015 the copilot of that flight Once the captain was outside lock the cockpit door deliberately crashed the plane and following that horrific tragedy There was a lot more conversation about how many people should be in the cockpit at minimum Oh, then let's have a renewed focus on mental health and and giving people opportunities and utilities and things in their lives I don't know and obviously I don't want to fully compare the two with with the person that we're talking about today They they seemingly did not want to hurt anyone else Whereas the deliberate crash in 2015 had a fatality count of 150 where I leave This story is a question to you on how do you feel about this whole situation? Then in every facet of life these days is a reality show news We have Omarosa and Donald Trump in the news.  Good ol Omarosa Manigault Newman.  If you don't know Omarosa is She popped through the spotlight back in 2004 when she was on Donald Trump's show The Apprentice She then had repeat appearances in 2008 and 2013 she served as a director of african-american outreach for the Trump campaign and once he was elected she was hired as assistant to the president and director of Communications for the public office of public liaison and as you might remember in December of 2017 it was reported she was forced out of her job and fired by chief of staff John Kelly.  Some reports saying she had to be physically dragged from The White House after she allegedly tried to enter the presidential residence. While a stint on Celebrity Big Brother and a deal later And she is back in the news on Sunday Omorosa went on NBC's Meet the Press with Chuck Todd to promote her new book unhinged an insider account of the Trump White House in which she calls the president a racist a bigot and a misogynist before the interview even started Meet the Press played a secret according that Omarosa made of john kelly firing her there are pretty significant Legal issues that we hope don't develop into something that That will make it ugly for you. But I think it's important to understand that if we make this a friendly departure We can all be you know You can look at look at your time here. And the White House is a year of service to the nation and then you can go on without any type of difficulty in the future relative to your reputation and we then hear Omarosa ask if she can ask a couple of questions kelly says that Is a non-negotiable? Conversation and as far as where this recording took place reportedly it was in the Situation Room talking the real Situation Room not like where wolf Blitzer's plopping around? And so that was keeping score at home Omarosa just admitted to secretly reporting the White House chief of staff in one of the most sensitive rooms on the planet its secure room that She generally used for national security crises and where cell phones are not allowed during this interview Chuck Todd also asked if Donald Trump knew that she was being fired and This will be notable in a second, but she responds I know he knows because I've talked to him subsequently and he said he delegated I delegate it So he knew he knew that John Kelly was gonna take me into the Situation Room and lock me in there Threaten me and say that things were gonna get ugly for me and there would be damage to my reputation during the interview She also said she was complicit in the lying of this administration does and did also commenting on the president's mental health I was complicit with this White House deceiving this nation. They continue to deceive this nation by how mentally declined he is How difficult it is It is for him to process complex information how he is not engaged in some of the most important decisions that impacts our country I was complicit of for that. I regret she closed by saying several former employees have nba's where they're being paid $15,000 a month for their silence. In fact, there are several Former employees from the White House who actually signed this agreement who are all being paid $15,000 for their silence. So then this morning not even a full 24 hours later Omarosa is on the Today Show and she releases another audio clip and in this one she secretly recorded the President of the United States Who was saying that he was unaware of this fire? What happened general Kelly General Kelly came to me and said that you guys wanted me to leave No, I nobody even told me about it. No, you know, they run a big operation, but I Didn't like I said Omarosa statement the day before all of a sudden there appears to be a discrepancy on that note She says that there were subsequent conversations and this interview. She specifically uses the word probably right? This tape shows him saying I didn't know you were fired. Is he lying? Yes, because there were subsequent calls after that okay, there is a Complete organization between the two of them. He probably instructed general Kelly to do it So they keep his hands clean when he spoke to me we know that there's a recording but she also seems a lot less definitive as far as who actually Pulled the trigger as far as his Omarosa worried about the legal consequences here if she said are you concerned are you absolutely not because I have Protections the moment that I've decided to blow the whistle on a lot of the corruption going on in the White House there are protections That afforded it to me There's also a part of this interview about allegations that there's a tape with the president saying the n-word on it says there's multiple tapes Of it, but I'm not really covering that part because it doesn't really pertain to what we actually have right now And as far as the reaction from Trump's camp, obviously they were none too happy Even before these interviews aired you had White House Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying it's sad that a disgruntled former White House employees trying to profit off these false attacks and even worse that the Media would now give her a platform after not taking her seriously when she had only positive things to say about the president during her Time in the administration and on Sunday after the recording aired Sanders said that it was a blatant disregard for our national security Then adding to brag about it on national television Further proves a lack of character and integrity of this disgruntled former White House employee You also have Rhonda McDaniel the chairwoman of the GOP tweeting that it isn't just wildly inappropriate It's a threat to our national security if she broke federal law She should be prosecuted from Slayer Giuliani on Fox and Friends said that it was violating national security regulation She certainly violating national security regulations, which I think have the force of law Yeah, I would think she is I mean I have to look at it more carefully and if she is she violating every Every every bit of trust and that she that people should have in someone and then we had president Trump responding on Twitter Whacky Omarosa who guy fired three times on the apprentice now got fired for the last time She never made it never will he begged me for a job tears in her eyes? I said okay people in the White House hated her she was vicious but not smart I would rarely see her but heard really bad things nasty to people and would constantly miss meetings and work general Kelly came on board. He told me she was a loser and nothing but problems I told him to try working it out if possible because she only said great things about me until she got fired well
I know it's quote not presidential to take on a low-life like Omarosa and while I would rather not be doing so this is a modern-day form of Communication and I know the fake news media will be working overtime to make even wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible Sorry and adding wacky Omarosa already has a fully signed non-disclosure agreement So that is where we are right now but honestly the way the situation is just coming out there could be five more updates by tomorrow as far as where I personally Land with this story is in the drama of this story really doesn't stand out to me I'm not gonna be one of the people that buys her book because unless it is a 100% valid recording that I can hear I don't personally believe a word coming out of her mouth write your opinion on if someone is trustworthy or not should not immediately Change once they switch team I have a personal belief that in life paranoia and skepticism is a strength and for now what I'm wondering is the legality of this situation right strip away the names you're talking about the President of the United States being secretly recorded by someone who was a part of His staff you have a member of staff secretly recording in the Situation Room And we look to the laws in Washington DC and there is one party consent recording there Meaning that legally speaking only one person has to approve the recording So in that sense, you didn't break the law But the White House has specific rules regarding national Security and so if some scholars saying because this recording took place in an area that is normally used for highly sensitive national security meetings She could be charged and specifically would be under Title 18 section seven nine three of the u.s Code which makes it a crime to leak national defense information one the information is transmitted, two it is defense related information and three the person leaking that information has the intent or knowledge that the information will be used For America's detriment or in other countries benefit but also at the same time with the audio that we have heard thus far it doesn't necessarily seem to check all those boxes but At the same time once again you could also argue She did violate her agreement to abide by Specific protocols when she applied for her security clearance as far as Omarosa saying she is safe because she's a whistleblower I don't I don't know if necessarily with the recordings we have right now What she is a whistleblower for we have so far as you were going to be fired Here's a situation which could be seen as a veiled threat and the president acting surprised like oh man You got fought what and then the same person that took the secret recording was like no we later had other conversations And yeah, he actually probably no no No
The last thing that I will say on this it is so interesting Every time you have someone that worked at the White House leaving on bad terms because someone who was previously just all of the best Thing is immediately characterized as the worst most disgusting most Exploitive person which then leads to the question if that was the case. Why did you bring them into the White House? How would seem to either not make sense or not be the best of decision-maker? But with all of that said I do want to pass the question off to you What are your thoughts about this train wreck of a situation you trust her. Do you kind of trust her? You're skeptical or you think she's just outright lying why why not any of the good stuff? Let me know down below That's we're going to end today's show.
