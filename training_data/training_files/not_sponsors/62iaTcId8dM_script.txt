I went to record a video with her Canon EOS R and I left it on a tripod and our dog ran by and knocked it over and broke it and that was my vlogging camera and I didn't have a camera to get my work done this is when I learned the importance of professional services this is the picture this photography podcast where we cover all things photography and today we're telling you about professional services inspired by our own story of our broken camera we're gonna go over multiple brands we're gonna go over what they offer how you can qualify but first speaking of Chelsea really can't go wrong okay we'll see who's better I have had a lot of experience with different repair services but I want to find out your experience I want to gather data from hundreds or thousands of photographers so I want to hear about your experiences at sdp io / repair pull if you've had a camera repaired or lens repaired by the manufacturer go there and tell us and we will report back so that people get a better sense for which camera companies provide better service because that really is key to both consumers and professionals yeah we have a little bit of experience but we're a sample size of one we need we need your opinions we need your help yes all camera companies offer some level of consumer camera service you buy whatever it is you can send it in and they'll repair it for some price but all the major camera companies office also offer professional services yeah which usually have some requirements to get in usually not always but usually there's a membership fee usually you have to have some pro great gear often you have to prove to them that you are a working professional but in return you can often get really steep discounts on repairs yeah I think I think we got a 30% discount on this Canon ESR and it went from being like 450 bucks to like 270 ml on the back yeah we just got it back you can get loaner equipment if the repair is going to take a little while and sometimes it can take weeks and if you can imagine being without your body for weeks a V real problem you also get top like priority service where they will guarantee they get it back to you in like one two or three days and in the case of Canon at least you can even get consignment stuff like if you're thinking about buying that six hundred millimeter f4 for $13,000 they will actually loan it to you for a period of time at a time so that you can assess it as there are some pretty big benefits yeah huge benefits I didn't understand how important it would be until he lost the only camera we use for vlogging and I wanted it right away and how long did it take for it to come back to us well we got the loaner I think in two days and then we got that back and I think like three days to everything like the next day we hope we didn't even get a chance to unbox the loan earth because yeah the one came back so fast shockingly fast so we're gonna cover Canon Nikon Sony Fuji GFX Panasonic and Olympus first up is Canon now if you sign up for the Canon Professional Services program there are different tiers they have silver gold platinum and then cinema and silver is free gold is $100 and the Platinum service is $300 all of them will give you loaner equipment well no I think the silver doesn't give you loaner equipment but the higher tiers give you loners the higher tiers will give you consignment which is you borrowing something even if you're not you don't have a repair going on the higher tiers will offer you free maintenance things like cleaning of the sensor at least a certain amount a couple of times a year and then depending on the tier you sign up for you can get a discount on the repairs which is what we got you can get either no discount at the lowest tier which is free or you can get 20 or 30 percent discount at the pro levels and for us the pro services have always managed to pay for themselves because we're using this gear like every day and traveling around and stuff inevitably breaks also we're super clumsy Shh don't tell them that it's mostly the dogs it's not us yeah they broke two cameras they broken two cameras tripod Falls are a big deal in this office we have a lot of tripods that fall over canon will give you free shipping either one way like back from them or both ways depending on the tier level that you get and when you sign up they'll give you a member gift which is not worth it so if you want to go to the higher tier because you're enticed by the member gift that they're offering at least it changes but in my case it was just like a 15 dollar bag that I've looked at and I was like I am never gonna use that back so don't let the member gift lure you into paying more for the higher tier but Canon has requirements and if you want to find out about them or sign up go to SDP dot io / CPS like Canon Professional Services you have to be a pro they will look at your website make sure that you have a professional website and I don't mean like your pictures are pro quality I mean like you are earning money like you depend on your camera as a working tool the website I saw indicated that it was us only but I know they have services outside the US so I just want to warn people like outside the US these are gonna vary some you'll have to look into that yourself for your country the pricing is annual either free for the lowest level one hundred dollars or three hundred dollars which kind of stops everybody from signing up if you have a certain amount of gear they want to see that you have some amount of Canon pro grade gear so they use this point system where different cameras and lenses give you a certain number of points I found the point system fascinating isn't it because they're kind of deciding like how Pro is each individual piece of gear like a canon rebel like an entry consumer camera is zero points you don't give any credit you don't get any points for that no oh the Canon EOS R is five points a one DX which is like a six thousand dollar camera is ten points the 24 to 105 f/4 like the kit lens everybody gets is eight points and that big $13,000 600 f/4 is 18 points how many points do you need to access the entry-level package the silver package you need 10 points for the gold you need 20 points and for the platinum you need 50 points that's crazy because I researched the nikon pro services and you need 700 points but everything is just worth more points yeah yeah so these points dar different well so you're about to tell us about nikon right as well as all those other camera companies so people can find it yeah I know how they compare but before we do thank you Squarespace so Nikon professional services works in almost an identical way you need to be a working professional you need to prove it so you submit an application to Nikon and then you also have to have at least two qualifying bodies and two nikkor lenses to get into the program so you can't just have the number of points you have to have two bodies and two lenses now you need at least 750 points to get access to the pro services there are cameras that are 700 points like the d5 100 year anniversary edition uh-huh it's 700 points well but you can't just have that one camera anyway so it doesn't matter and you get very similar perks as well like you get discounts on pairs depending on the level you get loner as well your gear is being repaired priority delivery and also they have events for people that are a part of NPS I don't know how good those events are I've never been to one but that's interesting you can also be loaned gear for special events but it's limited to like one a year depending on the level I think it's one a year for the first here and I think two a year for some of the other tiers so there are definitely loan benefits that are interesting to give you an idea of how many points you need to qualify a d800 is a hundred and seventy-five points and the d5 is three hundred and fifty points my experience signing up for Nikon professional services was weird because we had like a ton of Nikon gear at the time and I went to sign up and I realized we didn't qualify and the reason for that was we didn't use like any Nikon lenses at the time we were all about a third party Tamron and Sigma lenses and those don't count for anything because they won't service them so you can be you can meet all the requirements requirements but you'd be using non Nikon lenses and you kind of are left out and that's part of why nowadays I push working pros to get actual name-brand lenses because not only does it help you get into the professional services program but you can get it serviced like quickly and get the discount and get everything turned around more quickly and I feel like long term it just adds up to being a better experience I thought Nikon was cool cuz they also had a tear for retired photographers so if you're not working anymore but you still have all of your gear they take that into consideration I think some of the perks are lesser but still cool can I take a second and say that we've had experience with Canon Nikon and Sony professional services and they they all met their stated goals like they all turned it around quickly they were all excellent so I can't say that one is better than the other because they've all been really good and I haven't had any complaints as I know it's gonna vary by different countries I hear like Sony Australia has been really bad but I'm about to talk about Sony and I do want to say if you have previous experience with some before they launch their worldwide pro services it doesn't necessarily apply because their new pro services better we had a non-pro services repair it was a microphone that was uncovered under Pro services and that experience was appalling it took us something like thirty five days to get the repaired microphone back and then it was almost as expensive as the microphone itself was to buy and it was just really frustrating to be without the gear but for our camera bodies that did apply came back really fast so any professional services offers a three day turnaround if it's going to be more than three days the repair they will give you they will send you a loaner to keep you working they'll give you free maintenance like the other companies to clean your sensor and such and they give you free shipping both ways they require you to also be a working professional and supplies to the US there is an application process you have to have to Sony camera bodies and three Sony lenses vanishing the lens third-party lens Fuji has a plan but this is a real pain point for me it doesn't apply to the X mount lenses or cameras that most people are using it only applies to their medium format GFX bodies and lenses so if you have nxh one or an X t3 there are lots of pros using them you cannot get Fuji professional services and that's like a sticking point for me when pros go into that system because how long is the repair going to take there's no sort of guarantee around that but they do offer it for the medium format bodies it's $500 to enter the program and you have to have a GFX camera and lens they offer you a two-day turnaround and if the repair is going to take more than two days they will give you a loaner the maintenance on it is free a couple of times a year and all your non warranty repairs there's a 30% discount applied to it so the repairs could be quite a bit so that might pay for itself the first time around they'll also give you free shipping both ways panasonic has professional services - it's pretty similar two-day turnaround they'll give you loners if the repair is going to take longer than 2 days they give you free maintenance a 20% repair discount and free shipping both ways panasonic charges you $200 a year you have to have one of these camera bodies g85 a g9a gh4 a jh5 or a GH 5s and you have to have four of their lenses not any of their lenses but they're like they're more Pro oriented like okay go to SDP dot io / PPS to see the specific list of lenses that you have to get olympus similar program just started pretty recently and they're still kind of rolling it out not all the features are rolled out yet but right now it's $200 for two years they I offer a three day turnaround they'll give you loners for repairs that take longer than three days free maintenance 15% out of warranty repair discount and they give you an extra six months warranty on bodies that need a repair so that's something none of the other camera companies offer is that sort of extended warranty they also give you free shipping both ways then they you have to have an e/m one one of the models of it any of them any m5 or one of their pen f camera so it doesn't apply to like an e/m ten and then you have to have two of their pro or premium lenses yeah I know that was like a lot of information but I felt like people should hear about it cuz not many people take advantage of these things enter really if you're working pro it can save your butt like we almost had to just run to the store and buy another canon yeah could be able to shoot but fortunately canons loaner service like got us working and save just having to buy a whole other camera body yeah we were just gonna run to a local electronics store and pick one up so it saved us a lot of time and hassle so think you can and pro services it's nice to be able to say that and know I'm not sponsored by Chelsea and use the coupon code Chelsea to get 10% off thanks first base and I'd love to hear people's own repair stories like what went right what went wrong because it's difficult to gather real data and that's sort of anecdotal data could really help people make choices of what are
