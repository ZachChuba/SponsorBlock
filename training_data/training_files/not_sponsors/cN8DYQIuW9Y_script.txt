project pinky in color starring Nick Blackhurst also starring Richard Bonynge and Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln tonight's episode engines of change [Music] coming up in episode 30 nuke fails to get to grips with the new coffee machine at the end of the previous episode we'd completely stripped apart blasted and powder-coated all of the crusty old running gear we'd run the gauntlet of hydrogen embrittlement with a home plating kit we'd replaced all the worn-out bushings with new polyurethane versions and then reassembled the whole lot that all looks great but there's one very important thing missing yeah it's taken us 30 attempts to get to it but this is actually the episode that most people have been looking forward to one where we get the car in pain sorry the one where we actually take a look at the main motivation behind this project the motor the mill the donk the power plan the IC e all right Nick don't labor the point the engine no major surgery necessary because has my daily driver I put over 20,000 miles on that salika with really no problems at all now all those miles were sideways it did have a small oil leak which we all have to take a look at at some point but other than that a lick of paint a cam belt and an oil and filter change and it should be good to go or at least that was the plan until my colleague decided to take a look at that small oil leak the oil leak turned out to be a broken head gasket which in itself isn't too much of a problem but during the course of the investigations it became clear that Nix perfectly good engine was in fact totally shagged not completely dickard like this one which you'll get to see another time but just entirely worn out the more astute among will have probably already realize where this is going what we have here is a completely reconditioned block it may look brand new but it's actually the same one that came out of the car the poor old engine had a hard life under Nix ownership and the Boers had worn act and one had gone oval so we stripped it had it hot tanked and overboard or the torque plates to half a mil oversized cleaned again surfaced painted and we added some nice new core plugs this reconditioned unit now forms the heart of our engine build it's a building block if will yeah whatever write them then well that's all very nice but according to my calculations none of the internals that came out of it will now fit again not a problem all the parts are still readily available but apparently it was cheaper to buy performance aftermarket parts than it was to go for genuine Toyota ones and that has led to a decision when I first started getting into cars all of the cool stuff was natural aspirated screaming homologation specials stuff like mantas Chevette escorts some beams and like when I got my driving license all of the really quick stuff was first generation second and affordable turbo cars with no driver aids massive turbos and biblical turbo lag they were in essence awful but they weren't off exciting we might have only been able to afford a metro turbo or if we were really lucky and escort RS turbo but it felt like we were driving an Audi Quattro or a Renault 5 turbo tour de corse fast forward a few years and technology has changed the game completely these modern small turbos that we've been talking about on now ruthlessly efficient so much so then a lot of cars there barely perceptible which it's great for drivability and emissions but it does mean a lot of turbo cars nowadays just like any sense of drama now our 3s engine whilst originally turbocharged also responds very well to more conventional naturally aspirated tuning so well in fact that with the right selection of parts are just north of 200 horsepower is easily attainable without the use of a small more than turbo so the decisions a bit made which is not going to fit so to build a naturally aspirated 3 s engine to north of 200 brake horsepower as well as a good block will need a cleaned and polished forged steel crank competition mains begins and thrust bearings some decent studs a genuine Toyota water pump and oil pump a set of forged steel rods a set of high compression forged pistons a set of oversized one-piece race valves uprated springs and titanium retainers along with Kaulitz to suit a pair of high lift cams a pair of adjustable cam police an expensive cam belt new OEM idler and 10 sure a complete set of high performance gaskets a lightweight fly will and a new oil filter along with some extra tools can imagine what that lot did to Nick's wallet there's a few parts that will be retained off the original engine like this stuff and this oil filter housing but they're a bit monkey so they're all going in the ultrasonic cleaner the oil filter housing is quite an interesting little widget it acts as a water to oil heat exchanger and not only cools the oil without the need for a plunging radiator type thing but also warms the oil when the engine is cold it's a very clever and neat solution but a devil to clean without one of these things it took a dunk in the alkaline degreaser and a few goes in the ultrasonic bath to get the filter housing clean but I have to say I think it's looking pretty good now the other parts of this assembly have also been jiggled about at 40,000 Hertz and are super sparkly along with the rest of the bits that needed a wash talking of needing a wash Nick is cleaning out the bores in the block a good rule of thumb when you've had some machining done is to clean it and then clean it again and what do think it's clean clean it one more time for luck the anti-corrosion goop in the bores and on the main bearing journals needs to come off after a thorough scrubbing and three gallons of brake clean this is what we've managed to get out first job on the engine assembly is to fit these new gallery bungs it would be too easy to forget them so now is as good a time as any to are for the ends of the oil gallery and one is to plug up a water outlet having a bit of high-strength Loctite means they definitely aren't coming out again any time soon next up are the ARP main studs normally the main bearing caps are held in place with bolts these are fine for the standard engine but the stud conversion offers more strength than the bolts and therefore a little more peace of mind they're wound in hand tight as per the instructions from the manufacturer there's probably no need but for our own satisfaction we're checking all the machining work and might notice some lovely machining here our friend Robin at specialist engineering and Dunstable runs a fleet of CNC machines and he desperately wanted to get involved with the old so we offered to make some billet main caps for us it's very hard to say no to billet main caps so we reluctantly agreed and they really are beautiful things before talking them down the nuts and washers get a liberal coating of the special ARP Lube the torque setting is 60 foot pounds in three steps so we're going to 21st then 40 and finally sixty foot pounds the custom main cups really asks tunning Robin made something else for us which we'll get to later this Assembly has been lying bored by experts with better measuring equipment than us so we're not expecting any problems but now is the time to find out if there is they should all be bang on 58 millimeters at room temperature but as it was barely above freezing when we filmed this the tiny hundredths of a millimeter undersized is understandable the next job is to measure the actual size of the complete bearing so we can check our clearances we install all the new ACL shells in the block and of course in the main caps before talking the whole assembly back down again each bore is carefully measured and the result is noted down then we measure the main journals on the crank with a micrometer and this result is also recorded if do all of them and take one measurement from the other end up with the clearances if we check those against the factory Toyota build manual where bang in the middle of a tolerance so that's great we perform a similar procedure on the big ends and rods well not boy with all that as there's a load of in-depth build videos out there already Jeff Roe has done excellent series on his 4g63 build for example suffice to say there were no surprises and everything was tickety-boo the entire crank assembly including the clutch flywheel and pulleys had previously taken a trip to a company called vibration free to be balanced they managed to get our rotating assembly balanced within f1 spec tolerances so we're very happy that it's now ready to fit mustn't forget the new thrust bearings before laying the crank in the block and then it's time to release the shmoo [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] well that went well but what about the in float yet barren the proper way to check it is to carefully set the dial gauge up on the end of the crank then why'd leave a bar in it to force the crank side-to-side and measure the distance it wants to be around point one of a mil sorted we haven't forgot about the oil squirters we've chosen to put those in after the rods and pistons talking which they're up next we can't do any of that though with the engine on the bench so it's time to transfer the block to the engine stand where it will live until it's pretty much fully assembled the stand allows us to spin the engine round into almost any position and lock it there it's also on wheels which is a blessing and also a curse the new pistons have a diameter half a mil bigger than the stock size they're also extremely shiny we're going to label up the pistons and ring sets in pairs so we don't get confused as to which pair is meant for which cylinder as the first job is to gap the Rings the Rings have a split in them so can pull them apart to fit to the piston but when it's in the cylinder the gap between the two ends of the Ring is critical that's because as the engine heats up the material expands and if the gap is too small the two ends run into each other which then forces it against the cylinder wall which creates even more heat and before know it your engine is melted and you're crying into your beer a ring gap that's too big allows combustion gases through it wastes power and increases crankcase compression that's another bad thing so careful consideration here will ensure a long and happy life for our motor we check the lower of the two compression rings first and out of the box it was spot-on but the top ring is measuring up a little tight so it needs some fettling it's not a lot so a small file does the trick in no way did we set up a cordless angle grinder on the bench held by one of us while the other grind the ends of the ring because that would be dangerous and you'll not find us doing anything like that no siree the top ring on cylinder number 1 has been fettled so it's time to see if the gap is now right we're looking for a measurement of 356 microns or around 14,000 cleaned all the ring gaps have been set so the next task is to assemble the rods and pistons the good jump in clips are tricky little blighters but with some patience and some swearing they tend to go in after a little persuasion the con rod now needs to be fitted to the piston the Yanks call them wrist pins we call them good Jin pins but either way we're right the pin slides easily into the little end after the application of some assembly Lube and the FLE little clip goes on without too much foul language now the rings can be fitted to the piston the oil scraper rings go on first followed by the second compression ring and finally the top ring and that's one complete piston and con rod assembly ready to go in the engine one is no good though we could do with four excellent let's lob them at the engine ok a quick sanity check to make sure both clips are in and seated the gudgeon pin is free in the rod and the piston and the Rings are in correctly and not binding and I think we can put this in a liberal coating of assembly lube is smeared over the big end before what appears to be honey is squeezed onto the piston it's not honey of course that would be weird no it's mineral based engine oil we've purchased a tapered ring compressor of the correct size for this job because quite frankly the universal types are just a bit crap and this makes it easy and fun [Music] spinning the motor over on the engine stand to get to that begins is fantastically handy the big end get some more pinkish move and the ARP bolts are lubed up and winding to the con rod by hand to start with they are then tightened down to the required torque well doesn't that look good do it three more times and end up with this it looks almost as good from underneath back to the oil squirters the reason we're putting them back in now or not before the kraang Quentin is that we didn't want to clamp the spout with the con rod these spray oil onto the underside of the piston to keep it cool so a damaged nozzle could have less than ideal consequences a little dab of blue loctite should stop the cap head bolt from dropping into the crank and like all these fairly critical engine fasteners they get talked up to the correct specification the final check here is to make sure that the squirter doesn't foul the piston and thankfully it doesn't so that's great we've got a bit of dull stuff to assemble now like the crankshaft oil seals oil pump pulley and sump so while Nick gets on with that I'm gonna get the funk out [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we had our modified some powder-coated while we were Andes and it's looking resplendent in its new finish of satin black some new fasteners with a dab of Loctite should keep the windage tray in place and the bolts out of the tourney bits the sump can't go back on just yet because if recall we need to gain back some of the oil capacity lost when nicks sliced out the space for the dime pipe to do that we enlisted Robin its specialist engineering again to make us a 10 mil spacer as we expected it's beautifully machined a made out of gauge plate to ensure a perfectly flat surface for the sump to seal on after the high tensile cap heads are talked down we just check to see that there's no clearance issues and yep everything looks to be fine there's no point having Tim electric depth in the sump unless the pickups are right at the bottom and that is where this comes in but before we fit it I'm gonna prime the oil pump priming the oil pump mainly consists of pouring pink gloop down a funnel then spinning the pulley over by hand rocket science it is not here with the pump primed the bottom end can now be finished with the addition of the oil pickup freshly cleaned ultrasonically another smearing of sealant the sump gasket and finally the sump itself a [Music] quarter inch drive adapter in the end of your drill set to the lowest torque makes winding in lots of bolts and absolute Dadi then it's just a case of talking them up I hope you're appreciating all this Tom and that's the Sun spacer an oil pickup sorted before we forget let's track in the dipstick mount cup thing that's the official term honest it took us no time at all to rebuild the water pump and the oil cooler assembly might have noticed we're using brand new nuts and bolts wherever possible and hose clamps the new thermostat has what's delightfully called a jiggle valve in it and that needs lining up with the Handy casting mark in the housing before going on to the water pump the dipstick bracket is added before the water outlet on the backside of the block is done up next job is to seal up the turbo oil feed and we've whipped up a blanking boss for that we're nearly there with the long block assembly just the small matter of the head dowels to tap in the soft hammer and the addition of 10 new ARP head studs sorted now we just need a head gasket a multi-layer steel Kemetic one would probably do the trick thing pretty much really but the head which luckily I haven't had anything to do with because therein was a bit of a story to mice the spec of the bottom end we decided to have some work done on the top end and to avoid delays come assembly time all the outsourced machining was done a long time ago know to get ahead of the game we had our head singto by a master machinist near Silverstone he took it office and over the course of a couple of weeks ported and polished the inlet and exhaust s-- changed the valve guides gave us three angle valve seats skimmed the head and generally cleaned it up to give us some serious gas flow we were very excited even though the new cams bound in the journals meaning they had to line hone the cam caps to make them fit properly still at least we then knew everything was spot-on well that's all lovely but in what turned out to be yet another biblically over-optimistic plan I decided it would be a brilliant idea to simply put the whole thing together so it's ready to go come engine build time it was at this point they all went to Sh the first thing I wanted to do was change the risky shim overbook design of cam-follower for the much less dicey shinless bucket from the toyota tuesday's engine but as we add new cams and all the clearances needed doing anyway this was the perfect opportunity i measured all the followers lapped all the valves in by hand i love know none of this whack it on a drill and let the Chuck's do the work and began the assembly by fitting the valve stem oil seals only I couldn't because they didn't fit cue a whole lot of research and arcing around trying to find some that do eventually some special ford ones arrived and I can get on with the job of assembling the head there are over a hundred and seventy individual parts that make up this cylinder head and assembly is time-consuming and tricky the idea is that we'll use one piece followers or buckets straight from Toyota to replace the two-piece design that can have problems with high lift cams to do that we need to measure all the clearances as they are now and then all of the correct sized bucket to give us the required gap between the cam and the follower simple only it wasn't what I was about to learn was that the base circle diameter of the new cams was half a millimeter smaller than the standard ones that meant there were no shameless buckets thick enough to give me the correct clearance brilliant well it also meant was that our titanium retainers and uprated valve springs wouldn't fit the revised shim under bucket design we were being now forced to use plus ID now to take the whole thing apart again I produced a spreadsheet with all the measurements ordered all the parts and sat on it for a while about a year in fact the new shims look like this and the buckets have a pocket for them to sit in so after completely disassembling the head and building it back up with the different retainers and springs the new followers can go in once the buckets are fitted the cams and cam caps get thrown on and talked down to spec with a bit of luck I won't have to do this again on this engine if I've got my calculations correct this Fila gauge should slip in snugly and it does and so do the rest of them so I'm calling that job done that turned out to be quite the ordeal but it's amazing what can accomplish with a can-do attitude oh my god yes this weekend well not quite yet it needs a wipe off with some brake cleaner and a new rag look at him breaking out their clean rags willy-nilly like it it's quite nerve-wracking really because with all those new parts installed if I've done anything wrong it'll be my head on the Block for five freaking years I've waited for that one hello what's he doing now ah yes with the head bolts changed for ARP studs have to put the washers on ahead of time because they're wider than the casting so have to sort of slip them in but with the washers in place the head can now be properly lowered onto the block a little expert wiggling jiggles the washers over the studs I think that's what they call tech errs or something [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's impossible to overstate just how much I love these HKS can police anyway enough of the part porn back to business we need to time the cams in and for that we needed a greet wheel and a pointer for starters to find TDC or top dead center we've screwed a flat piece of steel to the top of the head to allow us to make the magnetic stand on the digital indicator is mounted in the arm and the probe goes down through the spark plug hole and will rest on top of the piston then we turn the crank over and as the piston Rises it moves the probe on the indicator when the indicator shows its maximum value we know that the piston is at the top of its travel that happens to be six point two one millimeters on the gauge but the measurement is irrelevant so we reset it to zero then spin this timing disc round to read top and lock it off but that isn't top dead center because the piston stays put at the top of the stroke is the crank rotates so keep turning it until the indicator shows the piston moving down and then read off how many degrees that is here it's 3 degrees so split the difference move the pointer back one and a half degrees and that is top dead center to get the cam timing somewhere near toyota of handily given us a mark on the cover plate behind the pulley so it's as easy as lining up the mark on the pulley with the line on the back plate and now I suppose we should put the belt on now that's just what are we expecting us to do so instead what we're gonna do next is take the fairly unusual step of priming the entire oil system because we can most Road car engines have their oil pumps deep inside the motor they tend to be gear or chain driven are completely inaccessible however on the 3s engine the oil pump is external and driven off the timing belt this gives us the opportunity to test the system long before the engine is first cranked over we needed to remove the timing disc and fit the sump plug oil filter and they're freshly plated dipstick tube but now the engine isn't porous we can fill it with some mineral based running in oil we've got the drill set to around three to four hundred revs so not even half idle speed and can see oil pouring out of where the pressure sensor goes by hold by finger over it the oil gets directed past the cam followers and is filling up the channels nicely I'm calling that a win there'll be oil already in the galleries before the engine has even started so that's great and there's no leaks whoo and might I add whoo time to put the timing belt on and we've chosen a gates racing belt in a slightly odd shade of blue not sure it goes with the purple cam wheels but you're not going to be able to see any of it anyway so who cares we're just going to a wire screwdriver in here to give us some belt tensions we don't want to pull the pin on the sprung tensioner until we're ready just checking that the engine turns and that there's no nasty valve to piston contact we're lucky to have the ear of a world-renowned engine tuner and although the engine will now run as it is he's told us that we need not 0.75 millimeters of valve lift on the inlet cam at top dead center we can't argue with him so that's what we're doing it's easy to adjust with these burning a slide pulleys just slacking off the three screws but a great big spanner on the cam and just give it a little tweak we were at 0.55 mill lift so we don't need much movement to get it spot-on then just tighten the three screws and that's the inlet cam timing sorted we did the same on the exhaust cam but this time to the prescribed 0.25 millimeter lift at top dead center now that we're happy with the timing we can pull the tensioner pin let's just see if it still turns over nicely yep very happy with that nearly there we had the rocker cover powder-coated at the same time as the rest of the running gear now it just needs a little reassembly before going back onto the engine if any of the little cap head bolts in here dropped out and into the top end that would be bad so they're getting a little dab a thread lock and they're done up 2ft pretty much the last job now is to fit the new rocker cover gasket he's getting faster with that hammer all the time yes I know it's not the same color with a block really heavy and I thought I'd like to gray my help just get that cover screwed down please the rocker cover bolts are the final ones for now that need talking down that sure is looking nice but there's one tiny bit missing there go well I talked to for a minute oh dear it seems Richard he's upset well no I don't really mean upset I mean concerned about Ted see he's been reading back through the comments and he's come across a lot of people are very worried about the final weight of binky and he's kind of taken it to heart music roller swaps is an excellent place to live and it's just we're not really blessed with massive sections of long straight wide Road not a problem because when there's no on a bank can still make some excellent progress now every driver in the world knows what it's like to be stuck behind a truck or a bus around here you're just as likely to have to anchor on for a horse a flock of sheep a tractor or a coffin Dodger in a Honda Jazz why is it always a chance it's all about time exposed to danger or Ted the amount of time need to spend on the wrong side of the road when you're forced to overtake some of these obstacles given our expertly predicted final power to weight figures and despite my best tuning efforts Richard is really worried that we're just not gonna be able to drive this car around safely but apparently he's been doing some research and he's come up with a quick and cost-effective solution I certainly have what we needed was a little bit of extra waft to make those limited overtaking opportunities a lot less hazardous so I found a place in the states at the cutting edge of technology that produces a suitable device the Garrett safety turbo they actually do quite the range but we're still space limited so while not as safe as it could be we should be able to meet our safety requirements with this GTX 3582 our [Music] [Applause] [Music] tune in next time for another exciting episode from the files of project pinky [Music] this is not safe either oh yes that's what go oh no choice [Music]
