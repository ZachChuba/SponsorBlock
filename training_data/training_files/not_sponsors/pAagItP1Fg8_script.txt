buy a damn good book let's take a look at where people the cursed hairy monster men who get mad at the moon a lot it's kind of interesting that the we're in werewolf just means adult human male so a we're creature is just a normal guy creature but today we're not just looking at werewolves but all of lycanthropes we got normal guy bears guy boars guy rats Guy Fieri's and a couple more before we dive in please ignore the fact that lycanthrope means wolf person sensible etymology just doesn't exist here lycanthropia is a widely feared and ancient god damn it why is everything ancient man anyway people can acquire this curse a small number of ways the first and most common is being wounded by one and surviving which is weird to me because aren't they supposed to be terrifyingly deadly why do so many people get away with a few scratches and start growing hair like that kid from goosebumps y'all should be dead as heck the second cause is by pissing off a wizard grandma I'd imagine fairy tale hags and their reputation for curses had something to do with this I'd wager to guess that an adult human male went to Baba Yaga and told her that her Hut's chicken legs were ugly and dumb and then he walked away as the Wolfman and the last and possibly the worst cause is to be formed from the loins of a where dad or where mom so from one event or another we have a cursed idiot who grows way too much hair when they get mad but D&D gives us further elaboration on the conflict because cursed people go about it two ways they either fight the encroaching beasts waging an incredible war of willpower to retain their personality or they give in and gain the ability to transform at will but they become evil bloodthirsty bastards combining human cunning and trickery with big scary animal not gonna lie it's a badass combo I still don't get that moon thing because it's based on the stupid idea that wolves howl with when the moon gets all big for some reason but here's how I would justify it in an adaptation the unsee leaf a wild the evil half of fairyland is in a constant state of dusk or dark Twilight so if the curse did in fact come from a hack every time the normal world is cast in strong moonlight the Fae wild bleeds into the minds of wolf men and the boys taking advantage of what I'll pretend is a segue let's look at those boys first on the block is the wear bear I can't sing enough praises about these guys they're so [ __ ] cool there are a lot like fur bolts creatures who secretly tend to the forests each lycanthrope gets some traits from its beasts and where bears are hulking loners they avoid other people that can carry the curse and fight usually only in defense which means they won't bite but tell me which is scarier a bear charging full force while yellowing the hard sharp teeth or this huge [ __ ] with the bare body of the world's strongest man trying to kill with a [ __ ] war axe in its hand I'd make a couple big old poopies in my pants if that was the case they're cool because they only curse people who want it and help those people with their transitions moving on to the nearly polar opposite polar bear pun is a where boar wild boars in history have been seen as great warriors and rip Robert Baratheon in half just like normal boy we're bores are brutish barbarians who live with families in distant and remote areas if cross into their territory you're gonna get gored where boars are sloppy and Savage partly because of their disposition but also because they think cursing people is haha funny where rats are actually very interesting with the way that they conduct and spread their culture because you'll notice for some reason that their lawful evil they sneak around the pool pool pipes under cities working with teams of thieves getting that daily bread cheese and shiny baubles my favorite angle of where rats is how they handle their curse if you're wanted by the clan they allow their curse but if get bitten a bad tussle and managed to walk away they'll hunt down and coup de Gras your ass ain't nobody going rogue rat they're literally just the Thieves Guild in Riften but grosser with more hair where Tigers are also kind of dope and I first found one tucked away in the tomb of annihilation there are the wisest of the lycanthropes and prowl their territory for challenging prey hunting for a wear tiger is very similar to normal Tigers it involves sudden precise calculated and deadly movements they don't spread their curse for territorial reasons and enjoy hunting near the edge of civilization because they like to go to town and get wasted on the weekends werewolves being detailed in gothic horror are of course romantic creatures you'll notice the others described are more cultural idealists with open-ended personalities werewolves often have either a God of War Ark where they slaughter their loved ones and then vengefully hunt the one who cursed them or are wise and Noble beasts who fear the dangers that a love interest provides as humans they're strong well-spoken isolationists but as wolf men they're the perfect mix of strength and speed becoming monstrous apex predators a minor note I'd rather not miss before I wrap up the video all lycanthropes have three forms that of a humanoid that of the stronger beasts and that of the gross deformed mix thing be careful when dealing with those find in the wilds they might be keeping more ancient secrets than they put off and beware the full moon for there is no safety offered by a man turned blind Savage that's basically werewolves
