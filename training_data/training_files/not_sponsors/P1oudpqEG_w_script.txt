have you ever seen something and immediately assumed that it's a gimmick like for example this brush buddy's Justin Bieber singing toothbrush I mean it's only fun but if ultimately when I'm finished my teeth are no cleaner than if I had saved seven dollars and gotten a regular one well when I first heard that a Seuss put a touchscreen in the touchpad of their new Zen Book Pro I have to confess that it triggered my gimmick detector at least before I used it for a while as for now well I'll say this it's a lot better than a worthless gimmick but then also kind of worse you offer code Linus to get 25% off glass wire 2.0 through the link below [Music] the overall design of the Suzanne book Pro UX 580 GE is a solid b-plus the brushed aluminum and relatively small bezels are nice but I just can't shake the nagging feeling that it looks kind of like an Inspiron but made from better materials and making matters worse compared to Dells professional XPS 15 it is a fingerprint magnet and the reduced chassis rigidity makes it feel significantly cheaper which I mean fortunately for it it actually is with that said I can't think of a situation where I'd be embarrassed to be seen with the Zen Book Pro I mean whether it's in an office or a studio or a library it does a great job of blending in seamlessly that is at least until your study mates notice the second display so there's a standard one up top though it might not be fair to call it standard because between its 4k resolution touch support and factory calibration everything from consuming to creating content is a joy as long as you don't care about HDR and then there's the one where the trackpad would normally be a soos is calling their little creation here the screen pad most of the time it just acts like a normal trackpad and actually quite a good one you'd think it would feel weird but it has a nice soft touch and a satisfying click in fact even without a screen under it it would already be getting a pretty positive review and then it's got extra functionality like contextual shortcut keys and the ability to use it as an extended display well that should get it right into a plus territory right hold on in some situations it's actually great the YouTube integration on Chrome puts ad skipping and a full screen toggle right at your fingertips quite literally and it even lets you scrub along the timeline and this is while keeping most of the screen free to be used as a regular trackpad then by contrast Spotify shouldn't even be listed as Hannibal I mean you know how most keyboards have media hotkeys up here at the top making play pause and track control a single action well for some inexplicable reason a soos has removed those functions and replaced them with nothing so you can have the pleasure of executing three actions instead of pressing one button and then making matters worse once the Spotify app is open the touchpad no longer works meaning that it is literally always faster and more convenient to just click on the actual Spotify app and this problem of not being able to use the touchpad when in certain apps hampers the usefulness further for things that would otherwise be great like the numpad or calculator which is particularly annoying given that these are issues that were solved in the word numpad like in office programs the numpad works freaking fantastic but also reveals its limitations only the numpad + symbol inserter actually really save you time and then for power users keyboard shortcuts like control asks are going to be the way to go for a very long time and then finally the lack of features like macros and equations on the screen pad meant that we really just didn't get many opportunities to use it overall then I don't think the screen pad is a huge selling point at this moment but at least if you don't like it there's still a perfectly usable touchpad like normal and so I like where asus is going with this and I hope we continue to see development on the apps something that should speed up when they release the SDK which is coming soon now this is kind of a funny thing because we're halfway through this video and I haven't even gotten to the specs of this machine on paper the Zen Book Pro is an absolute beast with a core i-96 core processor a gtx 1050 Ti graphics card 16 gigs of ram and 512 gigs of nvme storage and at that price unfortunately it doesn't touch the maximum performance of the core I nine and you know what I'm just gonna come out and say it I blame Apple for this a very unfortunate industry trend like a core i9 MacBook Pro the Zenbook pro pro right almost immediately overheats under heavy load dropping the frequency even below the base clock of the processor and even though the temps do get a bit better when the fans kick in it's still running well under base clock realistically you could be better off with a cheaper core i7 if you want a chassis that's this slim and the heat problems don't stop there while you're gaming or even in some cases while performing mundane tasks like installing programs the bottom of this machine would regularly get uncomfortably hot sometimes close to 50 degrees Celsius making the Zen Book Pro less of a laptop and more of a desk tough well yeah I mean not like a desktop but like the point is it works better sitting on a on a desk you get with you guys get what I mean also the battery life isn't that great that was supposed to tie into the desk thing desk top desk okay forget it so continuing on the dislike train only the storage is upgradable the webcam is softer than soft camembert cheese and the keyboard leaves a fair bit to be desired it's pretty similar to the one found on the Dell g3 which is alright in a budget gaming machine and overall pretty good but when you compare it to professional machines from Microsoft Lenovo and Dell the keyboard on the Zenbook lacks key stabilization chassis rigidity and tactile feel which I guess nicely leads into our conclusion besides the thermals nothing about the Zen book is bad in fact the speakers which I couldn't find another place to talk about are pretty good but at $2,300 for our build the only thing that really stands out against the competitors is the top-of-the-line core I nine CPU and the screen pad but since the thermals don't allow the i9 to stretch its legs and the screen pad needs a lot of work on the software side before I would consider it a selling point at this time the Zen book would probably need to be more than a couple hundred dollars less than a surface book -
