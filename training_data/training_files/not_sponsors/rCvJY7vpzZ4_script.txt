welcome to my comprehensive guide on how to use every single weapon and rust and improve your overall aim my name is Ashton and I played this game for over 12,000 hours hopefully today I can help you understand everything you need to know in one video this in-depth tutorial will be split into three sections first we'll be going over everything outside of the game that can help you improve and can potentially impact your gameplay these are things such as your computer specs your equipment and mouse monitors and even your posture next we'll be going through all the things within the game that you might need to configure or learn about for example your sensitivity dpi and game settings recall patterns and just knowledge about the game mechanics finally I'll be showing some practice runs and warm-ups that I do that you can follow to improve as well I'll be time stamping all the different sections and subsections in the tutorials so that it's easier to follow and also if you're just not interested in something or it doesn't apply to you you can easily skip to the next part without further ado let's get started before we even talk about what you can do in game we have to talk about all the factors that come from outside that can massively affect how well you can play the most obvious one is your PC facepunch recommends that you at least have an Intel Core i7 4690k CPU or AMD Rison 5 1600 and above you need at least 16 gigabytes of RAM and a GTX 980 GPU or AMD r9 fury or above they also highly recommend that you have an SSD I would say if I had to rank the order of importance for computer part upgrades your CPU is at the number one your RAM at number two their GPU number three and also having an SSD is very important for loading things in game and speeding up your loading time when joining a server if you're curious about what kind of computer I have my specs are in the description below of course individual skill has a lot to do with how well you can play video games but also having good performance and high frame rate it's just as important if I were to use a metaphor it's like basketball if you're 4 foot tall it'll be a lot more difficult for you to compete and say if you were rather 6-foot and if you were 7 foot tall and athletic you have all the tools you need you just need to practice no matter how many frames you get in game you're always limited by how fast your refresh rate is on your monitor if you have a 60 Hertz monitor and you're getting thousand frames in game it doesn't really matter in your eyes you'll still only see 60 frames per second for rust you're never going to need a monitor faster than 144 Hertz since you're probably not going to get over that amount in FPS however if you really want to reach your full potential I think it's essential that you at least get 144 Hertz in 2020 now that you have good frames and a good refresh rate the next most important equipment that affects your aim is your mouse and mouse path everyone has different body types and preferences so we'll all vary depending on you you want a mouse that will fit your hand nicely has a good weight that you like a mousepad with the right resistance and optionally you can get custom Mouse skates as well I use a jeep or wireless mouse with hyper glide Mouse skates and for the mousepad I use the HyperX fury s that's just what works for me but the only way to find out what works for you is to try a bunch of different ones for yourself another thing to notice the longer you use your mousepad the more gamer gunk and sweat is going to be infused with it that will cause your mouse to move and consistently throughout the pad so make sure you clean your mouse pad regularly what chair you sit in is often neglected by a lot of gamers but believe it or not it's actually really important you see gamers all the time destroy their back with bad posture or start developing carpal tunnel on their wrists and that's really no good you don't want to potentially ruin your body just because of a video game I pretty much sat and shitty chairs all my life but luckily around 4 months ago the first thing to talk about are some in-game settings that you should change I'm not going to go to in depth with this one just a few that I think is important first one is FPS limit negative one this basically just unlocks your FPS your screen mode should be at exclusive and vsync should be off in your settings for the F will be I recommend 90 but it's ultimately your preference graphics thought vm f OB scale should be a false though as leaving it on makes the gun scale relatively to your fov the true sensitivity comes from your EDP I which is your effective dots per inch is calculated by multiplying the mouse dpi with the in-game sensitivity mine for example is 400 dpi was 0.475 in game so my EDP I would be 190 if someone had 1600 dpi it was 0.11 in game our sensitivity would actually be very similar to higher your dpi is the smoother your mouse movement gets I'm not an expert but it's as if your mouse sees more frames with a higher dpi your mouse would be much more responsive to small micro movements and your cursor feels way more fluid compared to lower dpi but it's not always a good thing in a game like rust you rarely shoot at people moving at a fast pace and there aren't players flying around everywhere like an overwatch for linear movements aka trying to draw a straight line from left to right lower dpi is actually better because your mouse won't be picking up a small mistakes your hand might make that goes up and down a good example would be csgo where lower dpi will help you stabilize your crosshair to be at head level at all times it's good practice to just try out all the different sensitivities and dpis to see what feels the best for you in my opinion a sweet spot was somewhere in between 0.3 in game 2 0.7 with 400 dpi honestly a simple way would be to change your sensitivity until you can comfortably do a 180 turn in one mouse pointer before we get into the actual guns we need to take a look at the attachments first let's go over the bad words the muzzle break decreases the recoil by 50% but the velocity and damage gets reduced by 20% and accuracy reduced by a whole 38% the damage and velocity nerve is too big and having your accuracy reduced means that your gun is really only effective close-range you're going to learn to recall anyway after this video and besides the recoil rarely matters that much in close range combat do not use this the next one you probably shouldn't use as the handmade sight it zooms the gun by 0.5 X and doesn't really offer any valuable stats there are much better scopes in the game and you might only put this on on that have really really bad iron sights even still the handmade sight is pretty bad with how much it covers up your screen the 16-time scope is quite useless as well unless you're shooting at people from over 250 meters away russ pvp rarely happens from that range and then tense zoom just makes your scope sensitivity super low causing you to tunnel vision and have worst aim next the muzzle boost increases your fire rate by 10% but reduces your velocity and damage by 10% as well this attachment is very situational where it only becomes useful when your opponent has lesser gear and you're in very close combat in most scenarios this actually reduces your damage output as a damage decrease might make the enemy tank one additional shot to kill them now on to the ones that you should definitely use the flashlight is self-explanatory if it's dark it lights up the area you should use it it's useful even at daytime as you can blind your enemies at close range the eight-time scope is also very obvious it's great on snipers the LR 300 m249 or even vak next is a silencer this is probably one of the best attachments and certain scenarios the 25% decrease on velocity and damage might seem like a lot but also reduces recoil by 20% and increases accuracy by 33% in rust you can't really hear whether silenced shots are coming from so you're able to take down multiple enemies without them ever shooting back at you if you put this attachment on a gun that doesn't output a lot of damage they'll feel like you're shooting people nuts but if you attach it on a K or an m249 that's where it's most effective the next attachment to go over is the laser sight when activated you get a laser pointer on your gun and it creases your accuracy by 44% what this really means is that you're going to have less aim tone or less spread on your bullets so you can have much tighter sprays this is pretty much good on any gun but I see on guns that I've set recoil patterns that's where a laser is super effective it's also great on snipers as it reduces weapon sway so you can have a much more stable shot also the tactical glove when worn gives you more accuracy and less weight as well when you have the laser sight and tactical gloves on your barrel doesn't move similar to the laser sight there a sleeper Opie attachment called a hollow sight for the majority of rusts existence if you were using a hollow sight you were seen as a noob or a role player but that's not the case anymore the hollow site increases accuracy by 70 percent and also has a two-time zoom scope not only is it almost double the laser in terms of aim cone reduction you're able to have a flash land on at the same time but you can not do with the laser whenever you have it the hollow side is great on any SMGs - a K or an m249 it increases the effective range on any weapon by two folds you can put a laser sight and Halle sight at the same time and theoretically it should give you more than a hundred percent accuracy but in reality having both of them on actually lessens the effectiveness of both the attachments for some reason this might get fixed in the future by the devs but that's just how it is for now unlike other games like csgo or valiant where you have to counter strafe to be accurate your shots and rust are still going to go where you aim at while moving there's a lot of different things that affect how much damage you'll do to a person which gun you're using which type of ammunition you're using as it has different stats for each one your distance between you and the target as there is damage fall-off what kind of armor the target is wearing or where on the body you land your shots for example headshots have a 2 times damage multiplier with guns you need to take all of this into account when calculating how many bullets will take to kill an enemy finally red the most important part of the tutorial the guns itself I'll be going over everything you need to know about each gun the weapons and rust are categorized into four levels tier 1 tier 2 tier 3 and military-grade military-grade weapons can not be crafted and can only be found and appeared weapons are classified by which workbench you need to craft them the spray pattern of each weapon will be on the screen so you can better understand how to control it will actually be starting with the ak-47 here the reason being is the best gun you can craft and learning this will help you understand the other spray patterns as well the ak-47 is one of the greatest guns in rust and has played a closed medium and long range a lot of people explain to ake a spray like an S pattern but it's actually not quite if you shoot an a K into a wall reverse it vertically and horizontally we can actually see exactly what we need to do with our mouse you control the first bullet by a sharp pulldown left and then one bullets straight down and after that it gets easier and you just draw an S with your mouse the next challenge really is when you get to the last ten bullets you have a super sharp turn to the right and it's pretty hard to get the right timing you can try to trace the pattern with your mouse on this video to get an idea of what the pattern should feel like but the best way to get better is to actually keep trying it in game the a K in particular is very versatile because it's a great fully automatic weapon but it's also very good for tapping and bursting for tapping you can either hard reset your shots by manually moving your mouse up and down or just simply pull your mouse down left in between your shots this is good for when you're not in immediate danger to get shot at or die as you can just type your enemies for far away to preserve your ammo while being more accurate first thing just means that you're going to shoot seven to ten bullets weight 0.5 seconds so that it resets your spray and shoot 7 to 10 bullets again this means you can choose to only master the first 10 bullets of the aka and still hit all these shots but one good thing about learning to hold 30 bullets straight would be for spray transferring there comes a time where there's multiple players in front of you and you don't have a lot of time to burst or tap understanding the full spray can help you take more targets down faster the LR is a great assassination weapon for people that might have trouble with AAK but still want a gun that lasers people from medium to long range the LRS pattern is very similar to the a kay is essentially the same s pattern the only thing different is that the vertical recoil is almost halved and it turns within the spray pattern is way more sharp while the vertical and horizontal recoil is much more balanced than the a.k the LR is more of a long straight pull down and then it gets wild towards the end the first bullets of the LR is also much more tame compared to the wild first shots of the a Kate that being said I usually only ever spray the first 20 bullets of the LR or do fire round bursts I think the LR really shines once you slap an eight-time scope on this day the mp5 is the best SMG in the game with relatively high damage and an insane fire rate this great close-range and medium range as you can get deleted by it in seconds the mp5 actually has a completely different pattern to the a cake the first four bullets go straight down which makes it very strong and easy to do five round bursts after that you go diagonally right for another four bullets diagonally left for another five diagonally right for six and the rest of the spray you just move your mouse straight left apart from the first ten bullets most of the controlling comes from moving in a mouse horizontally so you don't have to pull down that much I find myself doing the full thirty bullets spray with this gun a lot since the damage isn't as high as the a K where I do five-round bursts mostly focused on hitting headshots the Thompson is a fairly strong SMG with great damage but lower fire rates it can be great at 1v1 duels from close to medium range and the Thompson has a very similar pattern to the mp5 but the recoil pattern is longer and skinnier the left and right turns within the recoil comes earlier than the mp5 and the latter part of the spray is more of just pulling down I don't usually like this weapon that much but it does do the most damage out of all the SMG spur shot I usually full spray this weapon and rarely tap or burst of this the custom SMG is an insane weapon to have close range to clear rooms or angles the recoil is almost identical to the Thompson and a lot of aspects so there's not much to say about it the only difference I say is that it has a faster fire rate and lower damage than the Thompson in close range I actually prefer this weapon over the and only ever full spray with the custom SMG that's it for all the guns that have a set recoil pattern and it's now time to cover the rest of the weapons probably one of the best and standard tier 2 weapons to use the SAR is a semi-automatic gun which is great medium to long range it doesn't need any attachments to be strong or accurate but unlike the other automatic weapons that we covered you do get way more equal on the SAR if you don't sit down while shooting the Czar's recoil just goes straight up so all you really need to do is pull straight down with your mouse you'll see a lot of players spamming the SAR for medium range but that's actually a mistake in my opinion when you do this you get quite a lot of aim code making you miss a lot of shots even if your crosshair is on the targets a better way to use a SAR for medium range is to tap it mostly focusing on headshots for reference it does the same amount of damage as the lr 300 the m39 is just the better gun than the SAR all-around more damage more range but slightly less fire rates it also does the same damage as the a cane the m39 is amazing medium-range and long-range and it's great for stealthy plays it's basically a DMR and can double as a semi-auto sniper this gun truly shines when you have an eight-time scope on it and despite the game saying and has the same accuracy as a SAR and my personal experience spamming to m39 doesn't have as much a phone as a SAR for some music now what can I say about this gun it's undeniably the best gun and rusts nothing compares to it and it is overpowered the m249 has a hundred bullets you can use it as a fully automatic sniper 30% more damage in the aka faster fire rate than the a K you can mow down entire clans without them even figuring out where you are from upwards to 250 meters actually there's an F one console command called play or equal comp this allows the game to make your site go back to where it was after firing once this is incredibly op4 tapping at players from the long range as you don't really need to do anything you just need to click this applies to the m249 and m92 another thing is the aim cone on the m249 gets progressively worse the less yes you have I'm sure this is a bug but a person with a hundred forty FPS will get a massive advantage with the m249 accuracy then a guy that has 30 FPS as for the recoil just pull straight down but keep in mind that is a bit of randomness as it can sway left or right next up is the pistols the Python is the best pistol in the game as it has the same damage as the a K and as comparable fire rate to it it has great accuracy that allows you to snipe people from long range and you can delete people from close range if you spam it compared to the mp5 where you might spend a hundred pistol bullets in a few sprays you can save a lot of ammunition by getting comfortable with the Python it also doesn't need any attachments so it's a really resourceful weapon the only downside is the limited magazine with only six bullets it's difficult to fight multiple enemies with the sconce so holding an angle or fighting at medium range with cover is where it really shines the m92 is a decent gun when it comes to close range it used to be one of the better weapons but along with a fire rate nerf the intense recoil and aim cone if Scott is not that great to use but I will show you something that might make it viable I haven't seen anyone else use this and this can actually make this gun really good if we combine the player dot recoil comp from earlier with a hello sight the m92 can be insane the holo sight reduces the harsh gape phone while the recoil cop makes the intense recoil something you don't even have to worry about the p2 is a cheap gun that might be good for solo players and might be okay as a secondary weapon but it's honestly not that good by itself with its low damage low fire rate and horrendous aim cone you always want to tap with this unless you're close range the gun is okay at best but I much rather make a Python than a p2 the only good thing is that you don't need a spring to make a p2 the revolver is pretty much just the worst p2 not much to say other than don't spray with this pistol and it's a great weapon to make early game when you only have a Tier one workbench a good combination would be to start with a crossbow and finish the enemy with a revolver the bolt-action rifle is a great weapon to use long range and especially against lower tier players you can one shot has Metz or coffee cans from within a 60 meter range or so and it's just great at controlling an area preventing enemies for pushing not much to say about the snipers in this game it's pretty straightforward it's just a great weapon to have control medium to long range fights the l96 is a true point-and-click gun it has one more bullet than the bolt has better distance with lower bullet drop-off but I actually like the bolt action better it's more satisfying to use because you actually have to calculate the velocity instead of just aiming at the head and the bolt has a faster fire rate the server that I usually practice and warm up on is called or story of training grounds there's a lot of other aim training servers and Russ but I feel like Russ story a does it best if you like to get better using the same server I did here's the IPS to the NA EU and Australian servers the aim training arena is great for refining your recoil against Dansville targets while the other map has BOTS that run around where you can practice leading shots and control the recoil against moving targets the server also some sick free-for-all maps you can join to play against real players and private pvp arenas so you can practice with your friends Ryan the owner of Astoria gave me a sneak peek of what they've been working on to improve the server even more it seems like a lot of the arena's are seeing a big upgrade and capacity so more of you can join the FPS is gonna be better the UI is improved and they added a bunch more unique arenas the updates will be live around the week after this video is released the only way to get better and more consistent is to join practice servers like this to get a feel for what the recoil is like learn how each attachment interacts with every weapon and you'll slowly develop muscle memory improvement comes gradually and at different paces for different people you shouldn't compare yourself to anyone just focus on working on your weak points and getting better each day maybe you can try doing a bunch of 180 turns with your mouse to get better at reacting to getting shot from behind try shooting with a silencer from far away so you can get used to leading a shot more especially since you can't see the tracers you could practice spraying at moving targets or while you yourself a strafing to make the pattern something you do unconsciously you might want to improve your flicks or your one taps you might hop on a PvP arena so you get better accustomed to real player movement maybe go wrong with your best gun whether you lose they're not maybe you'll overcome your gear fear most importantly don't get too upset when you die or mislay something just try to have fun and one day you'll get there I hope this video helped you and if you'd like to see more from me maybe you'll subscribe
