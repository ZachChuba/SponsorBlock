to over 2400 documentaries from some of the world's best filmmakers Tyler the Creator is only 28 but his career has been long and varied he's a rapper singer composer fashion designer and producer in this video I'm going to go through his musical catalog and rank the album's from worst to best let's get into it as Tyler's second record goblin isn't hugely different from his first but there are a few things to note firstly Tyler is now dealing with his newfound fame on goblin whereas that wasn't so much of a theme on bastard and in my opinion the themes of Fame took away from what made bastard so interesting bastard was written from the perspective of a true outsider while writing the first album Tyler wasn't yet famous with a legion of fans behind him but during the Goblin era Tyler was suddenly beloved by millions sure he was a controversial figure but I really wasn't that interested in hearing him rant about how much he hated being famous in terms of instrumentals and flows Bastion and goblin are both pretty impressive for Tyler's age the album's are almost entirely self-produced and overall the main reason why I'm more impressed by bastard than goblin is because they're very similar but bastard is more raw and feels less forced the lyricism on Goblin while lonely and isolated in the same vein as bastard just doesn't feel natural by the time we got around to a second album full of edgy teenage antics it just felt like too much of a good thing that being said goblin is still a really good album and an important step in Tyler's evolution in my opinion bastard should probably be regarded as a classic everything about it is just so bizarre so unlikely for Tyler to have begun his career here and reached the incredible heights he has today it's amazing and it all began with a pair of albums that got the kid banned from England for five years but despite the vulgarity despite the violent rioting there's something about it that's just different looking back on bastard ten years later the fact that Tyler was about to stumble upon something brilliant is honestly pretty obvious bastard and Goblin would kickstart a musical legacy unlike any other but at the same time they themselves don't even begin to hold a candle to the talent Tyler would later reveal their bizarre absurd windows into the psyche of a musical visionary who was just barely learning how to spread his wings Cherry Bomb is a mixed bag it's the odd one out where bastard Goblin and both are Tyler's teenage albums known for controversial themes flower boy and Igor are known for their artistic integrity and compositional complexity but Cherry Bomb doesn't easily fit into either of those classifications on the one hand it's inspired by 70s R&B and on the other it takes inspiration from early 2000s rock rap and industrial hip-hop these two conflicting influences don't mesh well and that's why Cherry Bomb is Tyler's lowest rated album besides Goblin personally I like Cherry Bomb quite a lot each moment is different from the next which is certainly a double-edged sword as Cherry Bomb iconic in the same vein as flower boy or bastard well it's not because the styles and ideas presented by Tyler are all over the place without a specific identity or theme track 5 find your wings is laid-back and soulful with impressively layered instrumentals it's an inspiring song about being happy and following your own path in life track 6 Cherry Bomb follows immediately after with borderline inaudible screaming heavy distortion and a rap temple and honestly that kind of explains cherry bomb as a whole it lacks the cohesion to reach the same iconic status as so much of Tyler's other work it's still an important step in Tyler's evolution for sure but as a whole it's just not on the same level as the rest of Tyler's work [Music] Igor took me by surprise Tyler has spent a huge portion of his career so far comparing himself to others while insisting that he stands out against everyone else igor feels like Tyler's first record that comes entirely from within no fast cars no trap flows no disses it's just Tyler's own musical creativity stemming from his inspirations and experiences at first honestly something about it felt a little off I missed Tyler's attitude and dark sense of humor but Igor is still good it's really really good it's just different and I don't mean it's just different from Tyler's other work Igor is honestly one of the weirdest albums to hit number one in a long while and it didn't just hit number one either Igor took Tyler from five million listeners on Spotify to almost 20 million Tyler spoke straight from his heart pursued his wildest musical interests and lyrical ideas and he was hugely successful in doing so Igor isn't my favorite thing Tyler's ever made because like I said I'm a huge fan of his dark sense of humor attitude and impressive raps that's not so much a focus on Igor that being said it's a young album and I can see it becoming an influential record on the sound of popular music and years to come Tyler's orchestral compositions deeply personal storytelling and beautiful melodies are some of his most impressive work yet Wolffe is the first Tyler album that sounds anything like his modern sound it's a long sprawling record at over 70 minutes long with 18 tracks he played with a ton of different styles and moods from dark grungy beats on answer to dreamy soul on treehome 9/5 tyler finally spread his wings as an artist and producer on wolf he was still an edgy teen for sure but his artistry was improving tenfold many of the songs on wolf are still among Tyler's best from if' age wise moody synths and powerful lyrics to his dark confession regarding the death of his grandmother alone it's an album where the music is written with the maturity of an experienced composer and producer and the lyrics are coming mostly from the perspective of an edgy depressed teenager of course Tyler is both the producer and the rapper all in all Wolfe provided the perfect combination of music and raps that I always wanted to hear from Tyler not too harsh and not too soft Wolfe contains the absolute best and most iconic tunes from Tyler's early career flower boy is perfectly balanced it turned Tyler from a somewhat cult rapper to a mainstream cultural force and influencing the fashion sense and musical taste of teens everywhere he was finally understood finally respected as a composer and finally appreciated by both critics and fans flower boy is his first album where each and every moment flows together and creates a memorable experience from moment to moment the album is psychedelic soulful and at times aggressive but what ties it all together is Tyler's exploration of his own personal identity something he never really talked too much about in the past Tyler's newfound introspection drove an axe through his reputation for dark heavy music and turned him into a bright talented musician serving as a modern icon for the youth in all their ups and downs specifically those identifying as LGBTQ flower boy is Tyler's most complete work yet his most peaceful beautiful and well composed work yet flower boy will probably go down in history as Tyler's best album and at the very least I would call it a modern classic in conclusion all of Tyler's albums have songs or ideas within them that are interesting creative and unique there's not a single bad record in his discography even goblin the album that I put at last place on this list contains many moments of brilliance Tyler is an amazing artist and I can't wait to hear what he does next now I know how much explore their fascinating catalogue of educational program
