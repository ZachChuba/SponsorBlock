so Busboys thumbing things get wet just like Simon Says make our that go I mean if Simon say sup oh my god oh yeah yeah sexual assault always good for a whoo yeah did you guys see this what I mean whoo yikes this is this is funny I like I'm like and I like this a lot let's let's keep it going hello everyone and welcome back to a brand new letter opener covered in seal blubber my name is Leon lush and I do appreciate you taking the time to join me here for a little bit today now if you're new here I know you don't give a rat's rear end but if you been with me for a minute you know that since the last video we have suffered a catastrophic loss the beard is gone and life is once again mundane and meaningless but luckily I have you guys here to see me through the tough time so if we could just a moment of silence [Music] box-boy with a commanding 1.7 million Instagram followers he is this week's premier influencer in contestant on the most recent episode this episode right here of YouTube's longest-running most successful highly esteemed and influential and most coveted series insufferable Instagram so box boy consists of this young Caucasian gentleman right here and frequently features what looks to be his good friend and self-proclaimed Asian this dude right here and I mean just take a look at this thumbnail talk about Instagram heavy hitters you know that this is getting clicks that's like kind of almost as so oh I get it yeah she's okay she's twerking she's in on it okay yeah now typically in the past I might approach content like this quite critically maybe you've seen me do that in some past videos but I'm really trying to turn over a new leaf I want to understand what's making the kids tick you know what I'm saying this is tough I got I got a really dive in and going with an unbiased palate because I'm just a wise weathered experienced hilarious remarkably good-looking and humble old man right with a voluptuous thighs and that couldn't possibly know what's hip and why kids thinks this is so funny so I'm gonna try I'm gonna try my absolute damndest to get a chuckle and maybe if they maybe I'll share it tagged some maybe I'll tag some friends or comment 15 emojis in the comments if it really gets me okay yeah good slap that's like that just asked me strangers to slap oh really oh that wasn't interesting at it let's keep going what I know I know I didn't technically say it but to edit that in afterwards is still kind of little luck in the line I think right I don't know you biz this like some new-age n-word past type of thing you can edit it as long as you don't say it per yeah is maybe his editors black I don't know this is a little you know maybe he just has a bunch of street cred that I'm not aware of cool you know what I take that back he is whiter than a glue factory would you smash my watermelon with a laughing till I'm crying emoji is you know what this has potential let's give it a shot again mother of dragons this boy is Finnegan cancelled if woke Twitter gets ahold of these clips riperoni I don't know okay so this video is going in a little bit of a different direction than I anticipated and Lord knows that you know if by some Jehovah's miracle it stays monetized it will 100% get copyright struck anyway so this is not complaining the days of complaining about these things copyrights Tracy monetization those days are behind me right I simply bring it up because if you've been watching insufferable Instagram for a while when I started this you know series over a year and a half ago YouTube was drastically different back then you could you know take the piss out of Instagram content and not worry about things getting monetized etc etc but this is these are the rules now right and you can't how you can't complain about the rules as youtubers we are making the conscious decision to use YouTube as our distribution platform for our content and therefore that means we have to play by their rules whether or not you agree with it or whether it's fair use or not none of that matters because YouTube owns all of this and we have to play by those rules if you want to make a living doing it right so amongst all of this through all of these ups and downs and the way monetization has changed one of the things that keeps the Creator economy going that keeps youtubers working full-time and allows us to be able to continue to make content for you guys that you can consume for free is working with brands and working with sponsors so I just want to thank those of you watching and those of you that have been with the tomato mafia for a while for being receptive when I or other youtubers that you love to watch work with brands because that really helps the Creator economy stay afloat when YouTube's kind of stuck in this Bermuda Triangle of [ __ ] and sterilisation on that note I would also leon lush take back your internet later today you know as you were watching that ad integration I was thinking about what I said previously and just about how so many youtubers have had to really sterilize themselves to try and stay monetized on YouTube myself included right and it's just the way things have progressed but it just sometimes I need to feel human again I get so much I have so much stuff pent up inside of me that I that I would say but I don't but in this video I feel like this is a good opportunity to just exorcise the demons so if you'll just bear with me here for a second let's I did something I gotta get off my chest [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] this [ __ ] that felt terrific anyways what was this video about oh yeah but box boy they already just say that you're fine we're not really fine you just can't 5 million views on this one and I just he's got a large chunk of content that's just him like asking for a kiss from some girl that he knows I think this one may be his girlfriend and then they do some innocuous response with a glove or pie or whatever and they play a short two second clip of a popular song as the punchline which is perfect that's hilarious and also in this forty second video provides five opportunities for me to get copyright struck which will happen because fair use is dead have three friends that would kiss you know well that is a tempting offer I'm gonna go ahead and pass on this one thanks girlfriend's pregnant deuces hahaha man classic that is hilarious and actually 3.1 million people agree except for Texas chipper in the comments if you were that sort of the guy you are an [ __ ] give me a break we buzzkill alert ok Texas chipper over here being a decent human being and a good father isn't funny now her girl gets pregnant you kick her out the house in the middle of winter during a blizzard now that [ __ ] is funny being a good dad boring perpetuating a stereotype of being a deadbeat piece of [ __ ] father that's the [ __ ] [ __ ] in that his words 100,000 let me tell him crying emojis in the [ __ ] garbage [Music] [Music] what is happening in this video will you marry agent or white tag 3 friends I mean if I have to I guess at mr. beast at Beauty Doland you know what hold on a second [ __ ] that he's just doing this to try and get more views and followers I'm on to this guy bolt hey can I get a kiss what though what hey can I get a kiss that was sweet oh hey can I get a kiss kiss me kiss me that was his latest post at the time of this recording he had posted at 4 hours ago and I guess these kissing though they don't even pranks I guess the kissing skits are working so you stick with it right I just I can't what did this take 15 minutes to make I don't [ __ ] you know I would [ __ ] like this it how popular and successful this guy is it's amazing to me that the entire [ __ ] world is an Instagram famous because what is this hey can I get a kiss you're fine you're not really hey Nigel can I get a kiss psych run nice what could I get a kiss well that is about all I can take I did my best to go in objectively to try and distinguish what it is about content like this that makes the kids laugh until they cry times 5 and I failed miserably I have no [ __ ] clue but I guess that's what makes the world great because you don't have to know everything and the world keeps spinning around so I'm not gonna lose any sleep over thank you guys so much for watching hope you had a laugh or two if you're new here and you subscribe that would mean the world to me and if you've been around for a while you know I appreciate your support if you do me one last favor before you go leave a comment down below then head out to your local mall with a friend have them record you just going up to a random person and start making out with them put it up on Instagram get 3 million views and then once you get served with a lawsuit for sexual assault just take those papers like that [ __ ] on fire because it don't matter because your Instagram famous baby and then hip thrusts that [ __ ] like button for me I do appreciate it I'll see in the next one peace [Music]
