When did you visit my place
When did you come into my heart But actually I don’t dislike it
(Oh Strange Why my heart is like) I was not ready so little surprised
Actually this is quite bad manners But actually not really I don’t dislike it
(Yes right I fall in love) Can I visit tomorrow as well
Come on Come on Come on Come closer If I knock your heart
Please open the door with smile Shall we tell one by one, only you and me
Stories of each other only between us Embarrassing and proud things
Keep them as a secret elsewhere only u & me What what what what what OMG Really
Again Again Again More More Tell me more What is the name? face? 
Not that other stories When did you visit my heart
When did you come in before I knew But actually not really I don’t dislike it
(Captivating me at once In a blink) Now it’s natural to me as well
I look so lovely even for myself Like this this this Do I become an adult
(Still shy when our eyes meet) There’s something I couldn’t tell anybody
Come on Come on Come on Come closer Actually I was so pleased
When you walked into my heart Shall we tell one by one, only you and me
Stories of each other only between us Embarrassing and proud things
Keep them as a secret elsewhere only u & me What what what what what OMG Really
Again Again Again More More Tell me more What is the name? face? 
Not that other stories Come again without saying
Shake me when I’m not ready You are the fake, too good to be true
The prefect chemistry with me You'll be in a trouble if my dad finds out
My heart is opening like this Oh boy today is Shh between you and me Shall we tell one by one, only you and me
Stories of each other only between us Embarrassing and proud things
Keep them as a secret elsewhere only u & me What what what what what OMG Really
Again Again Again More More Tell me more What is the name? face? 
Not that other stories
