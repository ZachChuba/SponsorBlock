[Music] thank you machine starts for sponsoring this video hey guys you know I would say hey go hey because it's been a minute hey girl hey what is up you guys I hope you're having a fantastic day today we're doing adding too much ingredients into slime but before we begin you've the video let's get started there is so many different add-ons that you can add into slime and that's why there's millions of these videos on the internet I've only done it one time and I was like yo I've only done this once I have a different ingredients that I didn't use in part one one that I haven't done is gold Leafs Talisa toss a lot has probably done this because she is the queen of adding too much into slime videos and she was actually the one that inspired me to do the first video we got an 8 ounce clear so we have some gold leaf right here we have 50 sheets look at all this gold leave ok there's 25 in each my favorite part about this is poking it we're gonna add this so far and we'll go on with more like come on look at that are you kidding okay I need to shut up we have 25 leaves in here right now yeah this is definitely enough there is 50 gold leaves in here leaves there's just too many in here to the point that I can't really stretch and much I mean you can but it's tough it's getting tough it looks really pretty but I think that's as much as an 8-ounce can hold okay next up is a little weird we don't have a lot of them but Alex did get them online which I'm really excited about we have two key they're not human teeth like gonna actual teeth I'm assuming they're like the Model T that a dentist would use also this a turn it's for fun there's not a lot to add like this is all we have this is about harsh teeth 168 teeth I'm gonna go and with this much slime so oh this is so weird oh my god like what's her in there they kind of don't look like teeth oh my gosh it just feels weird it feels crunchy ish feels like beads it's just weird oh my gosh it feels so weird well that was random okay so I got a lot of people slices this is a lot of female slices and I want to use all of these I think I'm actually gonna go in with an 8 ounce because I don't think a 6 ounce is gonna hold up all these few more slices if you're wondering how many female slices like how much there is this is a 32 ounce container and we just filled up what she's almost like laughs oh my god ah so many female slices this is already getting crunchy we've used about half of the 32 hours whoa I'm just gonna hold more no it's at ICAST I think I could fit them all here though I got to let it could fit them all in let's see if an 8 ounce could hold 32 ounces of female slices this is just wrong no no no guys I don't know this could happen is it possible is it possible everything's possible come on you know what we're gonna add in just a tiny bit like one ounce cuz I really want to collect all these female slices into this life whoa this is so so tough right now staying that's a lot of female slices so much okay this is my favorite one so far the crunches are just literally endless in this let me tell you that this has to weigh like a pound easily like two pounds cool it it's time for glitter these are chunky glitters and let me just show you these they're hollow stars more Hollow okay girl that might be a lot of Hollow we have some purple glitter we have some more of those chunky glitters those pretty blues okay this might be really pretty it's just that when there's so much in the slime like can you actually see how beautiful it is okay you see this amount of glitter right now I think it's beautiful why can't we just leave it like this here goes nothing so much glitter it's so much glitter ah I just have to do it I just have to do it it's a lot and I don't want to feel about it literally a ball of glitter I just something similar to this it's giving me laurdiy wives because we made a pink clear slam one time and we used a very very similar glitter but it was one of the pink side and I think it could hold more what it is but I had a lot of pigment or glitter to slime it starts getting like a stick to it like a tacky fuel and I don't like it how much can it hold too much pink and purple oh my god this is a lot y'all this is a lot oh my gosh how much glitter do we need okay I think that's enough glitter because it's literally hurting my hands like it does not feel nice anymore you feel the glue like with every poke every touch everything all right next up is fishbowl beads I'm gonna die I'm gonna color I'm gonna go ahead and color my slime yellow okay oh my gosh okay I need to stop playing with it cuz it's gonna get really buggy there is so much even here 15.5 ounces that is all I could do honestly even this is hard to stay in you could get stretch with you try and you go really slowly but even this is a lot that crunch bone [Applause] [Music] [Applause] whoo this is so many beads we have a lot of clay in front of us right now it's like a lot of bricks combined every break is a thousand grams let's see how much this 32 ounce to the hole oh okay the good thing about this clay is that it's so soft but this thing is huge I love this clay lo because no matter how much you add the clay is just really nice it's a lot of clay though like way too much this is like the amount of clay you would add not even to a gallon huh okay this honestly just feels like clay just straight-up clay this is so much clay like this feels like pure clay like just just clay more than anything this video was so so satisfying for my hands they're a little tired my fingers and that just about wraps up this video let me know down below what other really cool things can you mix into slime thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed this
