and joining the ranks of the general staff we're very pleased to announce that we've had our one hundred fifty dollar goal recently and therefore we will be releasing the first episode of our new series on historical guns later this month in the book the Leningrad blockade it is written that among the Soviet population somewhere between 1.6 and 2 million perished within the city of Leningrad and in battles surrounding the region between 1941 and 1944 the lowest range of this estimate exceeds the total number of Americans both military personnel and civilians who have perished in all armed conflicts from 1776 through the current war in Afghanistan I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian and today we'll be discussing the 872 day long siege of leningrad which is widely regarded as one of the most devastating sieges in history and possibly the most lethal for this reason we'll be providing you with an abundance of primary sources to effectively impart this horrifying tale end of this video 500,000 men of the German Army Group North dated by 1500 tanks the German air force advanced rapidly towards the Soviet city of Leningrad the former capital of the Russian Empire the citizens of Leningrad are on edge in July 1941 and stromae valet diva a Russian artist writes the following I suffer from constant mental and physical fatigue I cannot stop thinking for one minute about our courageous warriors a month after Anna wrote her entry the nearby cities of Novgorod and shunova fell to the Germans nothing stood in the way of Leningrad the first official acknowledgement of German troop movements read as follows comrades Leningrad errs dear friends over our beloved native City hangs the immediate threats of attack by German fascist troops the enemy is trying to break through to Leningrad he wants to destroy our homes to seize our factories and plants to deranged our streets and squares with the blood of the innocent to outraged our peaceful people to enslave the three sons of our motherland but this shall not be Leningrad cradle of the proletarian revolution never has fallen and never shall fall into enemy hands in early September 1941 German artillery began shelling the city Soviet General George uh qov arrived just days after the start of the bombardment and transformed Leningrad into a fortress hundreds of thousands of civilians were drafted to build a series of Defense's that stretch from luga and other outlying towns to the outskirts of Leningrad men and women of all ages worked rapidly to make up for their lost time however the internal defense of the soviet union had not been thoroughly considered by stalin and so preparation for the engagement with the verre moshed was largely unorganized after weeks of fortifying the Soviets anticipated a frontal assault on the city headed by German General Vilhelm von Leeb but it never came a large portion of the German forces were diverted last-minute to assist in securing southern Russia and those German troops remaining around Leningrad waited for further orders before initiating their main assault the upper echelon of Germany meanwhile were planning something utterly malevolent genocide and ethnic cleansing on a scale unprecedented Hitler knew that Germany could not feed the enormous population of Leningrad and so he resolved to let the population wither away due to malnutrition in the unforgiving Russian winter any survivors would likely meet a similar end as some historians speculate that hit wanted to have the city razed to the ground so wide Leningrad given that Moscow as well as the oil fields Germany would so desperately require in the coming months both why South will again quote the Leningrad blockade to explain Hitler's desire for Leningrad went beyond its military and industrial power to him the city symbolized the intrusion of Slav them onto the Baltic Sea coast that former Germanic domain of the Teutonic Knights and the Hansa in the cradle of revolutionary communism by late September of 1941 the city was almost entirely encircled and most of the civilians were trapped the siege had begun according to Anna Reed's Leningrad the epic siege of world war ii failing to empty leningrad of its surplus population before the siege ring closed was one of the soviet regime's and worst blunders of the war leading to more civilian deaths than any other except the failure to anticipate Barbarossa itself by August 29 636 thousand two hundred and eighty three people according to official sources had been evacuated but just over two and a half million civilians were left behind in the city plus another three hundred and forty three thousand in the surrounding towns and villages over four hundred thousand of them were children and over seven hundred thousand others were non-working dependents in late June nearly two months before the full encirclement of the city the local government of Leningrad did attempt to evacuate four hundred thousand children but this measure was reviled among Leningrad's populace sure enough the children that were evacuated approximately 15,000 in total ended up being put in the path of the ver Mach 2 as the German forces broke through the luga line during the initial stages of the siege Lou Bava Silvia recounts the following the skies were white balls of explosion the desperate efforts of the anti-aircraft guns suddenly from behind the roofs of a cloud started to grow it was so unlike small is it for a long time I could not comprehend that it was fire it wasn't long before a gnawing hunger seven a ration card system had already been put in place before the siege began but once it was under way the rations issued to Leningrad errs were three times smaller it certainly didn't help that the loaves of bread were largely composed of sawdust due to the scarcity of flour it actly one month later the first instance of cannibalism in Leningrad was recorded efforts were made to resupply the defenders through Lake Ladoga which froze over and allowed for an ice road to become operational this was the lifeline of Leningrad up to four hundred trucks a day delivered supplies across the ice taking refugees back after every trip but driving over the thin ice wasn't the only thing to worry about harsh conditions were compounded by the German Luftwaffe making the act of traversing the road a very dangerous one many who tried would end up at the bottom of Lake Ladoga the situation only continued to deteriorate in the following year with death rates spiking in the winter of 1942 during this period close to 200,000 people died began corpses a common sight for those brave enough to venture out into the once lively streets of Leningrad Yelena maitreya wrote in her diary which is now preserved in the Museum of Defense in Leningrad that this has reached an immense harvest on Linea Graz frozen streets silence and assigned to be seen not a rustle to be heard not the sound of cars our steps magnificent silence Lidia Rossum off SCA's account has also gained recognition in Russia as a former nurse she relays how near the end of January a boy appeared at the hospital she was working at and according to Rosa masuka's account he was skinny pale and indifferent to everything the boy went on to say that his parents were fighting in the front lines and his grandmother who was taking care of him passed away in many ways the boy's story was a microcosm for the desperation that all leningraders faced during the summer of 1942 almost a year after the beginning of the siege this anafi non offensive was launched which proved inconclusive it was followed by Operation oscura in the winter of 1943 which was carried out by the combined Leningrad and volkov fronts and culminated in the triumph of the Red Army after they repelled the Germans who were manning fortifications on the southern banks of Lake Ladoga this allowed the Soviets to ship more supplies to the hunger stricken populace but it would take more than a year for the siege to be completely lifted by the time the German siege was fully lifted in 1944 about one and a half million soldiers and civilians had perished we'll conclude by quoting Anna Reed who in the conclusion of her book says this after even the greatest tragedies life flows on new replaces old absences are filled the past is overlaid and forgotten
