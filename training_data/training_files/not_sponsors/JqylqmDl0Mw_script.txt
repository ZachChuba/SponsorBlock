Monday Wednesday friday-sunday eight days in two weeks in your terms eight times in two weeks equals four times a week genius all muscle and no brains mole double count Sunday that is two weeks plus one day did you fail brain tumor thus your own post said four or five times a week now you just neglect I mention the five grow up in admit when you are wrong believe me you can look further like that are you [ __ ] maybe you should look at a calendar I didn't double count Sunday my two weeks started and ended on Sunday exactly 14 days what don't you understand and it here is a calendar I made little dots for each day so you could comprehend that is 15 days are you that ethic mental you can't have a week though Sunday to Saturday then Sunday to Sunday look at the pic you posted count the days what are they 15 kids these days I was right 3.5 times a week it's always the first guy to post it and you my bright friend are hello uncle its 14 days try again maybe you should try counting on your fingers if you work out on the eighth you wouldn't start counting the days till the 9th because that is one day then the tenth would be two days and so on until you get to the 22nd which is how many days are two weeks four on 14 and I am saying you trade seven times in two weeks which in other terms is 3.5 times a week I cannot believe I have to type three replies for you to get this here [ __ ] read this sunday on monday tuesday on with it Thursday on Friday Saturday on Sunday Monday on Tuesday Wednesday on Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday on Monday Tuesday on Wednesday Thursday on Friday Saturday and on Sunday Monday on Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday on Saturday you tell me how that works out I see three times one week then four times the next which equal 7hl eggs in case you forgot one week is Sunday to Saturday not Sunday to Sunday that's eight days [ __ ] for me to get this you are the one who is not getting it it's simple just look at the calendar and talk to God there is seven days in a week if you work out every other day you work out four days a week how hard is that to King comprehend I'll do it out in four weeks for you maybe it will make more sense week one Sunday Tuesday Thursday Saturday week -
