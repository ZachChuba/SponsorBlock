build a beautiful website you can do it all in one place with Squarespace my right welcome to another studio blog in this video I am going to be painting a future school library in Cambodia I wanted to show you guys the entire process from initial ideation client feedback changes that come with that the problems that arose and then the fire piece which I'm super super happy with or you skippers out there skip ahead five milliseconds because I forgot to show you the final result boom now that we've got that ever done with it's time to start the process I hope you liked this video and I'll see you later [Music] now I asked the first time in school that place behind me is called happiness house Jordan talk me through I don't want to intrude and do a full block which I love the lives as a piece on its own but it's not gonna work so then we were playing around with like cream I prefer existing I do like this you can get a blue that color be nice well a nice digital RGB blue surely there's an East clients I don't think that we filmed enough to explain what was happening here and I think it would be more concise if I just explained it at this point we had shown mr. safar who's the founder of hello school D concepts and he said it was good but I could tell that he was a little bit reserved and it wasn't sharing his exact thought so I kind of asked him what he thought about this this this kind of  questions about the things that he didn't like and what I gathered from that conversation was that it was a little bit too abstract for the context of this mural and that for the outside of the school it was a little bit dark as well because we showed it with blue I went back and I created a new concept instead of having a lot of busy elements everywhere which made it seem a lot less easy to understand I think I created like more of a scene which is I think what he wanted and after I said that to him he sent me a bunch of reference images which is something that I usually ask for at the stop and I think that he already had a vision for the school already I don't know why I just assumed that but that was a mistake on my behalf so while the images that he set through were not unusual or overly complex I'm not well practiced in painting with acrylic based paints especially like that if I went ahead and did the bureau in that style I wouldn't be happy and he probably wouldn't be happy with the Edwards because we'd be finding a media between what I wanted and what he wanted my mom commissioned a local artist with the outside of school emphases the fire asked me to paint in the meditation room which is the future library which I thought was amazing in mine style so as I think the best outcome of all of the options that we had but basically the takeaway years never assume that you know what the client wants always ask questions first but in the end I'm really really happy with how the mural came out so I hope you enjoy the next few minutes of bliss my favorite part of the video [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's it [Music] that's it I hope you liked this video and I hope you like the end result let me know what you think it's the first girl I've painted in a long time I actually want to do some more so I want to thank mrs.
