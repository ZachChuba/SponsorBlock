hey what's going on you guys it is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome it to a brand new video for you all today so today I bring you guys a different style loot video first things first this is loot from 3000 green dragons and the reason that this video is different than most that's mainly because a lot of Peking was done in the making of this video and I would say 80% of all the clips that you guys are gonna be seeing throughout this very long video is me really just peeking people whether it's me defending myself or whether it's just me at killing fellow Peavy Emmer's whether they were dragon BOTS or Venezuelans there was no one off-limits for this and that's kind of where the entertainment came from because I did livestream pretty much all of this on Twitch some crazy things happen during this video if you were there for the live streams you definitely know what I'm talking about if not you guys are in for a lot of surprises so yeah I do hope you guys enjoyed today's video you know Green Dragons have been in the game a very long time being released December 1st 2003 at a combat level of 79 they've always stayed the exact same as it goes for their graphics and yeah other than the Goblin the chicken the cow I would say this is one of the most nostalgic monsters in all of runescape really represents what the game is all about overall according to the runescape wiki there is six different locations that you can kill green dragons at but as always I did want to choose pretty much the number one hot spot for peak Aires which is why I chose Cara languor I think I'm pronouncing that correctly and this is north of the graveyard of shadows in level 24 to 26 wilderness usually this area is mainly dominated by the presence of a lot of Venezuelans kind of around the levels of 80 to 90 you don't see too many level 100's here I mean I was here for around 4 days 8 to 10 hours a day and I didn't see too many of my levels although anyone that I did see that I could attack I definitely did attack and you may ask yourself well mister no-sleep if you did kill all these people killing dragons did their bones and their hides get mixed in with your bones and your hides and the answer to that is absolutely you know I figure this is loot from 3000 green dragons but that certainly does not mean that I have to kill all 3,000 myself obviously I kind of did but yes it signed that I did kill someone depending on what was going on depending on if there was any people nearby I would most of the time pick up all their bones all of their hides that's where the useful looting bag did come in as most of you know if you do have the elite wilderness Diaries complete all of your dragon bones from any dragon in the wilderness will be noted and since that was the case for me the looting bag pretty much just stored all of the green dragon hides so if you do decide to kill anything in the wild it is highly recommended that you bring a looting bag when I'm sure most of you guys all know that here in this clip you know I was actually just exploring the East Dragons this is the spot south of in anatta surround 22 to 25 wilderness and go figure the very first world that I went to I actually got almost peak aid and then he just ended up teleporting and I decided to do some hopping around and there is a lot of bots here this spot is pretty much the bot hotspot other than occasionally seeing a few 105 so you really don't see too many of my levels at this area this was actually on a weekend and then the following Monday I came back here and there was nobody here I hopped through numerous worlds dozens of worlds and was virtually empty and I did go on the old school runescape Twitter and it did say that 28,000 BOTS had been banned on Monday and I'm assuming a lot of these green dragon BOTS were pretty much a part of that didn't stay here too long I think I was only here for like a day or two if you do come to this area in the total level worlds you might see some iron men you know grinding some green dragon bones stockpiling a lot of things obviously back in the old days you know 2005 to 2007 this was a very popular peak a hot spot names like bloodhound 34 elf mage and of course Mako Pro they all did PK around here so this was pretty much my childhood as seen on youtube many many years ago but after those two days went by I did return to the Carroll angered dragons and I just went back to work as you can see a lot of people do bring cannons here and that is suggested I mean you're not gonna lose too much money if you bring a cannon if anything you're just gonna get a lot more kills per hour so even though you will be spending money on cannonballs your kills per hour will go up so significantly I think it'll actually be worth the cost I myself didn't bring a cannon I didn't think I needed to since I was such a high level and I was also super combat syp the whole entire video I didn't think a cannon was necessary and I don't think it is necessary if you're past 120 combat but if you are level 80 and you're level 90 and you bring in a can and then you're definitely gonna get probably similar kills per hour than I was if not more is a good med level money making method to kill Green Dragons and I'm sure a lot of you were probably annoyed that I started the video using as amrok hosta and don't worry after the first 500 or so kills I did go ahead and switch over to a dragon hunter Lance you just have to understand I was scrolling up so often in live streaming this you know the chance of me getting T beat and then of course a clan logging in was very high and it didn't even happen quite a few times so I thought the dragon hunter Lance as well as the dragon claw risk was just a little too much then I grew some balls and just started scaling up with all that stuff anyway you may also notice now at this point I did change my username for mr. no-sleep to crab rangoon whose actually wasn't after the Chinese food I know go figure never tried that before yet yeah I did just want to not be known as mr. no sleep in the wilderness you know I already had a target on my back from streaming all this and speaking of being targeted this is why I decided not to kill the green dragons in the multi Revd caves I know that there is that lovely amulet that just notes everything but unfortunately it is in multi so yeah I tried to escape this team and unfortunately I guess I haven't learned these steps of the wild not to run in because I ran right into multi from singles and luckily for me the ice barrage as well as the in tangler did splash around six times each so yes I should have died there no doubt about it and that is my fault for even trying out the rebbe cave Green Dragons when you have elite wilderness Diaries and you're already getting noted bones there's really no reason to go there now for this next clip I just want to give a big shout out to my man a mac and cheese it looks like I wasn't the only one who named myself after food but yeah you know when I did kill this guy I knew it was a little too good to be true and to change my player attack options from left-click only to off and as you can see there it did slow down the clip there was a max mage Third Age made chatt arcane and all logged in and the goal was for me to while I was picking up the loot look on him skull and then I would be tele blocked and then I would be screwed so yeah guys have you ever killed someone in the wild and you're looting their stuff and it just seemed like it was too easy and it was too good to be true it most likely is just make sure to change your player attack options to the right way and that way you'll be safe from sculling yourself and that actually happened numerous times throughout the video I mean I didn't mind because every time I killed their alts or their beta count whatever you want to call it whether it was a team a clan or just one guy on multiple counts doing this it was always a free 300k so I'm not gonna complain and the inventory as well as the gear that I was using was really old-school I mean I was always bringing it the manta rays as well as the karim ones for combo eats as well as always a SAN few serums just in case I got poisoned with a good stack of brews and restores I did go with divine super ranging and divine super combat potions just to kind of help me speed up the track and kills themselves at any time that I would spec someone who was pretty obvious when I was going to because every time you take a sip of the divine potions it does damage you a little bit I didn't make it pretty obvious at times but honestly it didn't really cost me to kill too often I do hope you guys don't take offense to me killing some Venezuelans throughout this video you know the air and the wilderness and it is the wild after all I did kill one guy though and I did feel a little bit remorseful so I did give him five mil just to prove to you guys that I do have a heart you know I'm not always so ruthless but yeah he's a nice guy shout out to my man Luis and yeah most of the time when I would kill someone who was just killing dragons the only traps that I would receive is just a few armor pieces sometimes a combat bracelet these guys really brought some weird gear I mean I'm talking runes skins Carol's coy steam capes leather chaps mithril armor I mean I just don't understand like you think that they would bring just a basic set of D hide in a glory but yeah I really don't know I guess everyone's just is into their own thing there were occasions where I did attack some people who were actually doing the same exact thing that I was doing at a couple times where some people would retaliate with cloth specs or AGS specs but for the most part I did do pretty well only died one time in the making of this whole entire video and I think you guys will see that clip a little later on at this point I was one thousand kills and I was having a great time a good friend of mine big steak er from back in the day did visit me while I was killing these green dragons and I guess he just somehow lost his claws he must have forgot to protect items so yeah and the following clips when you see me pick up an insane amount of loot don't think too much of it sometimes I just meet some people who have a lot of money and they feel like giving it to me I didn't keep any of this the total loot I think was eight pairs of tracking claws and quite a lot of other stuff and if you were in my live streams last week you did receive this all throughout giveaways not promoting my streams and I'm certainly not promoting giveaway he's never really been a big fan of them to begin with but yeah all those clips just pretty much extra clips don't think too much of it I didn't keep anything you know this whole loot series is how I built my bank and it's how I want to maintain my bank I myself was a big stake here back in the day but those days are long gone regardless a big shout-out to my friend Josh very generous guy and we did it make a lot of people happy with all that gp2 giveaway now that clip there was another example of me almost having a problem you know I did get telly blocked on the same tick of where I tell Eid I did get away luckily and of course I came back ten minutes later to rush this guy and I chanced myself for about sixty five mils so yeah I wasn't afraid of scrolling up by any means this was just one of those days where I was in a certain kind of mood and luckily for me I didn't pay for it i tanked both of those times but that guy with the HDS did have a really good shot at getting me for one of the biggest losses that I would have had in this whole loot series and to add insult to injury he even saw that 267 milk and of mine and even asked for a split so yeah it was pretty funny in my opinion and yeah here's actually the clip where I did fight some guy looks like he was just a simple PK heir and I figured why not you know content is content and he did get me with that high vengeance I myself was bringing a rune pouch as well this whole video and of course stacking the vengeance runes inside they're one of the most underrated things especially for anti PK is vengeance you know people are gonna tend to hit pretty high on you and if you time it correctly you can get yourself an amazing kill or you of course yourself can be on the receiving end of that of course there were occasions where I would be in some sticky situations and people would be rushing me and I just had to log out and luckily every time that I was sure that I was going to die I did log outs and I did get away so yeah my tanking effort was pretty good for this video compared to most other videos in the wilderness yeah getting back to the Green Dragons themselves you know let's talk a little bit about the drop table you know every single clue scroll that I would get I'm sure most of you guys know that Green Dragons do drop hard clues as well as most dragons and since I was in the wilderness I was using a ring of wealth imbued which means that one in 128 drop rate drops down to one in 64 so you guys are gonna see a ton of caskets towards the end of the video alongside doing the clues you know the other drops can consist of just a few gems a few different herbs and a little bit of alcohols you know nothing too crazy just steel and myth as well as the infamous a tea full helm alongside the rune daggers I did my very best to keep track of all the coins as well you know since that ring of wealth does have the ability to keep track and pretty much put all the into your inventory I was collecting them all and of course banking them all however there would be times where I would kill someone and they would drop the amount of GP that is equivalent to barrows gloves so sometimes that would get mixed in but at the very end I tried my best to kind of just come up with a number that sounded right that looked right based off with the kills and certain clips that I already had the normal amount of coins for you don't have to be a hundred percent accurate I mean they're just green dragons after all hope you guys don't take the coins too seriously at all honestly I don't really think people pick up the coins even the Venezuelans from what I see they're usually just left on the floor this clip here you know was very strange to me because as I was killing some dragons a guy who looked like he was coming from the Revd caves was just walking by very casually and I did spec him out as quickly as I could but notice how he didn't have a bracelet on at least didn't look like he had a bracelet on and the second that I started picking up his drops there were two max mages south but they instantly just kind of looked at me and then they ran away maybe that bear saved my life I still don't know to this day but nevertheless it was about a 900 K solid PK just from what looked to be a PV Emmer if not a skull trick bait and I'm always a good fish for some bait you know I'm the big whale that always pretty much goes for anything in the wild you know tend to scroll up over almost anything but here's just another example of me killing someone and it was actually a decent fight I didn't think too much of it but I was still being pretty paranoid and then of course after about 10 seconds of right-clicking there was a max mage that logged in underneath me and I luckily had the last laugh on that one as well so yeah I mean if this video doesn't teach you anything about green dragons at least you'll learn a little bit about what not to do in the wilderness and you know of course always being cautious even if you think to yourself that you know you're never gonna kill green dragons for money that is true but maybe you'll be in a situation one day where you'll be doing some wilderness Slayer and you know people tend to target people doing wilderness Slayer quite often and even if you see someone who's asking for your help or they're trying to help you you really can't trust anyone you know in this clip here I did kill another major yet again and the same skill trick was going on where you're just you know spam clicking and PKR logs in underneath and in this situation there was a max mage who logged in and as soon as he did you notice how that guy with the armadillo helmet instantly attacked him I still think to this day that they're actually a team I did come back and they were still attacking him but I was later shown a screenshot that kind of showed that guy in the same group so I don't know what they were trying to do they're kind of a reminder that even if you're watching a fight go on you could still be the intent that's argue you just never know these days 2020 and people are always coming up with new methods and new ways to get you to scull I've been in that scene as well and it's still thriving and a clip coming up here was yet again another friend of mine who actually genuinely wanted to fight and try to kill me but luckily for me he's a mobile user and I know mobile users you know I'm not nothing against them or anything they don't make for the best P cares so I did get myself a nice eight mil PK from him I didn't keep any of that stuff though I just gave that stuff away too you know I didn't think I needed it and yeah there was a pretty big team that did run by shortly after that kind of a reminder that north of this area is black gin Chiapas and that is a pretty good peaking hot spot mainly for single teams so if they do spot you at dragons you just have to be wary of that get ready but Ellie and all that good stuff my teleportal choice for this video from start to finish was just the simple amulet of glory along with the simplistic gear as well as the inventory I'd say the only thing that was Opie or kind of new school was of course the dragon hunts or Lance but with that Lance here we are all these days later with 3,000 green dragons finally killed I know this video was very long but what can I say you know there was a lot of content to show a lot of clips a lot of people hopefully this inspires some people to maybe check out the Green Dragons you know I know Rebs is mainly where people like to PK and anti PK yeah you know if you're ever bored try out the Green Dragons I seem to have a lot of fun there on and off streams so yeah it was a good experience let's get into the price check so the price check of all these bones and hides and everything in between comes out to be just about fifteen point nine mil rounded up the price of insult heads actually on the rise this was a really good time to be killing these green dragons just in the bones and the hides we actually did make thirteen point three mil so most of your profit is obviously just gonna come from those two main things the hides and the bones so the insult heads as well as the alcohols do add up over time I would recommend you either bring Alex with you or just vengeance so that you know you don't have to pick those up individually and for the amount of clues scrolls that we did receive we have 29 caskets to open so let's go ahead and open all those now if you're curious about the cost of supplies for this video it really wasn't too much time that I would ever eat food was if I was in a fight and I don't think that I should just factor in that food for the cost of supplies since really if you're just killing Green Dragons the only thing you actually should be using is the occasional prayer sieve and of course the divine super combat sit before the supplies I'll just say 500k I think it would ever be more than that supersets are always optional you know just really makes for faster kills per hour with the Lance as well as the method that I was doing in my attention span I was just getting about 75 to 80 kills an hour and I know for a fact you can get well over 100 kills an hour especially if you bring a cannon as you can see from these girls we weren't getting anything too rare but you know the average reward you know we were definitely getting that in double the amount yeah really good rewards you know a lot of 150 case a couple 200 case and quite a lot of over 100k rewards I did actually have a master clue in my bank while I was opening these so that's on me I do apologize but to be honest you guys don't really ever see master clues in this loot series anyway bill for me in 2020 it's actually switched a rune light so I can start doing mash to clues because they do take me a long time still to this day oh that's just one more flaw that I gotta fix overall though as you all saw 29 hard clues scrolls was achieved and all opened and we did make just about 3.3 to 3.5 millimeter green dragons themselves the overall amount is about nineteen point three mil well just from all of the bots as well as the Venezuelans as well as the people that IP Kade on the side I did make approximately maybe one mil from all of them it was hard to keep track of because you know just had so much weird things happen through the video as I'm sure most of you have seen by now and if you're one of those people that just skips to the price check I know the thumbnail is a little misleading but I assure you this video has a lot of funny moments so I do recommend you actually checking it out this was by far one of my favorite videos as it just goes for entertainment value obviously the accomplishment was a little bit low but it was so much fun I mean this was just one of those things where if it's in the wilderness you know the enjoyment for me just goes way up I even honored the Green Dragons that I slayed by dressing up as a green dragon and trying my best to you know breathe fire and bring demise to my fellow PB embers and P K's in the wilderness but of course I died like 20 times and I killed like two people but anyway it was a lot of fun this whole video was a lot of fun I hope you guys enjoyed watching it if you curious for any details regarding the Green Dragons again just check out the description below happy New Year to all of you it's still January so I think I could still say that thank you for your time today I know it was a long one I really do appreciate you watching it and until next time mr. no sleep ow
