so if you don't know who Elizabeth Warren is which most of you probably do but not all of my audience is American so if you don't Elizabeth Warren is an American senator and former law school professor who found herself in an embarrassing predicament after it was discovered that she listed her ethnicity as American Indian on a State Bar of Texas registration form as well as a Harvard Law job application presumably trying to get in on some of that sweet sweet affirmative action now I don't know if you can tell but this woman is not an American Indian anyway when God Emperor Trump cottoned on to this complete load of bollocks he started mockingly referring to Warren as Pocahontas and even challenged her to get a DNA test to prove her claims that she was an American Indian and I just want to thank you because you have very very special people you were here long before any of us were here although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago they call her Pocahontas but you know what I like you because you are special Elizabeth Warren actually went and got the DNA test and it turns out that she actually does have some American Indian ancestry how much you ask Elizabeth Warren is one in 1024 parts American Indian so I'm probably more American Indian than Elizabeth Warren I mean I'm sure an American Indian and some stray and convicts probably got it on some time in the last few hundred years while the [ __ ] not but talk about egg on your face what is shameful and embarrassing lie like anyone who's being honest with themselves I know that I have made mistakes I am sorry for harm I have caused I have listened and I have learned a lot and I am grateful for the many conversations that we've had together it is a great honor to be able to partner with Indian country and that's what I've tried to do as a senator and that's what I promise I will do as president of the United States of America oh yeah she's also running for president in 2020 which gets us to the crux of this videos topic you see everyone knows it was those pesky kids and their darkness and it means that got Trump elected in 2016 so being the forward-thinking progressive candidate that she is Elizabeth Warren has just announced the formation of Warren's meme team and it is funny and we will laugh at it right after this the world-famous is about you've got nothing to lose cringe is one of those things that's kind of hard to define different people have differing opinions on what constitutes cringe because it is a somewhat subjective thing all I can say is I know it when I see it I have a particular case in porn okay I prefer when women preferably college-age but older is fine I find the older I get the more attractive all the women like all the women look but I prefer when women themselves using a webcam or their laptop or whatever set up and perform solo acts themselves on camera and upload it themselves you know the amateur and I don't know how amateur all this is someone could be shot to look amateur basically amateur porn of females masturbating that's what I enjoy watching what comes to porn you see what I'm saying okay so Juan's meme dream-team so as you can see the headline meme here is you can do a lot with two cents and I think these are like pennies floating in the background or something so I think that means you can like to do a lot with your [ __ ] thoughts as in your opinion your two cents now let's see what do they say here hi We're Warren's meme team you may have read about us in the New York Times we're saving the nation with selfies and memes okay how the [ __ ] do you save the nation with selfies or memes for that matter luckily there's a warrens meme team plan let's have a look at some of this plan mission first let's define meme when most people here mean they think image macros specifically but a meme is any unit of culture that spreads as people replicated and add their own twist they are conceptually simple participatory easy and generally fun nothing like a bit of participatory alized fun social media teams on campaigns do a great job of amplifying memes when they happen but political memes tend to originate externally and randomly and much of what Trump is amplified since 2016 have come from supporters who could run the full stack process from message to creative to distribution President Trump has successfully outsourced to creativity to his supporters for Senator Warren to win we must outperform the meme efforts of our primary and general election competitors Warren's main team is a people power engine to help spread the campaign's message faster and further the purpose of this power is to win in 2020 then support President Warren in enacting her agenda attributes a meme is a template the attributes of successful means for the left are visual people process images 60,000 times faster than text and it performs better on social short or on the side of fewer words so more people quickly understand fun politics is serious but more engaging when supporters have fun viral voters have to want to share if it doesn't spread it's dead expressive positivity and other emotions without resorting to least common denominator person Warren already knows the relateable power of selfies robust designed and distributed to make misuse by trolls more difficult we will explore a bunch of visual formats to determining which ones we find an asymmetric advantage some will work some will not we will experiment learn and iterate well I think this is a winner I mean how could you fail with a corporate memorandum explaining to people how they should [ __ ] post on the Internet I signed up to Warren's main team over at Warren's meme team comm I hope to see you there look out for user Warren meme magic oh one cheerio [Music] [Music]
