[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys exact hope you all are doing well hope you had a great holiday season welcome to the first best Android apps video of the year as always application links are down below in the description so make sure you check them out and I'd have to offer by using the very first two link down below first up we're taking a look at one gallery if you guys are familiar with one of my all-time favorite weather apps today weather which by now you should be the developers that made that application made this it's free it's clean fast and it's easy to use it has a baked in photo editor you can trim videos it has dark mode and you can hide photos and videos using the encryption feature and you can lock them up using a pin a pattern or your fingerprint this actually quickly became my new go-to gallery application make sure you try it out speaking of go to my new go-to wallpaper app is crisper yes this is another unsplash client but it isn't just any unsplash client this just might be the best one I have come across first off it's free so that's a good start it's got dark mode it's one of if not the fastest and most responsive unsplash client that I've used it's very easy to navigate pictures load quickly you've got all of your usual photo photographer and location information you can download the photos in RAW on the spot and on top of all of this and has a surprisingly in-depth photo editor you can crop you can rotate you can adjust contrast saturation brightness all that good stuff you can blur photos too and then you've got all of these extra special effects that you can mess around with it's pretty neat stuff this is easily one of my favorite wallpaper applications third application on hand is this super handy unit converter for starters the app is very small in file size it's ad free with no weird permissions or anything it's an offline application and it's got basically every unit of measurement you need so when you go in to convert something you choose what you'd like to convert and as you type in the amount you'll see all the other applicable conversions below and if you'd like to copy a conversion you can just tap on it and it'll copy to your clipboard the app itself is well put together in clean and quick it's got two different dark modes and the settings has a number of tweaks in it if you'd like to further adjust conversion results so like I said this is a super handy application to have on hand and I'm sure a lot of you could get some use out of this fourth app is also super handy this is rotation lock bubble the concept here is actually very simple basically you want to turn off auto rotate on your phone and then enable this application so when you do that and rotate your phone the orientation won't adjust until you hit this little bubble that pops up giving you full control over when the orientation shifts you can tweak the look and the position of the bubble and you can even change the rotation lock on a per application basis which just ties everything together nicely this is great for users that like to use their phone while laying down or just find it really annoying when the phone decides to rotate when you don't want it to rotate all right so application number five is called toady Toddie toady to die dude I have no idea how to pronounce this this application has been floating around out there for years but not too long ago it floated its way over to Android basically it aims to help you stay on top of your home cleaning you start out by adding an area of your house that you want to target then you add a cleaning task you can choose from the presets or create your own then you can set the necessary cleaning frequency and you can even set this task to be active during certain months or active at all times then after that you can set the current state of cleanliness that that area is in and you'll get to see when it's time to start cleaning that area this app has a handful of different functions like multiple users vacation management device syncing notifications and widgets and more I'm actually gonna try using this application on a daily basis as I can definitely see how it'll help out that application number six we're taking a look at my current go-to icon pack picks material this is an Android ten inspired eye contact that showcases some of the cleanest icons that I've seen as of late it comes packed with well over 1200 icons and Counting and ten cloud-based wallpapers to match as of this video it's compatible with pretty much every launcher out there it does cost a buck fifty but if you're a customization freak it's easily worth it it looks so good it's my new favorite next we're taking a quick look at photo time this is a golden hour calculator simply put this will show you where and when sunsets and sunrises will be this is perfect for those of you that really like taking advantage of golden hour for some really nice photo taking you can pinpoint precise locations and you can use the integrated calendar to check for times ahead and it's pretty cool nearing the end of the list we've got a couple of games the first one is traffic's the objective here is very simple all you have to do is tap the traffic light to stop or allow cars to pass through safely without hitting another car that's it as it is with games like this it'll start off super simple to get you in the swing of things but as the game progresses it'll prove to be quite the challenge with different road layouts multiple lights and more traffic so it is sure to test your timing and multitasking skills now one of my favorite things about this game is just how nice it looks the graphics are very clean minimal and colorful and the sound effects bring the whole experience together very well the next game is called poly star this one is also simple yet difficult the objective here is to rotate these 3d puzzles in a way to where the pieces come together to complete the full image it's definitely more difficult than it looks but you'll get the hang of it this game aims to be a bit of a stress reliever with relaxing music and minimal graphics that are pleasing to the eye if you like puzzles if you like art and stories I'm sure you'll enjoy this game last application on hand is called pigments simply put this application generates color palettes this is great for those of you that could use some color scheme inspiration if you're creating or designing something you can select different generating settings for different palette styles there are different settings for different types of colorblindness you can rearrange the order of the colors you can add or take away colors if you'd like and you can favorite palettes to save them for later I know not everyone will find this application useful but I know some of you will so be sure to check it out so that's it for this episode of best Android apps if you enjoyed feel free to leave
