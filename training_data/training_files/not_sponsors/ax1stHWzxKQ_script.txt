it's no secret that the security of IOT or smart devices is pretty abysmal right now here's a cool site called hacked dot camera from security researcher Paul Mehra piece that illustrates just how weak and unprotected some devices are right out of the box every single one of those color-coded pinpoints is not just one but actually a group of smart devices like cameras that on less savory sites could actually be directly accessed by anyone with the know-how online so that is where our sponsor for today's video BitDefender total security comes in their software suite and their hardware BitDefender box are designed to protect your entire home including devices like cameras that cannot be loaded with traditional antivirus software and guys make sure you stick around because BitDefender is offering an extended free trial to our viewers we'll have the full details at the end of the video so why don't we take a little tour of my house and have a look at some of the threats that I have lying around so we'll install the BitDefender box later for now let's walk around and have a look at some of the potential points of ingress for my home starting of course with this smart camera now this is a nest cam and as smart cameras go they're relatively reputable it's not a simple task to just connect to someone else's nest cam but the point that I'm trying to make and that this is supposed to illustrate is that anything that's accessible from the Internet is a potential way for someone to gain information or in the case of very insecure cameras a live video feed of the inside of your house and there are plenty of cameras out there that have massive vulnerabilities I mean really if you think about it anything whether it's a game console a connected TV other more different game console or a PC is a potential gateway into your home network so just right here I've got like five points of entry out in the garage we immediately find some potentially more sketchy things so in my pile of projects that I still have to do I've got my paintball mask lens that I'm trying to silicone back together so that stuff doesn't get up store calm ah this is awesome my mask that I put one of the waist bands of our l TT underwear on No so to make it work again and also a ring doorbell that I haven't installed yet but I will and this this is exactly the kind of generic Chinese smart-home stuff that can potentially be a problem and in this case access to this device could mean that an intruder not only has a view into my home they could potentially walk right through the garage door the best part is I made a video about installing it and then didn't change anything about it so hasn't happened yet but where's wood wood ish so funny story here the only reason I have a nest thermostat is that my wife won it through like our credit card company or something like that like I'm the last person in the world who needs to win a smart thermostat or whatever but I figured what the hey I've got it might as well install it potential point of ingress on that subject my Sonos smart speakers yet another smart connected device with the potential to be a security flaw next up we've got the nest smoke and carbon monoxide detector then of course there's the connected hub of my home which is the office where my wife and I have our computers and the server closet where you'll find both of our desktops that are connected via Thunderbolt 2 the desks over there my home server which has got my plex server any internet shares any of that kind of stuff as well as just my nas archive my router and I think that's pretty much it actually for connected stuff in here I don't know if my printer has any like in printing features or anything like that but if it did the point is anything accessible from the Internet is a potential security threat now let's have a look at the BitDefender box which runs the latest BitDefender total security software in a nutshell the box is bitdefender's hardware solution for devices that cannot run their total security software like most of the devices we've just gone over so the idea here is that they've got device detection and management so you can monitor your connected devices and see what is sending or receiving data vulnerability assessments you can identify weaknesses in your home network as well as anomaly detection mechanisms to block compromised devices and this is something that is pretty interesting to me actually when they pitched this to us the parental features for me are one of the things that stands out because they allow you to just shut off internet access to any device that is assigned to your child within the home so we're gonna need the BitDefender central app and then there's a whole bunch of stuff to do so the first thing I'm supposed to do is just plug this puppy into power there you go that's unplug your isp modem from the power outlet what if I don't want to do it that way I have to connect to the BitDefender box Wi-Fi do you know what the default password is oh quick don't why shouldn't probably read that out I mean I can change it but power up your ISP modem plug your ISP modem connects BitDefender box to the Internet you are ready to secure your network all right cool I have a personal Wi-Fi router there we go this can just go straight into here and theoretically that should work now shadow you're not helping right now but you just checking out the security making sure we're gonna keep all the internet mice out well you're a button cat okay so we're up and running now it's gonna scan for devices on the network it says there are no devices connected to the network you know that doesn't seem right new device is this that must be me so it actually prompts me then to install BitDefender software on the device oh here we go now I've got this whole dashboard that I didn't see a second ago network settings can be changed only while connected to the main Wi-Fi yeah yeah you might as well oh your Wi-Fi network is disabled well there's there's the issue okay there it is okay we're connecting to BitDefender box now we can go in and change settings yay okay so let's go ahead and let's jump on the ruckus Wi-Fi let's make sure that's working that's working freaking awesome then because we need to connect directly to the BitDefender box's Wi-Fi for the initial update what I would love to do is jump on its Wi-Fi turn off its Wi-Fi so that it actually has to be manually re-enabled by me and then there's basically no way to get into it alright my ruckus extender just got picked up good stuff settings saved successfully fantastic so we've got the kid app installed here and then we've got check this out 18 protected devices that are on our network here so I've got my anti phone I've got a handful of dropcam's a harmony hub expressive home automation - desktop - WS my nest thermostat everything shows up exactly as we would expect it to so will download BitDefender total security one of the things that they boast about in their literature is they're very low system resources usage so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna let the computer settle down and be doing nothing and we'll have a quick look at what our CPU utilization as well as our memory utilization looks like okay so we're sitting at just shy of 19 gigs of memory usage in about 3 to 5 % CPU usage right now so let's go ahead install BitDefender Oh interesting curiously actually a family link only forces safe search on there doesn't seem to be any way to actually filter Internet content so let's say I'm out somewhere or whatever the case may be and I'm like look I don't want the kids playing Nintendo or whatever I mean this assumes they're playing an online game maybe that's not a great example I don't think they play anything online games for the switch but this way I could know for sure really cool so you can just instantly knock out the internet for any device on your network alright so now that it's installed we've got our trial active here be aware of your devices security status at a glance ransomware remediation so this is basically just a data backup snapshotting type tool so that if someone does send you ransomware you just have a copy of the data already that is not encrypted oh that's right it includes a VPN which is pretty cool so let's go ahead and have a look at how much overhead we're looking at so there's definitely a memory usage cost it looks like about 500 megabytes obviously on my system that's fine but your mileage may vary and then in terms of CPU we're sitting at right around the same range so that's actually pretty nice to see when we start a scan and see how much it eats so we're getting a little bit of disk thrashing about 5% CPU usage you can also see the frequency picked up a little bit but memory usage actually not too much heavier uses around another 200 Meg's while scanning your system files it's not that one other cool feature is the game profile so when you turn it on the defender will not only hide notifications and pop-ups but it will also prioritize your games connection now you can go game by game if you just have Steam running all the time but some feedback for a bit defender is that it would be nice if there was a like an automatic game exe finder functionality or something like that akin to the way that Nvidia handles it in GeForce experience because it is a bit of a bear to go around and find all your exe s this is cool you can actually even postpone windows automatic updates through the BitDefender dashboard which of course you can do manually but it's just all in one place if you know this is for cousin Jeff who's not particularly tech savvy and you just don't want to hear about it anymore a couple of other cool features of the app include there protect which is like a constant scanner while you're browsing the web as well as this is cool app lock so you can protect private apps against unwanted access with a plug so if you're one of those parents that shares your phone with your kids from time to time you can actually lock out things like I don't know games or you know any apps you have on your phone but don't want them to be looking at with that one last thing that my writer for this video thought was pretty cool was the parental control you can just go into screen time and pause the device really shadow knocking stuff off the shelf there anyway so you can just pause the device and nothing happens apparently do we have an internet connection so it doesn't actually just like lock the phone I just tried to launch an app and it goes whoop you are not allowed to use this device ask your parent to change the restriction okay so basically that's the bulk of the video except for something cool we've actually got a giveaway so BitDefender is giving away six months of BitDefender total security 20/20 it's for new users only and it's for the US and Canada so that's six months of the whole shebang internet security VPN wallet the whole nine yards instead of their typical 30-day free trial with all that said guys let's real talk here for a moment if you're a power user you might think that you don't need protection however there are plenty of cases where bitdefender's total security software suite could be the perfect addition to your network as well as your parents friends or non tech-savvy aunt or whatever I pick on my poor aunt a lot so that you don't have to babysit them BitDefender has a pretty complete suite here with a ton of cool tools to maintain control over your home network or even a small office network so even if you never typically find yourself in the deep dark corners of the internet the massive amount of tools and features here mean that there should be something for pretty much everyone so go check them out at the link in the video description
