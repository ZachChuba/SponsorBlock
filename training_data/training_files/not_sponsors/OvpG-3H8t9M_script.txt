good but gaming I'm here with Sven what's up Sven we're up in the sky for a very specific reason that's right we're gonna build an ac-130 for you could spend this has been a long dream for my minecraft dog he's always said it since day one and today that day is here because it's true I'm gonna show you just a quick rundown and what the idea is so basically we're gonna build at Bombur with through a TNT duplicator I know you're very interested it's cool though I'll show how it works let me see if I remember okay so bing bang and then what you use is a core out of all items a coral bubble whatever that is that's how you make this to duplicate there's old versions of this but this actually works in the latest version of the Minecraft no one cares you're like okay cool and then you make this and put a detector rail and then you put a minecart and then you just have something to push it and that will actually let's put a sticky piston and then watch this fun this is good this is a good fun part it duplicates the TNT Jesus which means we can make a lot of bombings oh my god that's cool right so I got the design from Diamond dozer really really fun and cool I can't wait to use this properly why is it so satisfying damn it's so fast oh my god yes you see what I'm talking about alright they're blowing up are they blowing up before okay I see I see I see let's build it a little further down then good thing I tested this oh oh my bike okay well that was that design cool [Laughter] a lot of people just find these random things oh yeah the bubble coral reef that'll do the trick like it comes up with that stuff you know what this bill needs to work a bubble coral reef that'll do the trick okay I didn't build the crank this time today okay now it works twice is so satisfying look at that so basically now any time that's push forward epic explosion in soos so what we're going to do is we're going to put the observer smurfer here and I guess we'll put you there see if I can do this properly and then this this F wallah try it it doesn't work one tooth okay now it worked and then eventually yes okay so this is actually our base now we're just gonna make more of that holdups event Bracey hey we're just gonna repeat this pattern I just realize it doesn't work at all now it's work so one two one two three or six also while I'm at it this build is inspired by I think PI he did a carpet bomber as well and I thought hey that's cool I want to make it okay see it works yes alright we keep going gamers I don't know how big I want to make it though that's the million dollar question how big you want it Sven he's clearly very invested this is great all right getting hang over this doing this very fast epically and as I said that I stopped doing it okay I think this should be one wing you know that's pretty cool that looks cool oh I made a mistake what did I do oh alright there's a lot of building that needs to be done and we're doing it we're just doing it this wait for me to place a TNT wrong and the whole thing goes kaboom gosh balloon okay works this is obviously a lot of work but cement is gonna be so happy that it's all it's all gonna be worth it please don't blow up oh this is Gary this is fine he's fine bing bang bong bing bang bong ping pong ping pong ping ping pong pong pong this is this already looks ridiculous okay all right it worked glorious as stupid as this already is I think I need to actually make it bigger because the wing is so fat now it needs to like be at least that long I think all right it's getting there we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 17 the lucky number please work it's all ass just working alright looking good looking good nice oh my god that was way too evil come on surrenders like I don't know if I want this alright the wings are done I just need to build the front of the ship and we should be good to go okay not bad I think maybe does it work at all I am no clue I think something happened I I think so I think it works I'm so amazed all right what a laugh it looks so bad the weirdest part of this whole thing is that it somehow works every time I try it I'm sure it's gonna fail okay let's just you know what this is not no I think what I need to do is I need to build it and slime first and then figure out the Redstone now I built the thing just so I can test if it works to see if it works and he doesn't oh my god Oh three two one please work okay I'm really glad I thought this might be too easy okay I think I did it okay this should be a repeatable pattern look for what I built like what I built it's like it's gonna be an airplane thank you bye Maya okay once I get past this hurdle it will actually be quite easy just connecting these two spots I've been literally hell it works okay now we're just gonna make these ovals God smash like on video cuz my brain about to explode of explosion brain image okay I wish I came up with this pattern before I started recording Jesus well that's my only wish in life alright so we're nearly there aren't we swing Hey hopefully this to pay off my god my god I mean this is silly this is just stupid it is so incredibly dumb alright so the engine will go here this should power the whole thing should I try it damn us Carrie I'm definitely backing up I how are Y now backed up my house is flooding right now and I'm building a Minecraft airplane the irony that this country is filled with water alright we're backed up wish I could back up my house but I can't okay here we go oh I forgot it needs to move forward a little bit does it hit it is what the [ __ ] happened here I definitely broke here what happened although it didn't break I just kept going there okay it didn't work EPIK probably because of this thing nope it stopped swearing for another reason and I see the problem already what are you doing here huh what are you doing they fixed it it's like you know you can do it you just have to figure it out and you know it's gonna pay off because it's gonna look at dan that looks so cool why does the wings not move oh no no oh it's affected by that okay fan sex it's already broken to begin with okay so it's missing a piston right it's missing one here two should work I broke my mouse know what oh I forgot come on swing yes it works it works it works oh this is where the fun begins it's gotta build the engine okay there she goes we just got to find a spot for Sven I didn't think of that actually dang it this could be a problem wait what is what is this what is that what are you not activate no no why all right who's been the most patient dog in the whole world that's right you spin you did it just hang on we need to find you a seat I don't know where you okay can he fit in one of the minecarts cuz that's not a bad idea I'm gonna go here spin come on my mane come on get in yeah that's my boy and then maybe I can be like captain next to you that looks so cool that looks so dope alright this is the first time we try it with a full engine let's see how it goes all right now we're just waitin here we go spin this is gonna be awesome oh here we go yeah so happy it's working said it's working after so much trouble it's my computer okay oh god Mike I think on my computer is starting to have a little problem let's have a look at that looks like oh my god that's so cool no way render distance computer about to explosion why compute their social sake come on it's having a bit of problem to render all explosions are happening explosions are definitely happening all right all right I should stop it and see kind of like with the damages oh they're Sanjana all right what's the oh god it's still dropping is it still no let's see the damage we've done okay all right that's cool not bad not bad not bad at all spend spend be like let's commit some war crimes gosh so happy I'm so happy I've could it's it was so much easier than I thought if I didn't just build it wrong here and had to make this whole complicated thing to make it bit bare and this bit there it would have been so easy but I didn't think in advance and I paid the price but what this is this oh [Applause] no there's a village when there's a village right there there's a bunch of innocent people okay we better turn left we better turn left then kill them kill them Sven oh god I fell down oh god I don't know where I am help me oh no they're gonna poop pee in their pants when they run guys hurry up you have to run run no guile oh no someone stop them guys please do something run oh no what a tragedy it's about to happen

stop oh they're trying to run but there's no there's no point in running from Sven's little ship alright let's see if I can find the engine oh my god it's still bombing all right let's look at the damage there it is oh this is so sad fifty thousand you people used to live here now it's a ghost town my god so then how could you how could you my owns minecraft dark completely ruthless hey two
