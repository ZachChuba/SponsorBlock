i did say this month is going to be insane in terms of content it's honestly crazier than i even anticipated because of the recent energy that happened i already had some secret awesome progress i've been grinding out for this month to show you guys so i'm very excited if field community can do this nightmare grind truly lives up to its name of being a nightmare uh we've probably put in easily 400 somewhere between that and like 500 hours where 900 souls which is basically about three kills an hour and uh about 12 to 1300 groups as well so it's it's been a long time coming man i say we have put in a lot of work but i won't spoil too much hope you all enjoy today's video though i think that was a one shot the 146 xp drop is a one shot oh that there is 86 yep 157 is 86 so yeah i think i'm going to go with this setup i guess i'm going to try some duo nightmare it's been a long time since we tried boom baby already a good start oh damn 9 20 bro damn nine minutes bro dance into a smith oh that was beautiful good luck come on give maryj a staff emergency staff mary j staff oh oh my god dude you got the skirt oh good thing i didn't get it i'm so glad i didn't get that skirt bro i don't i don't want a skirt bro holy [ __ ] yo we got the skirt put it on bro put it on put it on mr mary jane put on the skirt bro hello nice dude new best in slot for nightmare bro pug hell yeah man nice to see vrb oh new pb bro sub 9 hell yeah easy we're just basically changing our defense so we can bait the boss look i'm going to put on my bandos and it's going to keep trying to come to me for a bit makes it nice you know you don't have to worry about melee hits damn dude 848 see what the hell is this pb nice new pv again type please for a drop okay bro we'll use your voodoo magic all right please please please please oh my god dude oh damn bro holy [ __ ] it works shout out to prime right through this guy's still looking at nightmare he's like yeah i know how it works just type please i type please and guess what first time ever damn that's awesome bro that is very very awesome dude oh look at this nice man we actually got on the iron man the mace is technically not best in slot for me anymore at nightmare because with full inquisitor at least i'm sure with at least top and bottom the the scythe actually is a bit more dps now because uh the crush style is actually really good now with the site like before without it as you can see the size crush is only 67 but then you add this into it it just increases by a ton it went from 67.91 i'll definitely do some scythe kills again for fun and you know see if we get some nice nice pbs or something but we have two orbs left and i guess the pet but yeah what the full inquisitor said i'm pretty sure our kills are gonna be faster and smoother which means you know our grind on the last two items the basically the three rarest things left in nightmares that warps in the pet is gonna be a lot nicer dude so that's awesome all right guys let me take this time to show you guys the uh comparisons between faux maxx melee normal which is bandos and faceguard versus uh inquisitor max melee so here's the max hit of the scythe it is 48 alright and here is the max hit of the scythe with inquisitor still the same exit so that's very good that at least means that max wise is good but here's where the kicker comes in so full inquisitor has a set effect they have this new update here it shows your set effect so as you can see i have the full set now it says if all pieces of inquisitor are worn this bonus is increased to 2.5 what is the bonus it is uh crush accuracy and damage so not only do i keep the same accent i also get 2.5 crush accuracy which is amazing for things that are way too crushed like nightmare and stuff so this site is going to be insane not only are we getting you know this insane crush bonus now with inquisitor we also get the extra 2.5 percent while keeping max it absolutely phenomenal all right here's the uh max hits of the increase remains with regular melee 53 now this is what shocked me the most because i thought the maxim would stay the same but in reality it got stronger so instead of a 53 with inquisitor the maze gains a max hit 54. so that means other similar weapons like the sounder blade and the grass rapier it cannot hit a 54. this is the only uh weapon like normal one-handed weapon same you know speed and everything that can hit 54 so this is in general uh stronger than the blade and the rapier just because of the inquisitor armor i think i might be one of like five iron man that has phone quiz or some some bs is insane dude absolutely insane i want to find out whether or not the set effect will actually impact dragon two-hander and ceramic god sword so let's just quickly test the max head of the dragon 2h with full bandos real quick it is a 52. see dragon 2h has a crush style so i wonder if i spec with it it will actually calculate the boost towards the spec with the inquisitor let me see if i get a new magazine i do so it should also work with the sera dominant godzilla as well but i want to see what it was before because i think i lost the max it before yeah yeah before i had that it was 67 but now we're back to 68 so that's really nice all right so yeah we're gonna go test out the mace first since i'm most comfortable with mace i've been i'm inside in a while so let's just see how this significantly reduced defense is gonna you know work since i'm only 77 range on this account right now which is really low compared to like 200 oh there it is the new max set holy [ __ ] of 54 man so i've been using the inquisitor full set at nightmare the past two days for a while now and yeah it is phenomenal man definitely a lot faster than what i'm used to in terms of average kills most of the kills are always in the low 70 minutes which is amazing because i think before i was really uh varying uh mid 17s to like low 18 so it's definitely a solid like 20 to 30 seconds faster on average so yeah very noticeable for sure the only downside sometimes is that uh with phone quizzer your range defense is super bad so sometimes the hus will destroy you and you might have to eat up a bit more but that's honestly not a big deal it's well worth the the trade-off so had to reorganize the bank a bit just to accommodate for this extra item but uh i'm taking the new uh overall look what do you guys think okay the amount of times that i've said i'm probably done with corp is alarming but dude who the hell knew i was gonna get this body look at my crush uh accuracy oh my god i have to try out some pork with this uh set dude this is insane holy [ __ ] i i should be able to spec corp down much faster than before come on bro i'm recording here i should be able to expect uh down corp way faster than ever before 202 crush bonus and i got the 2.5 percent accuracy like come on we have to try this out you know i'm gonna do a few hours and uh yeah see how uh how smooth it is but there's a downside though i have like no magic defense so um i'm gonna have to put on my armor right before i reach corp so i can actually tank the magic hits because yeah that's probably the downside of spike and corp this way but otherwise yeah should be good what you are seeing right now is a dps calculator and the big thing i want to show you guys is the difference in spec accuracy with the warhammer between two setups set one is the setup without inquisitor and set two is a setup with inquisitor so as you can see set one here is about almost 35 percent accuracy when uh using the first initial warhammer spec on court and here's set two with full inquisitor as you can see it's almost 40 percent so inquisitor is about five percent more accurate than the next best thing which is nice because that's an extra uh hits that would land every 20 attempts so yeah that is really really nice man i'm going to have a lot of fun you know uh using our newfound accuracy at court man i might just do some more corp honestly just because i should be able to save a lot of time holy [ __ ] that was fast two trips landed four specs pretty good for a second kill yeah while i was messing around with inquisitor corp i actually realized that i over thought my suicide core method post death mechanics and i can actually pretty much do the same exact strategy that i did before the only modification again is four items when i'm speccing and suiciding so that way there's only one item for me to pick up uh and that's just located work so all i have to do is every time i fight the boss i just pick up my locator orb and the gravestone will poof and it doesn't matter i don't actually have to keep it active the whole time and the benefit of that is that sometimes i don't actually have to suicide because um i usually don't end up using all the food per suicide anyway so i get left over so yeah i can go back to just not suiciding every kill and only suicide when i actually have to draw food which means the overall corp cycle per kill is gonna be a bit faster again okay let's try this out we're gonna incorporate uh phoenix necklace to our setup we often get to quite low hp and i think the phoenix necklace would be a nice way to get my hp back up without losing any takes from eating a food especially on phase one with inquisitor i take a lot of damage so after extensive testing with the phoenix necklaces is super nice to bring here for my nightmare solos just because it only procs at 20 hp whereas like redemption so much harder because you have to go under 10 xp like yikes but anyways yeah i can bring about two of them per solo and it works out really well on p1 and p2 since i often go under 20 hp but i instantly get like 30 hp back with very low effort so it helps a lot and uh avoid cool down from eating hard food oh [ __ ] bloodfield test oh this is uh another one time special because i do want to test out the blood veil one time at that uh dartmeier spot you know the og spot from back in the day all right getting to the new bloodfield spot is definitely annoying uh does anybody know the fastest way to get here because i feel like there's probably a better way to get here oh my goodness okay guys uh the xp per hour is going to be really skewed because i already already got two of these superiors so yeah it says 86k but i was honestly getting like 72k an hour before the superiors started showing up so all right guys i finished the bloodfield task and i got 33k experience and um took me 21 minutes to do what the can it was like size 160 170 ring oh my god look at the xp fire 94k so it was like 70 something k before the superior so yeah man easy sony knight on my first try i don't even know like the best canon spots and stuff so huh so yeah dude it's freaking nice um not really for iron man though main accounts you got money to blow dude such a good spot man i've had my nostalgia feel though oh damn subtas yeah i want revenge we uh failed our uh we that is like the last test so i'm definitely doing this one what please die yes yes finally redemption round boys we did it ah it's nice it's nice last time we failed but this time we could no pet there's no pet no all right well that's okay i can always gamble all right dude we're not gonna milk we're just gonna go straight for it because that's not what we do over here please give me the give me the pet let me get lucky not lucky 20kc but nice we hit 20kc bro elder staff this time it worked really well i actually healed a lot of 20s and 30s this this time so i'd say yeah man the eldritch um it's i'd say it's about the same with sgs it really depends on what type of player you are at the moment if you are struggling with prayer i i'd say eldritch is a bit better than sgs but if you're struggling with hp sgs probably a little better so for me it really makes not much of a difference so oh armor speed let's go so i've been slowing down a lot on this subwoofer grind it just sucks being you know drive for this item man the ring of endurance but now that i'm feeling less obligated to be a nightmare i'm going to try to commit to an hour a day of suppercur that's like i don't know 8 or 10kc an hour or something so yeah hopefully we get this ring soon because that's like the last major thing i want to get done in terms of the new content oh crap no i'm going to get no wait yes oh my god that was insane i actually did that all right let me give you guys a sneak peek of this hidden area that uh you can't access yet but um you know maybe we'll access it one day you know potential content um the perks of the orb of oculus secret secret item by the way another video take care and bye bye
