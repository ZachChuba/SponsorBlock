it wasn't that long ago but if you wanted to glam up your computer you could either use a colored cold cathode tube or a UV cold cathode tube with some black light sensitive components RGB believe it or not wasn't a thing oh I know right and that got us thinking what if we combined the old and the new we took RGB UV cathodes and and and lasers and we smashed them all together into one computer to make the craziest most colourful most rave tastic PC the world has ever seen brace yourself and you know what else is offer code Linus and get 25% off glass wire 2.0 at the link below [Music] selecting the case was probably the easiest part of this build the primary PMO 1fx from silver stone literally has a unicorn on the side what more could you want and it also has three 140 millimeter fans upfront which means that there should be enough space to fit our sky white 420 millimeter radiator from primo chill even if Silverstone doesn't explicitly say so so measurement wise it should fit it's close it wants to do it yeah since we're in for a real derivative good time our big radiator troubles weren't over yet though for our DDC pump and reservoir we planned to use this bits power mount that while sexy only connects to 120 millimeter fans but that's nothing that can't be fixed with a few minutes of SolidWorks and some acrylic vaporization with our laser cutter not bad you might even say it's profesh as the kids say now it's time for some lighting RGB strip lights are cool but what's even better is spatially and temporally coherent lights oh yeah we're talking about lasers so we got this guy here off of Amazon it's designed for DJ boots but we're all about improvisation here and as it turns out the hole for the PCI Express power cables is just the right size for it only problem is the laser is too big to fit beside the massive prime titanium 1000 watt power supply from C sonic but what if we could make the laser smaller taking it apart revealed a lot of empty space and dr. Alex prescribed a healthy dose of angle Galatian to fix the problem oh yeah originally we wanted to add a smoke machine inside the PC as well but unfortunately the compact ones rely on water vapor a hopefully obvious problem inside a computer so we'll be relying on mineral oil based fog instead alright so now we've got a pretty funky case but this is LT t so we will need plenty of horses under the hood - first up was our GPU and NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti which gets the water treatment courtesy of bits power we removed the stock heatsink added some thermal grisly cry not and after a generous application of thermal pads we screwed on the water block now it looks pretty good here but that stock backplate now it's nice but a bit boring what's not boring though is this completely insane RGB backplate that we got from v1 text so we attached that to the GPU using magnets so it could be easily removed later for our CPU we chose a core i7 8700 K in every intel build these days needs a nice helping of liquid metal so pop the lid add some conformal coating and then well in a perfect world we would have picked up a new syringe of liquid metal since the old ones have a bad habit of sticking fortunately we've already shown you how to clean these kinds of things up there we go with the cpu installed into our asus rog Maximus 10 formula which comes with water cooling for the vrm already installed by the way and the cpu block on it was time to plan out the loop someday we will learn to do loop planning before we start but it is not this day Wow Alex's technique for hardline is to measure the vent cut a bit longer than needed bend in the correct place massaging out the flat spots or oddities by hand then sand the tubes down to the correct size so the reason that we always recommend finishing this off with sanding is that it's super brittle and this way we can avoid that happening so do this a couple more times and you've got a hard-line water-cooled PC first we filled the system with distilled water and sysprep to make sure that any strange things would be removed next to find out if the liquid metal spill had damaged our CPU we went ahead and fired it up both excellent looks like we're good at this point things we're starting to come together but the fans were a bit boring and we didn't want to just rely on throwing RGB fans into a case to make them pop idea number one was to use UV body paint which we have for some reason and sort of just throw it on there but by idea number one I mean the first idea not the best idea and quite frankly the rest were not much better so while the fans were getting figured out and we've got a custom cut mirror to go in the top of the case we modified the laser lightshow to use the computer power supply by soldering the leads to a sacrificial molex connector and jazzed up the power supply shroud using some spray adhesive and a tasteful application of glitter if such a thing were possible with the loop cleaned overnight we flushed it with distilled water and then filled it up with UV pink dye from primo chill to give it some pop back to the fans then we tried using some different UV reactive paint to spice them up but try as we might all we ended up with were crappy looking half painted fans so we primed some more for another crack at it I mean at least we've got a couple of narwhals done while we waited for the fans to dry so that's a positive point coming back in on Monday IDI actually had a stroke of genius rainbow fans so we took those Prime fans and ROYGBIV the heck out of them dabbing on all the haters out there that thought that they were gonna come out looking bad with some UV cathodes added to the front to make them fluoresce there was just a bit of tidying up to do before it was time to admire the rave PC in its final form so get up and shake your booty to this dancer if ik glam can arrange that check this for one more for sickness tell me [Music] [Music] [Music] so it looks great that's objectively and the performance rocks too this thing stomps on every game we threw at it and with some overclocking we were able to easily get 5.1 gigahertz on all six cores with our 8700 case sitting at under 70 degrees master op is back with the new force EDC mass drop for just 60 bucks at the link below thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it was awesome get subscribed hit that like button or check out the link to where to buy the stuff we featured in the video description also down there's our merch storage has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join this is what happens when we let someone who either has never been to a rave or more likely can't remember ever having been to a rave helped me with our makeup I mean you see l-wire under the studio lights you can't even tell that it's flashing could you tell
