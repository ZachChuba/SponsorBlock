Hello and here we are again ready to
shoot some landscape photography in today's video what I thought I would do
is spend this video talking a little bit more about landscape photography
settings it's something a lot of you asked me about a lot so today I will
show you my process. Also today's episode In a lot of my other videos I talk
quite a bit about composition and how I visualize a shot, how I then set the
camera up, position it, the perspective all that type of thing which is how I
capture the scene in front of me. I've been a little bit reluctant though to
talk about the camera settings but this video is dedicated to that.
When I first attach my camera to the tripod I'm always going to switch it
into manual mode because I think that.... or I want the camera to be an extension
of my arm, of my body, or just when I put it on a tripod it's an extension of me
and to do that or to achieve that I think you need to have full control over
what the camera is doing so manual mode is the place to be I then it will always
shoot in RAW I just don't see any reason not to shoot in RAW after that I then
think about the exposure triangle now that's the relationship between aperture
shutter speed and ISO I've got an ebook if you want to download that that
explains all of them in detail but it's essentially balancing the exposure
triangle to get the right effect or the right exposure for you. So I'll generally
start with ISO and ISO 100 is going to work for the vast majority of situations
there are some times when you might up it a bit to get the shutter speed up as well
but most of the time I'm going iso 100 After that I'm going to think about the
aperture and I use the aperture to adjust my depth of field mostly if I
have something in my foreground that's quite close to the front of the lens
then I'm going to have a higher aperture number which means a smaller actual
aperture so usually around f/16 you'll be able to get everything in focus but
if you don't have anything particularly close to the front of the lens then I
want to maximize the sharpness that the lens provides and I'm going towards f/8
that's around the area where you're gonna get maximum sharpness sometimes
you'll go to f/11 dependent on that foreground again but f/8, f/11 or f/16
will be the vast majority of my shots. I then just use the shutter speed to I
just roll the shutter speed up and down to get the right
exposure I will use it creatively sometimes with long exposures but that's
how I use the shutter speed just to get the exposure right so if you can
master the settings on your camera get that manual mode nailed down then that's
when it's a bit like driving a car just becomes second nature you won't remember
your journey or what you've done on your camera and then you just really start
getting those creative juices flowing okay so that's that I'm gonna pack the
stuff into the bag again I want to get a shot taken so I found this beautiful little cove
here with this tremendously impressive waterfall. When you want to practice
your landscape photography settings in manual mode there's nothing better than
finding a waterfall and there are lots of them when you're shooting in the UK
so I've got my shot composed here I'm at a vertical and I'm just getting the
stream leading you up into that waterfall and then that waterfall is
prominent in the shot. The sky above has a few flakes of blue and a bit of cloud in
there as well and I'm managing to capture that all in one frame because
the dynamic range of my camera is pretty good and it's relatively good light for
shooting this sort of shot so all I'm doing here is because I'm not using any
filters other than the circular polarizer to take the glare off the shot
off the water that is.... I'm at f/22. I'm or I'm working between f/18 and f/22 when
we're thinking about the exposure triangle that I talked about earlier what
that allows me to do because I'm reducing the amount of light coming into
the camera I can then increase my shutter speed and
I'm at..... I'm only at one quarter of a second and that f/22 aperture in the
current lighting is allowing me to do that and what that does is just let the
water move through the frame for about a quarter of a second and it gives you
that nice bit of movement in the water ISO for this shot is at 100 I want the
least amount of sensitivity from the sensor and I want a nice clean image
which is so 100 gives me so I'm gonna wait for the light to go overcast
again and then I'm going to capture this shot beautiful scene let's shoot it. okay so I'm pretty much back where I
started at Ribblehead Viaduct this is a composition I have shot before last
time I did a vlog here it's a really nice composition. You get a good view of the
viaduct and then you get the Ingleborough mountain in the background and that's
the same composition that I've gone for today but today I'm going to use it to
show you what I do to get the exposure right how do i meter my shot? First thing
I do is like I said get the exposure triangle right with the sort of creative
way I want to have it so I'm f/16 here because I've got some of these Reed's in
the foreground of the shot and I want them to be sharp and I want them to be
within my depth of field so I'm at f/16 I'm ISO 100 I'm then at a 1/10 of a
second and the way I go about getting that exposure is firstly I will look at
the meter, the built-in meter, on the camera a lot of the time it will then be
okay but I will then check it using the live view mode so I just click into Iive
view it pops up on the screen and you can use the LCD screen itself to
see how the image will look I will then use the histogram to get it as spot-on
as possible so my histogram here is looking pretty good it's not peaking to
the left with the blacks it's not peaking to the right with the highlights
and then I'm not going off the top which means it's over exposing for that
certain colour tone I also use it for focusing a lot of time because the focus
on this camera using the live view is absolutely perfect
if you camera doesn't have the touch to focus on the LCD screen
look through the viewfinder focus in then switch the automatic focus off so
you then in manual focus that's focusing and metering let's take the shot. Two
second timer is on there so it doesn't move around and that is looking really
good okay so I am set up for my final shot
of the day and this is my composition pretty much with the viaduct going left
to right in the scene and then I'm hoping to get lots of beautiful golden
light on that viaduct shining through with some big shadows and that should
look really good. I've got the camera really low down on the floor because I'm
on this limestone ledge and I want the ledge to appear as if it is right in the
frame in the foreground and then just leads you in straight up to the viaduct
without getting all of this sort of rubble and rubbish from this old cave
system here. Settings wise I am at f/16 because that stone ledge is right in the
foreground and very very close to the lens it's still looking sharp at f/16 so
I'm happy with that i'm at iso 100 again and when you are
shooting the sunset you are always going to have a much brighter sky than you are
in the foreground so balancing the exposure is the challenge with a shot
like this you've either got bracketing or you've got ND grads, I use bracketing
because it's easier. I usually do two stops either side that's what I'm doing here
and it's going to be a really nice scene when sunset comes I'm gonna capture that
moment it's actually gonna come just before sunset because it's gonna dip
behind mountain there first but I hope you have got some value out of just
seeing how I go about using my landscape photography settings because once you
master it you then just don't need to worry about it in future and partly
that's why I haven't included in my videos up to now because I don't want it
to be the thing you focus on it's not the camera settings that are going to
make you a great landscape photographer it's about the visualization about
getting out actually into these amazing landscapes and then just putting your
personality into your photographs and the camera settings are purely a technical
thing that you just need to master you can then explore all those other things
that I was talking about before. So I hope you've enjoyed the video it is sponsored by Squarespace now..... go to to get 10% off your

think of the video and have a bit of a discussion about what settings you use
because I'm learning from you I hope you're learning a few things from me as
well and it should hopefully benefit all of us.
Anyway, I'll see you on another video very very soon
