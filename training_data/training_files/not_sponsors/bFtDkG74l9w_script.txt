hello this is chef john from food wishes calm with baklava that's right at long last I'm going to show you how I build my baklava and as funny as it sounds this recipe always reminds me of lasagna because much like that most people use the same handful of ingredients but as far as the ratios go as well as the exact way they're layered can really vary greatly depending on who's making it so this is just how I do it and if you have what you think is a much better way feel free to keep that to yourself because I like how this comes out so with that let's go ahead and get started and we'll begin with our nuts and I like to use two kinds some walnuts and pistachio and while you can use one or the other and many people do I really do like the combination here and then the only other thing we're gonna add is a spoon of cinnamon at which point we're gonna process these by pulsing on and off until they're sort of but not too finely ground and thanks to the power of video I'm going to show you exactly what I mean by that so this right here is my preferred texture and once those are done exactly how we want we'll go ahead and set those aside and we can move on to assembly assuming that is that we've made some phyllo dough Early's bought some at the store and let it thaw and by the way I did make this the night before and left it in the fridge and it seems to have held up beautifully those sheets separated easily and they were still nice and supple and fairly stretchable and one big tip here whether you're using homemade or not is to always keep these covered as you're working with them otherwise they can get dried out and much tougher to work with before that I like to use a barely barely barely damp towel okay it's not so much damp then it is not dry and then other than melting a stick of unsalted butter we are pretty much ready to start assembly so we'll go ahead and take that butter and brush it generously into the bottom of whatever pan we're using and once that's been buttered we'll go ahead and start building our bottom by layering out five or six sheets of phyllo and if you happen to see little tears or uneven edges or small holes do not worry okay we're not machines we are human now things are gonna happen but the good news is when this is done no one will ever know ever so please stack these layers with no fear and generally the rule of thumb is we're gonna butter every two sheets of phyllo although as you'll see later don't always follow that and as you may notice I'm not brushing I'm dripping do not try to brush the butter on the phyllo it is so thin it's gonna stick to it and you're gonna have a big mess so what we'll do is drip over about a tablespoon at a time and as this thing cooks that butter is going to distribute evenly between the layers even though we just dripped it in didn't brush it so we'll go ahead and build up our bottom as shown and I think the minimum number of sheets at the bottom here should be at least five or six and yes you can certainly do more but my favorite part of the baklava is the nut mixture not necessarily the pastry even though that's awesome also I do try to get away with the least amount of phyllo I can where it still comes out crispy and amazing but anyway once our bottoms been layered we will go ahead and transfer in exactly one third of our nut mixture because we're gonna be doing three layers of that separated by just a couple sheets of phyllo and while some people like to have a third thick layer of phyllo in the center like we do at the bottom and top I prefer to place in just two sheets of phyllo both butter by the way in between my nut mixture layers and for me those are they're just add a little bit of structure and they're not really gonna be noticeable in the final product okay sort of like when we add a pinch of cayenne you don't really notice its presence but you may notice its absence so we'll do a third of our nuts with a couple buttered sheets of phyllo and then another third of our nuts followed by another couple sheets of buttered phyllo and by the way no it's not your imagination I did speed up the footage here save a little bit of time on these repetitive steps otherwise I would have had to fill up all the dead air with bad puns and vague references and nobody wants that but anyway if everything's gone according to plan we should be left with one third of our nuts which we can go ahead and dump over the top and then the finishes off will simply go ahead and repeat what we did on the bottom we will layer up five or six sheets of phyllo with butter being applied to at least every two sheets and as I finish this off I do apologize for the fast motion which I really do not like to use I find it annoying and off-putting but I thought it was the lesser of two evils since I didn't want to edit out any of the actual layering steps so thank you for putting up with that oh and I probably should mention I'm using a round pan here but literally any pan that's deep enough will work okay may have to adjust your mounts and the amount of phyllo you make in the size and shape of it but the technique is not going to change so you go ahead and make this in anything you want I mean you are after all the Frank Sinatra of your baklava and if I can make it here in a round pan you could make it anywhere in a different shape pan but anyway we'll go ahead and finish off feeling the top with like I said at least five or six layers I believe I did six in ideally once you've placed on that last piece of phyllo you should have just enough better left to generously coat the top and I realized I said earlier to drip not brush but once this gets built up towards again when it gets kind of sturdy you can actually do a little bit of brushing without causing much damage so we'll go ahead and apply the last of our butter at which point we need to cut this into portions before it goes in the oven but not yet okay we're not going to be able to effectively cut this until it's cold and that butter hardens up and stiffens our sheets of phyllo so what we'll do is cover this and pop it in the fridge for about an hour at which point we're gonna cut this into the beautiful traditional diamond pattern and to do that we'll make three or four cuts in one direction and then turn the pan and make three or four cuts diagonally across the other way and if you have a steady hand which I don't and you know what you're doing which I don't you will get perfectly shaped absolutely even pieces in other words the opposite of what I get which is every single piece of different size so if you want to sketch a pattern on top to make these more even go ahead but I can't even pretend to be concerned with that because as you'll see once this is cooked it looks amazing no matter how you cut it but either way this has to be cut before it goes in the oven otherwise it's virtually impossible to cut without wrecking the top so once cold we'll go ahead and cut that into pieces at which point it's finally ready for the oven so let's go ahead and transfer that into the center of a 350 degree oven for about an hour or until beautifully browned and what we'll do while that's cooking is complete our last component the sugar and honey syrup and for that we're gonna need a little bit of sugar as well as three whole cloves I'm also gonna toss in a spoon of honey which wasn't running who was and crystallized that's fine for this and then last but not least we will pour in some nice cold fresh water and we'll go ahead and place that over medium-high heat and we can go ahead and stir that together and then all we need to do here is patiently wait for this to come to a boil which is gonna take a couple minutes but don't walk away because as soon as that starts to boil what we'll do is give it a stir and turn off the heat because we're done that's it very simple and you'll see as this stuff settles down it should be relatively clear and then what we'll do with the heat off is add the last two ingredients one very familiar a little touch of pure vanilla extract and then one that's not familiar orange blossom water oh yeah so exotic which is gonna add this gorgeous citrusy floral element which doesn't sound great but it is and that's it once those two things are stirred in it is ready to ladle over our hopefully now baked baklava and there it is like I said we're gonna bake that for about an hour at 350 until it's beautifully browned and just to help you visualize the bottom is gonna be one shade darker than the top so I use that as my guide and I try to get that just one shade pass golden brown knowing that the bottom will be beautifully browned okay because we do not under any circumstances want a soggy bottom so that is looking just about perfect and what we'll do is let that sit for just five minutes before labeling over our syrup and by the way if you have a guest over maybe it's date night make sure they watch you do this step because there's no way to do this and not look cool and sexy it's impossible and to those people thinking man that's a lot of sugar syrup it is but it's about 25 percent less than most recipes call for so I'm sort of doing a little bit of a dive version here but anyway we'll go ahead and apply that to our still hot baklava and then by far the hardest step we have to let this cool down to room temp before we eat it all right it's not good hot nor is it good cold because the butter hardens this in my opinion should be eaten exactly at room temp and why are you waiting you can just stare at it and pick out your piece I think I'm gonna go bottom right although now for the final plating in pictures for that I use one of my few perfect diamond shape ones in the finish I like to right over a little bit of pistachio because I'm kind of fancy and I think it looks good and that's it once cooled down to room temp and possibly pistachio dusted our baklava is ready to enjoy and I hate to think you've never had this before but if you haven't man are you in for a mind-altering treat right we got that crunchy buttery feeling on the bottom and then our rich fragrant sticky nut layer I'll top with more buttery crispy phyllo and I was just about to say thus far as sweets go this is one of the greatest bites of food in the world but forget just sweets this is just one of the greatest bites of food in the world and now if you'll excuse me I need to finish this and also that oddly shape when I picked out earlier so whether you use the phyllo from the store or you significantly raise your foodie street cred by making your own at home I really do hope you give this a try soon so head over to food wishes calm for all the ingredient amounts have more info as usual and as always enjoy you
