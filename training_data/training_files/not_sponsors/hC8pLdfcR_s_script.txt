so what i'm going to do is i'm making a special toaster what what does it do instead of putting bread in it you put toast in it and do you know what it does with a toast yeah what it turns it back in the bread [Music] a portion of this video was sponsored by kiwico more on that later everyone makes mistakes facing the consequences of those mistakes is the catalyst for personal development or it's the impetus for inventing a time machine that's why i built this toaster though it's not a normal toaster it's a toaster for your mistakes let me give you an example have you ever been absent-mindedly making toast and then realized you didn't actually want toast you just wanted regular bread okay no big deal but then you realize that you actually don't have any more bread and the literal queen of england is sitting in your dining room waiting for her untoasted bread hyperbole maybe but probably only the part about the queen i do think that at some point in all of our lives we've made a piece of toast looked at it and thought i don't want this toast hence time travel toaster although it doesn't actually travel through time it does allow you to circumvent your mistakes in a similar manner turning back the clock on your toast the process is so simple that even a five-year-old could understand it so it's a good thing that my nephew's almost seven what is it that turns bread into toast it gets hot right oh yeah so what does that heat do um it turns hot then it dries out and it becomes stiff so what we're gonna do is we're gonna try and put water back into the toast if we just dumped water then it would just be soaking wet so what we need to do is we need to put the water into the air what is that it looks like water it's tiny tiny tiny tiny drops of water so we put that inside the bottom of the toaster and then the toaster will fill with fog and it'll soften up it'll turn back in the bread this goes right in here that goes inside of here and that is the bottom of the toaster so i'm going to build a new one that's going to have two of these inside of it cool let's do this so you make your design when i watch you that's cool yeah [Music] it is doing it [Music] is it the fog is generated by piezoelectric transducers or ultrasonic fogger modules which are cheap to get on amazon they generate fog by a high frequency oscillation not with heat which is perfect for creating a cool rehydrating mist for our toast in order to fit everything into the toaster i first gutted all the original parts but i was able to reuse the electromagnet that holds down the lever the lever now activates a limit switch that turns on a relay timer module the module then sends power to the foggers electromagnets some lights and a fan which is wired in series with the electromagnet making it spin at a slower speed and generate just enough pressure to cause the fog to gently billow out the top of the toaster so now it's time to answer the only question that really matters does it work since i can't reach through the screen and give you a piece of floppy toast you're just going to have to take the word of the people that i did give floppy toast what do you think it's kind of is it like bread it is bread it is bread yeah let's just get back to the game you want to play star wars yeah star wars is my favorite so since i lost eddie to the dark side i decided to bring in some people with some slightly more mature palettes i want you to uh taste the bread i really don't want to taste the bread what do you think tastes like pumpernickel bread looks like it was in a toaster on this side looks like it was in a toaster on this side so what do you think happened to that bread i think it got toasted now try it [Music] guess what that bread was toasted you ready to see it's a toaster do you want to see what it looks like when it works is it kind of like a toaster i invented a time travel toaster no way oh my god is this yesterday's bread no no no no no no it was toasted today it's tomorrow's bread it takes taste the future what do you really think yeah it tastes like almost moist bread come on in take a bite of that tastes like normal untoasted bread so you can tell that one's been toasted because of the color on it but it doesn't feel like it tastes like bread is it dry like drier than a normal piece of bread it's just the same so it tastes the same as a normal piece of bread i don't think so voila i don't even understand how this works it's like a humidifier inside a toaster interesting because whenever you eat it you can't tell that it's been like hydrated tastes like pumpernickel bread does it taste different in any way no i don't think so what if i told you i invented a device that takes toast and turns it back into bread what yes does that work it looks really high-tech does it always smoke it's pretty cool it does not look like a bomb it looks like a toast i feel like all the time i'm like dang it why did i put them in the first really wish it wasn't toasted has that ever happened to you no now i know you've got a lot of questions like how long did i toast the bread for how long does it take to untoast the bread did my testers have any other thoughts about what the bread really tasted like was the toaster designed your first month of any crate that's kiwico.com joel creates now was my stainless steel toaster inspired by a stainless steel vehicle from the 80s that was also a time travel cinema icon uh one point twenty one gigawatts two blocks i'll let you decide the time travel toaster takes anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour to turn two pieces of toast back into bread and my regular toaster was set anywhere from a two and a half to a three and a half when toasting the bread i gave the testers a piece of toasted pumpernickel and then a piece of toasted white bread as you might have guessed i gave them the toasted pumpernickel first because its dark color concealed the fact that it had already been toasted now damien already knew about the toaster before he tried the bread but stefano amy and ian had no idea which might have explained their trepidation at being handed a random piece of bread in my basement but yes it really turns toast back into bread would you say that it worked yeah yeah i thought you like spray painted the bread because it looked you thought it was bread that was spray painted like it worked that well i can't believe it's not toast nice be as brutally honest as possible did you have any idea that that pumpernickel was toasted oh didn't taste toasted what would you give it compared to a normal piece of pumpernickel on a scale 1 to 10. equally shitty just want you to know i will wait for you thank you to everyone who made this video possible and thanks to you for watching it i'll see you next time [Music] can i finish the bread
