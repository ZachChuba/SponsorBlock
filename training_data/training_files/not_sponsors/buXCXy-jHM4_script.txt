so Alex and I we kind of share a thing for sleeper pcs so that's to say like ancient junker looking cases with just the most tricked-out water-cooled overclocks of systems inside them that can absolutely shred the latest Triple A games while looking like they came straight out of the 70s 80s and 90s so what if we were to take instead of the best components and give them the old-school treatment the oldest components and give them the new-school treatment I mean tempered glass RGB water cooling full cover blocks pretty much the works so that's the goal today but rather than just taking some entry-level hardware and putting some lights and cooling tubes on it instead we put together my dream PC not my dream PC today mind you my dream PC from when I was in high school 2004 this was the best of the best and we are gonna do it up with glass where Android device use offer code Linus and get 25% off glass wire at the link below most of this stuff predates your PC enthusiast today's yeah I was like 11 or so when this came out okay fair enough now in fairness to me I wasn't actually that much older but I was definitely getting into the custom PC scene and I remember from being a kid this being pretty much my dream CPU this was the Pentium for Northwoods C revision that means you've got an 800 megahertz frontside bus on this puppy much faster than the 533 of the north would be core Wow it's 2.4 gigahertz which means yes technically this wasn't actually the fastest CPU on the block but wait this is three gigahertz yeah I specifically asked for a 2.4 C do we have one we do moving on this is what I was really after so yes technically the 2.4 gigahertz chip was not the fastest one but what it was was the lowest-cost one that was overclockable to well beyond the fastest thing you could buy from Intel at the time so we went out of our way to scour eBay for 2.4 C's with the m0 stepping these things were known to overclock well in excess of 3 gigahertz maybe even over 4 remember this is a 2.4 gigahertz chip imagine getting like an 80% overclock on something today now the performance still isn't gonna be great because compared to a coffee like CPU which does about what is it 32 instructions per clock single precision this is sitting at around 8 and it's only a single core hyper-threaded 32-bit chip so Windows XP anyone should bring it well I think now let's take a look at our motherboard so this right here is the biggest baddest motherboard that ever existed for socket 478 it's got pretty much everything you could want you've got your AGP yeah 5 PCI oh yeah that's SATA and in addition to say that you got not one not two but three IDE ports meaning this thing could support a total of 10 hard drives and a single floppy nice it even had like fairly modern features like Gigabit LAN coaxial audio out some of these are less modern there's no USB 3 or anything like that but who's paying attention have you ever installed a socket 478 CPU before I I think so okay you want to do it sure there's your arrow hold on 22 that you lift up the plastic arm goes out and up there we go beautiful can you help I don't want you to break it I don't need help we have two of them that's fine that is a terrible terrible approach I have a look at the pins and make sure they're not bad yeah I feel like one of them might be yeah there's a slightly bent one okay so there's a bit of a technique for this you just have to kind of wiggle wobble it okay okay do you have thermal compound no one moment while he's gone I'm gonna do a bit of a retro peel on our OCZ Platinum Edition enhanced latency dual channel two gigabyte kit check this out whoever owned these for all these years never peeled the logo I actually still love this heat spreader design it does look really good you could polish them up like really mirror shiny I think honestly the only reason that they don't still do it this way is that it's more expensive like these modules are heavy these are made of solid copper oh wow that feels good doesn't it so these right here are 400 megahertz kits the tips in them are probably TC CDs so two three - gasps - at 2.8 volts by modern standards also a lot of voltage for memory I'm actually super pleased with how good the condition of all this is no leaky caps a little bit of dust I'm so excited for this build yeah I was a bit afraid going into it that we have to like recap basically the whole board before getting it operational but no these look great yeah so we didn't think we were going to be able to achieve quite the modern look without at least springing for a modern case so we went with a fan text and through we evolved tempered glass just great kind of starting point for any build pretty clean looking this is gonna turn out really really nicely so one question with hardware this ol are going to have to have a CD player and a CD player I think you mean an optical drive is this the i/o shield that we had for this really doesn't look like it yeah I guess we're making one of those oh man it is an extra slap in the face though that they like included the wrong one especially after how much we paid for this thing yeah that was what 150 bucks something like that that was with the CPU though not this CPU yeah I didn't want that CPU though the only other modern core component we're using is a see sonic prime Platinum 1300 watt cedi plus platinum it's totally overkill but while we could go back and find something like an N Tech true power for 30 watt or something like that the odds of a power supply that old being a hundred percent reliable are significantly lower than just grabbing a new power supply and using that and we really don't want to break our hardware you know what the crazy thing is though all this cabling still actually works like I don't even know why it is that they do it this way but on this 1300 watt power supply the 24 pin connector still breaks away to a 20 pin and the 8 pin CPU power connector still breaks out into a 4 plus 4 try and think of like something else that maintain inter compatibility for 15 years my grandparents yeah so that's actually all we need for wiring we can go ahead and put it in I really like these like power supply you like do all the screws and then you just slide it in all right our boards wired up I think it's time for us to move on so we did allow ourselves to take some artistic liberties with the actual year that the hardware came out so this right here is pretty much as good as it got for an AGP graphics card this is the geforce 6800 ultra it was built on the hundred and 30 nanometer process it's got to molex connectors and consumed a total of a hundred and ten watts for older games at the sort of target resolution of 1600 by 1200 this thing was an absolute monster yeah I was looking up some of the reviews apparently it was like twice as fast as anything that existed before it yep well that was back when hardware used to move it that kind of a pace like pretty much every generation that came out turned your previous investment into complete garbage that's one thing I don't miss mismatched PCB colors oh maybe we could just take like the back plate off of a Titan or something like that and smack it on well that could work modding a back plate I like it not even bought him he just double-sided tape it on another thing that I read about this graphics card is that you had to be really careful about not using molex that are on the same rail because apparently could kill your power supply yeah that was back when a high end power supply was 400 watts total I think though oh it has a game port is that a thing oh yeah cool this port have HD or AC 97 audio oh of course how did we overlook this sound card sound cards Wow yeah onboard audio was just like throwaway anyway so why bother having a front panel header for it you know that this case doesn't actually have a five and a quarter inch Bay right well lots of cases don't have things that can be solved with a bit of massaging ah we could probably just mount it like down in here like below in front of the power supply you'd have to like open the panel it wouldn't be convenient at all what happens if you want to load games on it that way I think that's a hard no so this is a Western Digital Raptor X and this hails from a time when hard drives could be cool so this is a 10,000 rpm drive which decreased seek times and you can actually see the seek head moving around while the drives operating so we have to find a way to get this mounted in like a prominent like place of honor inside the rig maybe with like some spot lighting on it again this is a little a little bit so let's be careful here that's that's barely in as far as things we don't want to drop in this build I think that's number one this one would be pretty hard to replace so we're we really hooking this thing up to like a modern gaming monitor yep I guess getting our hands on an old like aperture grille or shadow mask CRT it's probably a lot to ask well so this is just making sure that the core bits work you want to do the honors press it I'm kind of scared I hope it works man back when stock fans sounded like that aftermarket cooling really made a lot of sense for everyone oh hey what what huh nice oh man look at all these like amazing old overclocking options it's beautiful huh now I'm really excited I guess what would you play on the system like Unreal Tournament you could play as some do not the recent do the other doom but not the really old doom see this is why company shouldn't call games the same thing it's funny the AMD fanboys at the time of which I was one we're all like hyper threading it doesn't make much of a difference and then it wasn't until a few years later that I actually got my hands on one of these combos that I subsequently got rid of that I actually tried hyper threading and I was like oh oh yeah I know I made a difference it was pretty common in those days to have multiple different controller chips for the different storage ports on your board because Intel zone and AMD's for that matter own chipsets didn't support a ton of drives so with these fully featured boards they'd go and they'd throw usually it was promised for the early say two days and did that just boot yep okay cool that worked hey there it is I can i connect to Windows Update well you can try but you're not gonna get a chance because we actually don't have network drivers is a Seuss's site this still live well alright its life okay how about that oh thank you oh no no I don't want to know I don't want to download updates for search breath what no this computer will no longer receive blah blah blah uh uh Wow let's try it it stalls team like this team even still worked for Windows XP Nvidia your website just doesn't even run on this alright we'll grab the latest driver I wonder what year it was 2013 hey that's not that bad oh we seem to have hit a bit of a stumbling block that really does sort of bring to light an issue with always-online DRM solutions like any game that I bought on Steam in the Windows XP days what I just can't play it what if I couldn't upgrade my computer what if it was an old game that doesn't run on Windows 10 so what are we gonna do for games like I have a couple here that are just on the server alright so what you want this is a doom 3 trial sure yeah ok so here it is we're gonna find out for real running the doom 3 demo if this rig is fully functional and we're ready to move on to making our ultimate ricer PC Oh what ultra quality was 1024 by sunset I forgot how brutal this game was on hardware back then oh ok really ok I guess we're sticking with high quality it looks really dark yeah that was sort of an issue with this game yeah so that's it I'm a little disappointed in the performance I don't know why I would have been expecting anything else but like it does the trick guys let us know in the comments if you have any suggestions for particular things you'd like to see us do with the rig but stay tuned because sometime and I think the next couple of months this is going to undergo a complete transformation in ten credit will have that linked below so thanks for watching guys if you disliked this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video description I think the only current things are this power supply in this case also down there's our merch store which
