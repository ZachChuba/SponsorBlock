all right sue off we go following the glowy things yay yes I was a dude was camouflaged I was deviously tricked into playing Monster Hunter shenanigans ensue from the 15 minutes or so up late so far it seems pretty good from what I can tell that to high level sneeze and it just fell over dead well first grab all their body parts here I guess that was it there's also great out of context by the way let's just grab all the body parts and craft body parts and use them for nefarious purposes yes cuz why on earth would I you know run up to a giant monster and hit it with a weapon if I could just shoot it from a distance which totally matters game like logic you thought you can realism that's what this game is all about I don't know about you but I can just sniff a paw print and then follow something with GPS accuracy is it just me by the way or just looking for skid marks that that just doesn't sound right is this Pokemon or something you can walk into a cave and you can get covered in bats quick get 50,000 silver and a free epic champion as a new player bonus this is a dressed up pig what the hell it's a dress that's it's wearing a pajama Liston I don't remember what you have to wear to talk to it to get it to like you but there's something left eeeh something specific you have to wear or else it'll bite you okay well these games things my attention span is even worse than usual lately it's just I have zero patience for anything I just skip right through stuff instead of you know waiting instructions anything like that let me just get right to it book would happen to the yellow pages you didn't talk to women you're just kind of name is asked if you get motion sickness Memphis motion sickness I get pretty bad motion sickness from VR games I mean it I can count desensitized by playing a while but usually in the beginning it's pretty bad a new challenger appears that's a big well is it an engine and I don't know what it is it's something what is it like its second yes did cheer up yeah it's basically the t-rex is engine yeah it's like a pimp t-rex wears like a fur thing yes it's the Fogarty way legs not the hope during the the head controller of the hooker you think miss and the thing is probably too much it just sweeps by poor giving away this is very different from from most other games where you find fight giant things you set this whole you got to follow the footprints and everything and then they actually want to get away from you usually everything just starts to jump you immediately as soon as you get in the area right yeah the pimp t-rex does not you gonna [ __ ] slap your ass monster basically is art Japanese art I think always improve to fight see you've got to have collateral damage yeah nope I mean Superman will tell you thank you I'm just saying there could be clean fight scenes where it's just like showing off techniques and stuff that's fine but personally I prefer I prefer a fight scene that has lots of smashing tables breaking through windows and all that good stuff some WWE stuff huh hell yeah smash them through some tables more like Dragon Ball Z getting punched through like six skyscrapers yes that work forget or or like when two super powerful characters punch each other's at the same time so hard that all the glass in every building around it explodes yes I always like that you know Goku has the past a brain to actually leave villains away you from the you know inhabited areas go to the wasteland Superman's just like no [ __ ] it we fight right here in the middle of the city and and so you know and Cokely since naive dumbass cat law in some ways so you think Superman would be smart enough to do that but no my thing about Superman is he could do so many things that could end a fight quickly without causing as much like with the with the exception of a few really powerful villains he could just drag somebody up into the upper atmosphere until they ask like seriously yeah I think he did that actually and one of the the animated ones I think yeah he doesn't like one or two times and that's like your go to start move exactly it would be for me and if they are powerful and see it there's his metric too because if they are powerful enough to not pass out after being taken up in the vacuum of space that's when you take them to the moon and fight them there hmm the digging it tells us kind of cute but I just have to murder it there's no time for cute things I do like the the that he can see that it's injured and it's limping away and stuff yeah it's also kind of mean you're just like no you're not getting away from me [ __ ] I could see that you're hurting yeah and I like it yeah yes let me sniff your blood as I run after you there that took longer I needed so many movies still have substantial balancing issues you know where it's like you crank up the volume to understand what the hell they're saying and then fight ensues and there's like the explosions tear your eardrums apart this is pretty too loud which doesn't make any sense you're supposed to have like professional qualified sound engineers I can I can go and off I can go into audacity on my computer remove compression it makes songs down better yet they can't balance the audio you're in an action suit mm-hmm really it's we're down and then of course there is the whole cinema experience where it's just overall just your drug countering loud as much as a [ __ ] and pick about ridiculous fantasy weapons everything this is fantasy done right I will say say that if you're gonna go over the top yeah just just go away right and and like don't hold them and and the thing is so far from what I've seen this game does it right in the sense that it's all over the top and everything but it's still like the animation still look kind of convincing you know like it looks it looks real even though it's totally over the top where are some games are just a they just mess around everything just only works because it clips and because you know they skip frames and then just it looks just wonky and weird here just yeah like it's heavy yeah it's believable even though it's over-the-top that's all I ask for probably whenever I talk about realism in Saturday but it would probably make more sense to talk about immersion because that's really what it boils down to if it's done well then it's immersive and if it's just too ridiculous and it kind of breaks the immersion yeah unless you kept like a like a good explanation yeah I was gonna say you could believe that cloud can swing around this austere as he supposed to be like a super soul yeah yeah he might look like a wave but he's actually strong yeah see I actually look like a pedophile but actually actually I'm a hero no see that's what I'm saying though if you're gonna go that route though like I said do something cool with it go what if it's gonna be a tiny little schoolgirl with a giant sword like give the school girl like telekinetic powers and make the sword the size of a school bus and she just uses her mind like swing it around and obliterate people mm-hmm what usually gets me is when when you have this ginormous paddle of a blade and then on this little pencil of a sword handle or it's like there's no way structurally this would ever support it like you would need magic just to keep the thing from breaking again nothing that matters really but it's it's a pet peeve okay I just had to stop for a bit and check out the environment here is pretty damn impressive gotta say yeah with their new graphic update it looks even better like it was always good really good yeah that's that's really freaking well done I got so much detail and very atmospheric good stuff okay you know one day yeah the neckl fell down at in the beginning cut scene of the first mission I'm late no they didn't just kill my neck or did they and then when you find the neck hole on your tampon I'm like no no don't mess with my [ __ ] I even named it after my own cat and I'm like you pieces actually wonder what is what is YouTube's policy on the word [ __ ] like if it's a applies to a cap it's a perfectly legitimate word right humming hum yes every RPG players response when they see that that's like it's a standard reaction Oh stealth is optional you'll get a bonus if you you know do this I also legitimately cannot focus on what they're saying in the game while paying attention to our conversation at the same time so like the in-game characters are just gonna be stealth stall just straight out Leroy Jenkins that [ __ ] yes sneaked by the thing oh shoot it in the face you said okay no no I was just heroically trying to sacrifice myself distract the things that they could get fast he was just trying to stop police smack it in the head yeah yeah I mean what was I supposed to do use my [ __ ] as a decoy look a [ __ ] oh okay the things that's a good decoy no matter which type you mean because you know I guess both still the mystery sneak past the thing I'm on screw my power say what what are you doing exactly the nuclear explosions couldn't take care of all that suppress nuke how scary would that be getting imagine like an actual new going off there's literally not a single sound just like what what what is that hmm more stuff to nuke we haven't even gotten to us sit seriously just launched a tomato in its eye yes all right I guess it was more of a persimmon don't you mess with me I have more persimmons so this the even more dangerous bigger looking thing that's what I'm supposed to fight and the other thing was supposed to be stealth mmm-hmm yeah well trolled game oh it's just always entered the game the discord stream has surprisingly low leg like okay the moment that you came upon a cutscene it came let me join on my service aim what is ad bushy parts like the anus I mean that's always what you think I'm starting to get a better feel for how slowly he rolls nothing but that wall didn't break his tail they got this new viewport mom Ava's not armored yet okay it actually stopped a recording for the video now because it is already gonna be a lot of editing so I'll leave it at that for now it's pretty cool I think I'll play this some work [Music]
