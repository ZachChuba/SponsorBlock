With your harsh words You leave scars on my heart Without an apology I comfort myself alone once again Like always, today I’m afraid You’re going to leave me I just want you to stay As your blank expression becomes dull I whisper to the mirror, to let it go You’ve taken me for granted But that’s you But still, stay, stay, stay with me This sad melody resembles you As it makes me cry, eh eh Your scent is sweet felony I hate you, but I love you Before the night traps me in Don’t leave my side Do you still love me If you feel the same way, don’t leave me today Don’t ask me why it has to be you Just stay with me It goes a little something like Lalalalalala Lalalalalala I’m not asking for much Just stay with me To be honest, I don’t wish for more I can’t tell if my heart is still beating Instead of having meaningless 
conversations with others I’d rather be in awkward silence with you So stay, wherever that may be When darkness comes, I’ll be your fire In this world of lies, the only truth is you This a letter from me to you This sad melody resembles you As it makes me cry, eh eh Your scent is sweet felony I hate you, but I love you Before the night traps me in Don’t leave my side Do you still love me If you feel the same way, don’t leave me today Don’t ask me why it has to be you Just stay with me It goes a little something like Lalalalalala Lalalalalala I’m not asking for much Just stay with me It goes a little something like Lalalalalala Lalalalalala I’m not asking for much Just stay with me
