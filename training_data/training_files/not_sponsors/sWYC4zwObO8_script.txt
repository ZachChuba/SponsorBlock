before we begin there is one change I need to make in this version of the universe at the chi ocean realm is accessible through ship travel in the actual Dragon Ball universe this should technically not be possible since it's not inside the universe itself besides that enjoy last time on Dragon Ball Z the kaiô shin realm is a world beyond space a world where gods live peacefully while watching over the universe however there was one point in history when the kaiô shin did not stop evil from spreading that was the evil tyrant Frieza whose paranoia drove him to destroy planet Vegeta however in the mists of death a single pod blasted off into space onto an unknown world Kakarot sperits Guinea and Bardock had a destination in mind for their child but unforeseen turbulence pushed the pod off and past the limits of space Kakarot lands on the Chi ocean world where he is found by universe 7 sky ocean what will the kaiô shin do with the child a legend is born now divinity and innocence what if Goku landed on the world of the Kai's the two residents of the planet walked towards the pod that just crash-landed onto their planet how could this be they both wondered no one was supposed to be able to just land on the planet chibita was ready to send it off again or maybe even destroy it however shin stepped up to it and watched the door open out of it came a small Saiyan child he was very rowdy and pulled on kabuto hair once he picked him up Thibodaux pleaded to Shanna to send him off but Shin didn't want to just set a child off to die so the Supreme Kai decided to bring him into his home sure he didn't have any right to be there but Shin saw something in him while racing the Saiyan they attempted their best to make him gain control over his own power and destructive capabilities capito never really understood why Shin wanted to keep him around not only was he a mortal but also very weak one day while taking care of Goku Shin took him up to where the seesaw was kept to look at the landscape around them and teach Goku where everything was Goku try to pull on the SI sword and when he failed to pull it out he fell off the top and cracked his head open while hitting the ground immediately shin and Kabuto took care of the boy and surprisingly Kabuto was the one most worried about him eventually Goku got better and begins to act more happy and willing to learn Goku will also turn into a nose ro as the Chi oceans world has many moons orbiting it they would be forced to cut up his tail though this reinforces ki betos dissatisfaction with the saying the tail would grow back and Goku would learn not to look at the moon but eventually the azar would come out again they would be forced to cut it off again Goku was taught to harness his ki train his body and expand his mind this Goku maybe wouldn't be named Goku however some chiron names are often based around mythical figures or verbs so maybe he would be names koko after all since song Wukong is a mythical figure this Goku is also smarter and a lot tougher than they won in our universe at a young age he would be taught many techniques by the Supreme Kai including Kabuto Kai Kai Jenna's also a lot stronger than Frieza and even piccolo after the cell games so Goku will grow up training with much more experienced and powerful beings than that of Earth speaking of earth it is pretty much doomed to fall under P loves rule or a possible comeback by piccolo but back to the chi ocean world a few years pass and a crash a spurt in the outskirts of the river while Goku and shin trained a little he had been trying to pull the sea sort out for a long time now but still gonna get there just yet the three one to look at what happened and find a similar ship to Goku's autovod came out of saying that said his name was Raddatz and he was Kakarot brother come on Kakarot together we can destroy these two weird-looking elves I'm sure of it Goku had no idea what he was talking about but wouldn't take his threats lightly Goku smirked on his brother and instantly rushed at him the battle began with Raddatz being easily overwhelmed by go kyochon try to get him to stop but Kirito told him that this is something that goku was definitely do by himself goku finished off the same and told him to leave off the world and never come back Raddatz attempted to attack goku in the back as he turned but q2 appeared in front of Raddatz and broke his hand before killing him Goku 1/7 but he knew that Kabuto had saved his life he gave Fred its a chance after all unknown to him rides a Scouter had sent a conversation to Vegeta and nappa they realized just how much power Kakarot had and they said it that they could meet him and use him in the battle against Frieza maybe they would pay him a visit remember this Radice and nappa don't know anything of other Dragon Balls and neither does Frieza they still want to take him down and without the prospect of immortality they need to look for other ways to be able to defeat the monster some time passed and Goku wondered and asked about the sales he didn't believe everything right it's told them Shem would explain that he's a survivor from a long dead warrior race a bunch of space pirates that served under the Emperor Frieza Goku is disappointed by the revelations of his past he knew he was different but he didn't like the fact that he belonged to a race of murderers despite his better judgment he asked but what happened to them why am I here shin looked down at his feet not wanting to answer the question Kyoto stepped forward instead and explained that Frieza the man they had worked for for many years had killed them all Goku was one of the very few survivors if a man was very upset though he hated the Saiyans he became even more upset that Freeza guy hadn't been taken care of by supreme kai they told Goku not to do anything drastic oku kept the distrust of the Chi ocean in his heart for some time but continues his training every day getting a little closer to taking out the Z sort but suddenly two more pods crashed dammit shin thought they should have seen this coming once again they met as Hussein's if boggled shins mind to realize just how easily accessible the kaiô shin ram was to some of these people they decided that after this they had to destroy all the ships that had crash-landed Kakkar on this planet how did you come to land here Vegeta asked Knapp I wanted to get rid of the other two but Vegeta stopped him no need nappa were here for Kakarot we know how powerful you are it's despicable that a low-class saying scum like you could be so strong and I want to see for myself just how powerful with our warning Vegeta came in to attack Goku the battle was intense but Goku had more power than the Saiyans anticipated at one point Regina even called forward nappa to join in the battle and Goku barely struggled against the two Saiyans at once Goku defeated them Vegeta was upset but he knew better than to blow up on his face he couldn't win instead he turned towards his ship I'm going against my morals since you're low-class trash but I'm sure you know that nappa and I want to take down Frieza we could use your power on our team when the time comes shin was flabbergasted so this is what the Saiyans wanted Vegeta and nappa left goku stood there in silence a few nights passed and shin told goku that Frieza is in matters that he should care about that what he's a tyrant he is in a universal threat like majin buu it's below the kaiô shins pay grade though could turn back to look at him you taught me right from wrong and what freezes doing it's completely awful Shanon glanced over at capito who had his eyes closed she knew that Goku needed closure in this so he waved him off Goku nodded place two fingers on his forehead and search for Vegeta's energy kids don't go away we'll be right back he appeared in front of Vegeta and nappa at a distant planet I'll take care of Frieza myself Vegeta grabbed Goku by the collar of his outfit Frieza is my Kakarot but Goku wasn't hearing he didn't want to think about it but he knew that Vegeta would try to become the Emperor after friezes death that time would come eventually but for now they needed to focus on Frieza the three headed to freeze us chambers where Goku introduced himself as the Saiyan who had come to the feedom Frieza laughed and said SAR bonded the Doria to attack goku ignore them and rush straight to Frieza sucker punching him across the room meanwhile zarba and the Doria were fighting Vegeta and nappa the two had gotten a significant boost in power after Goku's battle so they stood a chance Vegeta in particular Goku and Frieza svatah would take them outside where the city of random would begin to crumble soldiers try to attack Goku but freeze I yelled at them that this was his battle Goku pushed Frieza all the way to his third form remember Goku learned and trained with those who could have killed Frieza in a single blow though Goku is still not nearly as strong as them he's a lot stronger than the Goku we know during the frieza saga Vegeta had defeated a bunch of Frieza soldiers including czar bond and dodoria though he needed Napa's helped to defeat Saban in Napa died in the process but Vegeta could take care of most of the remaining presa soldiers that was until the ginyu force showed up Frieza stepped back from the battle for a second and let the ginyu force battle Goku and Vegeta the battles took some time with two on twos go could defeated gold oh and help Vegeta defeat Rick whom Vegeta was a very hurt but he also helped in the battle against giant burger finally it was time for Jinyu Vegeta tried to keep helping but he was hurt he wanted to go up to Frieza so Vegeta threw up an artificial moon Frieza damned the world sent his remaining forces against Vegeta meanwhile Guinea try to switch bodies with Goku but Goku uses kai Kai and teleported away which caused ginyu to exchange bodies with goal 2 instead you see none of the ginyu force had been killed except for racoon whom Vegeta finished off however a bachina wanted to kill them all and turn his gaze at goal Dogon you and the rest blasting them off with his own sorrow' mouth goku didn't want to kill them but he wasn't going to protest he tried to head to Frieza but Vegeta slapped him out of the way this then go down well for Vegeta specially after Frieza richness final form where he cut off his tail Vegeta was pushed aside in his regular state Goku took this opportunity to go in and rush at Frieza with all his might and he was at the very least equal to Frieza but most likely high above him they were both tired and beat Goku then asked why kill and take over all these planets you've left children and families destroyed Frieza laughed coldly and simply said that it was nothing personal this ticked off Goku and he could only think of all of those he must have killed goku exploded an anger as the city shook around them and his horas  up goku had become a super saiyan Vegeta was in awe but he also damped the world Goku wasted little time as he battled Freeza Freeza even tried to destroy the planet with no luck as Goku slapped his death ball away and into a nearby star goku finally punched Frieza one last time which left him immobilized they say and began to walk away telling Frieza to leaves Frieza used his last bit of energy to attempt to blast Goku to which Goku responded by quickly turning around ready to block the attack however the attack never even touched him as Frieza hit the floor dead Vegeta had blasted through freezes chest goku looked at Vegeta sternly before leaving a Goku or Vegeta not to do anything like Frieza did otherwise he would come after him too but they gave a light smile to each other next time I'll be the winner back at the Chi ocean realm Goku was greeted by ki b2n shin who were surprised by his new state it was incredible power that they did not expect from any Mortal he is stronger than Goku in the original story though Kiba to who looks down upon this shin thinks that it's time to give Goku one last shot at the sea sword as he believes Goku would be the one to eventually defeat majin buu if needed they were proud of what he did against Frieza and got closure against his enemy they all gathered around as Goku's energy spiked up when he became a Super Saiyan slowly this sword moved off the rock until it finally freed itself it was very heavy and Goku needed some time to adjust to it he was incredibly happy and already felt strong time passed as he trained with the sea sword years even one day Goku challenged shin to see how strong the sea sword is and he strikes cutting metal with the sword breaking it in half the team is terrified at first until they hear a weird voice the old kyochon had been released from the sea sort that beerus had hit him inside long ago goku wants to get to know his secrets immediately but he asks for a pretty girl otherwise he will not help goku doesn't know any women so sadly he can't help the old geezer he beat oh and she approached the old kiyah bout it and explained that Goku is their ticket to the beat the universe's greatest threat the old kyra luck Tinley agrees and begins to unlock Goku's hidden potential years past without a peep from Buu and Goku has become essentially the universe's greatest protector one day Caillou shin and ki Beto catch went from those on earth which is mostly humans and demons from Piccolo's army the three head down to earth and find bobbidi ship after following some of Bobby's men there were swarms of machines and demons all around that they all had to defeat though it was fairly easy for all of them even piccolo was taken down in the process Goku takes care of the evildoers including dobrze however all of this generates a lot of energy for Buu survival though not nearly as much as the one in the original story as there aren't as many powerful beings on earth but Goku was way too fast for bhavati and beat down the villain Goku took one breath he knew this was what he was training for his entire life he had to kill Bobby and so he did finally Goku had accomplished his mission of stopping booze revival and saving the universe he could live peacefully for now but before he did he searched for the energy of an old ally Goku teleported and about Vegeta sitting on a throne of a planet he looked to be solitary with no life in sight Goku smarter Vegeta who told them that he had been challenging warriors from across the universe and learning to be able to defeat him all these years though he thought about starting his own army Goku said that he simply wanted to battle him to his surprise Vegeta had learned to obtain super saiyan and the level above that Super Saiyan 2 Goku smiled and the battle began obviously Goku would win which is why he limited himself so the battle would be fair even so Goku was winning but he was quite impressed by Vegeta's techniques he looks forward to their next battle and hoped that he would become stronger too the battle was declared to draw Goku then headed back to the chi ocean realm to celebrate and this is where our story ends for now of course they're still super to cover but maybe sometime in the future I think this is a good place to end it as Goku and the rest Alif peacefully for a few years but as I said there is the subject of the god of destruction waking up anyways thanks so much for 19,000 subscribers so close to 20,000 but be sure to share
