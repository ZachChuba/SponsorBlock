hello everyone and welcome back to our dev vlog series foregrounded in today's vlog we're gonna go over how biggest building works and then we're gonna go take a tour it view the basis built by some of the team my name is Sheila and I'm the social media manager here at obsidian entertainment now let's get going [Music] to get started on your building journey you're gonna first want to craft a pebble attacks which you can do after you analyze a public these publics can be found throughout the yard and they will be vital in many crafting recipes once you have your ex take a look at your hot pouch and make sure that your building tools are being assigned to the slot you prefer then it's time to go find a grass blade and chop it down in order to make grass planks these grass planks will unlock the wall of door and floor blueprints another building material that you're gonna want to locate will be weed stones these can be found by chopping down dandelions one tip to help you locate the enjoins is that while you're walking around the yard keep your eyes to the sky Damien's typically tower over the grass and making them really easy to spot from a distance while mapping out your new base if you really want to clear out the grass in the area you're building in don't forget to go after the stumps of grass that's left behind when you chop the stock down not only will you remove these stumps but you'll also receive plenty of plant fiber while doing this as you continue to discover new materials in the backyard you're going to want to go back to and analyzer to analyze them from time to time well some blueprints will be unlocked simply by harvesting the materials other blueprints will only be discovered from analyzing specific items such as the Steyr recipe when analyzing grass planks [Music] as he unlocked blueprints you'll be able to start building your base starting with grass planks and then moving up to wheat stems you'll be able to find sturdier materials to help you keep those pesky bugs away remember the construction radio mentioned in the last vlog well it will become your greatest tool as you work on laying out blueprints to build your best face the handy feature for players playing cooperatively and grounded is the fact that blueprints you lay down will be seen by all players playing this way everyone can help design and contribute to the base another thing to keep in mind before you start building is the location you may want to look for a central location to start but keep in mind that you could really build bases all around the yard if you want to there really is no right or wrong way on how to build your base and to be honest you can demolish and rebuild at any time just go out there have fun and build the base that you really want to build [Music] starting a gaming creative mode means that you'll be able to go and play in the back yard without fear of any unexpected visitors bugs do not spawn in this mode allowing you to really get creative with your base locations in building locations that might otherwise be unsafe when you start your game in this mode all blueprints available will automatically be unlocked for you so you can get to building right away you can also have your friends join you in this mode so you can all get creative together [Music] as we mentioned earlier there really is no right or wrong way to build your baits like towers well what if you build two towers next to each other and then build your house in between the towers you have plenty of space to work with for all those decorations you want had an idea to build a base and a drink can well you can do it you might have to get a little creative with it but it'll definitely make for a nice dirty home [Music] love treehouses well why not build a tree mansion you can even have some fun with how you enter your home looking for a little waterside property well you can build that and then you'll have a nice spot to relax at as the day winds down [Music] thought about making an entire little village in the backyard complete with the basketball court and a target practice area then get ready because you can do that too there are so many things you'll be able to do in the backyard with the materials you find and honestly we really can't wait to see where your imagination takes you in our next vlog we're gonna take a look at how crafting works and go over some of the tier 0 to tier 1 items found in the game and as always please comment below with any sort of ideas or questions you may have for us to
