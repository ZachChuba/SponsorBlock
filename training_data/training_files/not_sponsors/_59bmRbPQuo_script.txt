hey guys it's Chelsea from the financial comm slash go slash TFD so this week I wanted to talk to you guys all about the things that no one tells you when it comes to your professional life and especially when it comes to getting a good job now I know that for everyone the definition of what a good job actually is is going to be different for some people that means a job with a lot of creative responsibilities or a really good work-life balance or with a team that you absolutely love but however you define it finding a job in a career field that you really care about is going to be much harder than just landing any old job off the street and for many industries especially professional / white-collar industries there are going to be a lot of office dynamics that go into landing and keeping that job that go well beyond the informational packet you're likely to pick up at some kind of college job fair basically when it comes to becoming a part of the professional world a lot of what is going to be expected of you are things you're never going to be taught especially not in any formal class and it can often feel most intimidating when you feel like there's a secret code that everyone around you is using whether during the interview process or on the job itself in fact I would argue that this is why so many of us feel a sense of impostor syndrome when we start our jobs it's largely because you have to learn on the job how the professional world works so it's totally understandable that you feel really unprepared but you're in luck because I am prometheus coming down from Mount Olympus actually I think in this story Prometheus actually came up from the ground because he was a Titan anyway I'm Prometheus and I'm coming from somewhere and I'm gonna give you guys fire aka the professional insights you need and for my sins I will be chained against a rock to have my liver eaten by an eagle for the rest of eternity but it's so worth it so let's get right into the professional secrets that no one is going to tell you about getting a good job number one is kind of a bummer and that's if you're applying for a job online it's probably already too late so here's the truth of the matter for every job that's listed online particularly as the job gets more and more competitive or desirable it's likely that that employer is going to be receiving dozens if not hundreds of qualified applicants and even if you manage to fill out the application the day it goes live it's still going to have to stand out in a pile through all those other applications that came in on top of it in fact because you applied so soon by the time that person is checking their application inbox you may already be totally at the bottom but aside from the sheer statistical difficulty of standing out in such an open cattle call situation there's also the fact that this job may very well be one that they were required to post online but had already likely hired for or promoted for a lot of people don't know this but in many corporate situations there's a requirement for a job to be offered to the public but there's already an internal structure in place that means that job is likely going to be from an internal promotion or through various networks they've already found the desired candidate combine that with the many many people who are going to be applying to the job and you find yourself in a situation where even if you are incredibly qualified you are fighting an insanely uphill battle just to even be noticed and you may be applying for a post that's either already taken or already promised this isn't to say that you should never apply to jobs online if you see a job that seems like a great fit go ahead and apply you never know they might keep your resume and use it down the road but it should never be looked at as your primary means of landing a job it is very likely that the jobs you're going to land particularly the ones that are most valuable to you are going to be through a little bit of creativity and networking in fact you may end up finding a job that hasn't even been listed yet because they're just in the early stages of defining it and if you want to ensure that you are at least going to be able to get to the in-person part of the interview one of the worst ways to do that will be submitting your name along with thousands possibly of other applicants making sure that other more creative and personal means of finding a job is the majority of your search not just responding to open calls is going to radically increase your chances of landing a good job and more importantly will at least ensure you're able to get in the door and make the case to people face-to-face and even if you don't end up landing those jobs getting more real interviews does so much more for your eventual skills than just applying to something online long story short don't not apply online but do not get your hopes up for it number two is kind of similar and builds upon the last point and is also a bummer and that's that networking really is super important but it rarely happens at designated networking events as I mentioned before many of the most desirable job posts you will find and the ones in which you have the highest likelihood of actually getting through a real interview process are going to be jobs that aren't even listed online or not listed online yet in fact it may be a situation where you meet someone who loves your work enough to see if they can create a job for you but no matter how you're getting to these back channels for better jobs it's almost always going to be through networking and yes that word gets a terrible rap but mostly because when people think about networking they think about that extremely superficial like let me hand you my business card add you to the list of people I claim to know and not really know anything about you and that kind of networking is terrible and that kind of networking most often happens at those big networking events mixers conferences etc I have been to so many of those and let me tell you that the amount of times I have come away with what is a really valuable meaningful connection is negligible most of my real networking happens through more organic means for example looking at people you already know who may have a lot of overlap with what you're doing getting a genuine coffee or lunch and seeing how you can possibly work together talk about what you're working on talk about where your needs are perhaps even form mastermind groups with one another even joining meetup groups that are based on common interests in which there may be a lot of professional overlap is likely to be a better situation than just going to some cattle call women in business mixer or whatever they're promoting these days when you look at networking less about just forming connections for the sake of having them and more about identifying where you have truly rich meaningful connections in which the two of you can be additive to one another's professional life it becomes more clear that a small amount of really good networking is vastly better than a large amount of really superficial networking so while you can't totally throw in the trash professional events and conferences and that kind of thing you'll have to do them occasionally they shouldn't be looked at as the place in which you're going to make the most meaningful connections sometimes they really can pan out but it's not as often as you would think more importantly you should be looking around at the people you already have in your life former colleagues friends people you went to school with etc with whom you could have really meaningful conversations often the best jobs you find will be through going to coffee with someone who you used to work with perhaps or a friend of a friend who happens to have a really great opportunity for you but even if it never results in just a direct handing over of a job learning to view networking in a much more healthy and honest way will make it feel so much less gross while keeping its importance in your life now number three is all about when you get to the interview and here's the truth the interview process is often more intimidating than the actual workplace itself and sometimes that's by design because people really want to suss out who is strong and responsive and handles pressure well and especially when you get into these more like high-powered competitive jobs making the interview process a big deal is a huge part of sifting out the people who might be great on paper but not great in practice from the people who really bring the total package and obviously in an interview process these people don't know you so it's very very likely that they're going to be a lot more closed off and professional and distant than they would be once you're actually in this office day to day and every interview is different so it's not totally to say that the interview itself is going to be more intimidating than the workplace but it's also pretty fair to say that usually in an interview your own tensions are running much higher than they will be in your day to day life so remembering that the interview process is not a good snapshot of what life will be like for you every day at the office is very important to remember partially just to help you keep your cool during that interview we have one employee who came very very professionally dressed for an interview very like business casual blazer working girl and then now that she's in the office every day she's totally herself and she likes to wear like a lot of concert t-shirts and she has piercings and she's able to just be totally at ease and that's the way we want it and for the record no one told her to dress super professionally to an interview but that's really common people are often gonna go well above and beyond in the interview process which often heightens the inherent tension and then as soon as you get even a minimal level of comfort with the people you're working with you can feel free to try out what feels more natural and be a little bit more convivial with the people around you and not feel so high stressed and distant it sucks that for most of us our entree into the professional world is going through a lot of interviews because it gives us an impression of the work environment that may be totally inaccurate to what our day-to-day life is and yes granted at TFD we might have a more open and relaxed work environment than others might but generally speaking the experience you have at the interview is going to be a lot higher stakes and therefore a lot more stressful than your day-to-day work number four is that you always have to be looking now listen you don't have to always be on the active job search 24/7 365 that would be terrible and also if your employer were to get word of that not a good look but you should always have your ear to the ground have semi regular check-ins with people who are very relevant in your network keep things like your online profiles updated and relevant and making sure that you're always kind of putting the best foot forward and maybe keeping even an eye on the overall employment trends in your industry for example if there is a competitive company that you really admire that's maybe going on a bit of a hiring spree that's something that's maybe good to know and I say this because often when we get a job that we care about it can feel like well that's it I have job and you don't ever really have to be part of the searching for work crowd ever again but there's a couple things to keep in mind first of all your employer is not your friend if they ever needed to lay you off for cost purposes trust me that your ass would be on the street number two most people are going to get their most substantial pay increases by going outside of their company because they're not held to that starting salary that they had when they first entered the company on which they get incremental raises when you switch companies that's when you can start making those huge ten twenty thirty percent and beyond pay increases it's also good generally not to be complacent in terms of how you are positioned within the industry because if anything ever were to happen to your job outside of your control you want to make sure that your Ducks are in a row professionally and that you can put your best foot forward but lastly like in a relationship over-familiarity can be destructive to all parties it's very easy to get complacent in a job and feel like well this is the best there is out there or it's familiar to me so why rock the boat and that can not only keep you in toxic situations it can also be a good way for you to sell yourself short I know several people in my life who have been at the same company for years and years and years who have hated their job there or at least not been super fulfilled by it who haven't been satisfied with some management stuff or their role or the pay or what-have-you but year after year they kick the can of changing jobs down the road because it's easy to default to what is familiar and what is known so if you are having an amazing time at your job it's good to just stay current because you never know what could happen but especially if your job is becoming perhaps a little too familiar not challenging enough not necessarily treating you with the level of respect that you expect that's a time to really consider keeping your options more actively open but long story short it's never a situation of you look for a job you acquire job you lose job you look for a job it should always be kind of a passive ambient I'm aware of what's going on job wise around me so that you can make sure to put yourself first and now once you've already landed it what is there to know about the great job on the day-to-day well number five I think is one of the most important things and that's being communicative / good at admin is going to make you stand out more than almost anything else now listen I am sure you are very talented you're watching TFD which means that you're clearly very smart and how peccable tastes but just because you are talented does not mean you are good to work with anyone who has hired or run a team or manage a department will tell you over and over that for every ten people who are very skilled at a particular task there are only like three of those ten who are also very good at just working with other people what do you mean by communication and admin Chelsea well I mean a few very basic things that sound like they should be obvious but are very much not things like being extremely reliable not just in terms of like when you're at the office but when you say something is going to be done it is done to a high standard being responsive which means like if there is a question you are able to answer it in a timely fashion or you're able to stay on top of a task as it goes on number three basic project management skills like can you create a doc that really leads like the ongoing odds and ends of the project are you able to keep up with it can you hold regular meetings to make sure everyone's on time there are so many basic elements of just like being a professional that a lot of people don't seem to master they don't understand that often just being a coherent and reliable person to work with or to work for is just as important as being good at the skill itself and yes there are certain jobs where it's just the skill and everything else is kind of secondary like if you are a hired contractor to do a very specific job but if you are an ongoing part of a team being a reliable and interact with the ball team member is going to be of the utmost importance and I have seen all around me people who are otherwise very qualified either not get or not be able to hold a very good job because all of those administrative and communicative and basic kind of management skills were not there and even if you are not managing other people you are managing yourself and your own time and doing things as basic as having a really good working knowledge of spreadsheets and your own calendar and project management documents is going to make a world of difference you may have gone to college to learn your specific skill but it's very unlikely that you took a class on not the in the email thread who replies all to the entire group with a question that has already been answered several emails up per my previous email is work for you please read lastly number six you're in this job things are kickin you're loving it feels like a dream you've managed to get way farther in it than you thought you would you're loving it unfortunately number six is the more you love a job the more careful you have to be about keeping boundaries and this applies from the interview process all the way until your retirement and/or premature death at your desk first of all be very careful about even using words like love to describe a relationship with your job of course there can be elements of your work that you feel a great passion for you can have a really high level of care about the work you're doing but especially when it comes to relating to an employer saying that you love a job is not super healthy because love is usually reserved for a human emotion between two consenting people not between you and a corporation who let's reiterate would totally fire you in a heartbeat if they had to cut costs but also it is very easy for a job that we love or at the very least really don't want to lose to bleed into the rest of our lives to an unhealthy degree it's easy to start answering emails in the evening or on weekends or going way above and beyond on a project pass what you're being paid for or even supposed to do it's easy to start covering for other people or taking up more slack even though you're not being given overtime it's so easy to get sucked into an unhealthy relationship with an employer or with a job once you have decided that it is your passion it's good to care about work but it's not good to care to the point that it becomes inappropriately present in your life and the bigger issue is that once you start to let those lines blur a little bit it becomes nearly impossible to reclaim that territory if you've started being the person who answers emails at 11 p.m. on a Sunday someone's eventually gonna send you an email at 10:35 on a Sunday and be like why aren't you answering this you're always available also fun fact you can schedule emails to go out in the morning which one time when I was and a bit of a personal spiral and typed up like a hundred and ten emails to send and it was like 2:30 in the morning on a Monday night I was like this looks psychotic let's schedule these all to go out between the hours of 8:00 and 11:00 a.m. and they did and I looked really efficient rather than like I was unraveling the point is when we think about these good jobs that were so excited to have it's easy to feel a sense of like extreme gratitude for the job but if you're putting in amazing work and doing what is required of you and beyond they should feel grateful to you but at the very least you shouldn't start treating it like a relationship that can stake a claim over the rest of your life you keep the boundaries where the boundaries will keep you that doesn't really make sense but you get
