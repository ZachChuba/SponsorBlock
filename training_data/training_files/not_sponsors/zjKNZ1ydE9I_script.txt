[Music] this camera technique is called a dolly zoom the lens is zooming out from a telephoto to a wide-angle field of view while the camera tracks in to keep the subject the same size in the frame here it's being used by director Steven Spielberg in his 1975 film jaws this is the moment the film's protagonist Brody realizes that a shark has attacked a young boy swimming in the water this shift from an era to a wider field of view separates Brody from the background from his wife it has an isolating effect the features of his face become more exaggerated reflecting the disorientation we can feel when thrown into a state of panic Spielberg is using the lens to play a key part in communicating Brody's thoughts and feelings as he comes to the horrible realization that he should have closed the beach this scene demonstrates an important factor in your choice of lens the focal length affects the psychological impact of your shot your choice of focal length these days is more important than it was in the past it's more important today than it was 30 years ago when it was more important than it was 30 years before that let me take you through why this is and what it means for you as a photographer advancing technology has made photography more accessible and therefore more commonplace but the bigger effect is the impact advancing technology has had on television and cinema home TVs have got bigger adopted cinematic aspect ratios and production value has massively improved the TV series to the point where a well shot TV drama will often be visually indistinguishable from a cinema released film and this means that most people will be exposed to this language on a daily basis the result of this is that our society has developed an acute intuitive understanding of the visual language of cinema now while film cinematography and photography are very different beasts in a lot of ways there are also some aspects that unites them and one of those is how we as an audience psychologically derive meaning from different focal lengths in his 2017 film call me by your name the director Luca Guadagnino made the conscious choice to shoot the whole film using only a cook s for 35 millimeter lens in interviews he states that the choice to exclusively use such a neutral focal length was to give the feel of the human eye the resulting effect of this is one that removes the barrier of the concept of focal length for the audience we are not so much viewing the narrative through the lens of the director but being placed into the environment with the characters when we choose a lens to shoot with we are making a decision about the psychological value the images we take with that lens will hold a wide-angle lens will exaggerate the perception of depth but shooting close with the wide-angle lens or give the viewer a unique connection with the subject as the subject will appear isolated from the elements surrounding them any movement towards the camera such as leaning in will be vastly exaggerated we become part of the subjects world we are close maybe too close there is a tension between the viewer and the subject and it can become uncomfortable maybe we're intruding into someone's world cinematographer Roger Deakins is probably best known for his work with the Coen brothers together they have created a distinctive cinematic style Deakins frequently uses a 27 millimeter wide-angle lens for shots of single characters his preference for often showing just single characters in the frame at any one time gives these shots a portrait like quality the wide lens gives us not only a heightened sense of both dramatic and comedic tension when use close up but when moves slightly back the wider field of view allows us to see the subject within their environment we get a contextual portrait of that character and this tells us more about them than a closer lens will give us a standard lens usually somewhere around 35 to 50 millimeters on a 35-millimeter stills camera is so called because it most closely represents what we see with the human eye and while I feel the visual awareness is actually a lot larger what a standard lens does is capture a similar area to what we call human foveal vision which is the area of detail we can see clearly and sharply with our eyes and therefore what we perceive as our field of view for this reason we can use a standard lens to reduce the psychological barrier that are more dramatic focal length creates presenting the subject of our shot in a way that more closely represents how we see with our eyes creates a feeling of honesty and of reality we can be more subtle in the way we frame and highlight a scene leading the viewer to make a more intuitive connection with the subject matter rather than a forced one it's also worth noting that mobile phone lenses commonly provide a field of view not dissimilar to a standard lens for this reason we're very used to seeing the world represented in this way and as most people use their phone cameras to take pictures of things rather than to create an aesthetically pleasing composition when we use a standard lens to compose an image any consideration given to composition or make our images stand out a little more while simultaneously reinforcing the idea that the subject of the image has some importance some reason to be photographed a telephoto lens isolates subjects in a very different way to a wide lens distance becomes compressed and we get a flattened out feeling to the perspective but from a cultural context we're used to seeing a telephoto lens field of view used to photograph things that we can't get close to such as wildlife celebrities athletes in mid-performance fleeting moments containing rare things of value formal portraits are often frequently shot with longer focal lengths as the compressed perspective is perceived as being more flattering on people's features when we use a long lens we are not part of the shot we are not there with the subject we are voyage looking through the lens onto someone else's world because this is how we most commonly understand the telephoto field of view when we take that look and apply it to something else a portrait of a stranger on the street for example we add a sense of formality of grandeur and gravitas something that a wider lens wouldn't give us the stranger is no longer one of us just a passerby we can interact with as an equal their status has been elevated using a long lens to isolate them makes the shot say this person is important choosing the right focal length is much more than just creating a flattering portray or being able to fit everything you want to into your frame your choice of lens changes the dynamic of your image and the psychological meaning that your audience will derive from it when choosing a lens think about how you want your audience to feel why are you shooting what you are what are you saying with it use focal length to subtly communicate your message to the viewer because changing focal length can completely change the whole meaning of your shot so this is the sponsored bit [Music] you [Music]
