historian website more on that later if you haven't seen my video on the battles of Lexington and Concord we recommend you watch that before watching this episode April 19th 1775 was a disastrous day for the British Empire not only did a loosely organized group of Massachusetts rebels rout 1,500 English soldiers but they also laid siege to the city of Boston that same day trapping the Imperial Governor General Thomas Gage colonial forces numbered some 7,000 men but they lacked the heavy artillery necessary to force British supply ships out of the harbor this bought general gage and his 4,000 troops much-needed time to call for reinforcements from England by late May 4,000 additional troops landed in Boston Harbor accompanied by generals how Clinton and Burgoyne the commanders all agreed that a breakout was necessary before winter hit the besieged city they came up with two targets Dorchester Heights and Charlestown these two points would act as staging areas to launch a pincer movement into the heart of the Patriot siege with limited munitions and poor organization colonial forces wouldn't stand a chance but stationing thousands of soldiers and all of Britain's I command in one spot meant that their troop movements were quite conspicuous in a great stroke of Fortune for the commander-in-chief of the Massachusetts militia Artemus Ward word of a June offensive reached him before its intended start but what was he to do with these plans splitting his forces in half to try to defend both points would put him at an even bigger disadvantage instead war chose only to fortify Charlestown his logic was that as long as one of the vantage points over Boston was secure the British could not break the siege lest they leave their flank vulnerable to counter-attack however the militia had to act fast if they hope to beat the Redcoats to the punch in the evening of June 16th a little over 1,000 Colonials under the command of William Prescott made their way over the Charlestown neck to secure a strategic point dubbed Bunker Hill joining him was Brigadier General Israel Putnam who had wagons loaded with tools and resources needed to fortify the hill British ships were on the lookout for any movement so Prescott's men had to move quietly through the dark New England tonight when they finally arrived a conference was held on whether to follow orders and build to read out on Bunker Hill or go against orders and build on breeds Hill on one hand the 75 foot high breeds Hill was closer to Boston making it good for offensive posturing but on the other hand Bunker Hill was 35 feet taller and was closer to reinforcements the decision to fortify breeds Hill was finally reached after two hours of debate in retrospect this may not have been the best decision as breeds Hill was closer to the British warships in Boston Harbor and as colonial forces were low on ammunition and heavy weaponry an offensive stance wasn't going to do much in the book a guide to the battles of the American Revolution by Theodore P Savas and Jay David Damron it has written that Bunker Hill could have been made nearly impregnable while breeds Hill closer to the harbor was essentially untenable and offered nothing of strategic value not found in the former by midnight fortifications were being hastily built on breeds Hill under the cover of darkness Construction had to be completed fast before British forces discovered Putnam and Prescott's troops at dawn before they were completely finished the crew aboard the HMS lively spotted the men atop breeds Hill and promptly opened fire the candidate was ineffective however as the commander of the ship ordered his men to hold fire until he had more intelligence about these situation as this was happening how Clinton and Berg when called for a conference to decide how to retaliate the plan they settled on was this troops would be landed at the southeastern part of the peninsula as soon as possible pinning down those defending breeds Hill while a separate force enveloped them by flanking around rail fence on the readouts left flank at 1:00 p.m. British troops landed around Moulton's hill after another round of naval bombardment some of the fire was directed at Charlestown neck this time to cut off colonial reinforcements which did prove effective in scaring troops who dared cross the narrow pass by 3:00 p.m. more British troops landed and the attack was finally ready to commence except it wasn't because sharpshooters in Charlestown were harassing British forces assembling on the beaches so before the attack had began the HMS lively was ordered to shell the town setting it ablaze thirty minutes later the attack was finally ready to begin comprised of four-man wide columns the tightly packed troops confidently made their way up Brits Hill the heat was oppressive and was only made fiercer by the intense burning of Charlestown below smoke filled the sky and the drums of war began to sound weary colonial eyes looked down on the dense red lines approaching the hill to their left was light infantry and grenadiers sent around to the rail fence ammunition was scarce so keeping discipline was imperative for the Colonials luckily for them their leader Prescott was a remarkable commander he inspired his men fighting alongside them on the front line Prescott ordered his men to target officers and hold their fire until British formations were within fifty yards when a strong volley broke out atop the British casualties quickly began to mount the events continued another body the advance continuing but as fire rained down on Houseman he was forced to withdraw but there would be a second attack and this time he would personally lead the light infantry around 4:00 p.m. the second assault commenced British forces advanced in the same old way and were thrown back in the same old way how now furious called for reinforcements 400 British Marines light cannon and gunboats were sent to provide fire support for those assaulting the rail fence the men were ordered to toss everything but their musket ammunition and bayonet so they could be as nimble as possible this time there would be no retrieved with Patriot forces low on ammunition the British launched a massive bayonet charge against both positions with the majority of their forces massed around the hill hand-to-hand fighting soon broke out in both locations and the Colonials were routed shortly after the troops stationed at the rail fence were ordered to retreat to prevent envelopment British forces then assumed the position atop breeds Hill and fired down on the retreating soldiers inflicting heavy casualties but the British were too exhausted to pursue colonial forces over Charlestown neck allowing many rebels to escape this battle was one of the bloodiest of the American Revolutionary War while General Howe did capture the Charlestown Peninsula it was at a terrible cost the British suffered 226 dead and 828 wounded which doesn't sound like a lot but this was 45% of their force the Americans suffered 140 dead and 301 wounded were captured which was only about 15 percent of their force what made this such a devastating defeat for the British was the amount of officers that were slain in the battle to quote a guide to the battles of the American Revolution again one-eighth of British officers killed in one sixth of those wounded during the entire war were lost at Bunker Hill the fear at victory at Charlestown made it impossible for the British to launch an attack on Dorchester Heights until more reinforcements arrived the siege of Boston would remain a stalemate with no side ad enough strength to break the other Howe ever the well-stocked fort ticonderoga had been taken in May just one month prior if the Americans could bring to bear newly captured munitions especially heavy artillery they might be able to turn the tide there was one problem Fort Ticonderoga was about 200 miles away in upstate New York when the new minted commander-in-chief George Washington took command in July he found himself in dire need of a miracle next time we'll see if that miracle comes thanks for best part is is that no videos on the website will have ads or sponsorships
