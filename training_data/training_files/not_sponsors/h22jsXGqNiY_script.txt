[Music] here we are everyone uh the rat catchers video i uploaded by release i didn't put rat catchers in there it came out november 28 2005 and it immediately became notorious as one of the worst quests in the game because of one reason the maze that that doesn't even matter trust me when i say the maze is the least concerning thing about rat catchers the writing the entire plot of the quest the reward you get the mini game that came along with it the characters i have no idea how i'm gonna organize this show i thought it was gonna be another good cat quest you know hanging out with all the fur balls and dealing with their business but before manscape.com for sponsoring today's video go take care of your balls lucky for all of you people i have my my old copy of rat catchers the original work i can't say i'd i'd recommend it i mean the last cat quest that we did was was tale of two cats and that was a great quest that had some of the best writing in any quest so far you'd think the next cat quest would be you know up to par with that one but boy oh boy allow me to uh read you the news post that was announced on the website the day that this quest came out dust off your cats and feed them up with fish today's update will have you and your moggy engaged once more in a cat astrophy of a feline favor oh wait a feline flavor sorry i'm bad at reading the rat catcher's quest will have you sneaking about experimenting with the new cat concoctions and of course catching rats all this will give you access to all sorts of cat related features including a whole new mini game new growth stages for your cat and the opportunity to give your cat a name wow here being the best cat trainer really begins to pay off as you challenge your friends and foes for glory and the spoils of victory keep your eyes peeled for six great new audio tracks i don't  care about that one see if i read that on the day of release i'd be excited i'd go do that that's so many so many things the problem with that though that was the most exaggerated ever i know a lot of you probably haven't done this quest in a while or maybe this is the first time you're hearing about it so let me give you a very brief summary so i talked to gertrude she said there were some people i should meet in the varrock sewers i went down there and met two sketch balls named grimesquit and and finspet they had me catch eight rats after that they directed me to a dude named jimmy dazzler in ardoyne who coordinated something called the rat pits i talked to dazzy guy and he said he needs me to clear some rich dude's mansion of a rat infestation but i can't be seen it'll ruin his reputation everyone thinks he's so clean i can't imagine what someone would think if they knew that this guy had somebody come and take care of a pest problem gotta be all over the papers criers with their bells saying this guy's got rats in his place so i got brought to that infamous mansion that everyone about i ran around some hedges snuck past some guards i cleared all the rats out and i was done when i got back he wanted me to go talk to a person named hook nosed jack jack had me poison a bunch of rats upstairs in some dumpster fire i don't know if there's a house i hope no one lives there then we had to fight a behemoth daddy rat with my cat i was feeding it i was one tick away from from my cat dying and then jack's cat got sick uh so we had to go make his cat an antidote which we did he was fine i had to go help a dwarf in keldagrim i used a pot of smoke to lure rats out and my cat ambushed them and we solved the problem i went to port cerum and talked to the face who told me someone named felkrash wanted to talk to me she needed me to get rid of the rat infestation at the port so i went to paulo novich and learned about a musical tune that made rats drown themselves when i played it i told the girl that it was done i completed the quest now this completion screen popped up and uh that was when i initially thought to myself i i can't put that in by release [Music] most quests prior to this one do a pretty good job at giving the player direction and giving an npc a personality this quest gives direction but uh our first piece of dialogue comes at the beginning when we talk to gertrude very very nice genuine cat lady we're just checking in on her she's like how are things and before we could answer she goes oh wait before i forget there's these two people down in the varrock sewers very very sketchy probably on a lot of drugs i think uh you should meet them that sounds like the last thing i'd want to do the last time i talked to gertrude i i helped find her cat and then she gave me one that's all we've been through together i mean maybe i do slightly give off the vibe that i hang out in sewers she didn't ever ask how's the cat going you like it is it alive so i go to the sewers i get down there and there's these two girls there's there's grimes quit and fin sped right that yeah my guy's telling me it's right they've got this weird thick english accent but i mean it's fitting you know they've they've got that stumble upon a creepy person in an unfamiliar place and thinking they're gonna you know kill me that's the voice one of those people would have probably for the first time in uh 93 quests my character performs an aside it's a theatrical thing but there's a group of characters and a situation's playing out one character will do an aside and let his thoughts be known to the audience everyone or animal freeze except for him he'll step out to the crowd and say some real emotional then he goes back into the crowd and it resumes and they put an aside in the quest dialogue to address the audience that is me i'm the audience my i am i didn't decide to myself i get the intention they're thinking oh i need to express the characters thoughts to set the tone of this quest and how the player should be able to feel about it i am my character i don't want my character being told what to feel it doesn't feel right it just doesn't feel right i can't believe i'm going to do this but what choice do i have i just got done telling these two that i'm interested in teaching my cat more about rat catching they just asked me to catch eight rats my guy has done so much horse before in the past i can't believe i'm gonna do this he's like sacrificing his arm or something but what choice do i have i was catching rats i catch the rats another curveball i start mocking their accent okay kind of kind of a dick move but then they started speaking normally apparently they tricked me why did their accents change that actually fit them then they start laughing at themselves shut the the next character no better worse perhaps we go and talk to jimmy dazzler but within the first couple lines of dialogue blue text pops up saying that he subconsciously shudders this is what they call in the show business a parenthetical there's two ways of letting a character that has lines on that script no they need to be either doing something walking over to it picking it up what they're doing what's going on that's an action a parenthetical is is written in the lines of the character and it's usually something that the character has to do as they deliver the line subconsciously shuddering would be the parenthetical that was written in the the script no one read the script dude no one read this thing before it got published the actions that are in the quest are trying to tell the player what is happening in the story what's going on unless you can animate it don't write a block of text telling me that it happened i didn't see happen i'm still standing here staring at this guy there's there's no excuse for it either they started getting pretty nifty with that uh shadow of the storm they got the priests pointing at the golem and very angrily what really got me was the smile bits they did his name's jimmy dazzler the dazzler part refers to his teeth being pearly white it's indicated that he smiles at me a bunch of times a dazzling smile jimmy dazzles you once more with one of his trademark smiles you get very turned on uncertain smile a knowing smile and so then i did the maze got back and just one last jimmy dazzler joke creepy is it funny i don't know let me give you a linus tech tip on writing this is a known theory i refer to it as the rule of threes the rule of threes will help you win arguments be funny and it'll stop people from hating you some of you  debate nerds out there i argued in high school i'm gonna use dazzy guys smiles over here as an example so you've got this joke it's a really good joke that joke comes in a package that package has three distributions that you can place you have to place them strategically because once you use them they're done you get three if you go over your three distributions of that joke argument point you're making people get sick of it and they hate you dazzler smiles at me like six or seven times safe to say i want him shot and then we head to uh hook nosed jack i wonder if he can spell around corners with that nose you quickly avert your gaze from his face with determination to not show any signs of embarrassment you look jack in the eyes that kind of sounds like i'm in the middle of the hottest sex scene in an erotic novel not talking to a guy who has a rat problem a guy's cat gets sick i say i feel responsible for it can i help in any way  grammar that's a question he's the one who let it run ramp it in a in a trap house get your cat put on a leash or something the next part of this quest is what really got me this is when i actually blew a gasket as i was playing it we had to help a dwarf in keldagrim i don't remember what his problem was but i'm a good guy i was like yeah i'll help you smoking joe nice to meet you and then the writer showed their true colors and keep in mind here all the quests up to this point granted you don't need to do any of the dwarf quest to do this quest so i'm in caldergrim got my dwarf friends i've joined a company here i'm an employee i've helped the commander of this entire town and i've gotten hammered with the locals people love me here i love them so smoking joe hard worker he's an old timer you know his immune system's not too great he's coughing a little bit feel bad i mean he's just he's old you know what can he do and for some unknown reason the writer thought to himself i need to make the player hate this disgusting little piece of so he writes uh wipe some phlegm from his mouth because you just got done coughing ew what a disgusting little dwarf and look at the size of those ears dude who the wrote this quest oh god did nobody revive did nobody review this quest before putting it out did no one read this dialogue in particular and say you know maybe we should uh you know rethink that line i'm calling this little dwarf here who's done nothing wrong to me other than uh is clearly struggling a disgusting little dwarf and look at the size of those ears there's not even those ears aren't even that bad oh my god i hate this i don't think my guy would be thinking that he's seen  things why this doesn't bother me dude i don't give a look at the size of those ears who gives a dude he's a dwarf look at the size of him a good old-fashioned fourth wall breaking take it from me the writer i know that you just take it from me take it from me you don't wanna you don't wanna see that no way am i touching that that is so gross i would never say that zero chance i would ever say that i so yeah um dialogue not so great i want to quickly talk about the story i don't think the gower brothers or any content developer looked at this even an outline of this before it was published there's no way there's no way this was supposed to happen the developer of this quest i don't want to point fingers but it says on the wiki that chris jolly was the lead developer of this quest so i did some research chris had worked at jagex as an audio engineer the music sound effects stuff like that i don't want to point fingers at him for being the writer i have no idea it just says he's a lead developer and the quest has something to do with a musical instrument so you can essentially play a song like an eight note song now if he was the one writing it i mean he's an audio music guy it would make sense chris is not with jagex anymore he left a long time ago runescape has it so you can't access their old web pages they used to have pages for every quest in the game and i'm sure they had credits on there they removed all the quests uh pages and just kind of directed everyone to the wiki the wiki guys probably reached out to jagex like hey who's the content developer or lead development guy uh chris jolly ah chris j that's that's the guy just plaster's name on it and that's his legacy as rat catchers chris i'm sorry if that's what happened it's up i wrapped up the quest i played some notes on a on a flute thing made rats jump off into a river which by the way completely unoriginal idea that's based off of a german folklore some dude would go to towns plays little magic pipe or whatever and uh make rats kill themselves who believed that one it says he like saved people from the black plague and all that but like he didn't no one got saved from the black plague so i finished the quest and i'm sitting there like why did that quest happen why was that developed what's the point and then i remembered oh there's a mini game uh rat pits that's a new mini game everyone gets to do it and technically rat pits is pvp content for it's called a punt you can bring your cat down and fight another player's cat sometimes to the death for a wager i think it's like 100 or 500 coins to 50k that's like the most up thing in the whole game not because it's cats killing each other but because this is the perfect solution to the dual arena destroy the dual arena tear it down remove the 50k cap so people can bet billions you eliminate all the scammers all the lures dude you have to fight with your cat that would be hilarious just picture a big streamer going down to the rat pits trying to get out of debt or you know he's just got bills to throw around just getting pissed at their pet cat that would be so good that'd be so much more exciting bring rat pits back dude feel like there's so many problems that would be solved through cat fights it'd be awesome hashtag rat pit's new duel arena let's get that let's get that going iron man can't do rad pits there's there's like money go myself this quest uh it's pointless you can give your cat a name and uh bet 50k on your cat to fight another cat remove the cap trust me what's the worst gonna happen i feel like no one has truly addressed this yet because everyone's too busy uh just smashing that moth space bar trying to get through it and uh i mean i approve of that as the guy who tries to advocate getting into quests and the lore spacebar the out of this quest dude good god it was just so frustrating doing this quest dude this was terrible i'll leave with this i know there's some jagex dudes who watch my videos and if you've made it this far i am willing to rewrite this quest as a side project i will redo rat catchers i will make this a great quest hit me up man and get this i'll do it for free this quest is just a smelly diaper in the corner that people have just kind of stepped around and ignored and occasionally you know trucked through when they absolutely had to let's let's make this a great quest because  that's all i got so uh [Music] you
