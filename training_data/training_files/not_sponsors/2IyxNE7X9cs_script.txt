now they've had a little time to recover from inktober I thought I'd share a sketchbook tour of all 31 drawings from inktober of 2018 but before I get into you're in need of a website check out our link below so the first time holds a special place in my heart because October 1st is not only the first day of October but it's also my birthday Lew and I spent the whole morning celebrating my 28th in our van Odie making pancakes and then spent the afternoon exploring Portugal's beautiful coastline I was a little nervous for the actual drawing because I'm still learning to draw at the moment in perspectives like this are challenging especially using only ink per the inktober tradition but looking back I'm proud both of the drawings and that this was the day I committed to a daily drawing challenge for the month of October we want to see more behind the scenes for this drawing we have an entire inktober playlist with videos from every other day of October so this drawing is the view we wake up to every morning in our van so usually the thing is full of dishes and it looks like a hurricane blew through nonetheless the kitchen is my favorite part of our entire Van Pelt from the beautiful tile ooh laid by hand for the custom cabinets for the curtains I stitched there are so many memories built into these walls and every time I stand there cooking or cleaning I try to remind myself of the months of effort we dedicated to make this dream a reality looking back at these illustrations now I can't believe what a wonderful tool drawing is to solidify memories it's like each one of these are a little time capsule that teleports me back to the exact moment I was drawing [Music] just where he was near [Music] cause I just [Music] and this one I remember so specifically the nervousness I had trying to draw the stairs because there was a tree blocking my view and it was one of the first times I took a artistic license to modify the scene in front of me instead of drying exactly what I could see I remember feeling my confidence grow as they explored a slimmer tipped pen to capture the ivy growing on the walls and my delight to be able to render the scene in less than an hour compared to some of the first drawings in the challenge that took almost three this sketch is probably one of the most precious ones to me when Lou and I first arrived at this empty parking lot on top of the mountain this beautiful huge dog came over to say hello she had a collar on so he assumed she lived nearby but for the rest of the afternoon she had felt like a part of our family a total cuddle monster and adorably curious I couldn't help but spend the next few hours sitting outside and sketching her there was something so profound about drawing a living creature unlike all the urban sketching I did the rest of the month it's definitely something I want to return to in the new year [Music] [Music] Koizumi just I'll never forget sitting on top of the castle walls looking down at the town below writing the voiceover for the day 13 video with Lou we would take breaks from writing to reminisce about our time in Cusco over three years earlier where our whole adventure started as content creators we talked about how he dreamt of coming into this town when we still were knee-deep in the van billed and used hypothetical future adventures as motivation to keep going even when we were exhausted it was like we were sitting there looking at everything we had hoped would happen and now it was all around us every day of inktober pushed me further out of my comfort zone whether I was drawing any perspective or a new type of tree had never drawn before but the rolling hills of Douro Valley took it to another level remember sitting out on this strange vantage point on the edge of the river looking off into a faraway sea of weaving grape vines trying to figure out a way to simplify all the lines I'm actually really happy with how this one turned out especially because just a few days later I ended up drawing close up of the grapevine as we explored the vineyards nearby drawing the same thing from different perspectives could be a really interesting concept for me to explore in the future [Music] I cherished the days that we take time to move slow first thing in the morning it might not happen often with the schedule we've created for ourselves but on this day it all fell into place we woke up and meditated I put water on to boil and set out some lemons and looking at our beautiful kitchen I realized that this was the perfect scene to capture us the day's illustration drawing this still life let me linger in the moment even longer and appreciate the life that we had built ourselves [Music] the only way I can describe this one is how adventurous days like this remind me of why we built OD in the first place arriving early in the morning barely prepared for the thousands of stairs we'd seen be hiking getting caught in a rainstorm drawing while watching a beautiful sunset with literal rainbows in the sky and then finishing the hike after dark only to get to enjoy the peace and quiet of an empty parking lot on top of a mountain Lew and I always joked the best thing we can do in the van is keep moving because it reminds us of how incredible OD really is he might not be a comfortable apartment there's no laundry no hot showers we might even run out of water but he is down for adventures and makes our life richer than we ever could have imagined [Music] a speech became our home much longer than we expected we lived here for over a week walking on this boardwalk enjoying the free showers by the beach in the cold air locking up the van and easing our way into the quiet city of Porto people always ask us where we sleep when we visit cities and I have to say taking the time to find a secluded spot with easy public transportation is always worth it so I'm not sure if we'll ever find something as wonderful as this cozy little spot in Miramar this book tour is getting a little long so I think I'll just end it here with its last drawing this past October was one of the most transformative for Lou and I in the van but he worked so hard to create all the think Tober content from the videos to the drawings and ultimately to creating our first scene it has been a really crazy time for us but I'm also so happy that we could share this adventure with you and one of gooey room offer code to get 10% off your first purchase and one last thing a big thank you to everyone that supported us buying a zine we've sold over one hundred and fifty this week and will now be shutting down the store as we head out west for a new adventure maybe we'll open again a new year
