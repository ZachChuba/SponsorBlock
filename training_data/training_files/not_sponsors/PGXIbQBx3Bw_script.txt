all in one place with Squarespace yes finishing Toba I'm super proud of myself because it's the first I've ever finished a daily drawing challenge I tried inktober last year I put some of the videos on my channel but after a week I was like I have too much work I can't handle this and so this year a night before inktober styles like I'm gonna do inktober and to remedy the fact that I can't keep up with really abstract prompts because I have other illustrative work to do I created my own prompts list randomly and I was like maybe a couple people following with me that'd be fun and hundreds of people follow along I was blown away by the support that everyone was giving us a sense of community that I had on Instagram was so cute there was like 15,000 posts on that hashtag which is crazy I don't know where I'm going to this all I know is that I'm just happy that I finish and I got to finish with so many other amazing people so for some reason I thought it would be a good idea to do one inktober video covering all of the process of October I don't know why I thought that like 31 paintings that's at least 31 minutes that's a really long video for like you to watch and for me to edit I have a few things to say before we start one I'm a disease called a pictorial archive of the world in my brain because I noticed that a lot of Mike Tobi's looked like old sepia tone images and it kind of was just like fragments of the world that's in my head that I create with my work so I wanted to release a little book it's a limited edition so if you want one maybe pause the video and get one the store link is in the description and I also released all of my originals so this is about the size and comparison to my head but it's a great way to support my channel if you want to and if you aren't before everyone asks these are the materials I use I will also leave the materials down below because you know I'm sure people ask if someone if you see someone else in the comments please let them know another excuse I forgot to film two of the prompts I think it was mustard and something else but I can't remember which one so if you see ones that like here's the here's the finish I'll work it's because I forgot to film it forgive me please there are a lot of paintings to do and film forgive me so the only challenge that I had set was to finish and I did it and I'm so proud of myself and the other challenge that I found while I was doing it was being able to have my work stand alone without color that was a big challenge for me but I really liked the outcome so I think success on both fronts Gomi Gomi i asked you guys on instagram if you had any questions for me for like the end of this video but since this video so long i think i'm just gonna answer the questions throughout the painting process i hope you liked it if you hate the sound of my voice mute it put up whatever you want to listen to on that all of the excuses that I have for this video that I can possibly think of to prevent anyone from being disappointed so without further ado let's just jump into it [Music] [Music] [Music] hello everyone its voiceover shot here I'm not gonna really explain what's going on in the videos because I think that it's quite obvious with the props what the things I was quite a literal promise which is why I think people liked it so much because it wasn't as abstract you didn't have to do so much concept ding and do something that was really crazy it was just literally about having fun painting so I'm not gonna explain it but if you do have any questions awesome below and I will answer you I promise ok let's start with some questions from the internet why did you choose to use a monochrome palette that's from me but this is a good one because I talk so much about how I moved away from being so desaturated and just let myself be colorful for the last couple years I felt so comfortable with my sense of color and playfulness in my work and I think that I decided to do sepia firstly because people complain last year that I did like lots of colors they said that it wasn't in court ever when it was really it was liquid watercolor but they're very similar mediums so I was like you know what I'm not gonna leave any room for error I'm gonna do actual ink and I was quite nervous because I was like can my work stand alone without color I'm happy to report that personally I really liked it I feel like I've really evolved in terms of like having a consistent style through a lot of my work that without color it's still mine and it was really really nice to see I don't think it would be something that I would have tried if I didn't do inktober this year so I'm really really happy I did it [Music] so there's a lot of questions about how to make time when you're doing you Toba a lot of people were like I'm really busy or what happens if you get sick or this or this or this and I think the answer to that is everyone's busy everyone needs to make time for it but a good way to do it is to kind of paint stuff in advance because that you will account for times where there's like unforce evil problems like a personal problem or if you just really don't have time that day or if you feel really demotivate and you don't feel like drawing it really accounts for that I would recommend painting ahead I think um the thing most people get caught up in with the inktober is staying on every day and I was traveling this month so it got kind of screwed up because I'm on a plane and then suddenly it was two days later like for example when we when we travel from America to Australia okay it's today will arrive when we get on the plane in two days so I accidentally like skip today and I didn't count for that and then I was two days behind for a long time but I was pretty chill about it I think people don't really mind it's still fun to keep up with everything but putting more pressure on yourself will mean the work is less fun and it means you're doing inktober because everyone else is doing it not because you enjoy it which sucks and I think with a publiced that I created it was it was literal enough for you to be able to create something that was just what the word was you could do something more but it was just like rock rocket there's two silhouettes birdhouse things you could literally just paint it if you couldn't think of something more crazy to paint you could literally just paint it I think that helped as well [Music] [Laughter] this is similar to one of the other questions but were you strict with once a day or did you do a batch of them in a few cities a lot of people have this question too and I did do a large number at one time because we were going to LA for 10 days and I didn't want to have to bring all my ink or my watercolor paper my setup for shooting [Music] this good I did like 12 paintings before I left and shot them and then when I got back I tried to keep up with them and did them in little batches just because for me it's really hard to keep up with doing illustration work and these everyday paintings and my main concern was being able to consistently post every day because that's something that I struggle with all of the time on all of my channels so I wasn't strict with one a day but I was strict with I wanted to be able to post everyday and be consistent with that how do you print and produce your scenes basically I don't go to a place that makes the scenes like I just go to a printing shop especially with Z's when it doesn't need to be like artist quality paper stock you can probably just Google printing place and they will do staple binding for you so if you find somebody to do some samples and test and make sure that it's good and you like it that's enough I don't know of any places it'll like we make scenes for people but I'm sure they're awesome I'm lucky enough to have Chris and Kim working with me and they are more proficient in prints than I am and so when I had any questions that I asked Kim I was like is this good and they were like yup this is great and Kim was in my ghako reaso printing vlog so you'll know them from that but basically if I had any questions at all and I needed someone to proof it I'm lucky that I have a team of people that know what they're doing and that have a good eye for cute stuff to be able to help me do that [Music] [Music] what app do you use to get that sketchy foggy look in some of your pictures if I don't really know that means but if you're talking about the grain I use vsco to add grain you can also do it on lightroom mobile for mobile but if you're talking about the little particles and like dust specks and so I just draw that by hand sometimes there's just no extort cut around that you just got to do it by hand [Music] have you ever joined dick Taub before but unable to finish it yes like every single time actually I've only joined in Tober once and that was last year I publicly did not finish it in front of everyone but no one complained you guys are so nice I was just like I'm gonna upload a video every day and do a painting every day when I have a millions of jobs on at the same time I don't know why I did that to myself to the point where I did a Paula's like should i do inktober this year and Chris was like he clicked know and then he messaged me and he was like no because last year I really stretched myself then I had all of his client work I was trying to upload a video every single day like foreing Toba and paint every day and it was just way too much work like I don't know why I did that I was a really silly I did [Music] how did you come up with the pros um I don't know if I can explain that because I literally just sat in my bed and was like here are the things that I would like to drill and then I made a list and I was like should I share this alright I'll share it and I shared it and people like well this is cool and then that's how it happened how did you manage to stay motivated and do an inktober each day of this month um even though I did it in batches I still struggled it's really hard to create every day because I painted it in batches I could basically just paint what I wanted to paint most in order of like how much I wanted to paint it so it wasn't like hey coat I drew nine ten eleven and twelve it was like I feel like doing twelve okay now I feel like doing nine you know I mean like I did it in order of what I felt like doing and that was really really helpful one thing that really really helped me was being publicly accountable which is great but it didn't feel like I was like oh I'm scared to post I'm scared that I'm not gonna do it because people will make fun of me or like people would be mad at me it wasn't that it was more like I wanted to be able to post because I had a whole community of hundreds of people doing the same prompt list with me and I was excited to share what I thought about the prompt and then see what they thought about it too so I think the sense of community that comes with inktober is really really motivating did you learn something unexpected from committing to October this year yes I learned that it's possible if I put my mind to it I can paint every day I can and that will help me when I'm like oh I feel like I want to make something but I have so much work on when really it only takes 20 to 30 minutes to paint something that looks good so I should just do it it just reinforce that idea of like just jump into it and who get done another thing is that my work can stand alone without color I know I've said that so many times already but it's really really was something that made me so happy because I I think I got so involved with this is my work my work is colorful my work is vibrant that I kind of put myself into that box and I didn't think that maybe it could also look good without it and still be playful without color but it can and I really really liked it [Music] [Music] how to deal with feeling like a piece is unfinished but if you work on it more it gets ruined I think you just have to try and realize that you can just do it again there were a couple of pieces for me that I didn't like the end result I think it was like two or three where I finished it and I was like I don't like it so I started again specifically the page one I don't know if I'm gonna show you the first image here because it's very graphic if you don't like pictures of like male anatomy don't look so my idea behind the page one was that it's it's like a little page that drops their leaf and it's their bum but the first one I did because of the shape of the page it looked like a ball sack and I was like to Chris should and also the ferb was like not soft it was like spiky so it looked like a stubbly pulse and I was like ugh should i redo this and I wasn't going to like I've got so much to do before we leave like I can't but then I looked at I was like I cannot post this on the internet but I guess I am now so enjoy so that burned into your retinas [Music] we'll zoom ever be restocked heck yeah I'm trying to restock zoom every time it sells up and it sells out pretty fast and then it takes two weeks to be able to get an order shipped back to me so it will be it will be restock soon I've just paid for a bunch more to come to my store so they'll be here in the next couple of weeks [Music] I've discovered many illustrators have their own color palette that works so well with them how did you find yours and is it hard to stick to with me colors not so much like I'm gonna use these colors like these are the ones that are gonna be in my work it's more like an intuitive process like I like I've used the colors that I like and I use color combinations that I love and I think when that's your brand when your brand is just the stuff that you like it's really easy to be able to change it up and try new things because people already like what you're doing because of your taste not necessarily like I like blue so I'm gonna follow this person cuz they can make a lot of blue work it's never like I need to stick within this range it's never like that for me I I think putting those restrictions on yourself can be very bad it can be very like crippling the creative process so I try not to do it ah disgust have such easiest concept to draw for a lot of the problems were really easy because when I made the prop list I could see what I was gonna paint in my header I had a really brief idea so and and it was quite a literal prop list but there were some difficult ones day and night were hard for me because I wanted to find a way to show it other than just being like a window or a landscape I wanted to find something that you could use during the day and something that you could use during the night but that had like a link and so I chose binoculars and telescopes a m-- but you use those things that generally at night and during the day so I thought that was a clever one and another hard one was fast because that was the only more abstract prompt that I added to the list that's one of my favorite ones so I'm glad that that I challenged myself [Music] do you feel accomplished would you do it again heck yeah I feel so good about myself right now I can't believe I finished like even till I see I was like am I gonna finish like am i and I did it I can't believe it but do I would I do it again yes I think I would if I don't have too much work on next year in October I would definitely do inktober again Chris I'm sorry if you're watching this but I probably will and if you guys want me to make another prompt list again I'm so happy to do that cuz it was so much fun I'm definitely gonna make one for myself if I do it but if you want me to share it again let me know [Music] [Music] which day was your favorite or most fun to paint I don't know I really just loved it I think I liked the ice cream truck a lot the birdhouse I liked the ice cream truck the birdhouse I like fast there was just so many that was so fun to paint I think overall I just had so much fun doing this [Music] would you consider doing another draw daily challenge for another month like Hugh vembur maybe if it was in July or something but the thing is like I like just finished the daily drawing challenge and I am exhausted from it so I'm not gonna jump straight into humour but also I want to like be able to do other things like paint for like shows or create stuff for my store and I can't do that when I'm drawing for every day so maybe not this year but Hugh member sounds so fun it's like choosing a color every day you're a kid and you paint something for that color like that's more on my alley I feel like [Music] what would you do differently next year I think I might use color next year and I don't think I'll use a shellacking because I don't like the I basically used a shellacking cuz it's what I had already in the studio but I don't think I'll use it again cuz it has kind of a satiny finish so when you paint something really really dark or really really pigmented it's a bit shiny and I don't love that finish this question's hardcore how are you successful in completing it this year when you haven't in the past again like it's just scaling it down smaller pieces less complex prompts less colour schemes and not filming it every single day like not posting a video every single day and not having as much creative work on [Music] this one [Music] how to stay motivated and creative even when you hate how your work turns out if you don't like what you've done start again like you don't need to it's not finished until you like it like either you need to decide that you don't like it and you throwing it away or you need to decide to start again and in the case of October when you have to post every day the only option that you have is to start again I mean you might get to a point where you're ok with it it's not perfect but that's better than not liking it you know what I mean and there were times that I threw away certain pieces like the letter one I found it really hard to paint like I had to do a couple of renditions but like not fully painted out look but I I didn't like how it turned out after the first few strokes I was like I'm starting again how do you edit your entries before posting them this one's a good one because the way that you show your work on the Internet is super super important you can be an excellent illustrator but if it's not something that's shareable if it's not something that people are gonna click on no one's gonna see it and that sucks I use two main apps so I shoot I shot all of my inktober on my phone which I thought was so good if you have a really good camera on your phone you can do it on your phone which I think you save so much time so much setup and it's easy just so you guys know I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 I also work with sounds on Buster's disclaimer but if the camera is amazing in it so I took all of my Tobi's on my phone and then I put them into Snapseed and kind of like equalize the lighting and then I brought it into visco added a grain added a slight filter so that every single one would look similar and then I posted it it's pretty easy like it sounds complex but when you're in the groove of it all it's so easy [Music] are you going to do a travel vlog from LA yes I was gonna post that mid month but I just did with the inktober stuff and with putting the zine together and wanting to put this video together to post after October I didn't have time to edit it so I do have footage and I will be making one [Music] [Music] [Music] what does your sketch process look like before jeez Pinterest or Google for reference not really most of these paintings would put were created freehand like from my head no sketching required no construction lines there was no like for most of them there was no reference photos I did use a reference photo for the Koala and I think I used a reference render for one other thing but I can't oh yeah for the bones because like it's really hard to draw anatomy without knowing what exactly it is but even then I wasn't like doing major sketches I literally did something else coaches I'll show you I'll show you some thumbnail sketches boom but mostly it was just from the top of my head which I thought was really liberating just like with the recent print vlog that I did where I was really struggling because I was planting everything out too much when I let myself just go free with a paintbrush and some ink like it really really felt great and I think that's just reinforcing that idea with me that that's what I should be doing for my process I try not to use Pinterest or Google too much and I especially don't try not to use anyone elses artwork like I never use anyone elses all look for reference I just use photographs and even then I'm doing sketches and then I'm basing the paintings off my sketches so it's never really truly from a photograph I think that's [Music] [Music] [Music] how did you avoid getting burnt out or if you did how did you overcome it I didn't get burnt out this time it was actually a really good experience so even though those times that were hard when I was feeling like I was struggling I would just think about like the end result like having a Zayn having the whole challenge finished like being able to say that I completed my goal those things really drove me through to the end of the challenge [Music] [Music] how do you feel about people using different mediums other than ink for inktober should be honest I don't really care about it I feel like I see in Tobin now as having developed into a daily prompt challenge more than an ink challenge I know people can be really grumpy about it but personally I don't really care I feel like if it's promoting you to create everyday do it if it's a new medium that you've never tried before definitely do it [Music] [Music] [Music] how do you stay so organized you produce such high-quality content all the time I'm really like not an organized person when it comes to deadlines like client deadlines yes I'm good at that when it comes to personal stuff like do we work for myself it starts to slip because I I find it easier to prioritize client work than I do my own work as a quality content I think it's more like me having an eye for what I want to produce I see my site I see my social medias like I finished my work that's it put it on the internet I see it as like my Instagram my YouTube they're all extensions of the work that I create so I want it to look cute I want it to be colorful vibrant happy I wanted to make I want all of the content that I produce to make people feel a certain way and I think that because that's naturally how I feel about social media I see it as like an extension of the world that I create with my work I just make things that I want to look at [Music] how do you feel confident posting your art every day for so many people to see ah I didn't think about that much I've been sharing my work on the internet since before my work was even work like I start sharing my work on tumblr before I even knew what the heck I was doing so it's kind of second nature to be able to share it another thing is I'm very very fortunate in that somehow I've managed to foster a really positive community online I don't know why but like on YouTube on Instagram everyone is just so enthusiastic and so positive that whenever I post something I'm like the main feeling I have is just being happy and proud of being like excited to share it with other people I've never had like a really really really really bad response that's really burnt me and I think when you're supportive to your audience whether it be just answering their questions or like if they're asking you to look at their work you look at it or do what you can if you have time to give back to them then I think the relationship that you'll have is a lot more healthy and a lot more caring and that will make it a lot easier to share all the time [Music] [Music] would you talk briefly about the production of a zine are you self printing we're not self printing because a lot of the numbers in my store now are in the hundreds it's just not smart it's not a good business to print myself I can have to staple it all myself it's just not it's not good like it takes a lot of time and it takes time away from me working Kym used to work for a printing place and they're printing the scenes for us so basically I just prepare all of the images i scan all of the paintings i design the front about covers put it all into an indesign file save it as a PDF and send it to the printer and then they handle all the binding and stuff like that [Music] how long did each one take you it depends some of them I started again in stopped ins and all that stuff some of them I stuck like the math one I did like the main bit of the mapping that I went to sleep and woke up and did the rest I was like I don't know why I did that but it must have been late I I guess what average they probably took about half an hour age I tried to keep it short and simple I didn't want it to be painful I think that's one of the things that helped me get through the inktober [Music] [Music] [Music] do you instantly have an idea for a topic what do you do if you hit a block for a day's topic because I've created the prompt list I kind of had an idea of what I wanted that to look like within the context of my work [Music] [Music] [Music] how do you get so many times in so much detail with one color of ink for your interval illustrations I think that kind of thing just comes from you understanding contrast understanding value understanding tones in your work I think it just comes with experience really I think a good way that you could do it is if you wanted to experiment with how many different tones you can get from one ink is watering it down doing swatches of different levels of pigment in the water and then ending it with like a full pigmented ink swatch and then you can really see like how different the times well I just played it by ear I think I'm very lucky and that I'm I've had enough experience and worked with enough different mediums to understand how color and tonal and value work within those mediums [Music] how do you tackle transferring physical illustrations into an inktober zine so I get this question a lot of how to take physical artwork and make it Instagram abou like ready for Instagram or ready for print and the thing that I do you can photograph it with a camera but I like to scan it just so that there's like a good level of sharpness and I make sure to bring down the exposure a little bit so that the paper is a little bit darker and so that all the details don't get lost in in the lighter Gray's and the stuff like that the lighter hues then I put it into Photoshop it's hard to explain it's just like a process that I have over time but you kind of itch out the image and then edit the levels of the actual image does that make sense it might not make sense maybe I'll make a video about it you let me know if you want to see that but it's basically just scanning it and editing it away the paper so that when it sits on white it's really just sitting online did you miss color so much that you would use it for notches on inktober yes yes I will [Music] hoping the zine might be available internationally prepares to throw money yes everything in my store is always available worldwide so if you're anywhere and you want to buy something from my store you can get it [Music] if you liked that video hope it really wasn't too long I'm not sure how interesting it would be because it's not like he's a different part of my life he's outside he's in my studio but it's just like here's the paper for 30 minutes if you liked it let me know and I might do more like painting videos but I don't know maybe you guys don't like that kind of thing I'm not sure hey I look at the end papers thank you every zenus over the kiss No thank you so much for like making it through this entire video if anyone's still watching um and yeah let me know what you thought below let me know what your favorite prompt was and what you liked your favorite part of my inktober inuring Toba and you're hauling Tober experience cuz I just love the sense of community I don't want it to end I don't want any Toba to end because I don't want people to stop like hanging out on the Internet [Music] this one [Music] you
