my name is Rebecca black and I sang at the song Friday this is that story it all started in 2010 I just finished up at the seventh alright agent so I was a whopping 13 years old I grew up being a huge musical leader kid I was that girl that was obsessed with glee and tried to sing the songs in my room I auditioned for everything that I could it was my home that was where I felt safe throughout moving schools and I don't know trying to figure out what I wanted to do going back into eighth grade I had noticed that a girl in my grade I was friends with had done this like music video was sort of a thing she shot it at the school it was a little cute song and she had friends in it I was like oh that's a cool opportunity to like try something new get experience and see what I liked so I asked this girl like hey how did you do that she had mentioned that it was through this little company it was this thing that like produced these songs for kids like my age teenagers so I brought it up to a mom one day like on a whim fully expecting her to say no my mom's a single mom so it's not like this stuff is just pouring out of the sky but to my surprise she said yeah we emailed the company met up with them that was my first time ever even seeing what any of that looks like they basically said we can write you a song put you in a music video if you get a hundred thousand views you can start making money per minute but at that point I was like okay there's no way that this little thing is gonna get any sort of attention so whatever like I just want the experience they send me a song and the first song was a song called superwoman about some boys superwoman and at that point I had just finished up my first relationship that lasted three days and I broke up with him because I was too afraid to talk to him so that clearly wasn't going to be the song that I was going to say I asked him to send me another one because I just didn't really feel comfortable they sent me a song called it's Friday and it was a cute little song of like waking up going to school and I was like yeah I do that this is this is it it wasn't even really about like what the song was about or planning for this big career debut because that just doesn't happen to me so I went in I did the whole feel of a recording process learning what it's even like I was kind of bad I knew that the music video was coming up in a couple weeks but I didn't even hear the song until I got on set for the music video I had no idea what really to expect it felt honestly kind of like we were all going over to my dad's house to do a project things were just kind of happening around me and it wasn't really like this big glamorous ordeal or anything like that I had gone to a forever 21 I got my outfit the day before I had invited a few of my friends I thought that would be a lot more fun than hiring anyone to like come hang out I remember doing that performance shot that's like on top of this little grass patch not knowing what to do with my arms so I think if you watch the video like I'm just digging and dancing like this for the whole time which god it was a fun day but also just kind of like okay this is what we're doing a month went by and honestly I had no idea where it was I was just kind of like thinking about it every once in a while like I wonder when I'll when I'll see you February 10th of 2011 I got a little notification from the company's website that the video was live I was really weirdly nervous I think I watched it alone for my first time what I really remember doing was afters maybe see it one time going to my dad and being like dad it's out and watching it together and my dad and I just being like yeah I told my friends that were in the video at school for a while like that was it I would get like one or two people at school that be like hey it's Friday I wouldn't really check it that much online I know that over the first month it had like maybe three thousand views or something one day which literally was a Friday I was on my way home from school and I got another little notification from the website hey this sucks but you're gonna be famous and I think they said that it was on a website called tosh point-o when I saw that I was just really confused I don't even think I told my mom or anything I like one straight to my room and was like what's going on I went to the video and it definitely had three times the amount of views that it had a few days ago comments were starting to come a bit more and they were definitely all making fun of me making fun of the song that immediately put the biggest pit in my stomach I've probably ever had I think at that point I was just like mom help she brought me into her room and I think I just started crying I mean it's not that I was protecting this thing as my like prized most beautiful creative thing I've ever made in my life but it was me and that was my face and that was my name people were making fun of my mom got on the phone with a people put the video up and they asked me if I wanted to take it down we could put it away this never happened it's just a blip and move on one thing that I just could not shake within myself was like no I don't want to put this down it's so much more embarrassing I think there was also this like fire in myself I'm not gonna let these people win that easy will bubble bubble bubble whoa I've been through this enough you want to fight let's go let's do this a few days go by and now at over million views that weekend my family and I were just kind of watching it build more and more rapidly my name was trending worldwide I remember I was walking down the street on Twitter and I was like oh my god Nick Jonas just saying my song at his show what I remember my first day back at school was probably one of the weirdest days of my life when like recess came about all of these people just like blocked my way because they were so curious with all of that going on my parents were trying to figure out how to handle like all of the incoming stuff now Good Morning America wants to talk about something and I just got asked to do The Tonight Show with Jay Leno I don't even think I knew what a manager was at that time of course they were coming to my parents saying we're gonna change your life and my mommy and do all these things at this point as well I had stopped going to the school I was at public school and I stepped into home schooling to finish the year I come from a family of doctors who expect nothing about literally greatness from you and I was getting all these crazy opportunities you know spend the day doing this and then spent a day going and working with this person and doing all of these crazy things my grades were horrible on top of that yeah kids were mean I'd walk down the hallways and it was just this like weird persnickety like very few people were laughing with me I was like this would all just be so much easier if I could not be so nervous about it all the time as much as like I wanted to keep my friends and how much I needed them at that point I think both me and those friends cut each other off because we were young and petty and yeah I don't know if there's one person to blame but I I think I isolated myself like while also being isolated the craziest thing about while all of this was going on and all this like weird attention was coming I got to do some of the coolest things that I've ever done I got to work with Katy Perry who at that point was like my idol not only just work with her but like have her have my back I got to go to award shows and Redcar friends and do the whole thing I won a Teen Choice Award hosting YouTube rewind and being the number one googled thing that year which is insane so 2011 definitely ended up being the weirdest year of my life it was one of the best and obviously one of the worst and so life went on it was kind of like what what happens now 2012 was one of the darkest years for me I was 15 and I had no friends and I was super alone and at that point like you would think having like a team and all these things makes everything so much better but all it was were just people who didn't care to understand what I wanted didn't want to hear it if anything that was just interrupting their plan for who I was going to be and when you're that young no one should be telling you anything like that you've got to figure it out for yourself when I was 16 I fired everyone in my team and my parents were like you should go back to club work school so I did and at that point I started a YouTube channel and that was one of the most freeing things I'd ever done for myself because I got to talk I wanted I was editing all my own stuff I was making so many friends that loved what I loved - and also covering things and just I don't know I let myself fly the first thing that I like really released on my own was a few years ago in 2016 and that was horrifying leading up to it to have to put out so I was like like this is something I actually like it is real it is genuine it came for me wrote written for me so now my days look like me constantly writing music and coming up with what is gonna happen next I put out a song called anyway this last year that I love so much and has been really fun to do and I'm just about to put out another song called do you I know when I look back when I'm you know hopefully old and I've had a whole life that I can be like yeah okay I did that for myself I'm about to go on tour this summer opening up it's my first like real full-fledged music tour I guess I'll see you around the internet or maybe see you untoward bye [Music]
