Wagyu beef sliders with truffle cheese and truffle butter oh my god it's simple it's simple so it's beef ground beef leg you ground beef it's Wagyu ground beef it's on Hawaiian rolls with with truffle cheese and and an int ruffle butter on the top of these rolls and they'll cook in the pizza oven and they'll pull apart and you'll eat them and you'll just want to go what the heck is going on here there's no bad element in this Hawaiian rolls check wedge you ground beef check truffle cheese check stand there black truffle butter spread let me tell you something about truffle butter let me tell you something about truffle in general there's a richness there's an amazing this there's I'll talk about whether this could be this or truffle oil or whatever but oh holy crap but check out how this is gonna go down we're starting off with Hawaiian rolls so look mmm little Hawaiian rolls so great we're gonna build this in my that we're cooking on the roof of my building today and it's a little unorganized but it's gonna be fine we're gonna be okay we've got terrible sunlight but we're in a beautiful spot but we're gonna take these Hawaiian rolls and put them in this cast-iron pan and then build everything on top of it it's gonna be perfect watch party food Jack Ryan season 2 all the way baby all the way we cook okay let me just get the the Hawaiian rolls in the skillet we'll go from there so here's the plan I would normally do this in like a look like a 13 by 8 or whatever it is baking dish you could just do this whole section here and it would be fine but I like the idea of the the cast iron so I'm gonna break these guys and then I'm gonna cut them in half because we only want to start with the bottom right so now we start to put the bottoms in here do I need this piece I do oh these Hawaiian sweet rolls are so good so we're gonna go like this okay is your old pops only bottoms in the bottom that doesn't make sense right I mean look at this is not a perfect situation without the brightness out here the lights Cremonese goes in what do you say how's that 2 4 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 in here you cool with that I'm cool with that all right let's no let me move this and then we're gonna add a layer of mayo okay it's like it can't fit any more in here maybe one more look I can put two more in one two there we go everybody happy okay all right now we're gonna add Mayo Japanese Mayo will just spread this oh sweet okay max it's ground beef time what we're using is Wagyu ground beef look it's becoming way more popular yes it's a little more expensive but the fat the deliciousness of it is something to behold stay down something to behold we're going on the Evo little oil little seasoning cook it quickly then we go into the next step and we start with some oil on the evo and the beef and max what do we do we don't mix we break it up it's about a pound and a half let it start to do its thing it gets a little Montreal steak seasoning because I love the flavor of this and it just sort of makes everything super beefy and we do this this is gonna do about 18 Hawaiian rolls so think about it one batch of this feeds 18 well I won't say feeds 18 people could feed nine people getting to each six people getting three each eighteen people getting one each you can do that Matt and I like to keep it just a little bit on the pink side because it's going in the oven so let's take it off and put it on the wine rolls with the Mayo and we go look how easy this is look what do you want to be doing you want to be standing in the kitchen for hours or do you want to be binge watching the hell out of Jack Ryan's so this gets spread out all the way around beautiful okay ready for next steps two things one we're gonna put a pan on the heat to start it getting warm right there to start heating but next is cheese our cheese of choice is truffle cheese you can see the little bits of black truffle in here you know what this is a great one because it's truffle II a bit but it's not over the top and this piece which was hang on which was 3/4 of a pound was nine bucks so it's not crazy it's just delicious and will add so much to this here's what we do we grate over the top right on there beef come on and away we go or as they say at the racetrack here in Del Mar and way they go so you want cheese everywhere just spread it around huh don't be shy look if I use all of this what's the big deal I'm making 18 of these things didn't we determine that truffle heaven man I just want good coverage so I might use extra I might use more than you would use but here's what you do you have a binge watching party you make one thing the people that come make one thing it's the way to go you shouldn't have to take on all the work yourself but you do want to be the person that makes the one thing the people like oh damn snap sign that was amazing so make your one thing a really damn good one thing and I think John Krasinski would appreciate you making this okay look at that is that perfect look I've used all the cheese okay love it now we top it we top with the Hawaiian rolls but I realized the problem I have no idea I cannot see where the is or where these other guys are in here I cannot see where their bottom counterparts are so I may have to add more Hawaiian rolls than I used bottoms I may have to use more tops than I use bottoms but I think that might be okay well maybe not how's that look awesome it's great one more thing our pans on the heat now we take our black truffle butter a big ol scoop of it then it goes and we let it melt wow that's the most crazy crazy doesn't it it really does Oh find a little more just let it do its thing and when it's all melty nice let's brush it on top of the rolls and do we go do you know how good these are gonna be okay the little flecks of truffle truffles are really expensive and a truffle cheese or a truffle butter like this is a really good way not crazy expensive way to get all the deliciousness without spending the big big bucks just trying to get some of these black flecks the aroma is crazy of course when something warms up it gets even better and now just because I've got this extra butter I'll just drizzle a little bit of it in between here I mean why is that a bad thing truffle butter on truffle cheese come on oh man Mac's ready into the oven wait did I say oven I meant pizza oven Mac's in they go and I think this is about three hundred three and a quarter so we're gonna leave it until the cheese gets melty the rolls get warm and start to do their thing and look you can eat them right now the beef is cooked but you want all this to get the benefit of the heat of the oven so put it in shut the door and wait till it's ready hey I got it and when they're ready out they come and perfection and let's get one if we can figure out one to get oh boy oh boy Wow holy smokes man look at that the melty cheese the the truffle from here please can have a bite please it's heaven look at this and all right I don't know if it's the Wagyu beef if it's if it's the the Mayo if it's the truffle cheese or the truffle butter over the top but this thing could make me steal secrets for the United States of America and the CIA it could and I might have Jack Ryan on my ass but you know what I'd be happy as a pig in you know what does we say thanks for watching
