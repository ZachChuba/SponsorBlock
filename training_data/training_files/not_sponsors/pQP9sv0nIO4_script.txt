So I've been playing BO4 recently,... UH OH NORMIE ALERT IDIOT ALERT FUCKING LOSER ALERT UUUGHGHGU EVERY GAME HE PLAYS ISN'T AN INDIE GAME FUCKING KILL HIM KILL HIM and uhhh... I'm sorry to say this but the game is actually really fun I know COD kinda of has this overall history to it where if you play it nowadays you're looked at as kinda sewer man *BUUGH* but overall I'm having so much fun with this one Now keep in mind with this video, I never own BO3 so some of the features in BO4 that might have been implemented in BO3 I didn't know about so it's all new to me. Just keep that in mind. I did play a little bit of BO3 multiplayer in a friend's house but maybe after two or three hours i put the controller down and decided "That was enough of that". Like I said previously I didn't really dive into all of its mechanics and features, I just couldn't enjoy the wall jumping and running and jetpacking and (pff) whatever all that shit was. Thank god that stuff isn't in the multiplayer in BO4. But that doesn't mean that this game didn't come with a hefty amount of changes. For starters, you don't regenerate health over time like in every other COD game before this. You now have a healing syringe on a cooldown, which is honestly a very good gameplay change. The usual flow of COD gameplay before this was shoot a guy and if you happen to get some strawberry jam on your face, just lay down relax and wait for it to go away before you go and shoot the next guy. That is entirely different now. It's now a choice if you wanna heal or reload your weapon because both take up pretty good amount of time. That combine with the longest time to kill in COD history makes a gameplay that feels so unique and fresh. And with all of that, it also seems a little more difficult overall to get kill streaks. I've played a few hundreds matches of the multiplayer and I have seen TWO gunships and one came out of my loot crate. (too tired to continue subtitling)
