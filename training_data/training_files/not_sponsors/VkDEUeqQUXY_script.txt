hey hey hey lighten up baby could do some tech news a and B had already softened Intel up after the launch of their rise in 3000 series processors but team red is now preparing the knockout punch this is a very very slow boxing match yesterday AMD officially unveiled the first to third gen thread Ripper CPUs the 24 Core 48 thread 39 60 X for $13.99 US dollars and the 32 core 64 thread 39 70 X for 2 grand they're going to launch on November 25th alongside the new king of the mainstream rise lineup the Verizon 939 50 X the first 16 core mainstream desktop processor AMD says that despite the high core count it will still offer the highest single thread performance of any rise in CPU while keeping the same 105 watt TDP of their other high spec rise ins and if some leaked Geekbench members are to be believed the 39 50 X even beats Intel's 10th gen h EDT part the Cry 9 10 9 8 exe in both single and multi core performance despite having to fear course Wow but guys let's not forget the real star of the show here the Athlon 3000 G this $49 dual-core quad threaded part is going to shred everyone else in its price point when it launches on November 19th look guys just because you think it can't doesn't mean it won't never underestimate the little guy that's right US carriers t-mobile and Sprint have been trying to get approval for their merger for a year and a half and now they're trying to sweeten the deal with a bunch of promises that they'll be able to fulfill if regulators let it go through the two companies announced that after their merger they will offer free home internet to ten million low-income households for five years and throw in a free tablet or laptop although they'll only have a hundred gigs of data per year the new t-mobile as the company will appear really be called we'll also offer free unlimited 5g access to every public and nonprofit US state and local police fire and EMS agency and we will provide a new $15 per month prepaid plan with two gigs of data now the merger has been approved by the federal government but it currently faces 16 lawsuits from various states concerned about the move reducing competition as the number of nationwide wireless carriers would go from 4 down to 3 that is a 25 percent reduction as a reminder of what a lack of competition can lead to AT&T recently gave its mobile share customers an extra 15 gigs of data along with a $10 price increase BOM that you can't opt out of well at least we'll get some free stuff on our way down the slippery slope and this week saw the release of some interesting AI tools research nonprofit open AI has made the text generating GPT 2 software available to the public the system can actually write articles based on a human prompt that are impressively well formulated even if they are mostly inaccurate seems like it learned too much from the humans it was a Iying based on so research with GPT 2 showed that humans find its outputs convincing so it's been described as something of a fake news generator opening I previously said that the tool was simply too dangerous to release to the public I mean think of the Facebook posts but now they say that there was no evidence of misuse in their research well I guess not yet anyway in slightly more optimistic news Google released two teachable machine 2.0 this week which lets users train an AI using images video and audio for custom machine learning applications so maybe we could like train an AI to detect whether an article was written by an AI you know keep them focused on each other so that way like Skynet never happens matrix now it's time for the crunchy crunchy buns why are they called bad crunchy stains cloud gaming service might be more complicated than a simple competitor to Google stadia or X cloud the latest Steam client beta makes reference to steam cloud gaming supporting multiple other cloud providers including NVIDIA GeForce now game streaming service so then what is it called when

now Dell promised that you would be able to upgrade and now you can you can stick in an RT X 20 70 or 2080 along with a new cooler if you so choose the 51 M was already available with those GPU options but the upgrades are available for those who bought a lower tier model of one of the beefiest gaming laptops ever and then only realized later that they had a bunch of money burning a hole in their pocket that's just bad planning yesterday tons of people in the US and Canada received text messages that had been sent way back in February and had been presumed to be lost in the ether carriers say that the glitch was caused by message service provider sin averse man that's that's a great name for the AI that takes over the world isn't it while the company was performing internal maintenance more than a hundred and fifty thousand previously undelivered messages were sent so if you got a message from your ex or whatever don't reply they still don't do this interview in an interview this week Bill Gates said that Windows Phone could have been the dominant mobile operating system if it wasn't for those darn kids except that he was actually talking about an antitrust investigation that Microsoft faced in the early 2000s when Android was taking hold that might actually be true or it might be that bill was just in a sour mood from having to deal with all the people
