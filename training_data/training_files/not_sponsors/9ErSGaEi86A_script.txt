hiding there behind the the scrub and this should be interesting it's got no clue what's about to happen oh there we go so good morning everyone today we're going to be taking thor's group out i've been asked quite a few times lately about the pride and one of the questions was how do they change from being these youngsters to these teenagers and then now what they are is these adults do i see or notice any distinct behavioral changes and i think that is a good topic of conversation and that is what i'll be talking about in this little video today i'm not sure if you can see that guys running down the road it's a black back jackal the jackal on this farm will not run down the road like this they will just zoot off into the bush which i think he is just done there he is just behind that green bush to the left of that green bush not sure you can see him on this camera blended nicely into the shade a little black back jackal not such a little one actually that's quite a big one all right so there was a really cool sighting of a black back jackal um it is one of our little carnivores that hang out here on the farm it's a heavily persecuted animal around south africa and further north and the reason being is farmers see jackals as pests all right so arriving at the enclosures and i want you guys to watch how the lions how the lions get excited about what's about to happen so they kind of know and they see our approach and you'll see they'll all be kind of doing nothing and then there's this realization we're going for a walk who's excited about going who's excited look at all of you do you think these lions know it's about to go down hey i think they do but you know it's always the girls to arrive first but here comes charlie thor is the last one for a change anyway let's let these let's let these puppy dogs out all right please don't eat my camera can't use the camera don't knock the camera over hello big boy [Music] they are having a blast lions on the rock lions on lions rock i love it up there hello jib hello jib oh yeah and down she goes oh up she goes oh oh that's cool just don't jump on me [Music] i'd be a flat pancake [Music] rallying around in the doodoo oh we let the lions do their thing [Music] and he's just really going mad [Music] never a dull moment these guys have so much energy and it's actually quite warm now um it's not as cold as it was the days are really really nice really really pleasant but [Music] yeah we've got this temperature fluctuation between very very chilly in the morning where you dress like a snowman and then suddenly temperature just goes soaring and we got these midday highs of about 25 degrees so not unpleasant to to be here hello boy oh let charlie be grumpy over his doo doo so i told charlie does charlie brown um thor doesn't really care much for stealing that he just wants to be a lion mark his territory oh these guys are crazy crazy kids not such kids anymore all right so might as well start talking about the transitions and what are those behavioral changes in terms of not um not in terms of their characters like and meet the characters not in terms of what would what's charlie's character like or what's thor's character like it's not what i'm talking about here what i'm talking about here is behavioral changes when a lion goes from um cub to teenager is a marked change and then from teenager to adult so we'll address first cup to a teenager so there's very many similarities between humans and lions in this regard one of my friend's kids when he started hitting 12 13 it suddenly wasn't cool for dad to give him a kiss or a hug when you dropped him at school and that that was a telltale sign of some of the changes so you know where's all of his life no problem all of his school career no problem you'd always give a hug and a kiss now suddenly he's telling his dad no that's not cool and so when you're talking about a cub turning it into a teenage lion um suddenly things that they used to love as carbs they don't really enjoy anymore so it could even be some of the things that you did for affection blowing in their face or um you know tickling them under the chin or touching them in a particular place on their body and they used to enjoy that thoroughly and now suddenly um that's not cool so that's one example where the cubs become teenagers she's seen something look at those ears okay matches off okay so i think we can all get what i'm saying about that change between being this kid that is tolerant of everyone and is friendly towards everyone and there's no problems no issues and then suddenly they start to become more picky they start to become more selective now it's the same thing with these guys so when they go from cup to teenager now in the lion's case cup to teenagers about two one and off two and we have jubjub hiding there behind the scrub and this should be interesting let's see what she does and he's got no clue what's about to happen i'm going to stick on her but no yes nothing no foiled foiled oh there we go i love that play there's another example so thank you girls for demonstrating that because what actually transpires from cub to teenager is that suddenly we too cool to play like cubs anymore so cubs every time you would be around them or take them out these cubs are always always playing and you guys are not demonstrating adult qualities now they're demonstrating cup qualities but i will get to that let's just play so wonderful to see okay what's cool is luck humans have become adults they run out of energy a lot quicker than the youngsters so you can see already they're starting to slow down to a kevin pace which is wonderful all the girls are here hormones didn't touch on that one why the behavioral change hormones ah sexual maturity testosterone over supply of eastern progesterone all of these hormones in males and females that start to come into their own and normally when those awkward little teenagers those ones are the mohawks i'm talking about male lions here not humans um and if you can relate to humans the teenagers are starting to grow this stuff on their faces it's like almost like a bum fluff and it's not quite filling out properly you know a little bit on the top lip a little bit on on the chin and some scraggly patches on the cheeks please uh youngsters who follow me don't unfollow me now because i'm i'm you think i'm taking the puss i'm not if you look at lions and you see young lions and they've got these mohawks and they've got a little bit of cheek hair and you know there's not quite a lot of main hair on the on the on the shoulder you'll see charlie now as he walks by you're going to see he's got nice full mane on his side there by his shoulder it's even filling out even more um but he's got a nice full main now if i look back to when he was two years old charlie at the scraggly mane again teenagers are starting to go through these awkward phases in their life they start to act bizarre and weird too and they're starting to find out who they are guys they're starting to figure out who they are in this world as are these these guys these guys are starting to say hey who am i what is my purpose here and so they do it with each other they're starting to figure out who they are with each other it takes nothing away from the personality type of these four lionesses that i'm following now nothing away from their personalities their personality types still bubble through from time to time but while they're going through this awkward teenage phase they can be tricky and i'll tell you why i say that why they become tricky is they start to push the boundaries now when you see teenage humans pushing the boundaries and the parents are going oh i don't know what's got into so-and-so she never or he never used to uh back chat back chat what these lions back chatting never ever why would these lions back chat never never never but they do so when they get to 18 months two years of age they start to back chat so when you say hey uh nesh do you want to get in the the vehicle and there she says no kev i want what's in your meat bag and so she challenges you and she says give me your meat and i say no nez you know the rules you can't have the mute its mind possessions nine tenths of the law in the lion pride and then they're going yeah yeah yeah we know that but we're breaking we're breaking the rules um and that's what teenagers do so teenagers break the rules they do naughty things what's happening with these lions is they are really going through a complicated phase in their life and then what the average folk out there would go and say is you know what these lions are gone cuckoo and we're not i'm not i'm not going to work with that line anymore or that line has got an attitude or that line's got an issue now imagine if we had to say that about a human you know what i'm writing that human being off because he or she has an attitude he or she has an issue so you know what i'm not i'm not uh i'm a part of this i'm done i'm out here can't do that can we and nor should we with these guys so what needs to happen is you actually just need to nurture them through their teenagers and uh then they they change into the next phase and the next phase being from teenager or adolescent to adult and you're gonna take me right through the felt yeah okay let's go let's go like that adventurous adventurous let's go come on um the the change from that adolescence into adulthood is not as mocked it's a little bit more subtle but it's still there uh the change you will notice you will be there you'll you'll come there one day and you'll you'll look at this group and you'll go you know what you guys have matured and you can just see the look you can see it in their faces you could see it in their body language you could see it in everything that they do you can see it even in the way that they conduct their behavior amongst themselves um yeah i think that is the telltale sign [Music] this has been one hell of a walk oh it's been one of the walks that has certainly put in a lot of steps from my perspective and now whoa look at that sure [Music] oh [Music] [Music] there's easier ways to get a drink niche you're wet you're wet look at you this line is a crazy catch [Music] guys yeah as you can see the lions thought i really enjoy going on these walks but i do too to be honest it's really good to get outside kind of smaller roses so to speak and you know just when you having a down day like some of us do have especially during this crazy times or these crazy times that we're living in going on a good walk with your dog in this case with some lions is uh is refreshing it's good for the soul it's uh soul enriching medicine so yeah i always say on my instagram go outside hug a tree i literally mean it i i do hug trees so um i take tree hugging to the next level i love being outdoors in nature it's my life it's my my god-given gift actually um it's a blessing there's no doubt about that and it is a blessing to be able to spend time with these animals and look at that like good cats all walking back with me home please do subscribe and then animals lives from myself and pause group until next time bye [Music] you
