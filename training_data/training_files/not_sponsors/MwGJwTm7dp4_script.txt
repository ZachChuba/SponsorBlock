ladies and gentlemen welcome back to another episode of RL crafts where we have been scientifically measured to have me talk in an episode twice as much as zine so not true it was three times as much was it actually 75 to 25% was it really bad I honestly like I didn't see I saw commentary towards that effect I don't know that I saw methodology so it could be that it was anecdotal and incorrect so I feel like you're taking this to heart you know a little too much to heart all right because I think you talk just the right amount for me like I appreciate what you do and I'm glad you're here thanks man I appreciate you too hey so I have a lot of levels and I had some thoughts between the last episode and this one as to like things that I could do with those levels and stuff that could be kind of nifty and and pretty cool and stuff so yeah it could be pretty cool yeah yeah you know you know so I had thoughts basically first off I think that the lifesteal enchant just doesn't work on the great sword that I had and that's kind of disappointing to me fortunately I have the region but I want to try vampirism but what I also have is I have these totems of undying and I can't use them and hold them in my off hand when use them great sword because the great swords two-handed so I switched over the rapier is doing a little bit of testing of values and things like that seem like the rapier as long as they are unarmored there's pretty much the same amount of damage because of the 200 bonus as the great sword so I want to I want to just deck out this rapier and put vamper ISM on it I also want to put ash destroyer because ash destroyer deals extra damage if the enemy is on fire and we use the fiery swords all right all right yeah so I figured it could be pretty dope you know okay sounds like a plan how's dragon stuff going for you though I'm fighting a giant Bert oh is that a man how okay there was a pelican yeah there was it was birds of prey I have there we go there was an evil pallet a pelican and [Music] some pterodactyl but the Dragons are looking mighty fine beefy boys yours is adorably cute and small oh my god and mine is the guy who prioritized all of his freaking dragon money mine is absolutely ginormous but that said I think I after we finished last time I collected some bones and stuff for you so you could make some dragon meals to catch yours up oh that's very nice of you to do but I'm going to acquire is a sharpness three on a sword and then I'm going to grind that in order to apply sharpness four to my dragon bone thing and yes this is going to be very good I would have to say oh I have six dragon meals ready for you that's what it is oh six okay it's something it's just something it's a lot of something those dragon meals go a long way yeah I do they I think so I don't know I mean they they do a little bit of things they do a little bit of things can we we can't take our dragons into the end can we I don't know how yeah because of the dragon horn I was like I don't know how you get them through the portal but if we put them in the dragon horn then it seems like something we could do it's a little on the risky side given that I can't we know here to feed the cows and accidentally had my sword selected so i right-clicked and sprayed fire but it's okay the herd needed some coing anyway um okay here we go let's make this sword and absolute units and ash destroyer actually wait wait wait I should level up a thing before I do this what are there any attributes that I should level up more do you think I've been working on mine but you should take yours to whatever level you want I don't know I I don't actually know like what you need like I was looking at some of the the skill points and stuff like that and kind of getting those but nothing major I mean if I leveled up mining I guess I could work towards being able to use dragon pickaxe and stuff which could improve yeah that brings me up okay cool and then I can just apply I can't do subject mathematics cuz the sword ah it already has sharpness so that's why we can no do that but these pay is very nice it's so big the vitality I could put on the pantaloons he's so big no I don't want to just give him ten so that I go to stage 5 but I think Jordan would complain if I would suddenly give those all to him yeah no don't do that I'll leave I'll leave I have 13 for you now I fed Steve one so that he wasn't hungry but I have 13 for you thank you dude what do I put vitality on the vitality and I actually know what it goes on there at your feet well thank you oh it can't go on protection simultaneously that's no 100 I can put it there we have tools for bubbles I see didn't I make that reforging station at one point accidentally isn't that alright some iron I can put it in I can put this enchantment called vitality one on my chest plate but when I put it on it says vitality enchantment level dot zero that doesn't seem good I don't know what that means it means you need so I'm gonna do it cuz why not you know why not alright let me see if this I might speed ahead let's see like the old life Steel Works if I can find any monsters in in the forest actually know what's going down in the mine alright so this I don't know that I think this might be just causing me problems I don't know that this is helping you know but I was also looking at and we have all this so maybe like isn't this an actual bottle rather than something I use I think that lifesteal doesn't work lifesteal and vamper isn't like just don't work for me that would be very unfortunate I think it'd actually be that way no can't do it cuz they just a whole bunch of damage and it didn't give me any extra hearts aren't they just to refill when you're missing hearts what do you mean wait no like I'm missing hearts oh my chest plate gives me extra heart so it's an easy thing I can do is I can take off my chest plate and then it removes two of my hearts that don't instantly regen and then I can hit a mob and it doesn't give me any health it's so weird yeah it might be that maybe when you're you have extra hearts it's coded into a maximum of like ten hearts and beyond that it thinks that you're full and doesn't regen you or something I can't think of any other reason why and maybe the maybe the like a Knights mobs thing like doesn't have that coded in could be vampirism that's cool is useless much like diamond pickaxe that doesn't work there all right let's see what are we at here Jesus man 585 how big do they go Oh big can you go that's not five fifty four all right baby Yoda is bigger but still not quite as big I feel like they're gonna be bigger than the Enderdragon actually did I not say diamond ho did I say something else yeah diamond Josias --less I didn't I didn't mean to say the wrong thing how is our cow how's our cow breeding going do we need more densely pounders I just spread them like a half minute ago okay oh yeah a few more so if you still have a ton of levels I made a thing that we can you can tweak up a little bit I can tweak up you've been nice both of those angry I wonder if I could like I could try for the little hearty instead of the half-hearted yeah I have something to use levels with what is it it is a it's a reforestation okay and it will it's it's kind of it basically works the same way as the one you're used to with the weapons except it works on your bubbles and it uses XP Oh your but it seems like all of them are positive I didn't find any actual negative ones it's just kind of cycling through either they the ones they didn't have like I my balloon now gives me plus an extra heart okay both of my both of my rings are plus 6% attack damage Oh plus 6% okay cuz I I have I have stuff here and like I have on my all my baubles are actually good my wild potion ring is 2% attack speed then I have a plus 1/2 heart plus 3% projectile but it sounds like you can go higher than that yeah I've got I've got a half heart I've got a full heart and then I'm up I've got a 4% attack speed and a 6% attack damage okay 4% speed so anyway it's this pile of stuff right there and it's like I said it's just oh so it already it shows what's on you already cool yeah yeah actually it was like oh this is kind of nice nothing too terrible there okay one level we forage plus one armor huh I don't know like what's good and what's not yeah I wasn't sure like one was like an armor toughness and another one was just plus one armor and I don't know what like of that I have no idea which is better or worse or yes half a heart 3% damage resistance there's have projectile damage okay doesn't allow armor okay plus 8% is apparently the best 8% of just I mean and all those are why does that cost three low I did some things cost way more than others some things cost some more I think to remove based on what's on there no well I'm just spence reforge to the exact same thing oops nice nailed it what you get I took I took off my thing that was half-hearted oh right it and got full hearted plus two armor that's good whoa what the dad it's flat why is everything flashing Oh oh noes you've got that it's it just press press three okay I just toggled it it freaked out who's freaking out on me yeah when you when you take it off put it back on it's like oh god no home.they so wait I have okay I can do extra armor then for sure rip reforge to no modifier perfect I don't need more speed I don't need more I never got that like it's it's amazing that you always manage to find these negatives yeah I don't know how I managed to do that it's very impressive that's Mary Mary Oh two percent attack damage I'll take that uh most of mine are six percent attack damage okay two percents not that great cool well I got another half heart so I am half heart half heart half heart three percent but I did get a three percent projectile damage plus two armors that's gotta count for something right that definitely counts for something why are you so why do you see me there I'm I get more good stuff then kazeem just puts out better karma into the world we all know it wow that's accurate yeah come on give me that last heart maybe maybe she maybe she won't she ain't gonna whoa you know it'd be really cool if we could bring the you know the thing likely where you right-click crops and it just harvest when Lee and leaves the seeds so shavax see that son of a beast intentionally disable that what because it bypasses the farming check in the the abilities thing where you need to gather like for farming or whatever it's by pasts without that and so he disabled it and I was like you were a monster what I was gonna say though is that should just be vanilla minecraft yes I would agree with that Oh what was that was that a geo knock from plants basically yeah that's that's a good way to it's exact same type thing yes I've never had that happen in somehow and I've harvested a good bit oh I I had it happen and enduring weaker times and I died a very very death exactly death I think I saw that actually the the weed murdered me I believe I was there for that no heat rose up and was like huge cow [Music] not the gumdrop buttons what is that Shrek actually oh really yeah it's been a while been a while for Shrek huh it has actually when was that like 99 or something the original one thanks I just we all bill older for that thank you not a problem I think I speak for everyone when I say thanks and I can't tell if I'm getting boomer for having seen Shrek or not getting Shrek I'm not sure which one in which direction it's going anyway now I need your help though here what's what's this whole Zoomer thing where's the Zoomer come in wait do you actually not know what Zoomer is yeah Oh gen Z so the Z zoom okay okay that makes sense like I just hadn't made the connection I I didn't know if you were just saying so what's the deal with Zoomers like what's the deal with airline food you know I didn't know if it was that or if it was you actually like not knowing old Jerry Seinfeld on us yeah dude will you come sleep oh I know if you insist man those cows are a little there's something over there mm-hmm there's something all right what are you saying you hear them yes I do I because I turned off Friendly's we don't have bones so that's a thing I use them all to give them to make those yeah dragon meals for you I see that ya know for sure for sure I was just I got more stuff I'm mostly just going for levels right now but I just wanted to see if I'd be able to make more dragon meals we need the bones for uhm we do hopefully the nd Dragon will drop mad bones angry bones oh my gosh you're an absolutely unit I know I am your your guy is getting pretty big you are too dude you're like you're like you've got four foot wide biceps on a four foot tall frame it's you know what's interesting actually is I I measured my bicep like the other week in comparison to what the average bicep is and my bicep circumference is only marginally larger than like the average male bicep and I don't know if that is because like ah is it because there is a lot of people who are bigger and it's not all muscle and therefore like you're gonna have a bigger arm that kind of offsets that yes I would say that's true like I mean I can think of plenty of guys who have wide broad arms but it's like they don't have you know it's not sheer muscle for them so I think that's a good I wonder if there's like a bicep to waist ratio or something that would be a an indicator right you know reflects you know I want something that reflects work that's been put in yes what's my bicep to forefoot frame ratio yeah dude bicep to waist or something like that I don't know okay well let's use some feel like I don't just need to keep getting half hearts so maybe give me something up nothing I've just reforged twice that it's giving me no modifier you Frick that don't need speed I really I really don't need speed o plus e % attack damage that's getting saved also yeah that's a good one my arms are breadsticks your aren't wait what yeah it's the thing okay this is some sort of meat some sparkles mean it's it was a meme on the subreddit but yeah it's know there's back to half-hearted just all those levels for nothing Wow basically the top of my arms in the lighting here up here kind of golden and the underside is kind of white and if you compare that to the look of an Olive Garden breadstick it resembles I saw I saw one post that way and I just didn't see it and I was like okay I don't know why this is up devoted but okay but apparently it's a thing okay I looked in my you know in preview and I was like oh like my webcam window I looked at it because I think there's no way this is a thing and you know this is definitely a thing that was very disappointing to me attacked you came here for a good time obviously it's doing so attacked right now yeah yeah I'm I am ready to go to the end I'm working on finding it right now I'm oh I'm actually I want to join what okay how many how many aya vendors did you bring I have 26 okay that might be enough yeah I figured that probably enough could be enough okay you come back and though you need to join you just like I'm just gonna fine meant I was that other person I just figured you were busy complaining about your bottles I'm just gonna kind of get started like I didn't think I was like oh I found this stronghold here it is like I was just like it's just right over here but it's it's it's it Shh don't complain okay this man's is just trying to get a jump on the the task at hand from this man's alright you come back here now dude is ready to rock or there we go got empty handed ah have you got your totem of undying for when you fall off the side of the map I do ow what the hell are you at dude I'm trying to get back but I just had something blow up but it's fine don't worry everything is under control okay boy is a unit here yeah actually with here if you gave him all of his meals than he should be he's close here well he's close to you like 2020 health off all righty here I'm here I'm ready to rock with you dude all right up you go up I go I'm out it what okay you're responding a little bit like you the the Dragons like kind of teleporting around so Oh rip ah the chunks God dang it dude what is oh Jesus Christ yeah oh are you it's it's immediate issues immediate issues mine's been doing okay why what the heck it's just the mom I mean minecraft wasn't meant to fly I see I see your dragon down there yeah my never just like chase you on the ground alright west we go off to Westeros alright well at least now like usually if that's gonna happen the chunks just don't continue look they kind of stay yeah yeah so it's moving now so at least that's a good sign it usually doesn't or happens pretty fast if it's gonna happen time to toss another toss another let's come over - are you landing and then throwing yeah all right see if I can catch it all right you ready yeah goes up still just west you kind of I think it broke okay I will never fill the portal in now yep pretty west dish don't fly our dragon in the end porque no oh I should have brought enderpearls that would have been smart all right yeah I don't have any prose I just have but that's okay I can just mark it on the atlas and then oh I think your dragon is doing the thing I don't know who's having problems my chunks of water yet it's it's mine okay Rippey dipping hey I hit on this mount and my dragons over here and I'm and like in now in front of me and I'm back here that's always fun can I get on my dragon no family I can't get on my dragon that's exciting I wonder if the ender dragon is any different there we go alright do I look like I'm loading normal yep okay good now watch me have problems okay they're still loading yeah I'm so nice nice and easy nice and steady boys do you know if the ender dragon has any new mechanics in this I don't know anything about it okay alright this is water come over this little Iowan right here are you throw another hopefully there's no sirens around pop off the dragon immediately wha I throw it to the area where to go oh it's right over you it's so same direction yeah okay yeah turn around I can't see it the ender pearls are pretty decent on servers generally yeah did I did I mention our sponsor at the beginning of this I don't think you did you should tell us about our sponsor yeah dude have you heard about our Lord and sponsor Savior MC pro host at your dragons doing the thing again

cool stuff like that and yeah that's that's what's up with our sponsor for the forever oh you're that boy over there dude I guess that's just it just a lighthouse oh that's a tower right there that's his Bethel tower it looks exploded what's happened very big what happened to bottom of Bethel tell me there's spotters in it so it's not that exploded huh hmm I mean we said we were gonna do the end so yeah okay gotcha right forward no no no no doing battle tower bosses for now dude no doing battle tower bosses for you seeing is a little kind of other sirens right underneath this Oh was it can I pick you off when you're on the dragon I have no idea but I also land in I feel like we need to toss a thing okay you don't mind if I use this to you guys I'm sure they don't were you able to retrieve the I Avenger last time ooh it would be nice to be able oh no we're we're okay oh yeah drop down like I did not sadly that's it and this direction is we're kind of tilting north a little bit but otherwise still west okay a lot of West good climb back up here you got it whether or not yeah I got the thing your boy is sleeping now it's my dragon doing the thing oh it's doing the thing yeah I think it just happens every landing okay how about now mmm yeah looks good looks like you flying it did you find kind of like a fix for it yeah you just dismount and remount you know put or you move like the dragon will move without you right it's like your body stays where you are oh I'm going north this is the wrong direction let's go this way glad I looked at the map and was like hey that's not the direction at that pearl win is that Pelican over there like some pelicans they come after us careful with the pelicans there they've been known to take down dragons spicer sighs what actually happens if you get engaged by something when you're on the dragon can you really and you swing without attacking your own dragon I hope I really haven't tried like I've been very delicate not okay I'm punching with nothing and it doesn't seem to do damage so that's good there is nothing to land on in the entire world okay look a mountain hold on hold on there's also an underwater thing over here what is that do those citation oh dang did you just eat them actually they're still alive what is it again what's up another another you did are oh you should mark this I wonder what it is we haven't been in something like it before oh okay underwater temple why am I going down stop it there's more sirens over there but let's trumpet boy get rekt and check up back we overshot uh yeah we overshot oh it's in the ocean somewhere okay well that means we might actually be able to see it it was okay I was like wow Frick I mean belacan doing careful with the pelicans can i incinerate this mother trucker away well you where you at oh you're still there on top of the mountain do it can I only are at the ground I know you can definitely are like basically it goes where your cursor is so you can try and hit mid-level Oh God trying to frickin I'm trying to air shot this Pelican and be super satisfied come on come on frickin AK dude well I can't air shot the Pelican I'm sorry I'm sorry this has happened to you whatever whatever he's over it well I guess let's uh let's zoom on our land over here and there's more to actually oh there you are oh my god destroyed but it's in the water it sounds like so you should be like looking underneath yeah no I've been keeping an eye like underneath as well okay but let's try from this island and see what's going on come on down you go and why am I being attacked by everything oh it's my time that's why we could sleep you wanna sleep I don't have a Oh should have thought about that eh yep all right I reckon Jamie do boy did you see where it went I did not because it was too busy with this frickin janggu that's trying to attack me create I don't know where the thing when it wasn't in the direction that we were heading hmm I mean it's probably more over - I don't know directions so oh it's it went ow gosh darn it we are whatever this is needs to go away hahaha oh my god dude it's just exploding all over you it seems like now we're heading southeast kind of the direction here's what we're but we add put that like this is we we have it like pretty surrounded like it's almost like that was by that siren thing that i nuked over there I'm trying to like you know he's in the water with the dragon I think oh yeah definitely the dragon I makes it easier to see in the water someone's hitting me with water oh the janggu yeah oh my lord how you doing oh hi you're shot in the boy I shot of the boy you feel pretty good about it yeah yeah yeah okay you still over at the place you're at I am I'm trying to work everything out and decide how I want to go about this and I do we want a boat now instead of dragon yeah yeah yeah yeah that's I think that's the way to go cool slurp and [Music] do we have sticks at all know what we should be able to make some oh I do have sticks I don't I don't think I have any planks and we can get some how do you say how yeah oh I do tree it doesn't work that way but I do have planks okay remember this you had to do the grass thing to make the knife to make the to cut but I thought we use since we already have an axe and a pick because we can do this just making it harder to be it's you know it's fine you get it no there's not a vendor you didn't pick up but that's the one I couldn't find then perfect nailed it huh go away go away go away here is your boat sir okay are we boating separately I guess and here's hoping like the the ocean is scary and dangerous yeah but we're also waivered AF what I'm going to make two buttons and some earplugs just in case ah true true do you need some yes I just drops him down yeah just in case don't you have to put him on unless you start hearing which yeah this previously was a dangerous island and then a dragon came and then the dragon came so I mean you gotta you gotta bud oh no God ow not anymore oh did he break my boat he's like don't forget about me yeah oh there's good you got more coming at you bro well I'm actually Azumi boy on the water I'm Azumi boy ow oh you are yeah dude I'm fine oh I just broke my boat no deaf straighter yeah I do that's why dude my boat got nuked yeah it happens oh there it is okay um which way are we still heading let us throw alright I forgot that I am I I was you me before yeah I'll need a boat dude anybody go faster no bug dude I know faster no boat alright where to go okay wait wait the heck is that mean yeah it's like under the water here then braum Aquaman dude because uh I guess there's this little yeah I mean we're just going back and forth right now okay so that mean I guess we can just dig down to the island huh hop over to it see what we got cooking smells like roast siren over here uh did you boom I didn't even see where are we I hate anyway I can't see where it goes did it go down I mean do we want to just go go down and dig down at the Oh dig down there we should we should have brought was the the geo not yeah that would have been good yeah why you know do that Hey because I didn't think that far ahead hmm I wasn't planning on being that serious about it okay fine that's I didn't do that just wanted water huh okay what I didn't do that whatever water man I am Aquaman to be fair to be fair this gravel Oh am i right why is there so much water the heck's going on dude [Applause] synaptic water it's the gravel it's hard to know like what elevation you're at is the problem we also don't even know if we're like directly over it yeah cuz I'm not gonna try and eat I mean I can hand you the pearls and you can be like oh throne it's not like we if we fall in lava doesn't matter in we doesn't matter if we if we fall for a long way then I leave matters but kind of it kind of matters that we have baubles that help that's bedrock well that's bedrock so hmm yeah we need the do knock thing what would have been nice I would agree it would have been nice alright so here let me open a little space around me and then or you could leave well I I think we need to be slightly higher elevation usually though well I was going to oh I was gonna just like open up a space and throw and get a direction but oh okay I gotcha it's what I was sir that's good so I guess we have plenty we don't have to worry about it just getting lost into the rock okay alright it went straight this way alright and I gotta go of it yeah yeah off we go into the distance reluctantly crouched at my starting line wish I hadn't braking on this thing uh I'm braking was a big thing for me yeah it's very hard to find oh I got a new one I forgot I forgot I lost my nonono oh sorry I was looking my pickaxe I forgot that I had lost my legendary so that had on braking so I was like wait this is breaking really fast and I was like oh this isn't even enchanted mm-hm see that's water and water it's just under water yeah it's still this direction but also up quite a bit still oh you you through another yeah why is it so much water the heck oh it's a cave it's a cave ISA cave something like that okay there's just a kind of a it was just kind of a small little opening ah will this lead to anything how is it how will you become so separated from this thing from what the for Christophe ever you're like right at it uh-oh I think I seize it you seize it yeah see you see that see that up there look at that I mean then again there's like a million pre-built structures so it could be anything right yeah but it really do look like it do let's see oh it's that's looking pretty fortress-like yeah I spy that'll that'll be the right one that'll be the one dude alright we have found we found a dead end huh okay there's more this way okay cool oh wow oh yeah there we go no I thought that you thought you found it immediately that would be nice because man one of the more annoying things is when you're just wandering around a freaking stronghold I'm inclined finding anything yep especially if you're doing a race to the end and yeah you can hear the first one to get there but then you just wander for like an hour and a half yep no I mean so I heard agree with you on that so I've heard oh you Frick you absolute Frick oh those guys suck this is what just once I'd like to find a stronghold that's put together like well I know right well hey here is generated properly we here yay okay marking Lim maps where they yeah we kept Oertel to here we can even make a waypoint since we have another stars Oh true true true indeed alright so a couple oh thanks dude it's it's very satisfying it'd be indeed oh alright so do you want to jump straight in or do you want to go back get a bed and some ender pearls and then well it's like do we want to make a portal here a waypoint and then come back and set up and then have that I'm not concerned I'm not concerned about losing the fight at all [Music] everything is different and I do know that the end fight is supposed to be different so oh you do know okay yeah yeah people have mentioned so it might be good for us to go prep and then like just with time and law and everything like that like get set up and just have that be ready to go for next round oh he wants to cliffhanger it boys he wants to cliffhanger it I'm saying that it works out that way that way okay I'm not saying I want to okay saying okay what would you prefer nobody can cliff we can cliffhanger it master of cliffhangers look at him blaming me no I don't want to blame you so people get mad at you and not me but I'm happening to my finger it if he will actually get mad at you for it like I've never had anyone that was like I can't believe you stopped because it wasn't a good time sure that at least one person has in subs okay I mean you're not wrong okay so you want to make waste out but what we can also do well we can also do is we could make because our nether stars are limited so it's like we all we have that key the Bosque we can't do that another time what else is made to the NIT I guess it's not I guess we're fine I guess we're fine here oh yeah oh you're gonna go there okay I don't know what I'm doing like I'm just it's it's been a tough day okay it's been you can just keep going from here you don't have to like oh yeah it's got to be a one-up every time like you can't stop you can't stop oh and we're pretty much at the surface it's just now made it kind of a pain you breathe a lot better than I do though uh no I don't breathe a lot better I just move a lot better horizontally but not vertically not vertically at all not vertically you know what come on gosh darn it what the to think that it was over here and yet the Pearl was pointing us in the exact opposite direction oh I'm gonna drown my life away here no no you would never you would never you would never dress someone forgot the the the sunken ship incident okay now the question is are we sure we don't want to just do a portal another portal I guess we don't have foot in steel do we actually wait no I have lint in my inventory we could use nether portal and then we go back super quick give another portal and that's fine you just have to snag some obsidian but that's easy enough to get okay uh on just saying I'm just saying also I'm mark this off just in case how are you planning on getting obsidian by putting water on top a lava do we have as much time doing that is flying back is my concern but okay we all not a significant CERN well no it's not because the thing is if we fly back then we have to fly back here again and I'm more concerned about the werewolf that's attacking these poor dear poor dear getting shrekt and now he's coming for you not anymore cuz I saved us you say about this man you fly back I work on the portal and we see who does it quicker what does everything have to be a competition with you yes oh ok makes sense uh will you verify whether or not my dad I can be dragging properly I'm already underwater and I really don't want to have to float back up again it'll be bad news ok I got it that's the wrong direction alright so obviously some lava in here already there's another battle tower like I'd mark it off but I can't I'm in a race now you should you should take your time there's no rush here smell the Russians here I have a I have efficiency on this boy advanced efficiency should be just reckon knees obsidian alright you mean more give me more and West that more obsidian oh there's lava there's some lava boys ex lady creeper oh yeah that's light creeper that is 10 the only problem is they need iron boys I didn't bring an iron now you see the issue that I've run into here is I am NOT in possession of a crafting table to make a furnace to say right there's one right up on that island that we were is on yeah that's gotta go to I have to just go back up which eats time yes time big time so so what's the winning conditions here because the back-and-forth wait but cuz once I know once I make the portal I have to find my way back through the portal and you have to fly the dragon back yeah but you have to come get your stuff and I have to craft all the right alright that's the thing is we've to we have to have the resources we have to have the resources because I'm at the base ok cool cool you might be winning but I've established a more long-term strategy here if I build a waypoint and I fly back yeah whatever bruh no what is golden nobody is you thing let's see ok so this way stones gonna take three obsidian Oh Frick balls you kidding me oh it's fine and then put that away we can put this away like I can I mean I feel like I have time you know Wow I feel no time pressure whatsoever right now well if I built if I brought a flint and steel okay I'd brought a flint and steel even even by the time you had everything if you had a flint and steel then you would still have to make your way through the nether know to get back here wrong I'd be there okay actually knowing our portals have worked so far I probably just would be yeah and not to mention the fact that you're under attack by everything in the nether both of us have experienced problems that way never it's never happened never in a million years never in a million years okay so now I am hopping on my dragon to come back with the waste oh no way Frick the only question is yeah how close will this be will I recognize the location will it be a problem Black Plague sounds good um Gordon gonna die in the nether chat be optimistic I'ma be honest I don't fully recognize this location uh-huh so I carry an atlas on me so that I know where I am yeah I don't fully know where this is in the nether so it's ass lazy it seems problematic like I don't know enough to tell you like you you you seem very confident so I'm assuming you know more of what's going on I'll tell you what though I got a hot air balloon I got a few bones and I got a red skull level me it's basically a win right I mean I would have to say so personally yeah yeah yeah no it's like my way didn't yield any I did forget about the needing a canteen too so although someone was saying that you can we can take a cauldron fill it up with the put it put it down put water out of a bucket into it without the water you can drink out of a cauldron yeah cuz I know you can do it fill your canteens off lever are you Frick you Frick dude oh no I might have ran into some delays did you actually know yeah I might have to just abandon ship on that one you win you and I I can admit defeat okay I can admit defeat I am not too proud to know when someone has outclassed me and it was just you know seemed like you're making it harder it had to be never oh yeah well I made it back to the portal where are you not of the portal get rekt some libraries though look don't you take a look around the library okay sounds like a plan my man don't sound so hesitation yeah okay no I backed away this this place honestly really really discombobulated it's very broken up all right anytime you want the end portal way stone is here oh I am on my way back are you next door said it you know one one minor drawback is it does cost a level to do the teleport so rough life yeah all right I'm back hello hello how's it doing mate I put it up just because sometimes we end up in the floor oh yeah we wouldn't want that yeah well bit of space like how there's so much work that went into things but the silver fish are still them silver fears are stilled and they're not retexture sour fish are just silver fish go alrighty they never gonna be anything but silver fish well I suppose we should probably have a few blocks on us yeah so that if we spawn out in the middle of nowhere I didn't I didn't bring like I guess I did grab some ender pearls so here's that but that's oh I guess we didn't roll over nice that should be plenty all right um cool you have water I need to get some I do have author my bucket is empty I need to buck it to my bucket you should do that I wish to have there we go just hear this now with all that said with
