months of Skillshare for free there's no song in the american canon like george gershwin's summertime it's a simple piece but a powerful one evoke King a hot summer day in the American South but hinting and so much more and that evocative ability has landed to become one of the most widely recorded songs in the history of music some have estimated that there have been more than 25,000 different recordings of the song and new versions are being cut every day from Billie Holiday through Nina Simone from Ella Fitzgerald through Janis Joplin summertime is more than just a song it's a living document of America's cultural history let's take a closer look summertime was one of the first songs that George Gershwin wrote for his opera Porgy and Bess it's used as a theme throughout that opera sung by several characters as the tragic story plays out the lyrics are written by Edwin DuBose Heyward who also wrote Porgy from which the Opera was adapted that novel tells the story of several black characters in the American South so when Gershwin set out to create a musical adaptation he turned to black folk musics Gershwin was writing in the early 1930s when jazz music had exploded into the mainstream Gershwin himself had been part of this explosion a few years earlier with Rhapsody in Blue mixing jazz influences with classical music in the European tradition Gershwin brought black jazz to white audiences with his Rhapsody but while that's always wild and bombastic summertime is common nuanced this is because of its influences from the african-american spiritual tradition tracing their origins back to the slave trade spiritual songs had existed in the black zeitgeist for generations one such song was sometimes I feel like a motherless child Heywood's original Porgy novel featured that song so Gershwin used part of its melody as inspiration for summertime you can hear the similarities in mahalia Jackson's on summertime which incorporates some of sometimes I feel like a motherless child [Music] somewhere time made its premiere alongside the rest of porgy and bess on September 30th 1935 sung by Abby Mitchell the legacy of Porgy and Bess is a complicated one to this day many still take issue to Gershwin a Jewish man using black music and purporting to depict black life in his opera but black communities were quick to latch on to summertime with its lilting melody and timeless music just a year after porgy and bess premiered a young Billie Holiday took on the song holidays version is more reflective of the swinging jazz scene that was happening around her at the time a raspy trumpet drives the song instead of the dramatic strings holiday summertime has moved from the rural countryside of Gershwin's original with driving drums in an upbeat sound holidays version is the sound of summer in her home of Harlem this is a reflection of a social movement that was happening at the time known as the great migration with the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and Jim Crow laws in the south many black Americans were moving to industrial centers in the north alongside these people came cultural movements to Chicago quickly became the jazz capital of the world and a new movement that would come to be known as the Harlem Renaissance was happening in New York by channeling the vibrant black culture around her Holliday was able to break the American pop charts climbing to number 12 her version was the first take on summertime to accomplish this feat but it wouldn't be the last it would take some years for summertime to get momentum though only a few artists took on the song in the following years as the second world war fell over the globe but in the postwar summertime found new life as jazz began a new wave of experimentation 1955 saw Dinah Washington release an astounding version of the song carried by Clifford Browns otherworldly trumpet two years later sam cooke would bring the song into the soul realm with his own charting version all of these versions help bring more attention to the song but it wasn't until 1958 that summertime truly became immortal that was when two of the Giants of American music history teamed up to turn the song into a duet Ella Fitzgerald had spent the 1950s earning her nickname the queen of jazz jazz was reaching a point of popularity that it would never hit again and Ella was a big reason behind that the bebop movement had allowed her to shine she would use her voice to imitate the kind of improvisations she heard from the horns that in a powerful cadence and a regal stage presence and it was enough to raise Fitzgerald to immortality it seemed too good to be true when in 1956 Ella Fitzgerald teamed up with the other biggest name in jazz but this time Louie Armstrong had been dominant in jazz scenes for three decades in the 20s he taught the world how to swing with his unparalleled trumpeting and through the 30s his iconic voice shaped the sound of jazz crooners for decades to come so when he paired up with Ella Fitzgerald the world watched they released two albums of collaboration before turning their eyes on Gershwin and releasing porgy and bess full of songs from the opera Fitzgerald had covered summertime before an aversion full of her trademarked improvisation but this was different the slow strings at the beginning seemed to be announcing that Louie and Ella are about to change the world there's a desperate near apocalyptic sound to Armstrong's horn playing that's calmed by Fitzgerald's Warren [Music] for many this remains the definitive version of the song to date but Armstrong and Fitzgerald weren't all there was to jazz in the late 1950s jazz was also going through a drastic shift held by the likes of Miles Davis who released his own porgy and bess album in 1959 Davis was always looking for new ways to push jazz forward and in 59 he realized he could do so by looking back at Gershwin Davis thought the increasing complexities of bebop were getting in the way of creativity so he sought a return to melody he found this return in porgy and bess the second of his collaborations with Gail Evans with Gershwin's chord progressions as the bass Davis created beautiful improvisations [Music] his take on summertime was a prelude to his next album also released in 1959 the world changing kind of blue well established artists like Davis were taking on the song an up-and-comer named Nina Simone was starting her own legacy with Gershwin tunes though she got famous for a take on I loves you porky Simone would also put her own spin on summertime her version reflects the brooding darkness with him the soul and the violence that was growing in America over the next few years Simone would become a key figure in the civil rights movement alongside the likes of Sam Cooke Simone's music provided a soundtrack to the marches rallies and protests that ended up changing American history the civil rights movement was just one of many pieces that made the 1960's such a tumultuous decade for America alongside the fight for black equality women were rising up and many youths were taking action against the Vietnam War where soul music was the backdrop to the civil rights movement psyckadeli Oh was the backdrop to the sexual revolution and one of the definitive versions of summertime would reflect this bringing the song from a history of jazz and soul into the world of rock in 1968 Big Brother and the Holding Company released cheap thrills that album featured a searing version of summertime Peter Albin's fuzzy guitar pairs with desperate vocals by Janis Joplin this isn't the rural summertime of the south but it also isn't Billie Holiday's bustling Harlem summertime this is the summer of San Francisco drugs in the air and protest in the street [Music] Joplin would perform the song throughout her career bringing a jazz classic to an all new generation and by the time Joplin's version was released it was clear that this wasn't a Gershwin song any longer summertime no longer belonged to Billie Holiday or Ella and Louie it wasn't a Miles Davis track either nor was it Janis Joplin's by the end of the sixties summertime was everyone's song it belonged to whoever wanted to put their own spin on it whoever wanted to sing of their summertime and with each passing version the legacy of summertime grows it's a vibrant diverse neverending story contained in one simple song making this sent you which is a big help to my channel so please just give it a shot
