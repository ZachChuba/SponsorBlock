broke and you're just watching this video because you're bored domain before it's gone alright let's start off with some TVs so right now you can get three hundred and fifty dollars off a 70 inch 4k TV with HDR from Samsung if you're looking for something a little cheaper The Spectre is 65 inches going for only 360 dollars also from Walmart and you get free shipping now if you guys want to stick with a more reliable brand LG is also having a sale on a 55 inch 4k TV however you're not getting that much of a discount compared to the other two only $20 off speaking of LG the entire Graham lineup is on sale for Black Friday and Cyber Monday from the 13-inch all the way up to their 17 inch models with savings up to $400 which is the highest we have seen on LG Graham ever they're also having a sell under center being 4k projectors which you can get up to $400 off the center beam is currently one of the best 4k projector --hz in terms of cost to benefit ratio compared to other 4k projectors in the market it has Google assistant built-in with webOS 4.5 interface and it uses 4ch LED technology for clearer and richer images shifting gears a bit we have a few consoles that are also on sale we got the one terabyte Xbox one X Jedi file an order bundle for $350 or the gears 5 bundle for the same price for team Sony we got the one terabyte ps4 pro which typically goes for 400 dollars but for Black Friday you can get it for only 300 if you haven't picked up a new model or a game yet then you're in luck because they cut the prices for both Xbox one and ps4 Pro down to thirty-eight dollars if you need extra game time for your xbox you can buy three month Xbox Live Gold membership for a reduced price of 15 dollars instead of 25 we do have a lot of really great deals on monitors so make sure you guys check the full links below but I'm gonna go over some of the really good ones that I found here's a really good budget gaming monitor under $100 and a 75 Hertz refresh rate one millisecond response time tn panel with free sync support it's also got built-in speakers basic compatibility and it's only 95 dollars if 75 Hertz just doesn't cut it for you here is the next best option a 24 inch gaming monitor from LG with a 144 Hertz refresh rate any one millisecond response time it's currently going for 135 which is an absolute steal for Black Friday now if you're looking for a curved monitor the pick CEO is a very solid option with similar specs however since it's a curved display it's using a VA panel instead of TN this means better viewing angles but slower response times at 4 milliseconds instead of 1 just make sure to click on the coupon button to get an extra $20 off lowering the total price down to 130 bucks for my ballers out there the Acer predator X 27 is going for 1,100 and according to eBay you're saving $900 but do keep in mind that this is a refurbished model for those seeking that super ultra wide goodness the samsung 49 inch is also on sale with a couple hundred shaved off the price and finally the 38 inch LG ultra wide which I'm actually using in my set up back at home is also discounted I had this for a few years now and I really love it for productivity not so much for gaming now let's take a look at some deals for PC parts once again check the full list down below Intel has been getting destroyed lately so let's show them some love their 87 JK is on sale with a $10 discount really Intel only $10 no wonder you're getting destroyed alright so back to AMD so I mentioned this deal in my last video but in case you guys missed it the

pc the RX 588 gigabyte card is going for only $135 after a male and rebate and after the $25 coupon code but if you guys have a slightly smaller budget you can pick up an RX 570 from new egg for only $100 after a $20 mil and rebate you also get a copy of Ghost Recon or Borderlands 3 with three months of Xbox game pass now if you have a slightly higher budget then you can pick up an RT x 2080 amp edition from ZOTAC for $600 not bad and if EVGA is what you prefer they to have a discount on their r-tx 20/80 FTW three card I was mentioning in the last video but you can get a one terabyte m2 SSD for 83 dollars it currently sold over a thousand units so make sure to snag one if you need more storage here's a really great deal and a 16 gigabyte RAM kit clocked at 3600 megahertz I don't have any timing information but you can always contact the seller if you're interested in picking these up and finally if you're looking to replace your old mousepad courser is sailing there mmm 350 extended mousepad for half the price I can't forget about the laptops the full links will be below but I'm gonna go over a few of my favorite ones first up we got the surface pro 7 with a 12 inch touchscreen the core i3 10th gen processor and 128 gigabyte SSD this is going for $700 down from 959 if you've been saving your money for a gaming laptop this year then you're in luck because the Lenovo Legion Wi-Fi 45 dropped in price to $800 you get an i7 9750 h6 core 12 wear processor 8 gigs of ram and the gtx 1650 but if you want something a little beefier the Wi-Fi 40 is a better option it's got a total of 16 gigs of ram instead of 8 and a gtx 1660 TI however for $100 more you can up for the r-tx 2060 version instead and finally let's take a look at some audio gear my all-time favorite headphones that I take with me everywhere is on sale for $229 but all the colors are sold out except for black and pink I actually picked up a few of these which will make great gifts for Christmas for gaming the popular logitech g930 3 or ms spectrum wireless headset is going for $65 for either color if you need a replacement charging case for your Apple earpods Amazon has them going for $134 and speaking of air pods the air pods Pro are also on sell it's only 14 dollars but it's better than nothing especially considering that Apple rarely discounts their stuff if you're looking for a premium high-end Bluetooth speaker the UE boom 3 is a solid pick and they are well known for their battery life sound quality and bass I'm not a fan of beats by dre but their Beats Studio 3s are $150 off in all three colors and finally the echo dot third-generation ramazan is going for 35 dollars down from the original price of 50 now before you guys pay full price for whatever you're buying now
