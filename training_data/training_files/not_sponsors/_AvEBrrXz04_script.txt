the draft was announced just yesterday that it's gonna be in Las Vegas that's been known but there's gonna be a floating red-carpet area in front of the Bellagio which players will get boded into they'll get boated into this red carpet area in front of the Bellagio think of the fountains going off with the photos that's gonna be dope pics then they're gonna take another boat over the other side hop in a car drive over to the Caesars area there's a parking lot over there that they're transforming into a draft spectacle area for the fans now Coonan you're big in the sports media world right diode in this whole world try to be no you are right yeah how long have you been working at CAA in the sports media world it's like four years now okay so the NFL has had this traveling draft now for the last few years they are in Dallas right then Philadelphia the Nashville now Vegas have they viewed these traveling drafts as a massive overwhelming success or has there been some misses or something like that it is just beyond a success be honest they didn't know not like Nashville is an amazing city was not gonna get a Super Bowl you know not they don't have a new stadium they don't have a roof they were not gonna get a Super Bowl they got the draft and it the the draft more people were able to touch the draft more Tennesseans were able to touch the draft and to be there and be offended by you then probably been able to go to the Super Bowl now they are saying that I am a voice of the draft after what happened one of the drafts most iconic moments ever that's what people are saying you're my agent you're supposed to say this year in the Vegas thing we were looking at the pictures they're literally just changing a parking lot in Las Vegas into a draft stage and then they're putting the stage on top of the the fountain or whatever what it goes into the thought of that like what what is the entire mindset on where they go where and why they do what look well in Nashville what they do is they shut down Broadway yeah and so you have just a mass of people 120,000 people for about a mile and the visual spectacle was incredible but the stage was in a parking lot and the greenroom was built you know elevated 10th in a parking lot true and the ESPN set was at a brewery NFL Network set was at another restaurant so like they just basically tapped into the local infrastructure ecosystem that was available to them they're in Vegas they're doing the same thing now I think it's a lot harder to shut down the Las Vegas Strip and is to shut down Broadway in Nashville see that is something that I didn't understand in digs listens the visa in every morning is gamblin picks and our guy Brent Musburger Brent Musburger and they were talking about how incredibly impossible it would have been to shut down to Las Vegas Las Vegas trip is wider than you know interstate 75 like that thing is how many lanes across twelve maybe yeah it's insane and you have to like you know you have to take the bridges you have to walk to a bridge I got a little legs like it's across the street you are a very small person you're not I don't think typically you're a little person no I don't think I'm there a few inches on the classification yeah you are I mean for everybody though walking the strip stinks it stinks and it's hot and people and like then you run into like people that you've never seen before and so you stop and then you see people like check their polls to see if they're still I mean it's a mess so I think shutting down the strip was not an option see everybody I think everybody assumed just after how last year went Nashville the broad way that they would shut down the strip everybody I assumed like and I am nowhere near in the position to ever have any intel on anything but when they said it was in Vegas I was like oh so just shut down the strip they'll have that shot down the strip that's the way it'll go instead I think the the boat to the Bellagio fountain thing is Hawaii it's genius Vegas doesn't have any there's not like anything like geographical topographical about Vegas that's super iconic right in the middle of the city you know so in Philly you had that beautiful Park in Chicago you had the park in Nashville you have you know the scene of Broadway in Vegas you have the strip the strip is gonna be part of the visual but the Bellagio fountain is iconic yeah Ocean's eleven yeah and they are going to literally put you know the biggest spectacle the NFL offseason in the middle of an iconic location I respect it it's gonna be really really cool I'm excited everything first-class I'm excited to see how it worked out I think they whenever they debuted the image I thought they were doing the aft on and I think that's because a rosh our kasi mark Ozzie whose friend of ours put out that tweet I assume they're doing the draft from the fountain when player gets drafted hop on the boat boob boob skippers coming in to pop off the boat DAP up Goodell do the interview with Deion Sanders on a boat out the other side celebration I thought that was gonna well hello there seeking now back to the magic I think that was the initial reaction yesterday when the images first came out it came out a rush broke the story yesterday first he was the first guy saw that had it except I think because the Clark County Nevada public filings had to be disclosed so nauseous on top of his stuff yes the reporter he was the first to put it out but I think that was the initial reaction I will tell you though I won't put anything past the NFL when a player is drafted I mean you've been in Vegas too many times those fountains shoot high like I would not be surprised if those fountains shoot high and team colors when a player is drought Oh like fireworks or Water Works yeah I just you know I don't know what the plan is no one's at information but it's all gonna be around there and I guarantee you that the show is not gonna stop once you know Goodell start to call on those picks all right I would like to let everybody know I have a self ban on Vegas so I went up either this year is that so we are at a dinner we were at a dinner in New Orleans for the national championship and we were sitting with some people from ESPN and it was a great conversation there was no TV in a restaurant because Coonan picked you only telling the entire city that did not have a television to watch a rather important and if you try to make a reservation for 33 in New Orleans the night before in place for that whatever the case was we went to this dinner and there was no television so you know a lot of conversation was happening and by the way it felt good to go travel back to the era where there was nothing no distractions just humans right so we're talking on the Istrian people and there was a you know a couple things floated by like hey we want you to be a part of draft coverage I was like awesome awesome where's the dad they're like Las Vegas I was like Oh can't do it so sorry till I have a hundred million dollars in my bank account I promised myself I would not go back to Vegas it's one of the reasons why I'm here today we have to just sit down face to face we go over a few things and draft as one of this any time Coonan is around we have a buddy system like I have a buddy system in place Michael Kline who cannot be here today we love Kline he's in LA away in the we're gonna put a buddy system in place for you in Vegas everything man it is I love gambling I like dancing I like having a good time I don't mind jumping into bodies of water I mean Vegas is just too much that was my initial reaction seeing the drawings from yesterday oh yeah that's gonna end up in that yeah yeah that's what everybody says that's what everybody has said yesterday but good for me I I can't go to Las Vegas it's we'll see that's one of those electric fences that they have for dogs they just have that up for me whenever I'm flying on the Southwest flight in there sitting in between like 75 people very responsible of you thank you foxy doesn't always get bashed for this now said Here I am being a responsible adult but anytime Coonan is around that means pretty massive decisions have to be made so anytime you hear or see the Koonin know that something big is probably gonna come within the next week or so fine to guess the last time we were there you slid out of the club on your stomach like a penguin he didn't have a kind of build a buddy I did I was there no you were not you're not you're the worst accountabilibuddy were you were you sleeping brother was hilarious I was know that it was hilarious and I had a sombrero on at the time I mean it was you know our parents put kids like give them a little backpack with like a turtle and a leash that's like attached to it yeah we're gonna do that for you it's not the leash I love that it's the best it's the best place to the worst it's worst place on earth it's the worst place Vegas is the worst place on earth sort of this but it's a good time it's a good time while you're there
