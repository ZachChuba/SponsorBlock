what are we think about Richard Sherman Richard Sherman came on this show and apologized to Baker Mayfield for the DAP gate that happened before the Niners played the Browns with an alleged missed handshake kind of you know lack of interest so the conversation where Richard Sherman was one that won a lot of different ways and went away that nobody thought it was gonna happen Richard Sherman owned up to his mistake now with Darrelle Revis and Richard Sherman situation on the Twitter I love this this is what I live for I live on the Internet I love whenever people start sharpen each other and when it gets maybe a bit petty but what people have to remember throw rivas goat yeah goat business wise on the field wise Revis Island wasn't just some catchy gimmick that was a real thing talk to Bart Scott this morning a half the field is just gone because Darrelle Revis was covering somebody didn't allow ski talks about whenever he was on teams as a backup quarterback their entire scheme their offensive strategy which is to leave off the side of the field did Terrell Revis was on he and Richard Sherman played two different styles so the fact that Darrelle Revis probably got a little bit upset that at some point they say Richard Sherman's greatest corner of all time because Richard Sherman proves it Richard Sherman is a stud on the field he locks people down he picks the ball off in magical situations he brought an entire attitude to the Niners so whenever people say this is a greatest corner of all time I think Darrelle Revis takes exception because the robbery is done through TV through our readers isn't the most relevant individual right now he's kind of disappeared with all of his money that he's made and incredible investments in himself and other things but nobody people forget about the robberies so I think what's wrong Reedus was saying was hey put some respect on my damn name well hello there and get $20 off your first order from seeking now back to the magic and what ended up happening was Richard Sherman obviously was the brunt end of that Richard Sherman's not somebody who's gonna back down like a [ __ ] Richard Sherman said you're not gonna say that about me old man basically and they got into it a little bit which I respect but both those players are Hall of Fame players both those players have made their teams better and Richard Sherman is in another Super Bowl so he's got to feel damn good about it yeah there's not a whole lot you can't say I mean both those guys obviously you don't get to that position if you don't think that you're the best ever corners have to think to the best ever bright that that's a position where you have to have this ungodly like confidence about yourself because you have to react you have to be the most athletic person on the field and you have to think the human that's being paid millions millions of dollars to get open is a lesser athlete than you are and Darrelle Revis was the truth back in the day and I think people have forgot that and I think that's why he chopped off because you said he was sick of you know kind of sick of people forgetting about how good dough is throughout Revis also was a partner Turner for a while he returned to punt against the West Virginia Mountaineers that I was putting in and he shook thirteen players from now when there's only eleven players on the field almost wanted a mess before it I was the missed tackle number ten another day so I have a lot of respect for Darrelle Revis I also have a lot of respect for Richard Sherman but I'd like to take out into it a little bit that's
