hey it's time for another marathon review and this time we're doing Studio Ghibli Ghibli G bleed who knows it's an Italian word for an African wind used by a Japanese studio and I'm American we're all - I'm gonna pronounce it Ghibli you might know Studio Ghibli from their critically acclaimed films like My Neighbor Totoro and spirited away or from their DVDs where you pop it in and for some reason John Lasseter's there and he's like hi I'm Pixar's John Lasseter you're about to watch an amazing TV like yeah I know John you're on it and right now you're the only thing preventing me from watching it sorry little childhood rant there anyway I'll be reviewing every studio ghibli film in 10 words or less including a few films that aren't technically Ghibli but they have a lot of overlap in their production staff so I'm just including them for good measure as usual the films are rated on a scale of 1 to 10 and if you want a more in-depth look at my review system you should check out my Pixar video just so you're aware for this marathon I watched almost all of these films dubbed in English I've seen a lot of them in both languages some of them are much better in English some of them are much much worse but most of them are about the same so it doesn't really matter the dubs are pretty good also Ghibli is notorious for not letting anyone upload their work in any digital format even if it's for review purposes and I'm not gonna risk that copyright strike which means that instead of nice movie footage for my reviews I'm just gonna use little doodles I hope that's okay I tried my best so without further ado here is every Studio Ghibli film in 10 words or less if this movie were a sound it would be boring this is the only post-apocalyptic film that I like Luke castle and the Skywalker wants to blow up everything coming up on your left it's adorable childhood whimsy and on your right it's children time for two hours watch the uncut Phil Hartman English dub it's the best still eating that pineapple ten minutes on that pineapple now this movie is great that we should add an ending your highschool crush is problematic and bad mom just like Totoro they're dead I hope they make a weird cat fanfiction out of this it's Nausicaa again but better and Japanese flavored master animator Esau takahata's adapts a bantam newspaper comic nice original rating jello you hack broad u shape this one is so cute and nobody talks about it this is the nicest fever dream let's adapt all the Earth's ebooks at once badly like a children's book but it screams it's alright I'm just a boy the first half is so charming with an incest mystery you could land a plane on that nose the longest and prettiest screensaver ever made my coral friend is my dead ghost grandma that guy sure  that turtle it's Studios owned our latest movie blue keys blimp livery blur verse and that's all of them days okay thanks for listening back to the video but before we even start let me just say that almost every Studio Ghibli movie is really good so if you told me that I don't know any of these where your favorite movie on the list I wouldn't even argue with you because you'd be right that being said [Music] the cat returns this one gets my third favorite slot because honestly I think it's really overlooked originally this movie was gonna be a 20-minute short for a theme part but that got cancelled then it was gonna be a 40-minute short to test out new directors but then they were like oh whoops we accidentally made the cutest thing ever um let's just make it a full movie and then they did the cat returns has jubblies trademark fun whimsical storytelling coupled with a unique art style and a puck eNOS not usually seen in Ghibli's work that's thanks to director Hiroyuki Morita and writer Rico Yoshida who don't get nearly enough credit for the awesome job they did making cute happy cat movie is another curse make all your fake infer tales from Earthsea but you thought this one would be lower on the list tales from Earthsea is the story of Orin a prince from Earthsea who murders his own father steals a sword with boobs on it and wanders around being vague and crazy for an hour he meets a mage named Sparrowhawk with cool powers that are ignored in favor of focusing on farming and vague angst bourtzi has a weirdly dismal vibe to it magic is disappearing earth sees in crisis but the people of the land are so catty and bitter about everything you just don't want them to be saved curtsey hints at a lot of neat elements that we never really get a chance to explore this is because the movie is based on not one but four whole books and they did a great job cramming the least interesting parts of all of them into one film [Music] [Music] Princess Mononoke this is my favorite movie ever so why isn't it number one well honestly I don't think it's quite as polished just the movie in the number one slot is sight note for those who don't know whether a movie is good or not from a critical or objective standpoint and whether or not you like a film are completely different things for instance I don't like Ponyo at all I have seen it twice and I never ever want to see it again but I also think it's a very well made movie it looks really good and it does what it wants to do on the other hand I like secret of NIMH to Timmy to the rescue even though literally everything about that movie is awful and that's okay just wanted to point that out for the comment sections benefit okay moving along Princess Mononoke is an action-adventure epic written by Hayao Miyazaki and localized by Neil Gaiman so you know it's good watch the English dub a young warrior named ashitaka is cursed by a forest god to break the curse he must journey to the mountains and insert himself into a war between the gods and the human metalworkers the characters are likable and multifaceted the action scenes are top-notch and the music is so so good is another curse make all your bacon bird when Marnie was there hi my name's Ana I'm reserved and bitter and there's nothing else to me want to know why I hate my two sets of loving Guardians and a mean to everyone all the time it's a spoiler just kidding it's that I saw my foster mother getting a welfare check for taking care of me but you don't find that out for an hour because the movie wants to pretend that twists will make up for me being a there's a mysterious ghost girl who does nothing interesting the whole movie besides definitely flirting with me and making you wonder what her deal is and guess what her deal is child abuse [Music] the wonderful sound of those bells yep it's spirited away surprise go watch spirited away very very good that's all I need to say about it everyone likes it everyone knows so instead I'm going to use this time to talk a little bit more about is another curse make all your bacon fur [Music] only yesterday here is a single image of a pineapple to impart that I do not like pineapples I will have you sit and be bored for 10 minutes while I focus on nothing but this pineapple well this may be an effective way to make my audience hate this pineapple it is not an effective way to make a good video or a good movie this is my problem with only yesterday only yesterday is written and directed by the late Esau Takahata whose works tend to be very long and slow paced they deal with themes of societal expectation versus individual happiness and progress versus nature only yesterday deals with both as we explore the life of the exceptionally boring taiko a Japanese woman who we watch both in the present and throughout her childhood just as he makes you feel the crushing despair of wartime Japan and grave of the fireflies by forcing you to watch an hour and a half of children slowly dying Tok hoddan imports the mundane frustrations and discontent of a Japanese school girl by making you sit through an hour and 40 minutes of dull frustrating scenes where nothing advances and the thesis statement is that life sucks and yeah after watching this I'm inclined to agree yes it's successful in its condemnation of Japanese society unfortunately it is also so boring okay maybe I didn't like the movie because takahata's other films cover similar topics in more interesting ways I would argue Princess Kaguya is almost the exact same movie thematically it's just set in a different time period with better animation are you interested in seeing takahata's commentary and japan's development and departure from traditional ism well then you should watch the much much better pom Poko but if you like banal unedited car rides small talk about nothing for eight minutes straight well then this is the movie for you now that's not to say the movies without merit but in terms of energy jaymund in terms of being a film you go to watch and take anything away from at all I can't recommend this to anybody [Music] thank you for watching and a huge thank you to verb for sponsoring this video if you liked this you check out our other marathon reviews we've got one for Disney Pixar DreamWorks there's one for scooby-doo for no reason or if you're interested in hearing why I gave these movies the ratings that I did you can check out on my patreon I've got this big long audio post that's just my unfiltered thoughts on every single movie and I go way more in depth there because I have a lot more than 10 words to use and you can check that out in the description thanks
