let's suppose that you were able every [Music] night [Music] buying a legion spirit shield 1.4b welcome back to in-depth for a pet the series where i stake my bank every time i get a pet i ended my last video with a bank value of 491 mil which was a hundred percent gain because i got the kvd pet i staked my bank and i won thank you thank you so much with my newly acquired cash i thought it was fit to spend a lot of money on bible so i got myself 99 construction and crafting i'm now 26 30 total and i don't think i'll be looking to max until i'm poor again so this episode we're gonna go pet hunting forward slash guns chili slight issue with the whole slayer bossing thing i don't have an average assembler i must have lost them when i was doing spider pet hunting so i'm gonna go get one i don't know how fast that was but it's pretty fast oh pv mate one minute six i doubt i'll beat that anytime soon easy clappington i have my head back and i made uh 2.3 mill going for that cool all right now i can start slayer bossing brother i have no idea what i'm doing all right i think i got the hang of this now i actually died earlier but this kills seem to be going quicker now and uh the loot's still terrible i'm gonna die again i don't like brav gear discord said don't bring food and i'm just perishing uh there's feet gun chili has nits wait what i'm going back brother who just said i hadn't knit i've not heard the word nits in a knits boy the knit head louse lice don't run away why are you running hey elite clue what clues do i already have let's have a look i already have a ma oh i know what this is i don't want to open it i know what this clue is i have to get 85 fire making and i'm if i make it to my lower scale i'm 75 i just don't want to get the phoenix man not while i'm this rich i don't mind getting the phoenix when i'm poor but i can't win man my twitch chat are having a go at me they're calling me a and i've got a which means okay i'm gonna go and do i'm gonna go and do winter todd and get 85 firemaking i have a life expectancy of 11 days all right here's the plan i've done 75 to 80 so i've only got to get five more i'm saving up all the crates and i'll open them when i'm done with the level all right fire making is no longer my lowest skill now it's got 86 i doubt i'll come back here until i uh want to max i now have to open 85 crates the pets one in 5k so outside in my favor of not getting it all right how many should i do 10 each time okay here we go we'll do 10 at a time how many do i have i can't count it's quite a lot though okay here we go all right round one over we're safe so far don't troll me if someone stands under me with the pet i'm not gonna be happy all right about 40 done here and i've only gotten two broomer torches so far ah warm gloves cool that's my first set of though so that's nice i'm gonna spam click these ones you ready i got a tone of fire on the first one suck it iron man how much is this 700k let's let's go pogbas hello only to those with an iron man i am against chile's ironman and i approve this content oh yes i got i got one thank goodness i say so a bit of context i'm trying to get six crystal armor seats on my iron man or a blade of zelda whatever comes first i'll go to tob i think if i get a blade and if i get six armor seeds i'll go and do sarah and then inferno after oh let's go oh man first kill of the day third one nearly there man just three to go what no way back to back and double drop thanks for watching the iron man clips next time on meanwhile on the iron we will try and get all six armor seeds and then go and kill sarah they get in front of cape and then freedom all right this ain't over yet back to crates i hate this there's no pet good it's over i finished i made 1.79 mil which is pretty nice um now to do this master clue all right got a boost and skill challenge completed what is that i think i'm cooked here boys i have to plant a spirit tree i've planted myself i've never planted one on this account and i think it takes like two days um so i'm gonna have to go plant one somewhere twitch chat coming in clutch apparently i can plant one in my player and house and it grows instantly too so we're going to go do that what do you mean i can't use my quest cave i just what do you mean all right who's the culprit what ques what have i got to do like some a porcupine of interest hmm oh you just luged in my face quest down point crown of interest thousand slayer i got 30 slayer points for doing that that's cool thank you now i can yeah a spirit tree and fairy ring done may i have the perky snips right first let's just clear the public chat then we open the clue all right guys this is the last clue of the day until i get another elite clue from grotesque guardians so let's see what we get that's actually very nice look at that 500k ah you killed my wife i will not put you in the fire which you can i've left you some space though just at the north oh it's got 94 slater i did not know i was near a level i got so confused there and now i'm the task's nearly over i just got my first unique a granite hammer all right that's the task done i actually ended up getting two granite hammers um and i spent like 11 hours here so i guess my neck this video that you're watching is probably filler just a warning ooh we got a boss task okay maybe this episode has a redemption arc and i get the smoke dab with repair i'm aware this is not the smoke devil i'm doing some gauntlet um because i bought a blade of cell door from the ge i i did like 600 corrupted gauntlets when i last got cleaned on this account and i never got the blade so i'm just gonna buy one myself now and uh i'm gonna use it against the thermonuclear smoke devil probably do one or two more after this what the hell oh i didn't have it scrolled eight shots good nice that's um how many charges now 1700. okay i have 3700 charges here that's more than enough uh a lot of people asked in previous videos why i don't make the red blade and keep it forever i just feel like it's kind of cheating the series if i do it and also you can actually revert it you just don't get any shards back so i would be able to sell it if i got it blue blade gang for life let's go seven kills haven't got a pet yet why honestly the most uneventful slayer task of my life i i i have nothing to show for it apart from completion hey dagonauts nice am i getting crashed in the current year at dragon of kings  off uh sickle head it's been a pretty uneventful task so far to be honest this is the last drop i got from the task a warrior ring at 375 kc all right we've got another slayer boss task to do 143 hellhounds so i'm going to go off and do some cerberus oh nice gonna hand this one into watson for now and do a master clue later 96 attack now pretty getting kind of close to max melee i just got a four defense levels and three attack to go some of you just about missed it oh  i i was recording on the you guys aren't going to believe this man i was while i was recording on the old screen instead of the main i got a prim crystal 622kc i wasn't i i was recording on the wrong account that's ruined no boot edit because i ruined no no boot edit till pet 30 mil that's gonna look nice in the loot tap 510 tasks done in a row that's been my best boss task so far it puts my bank way above uh 500 mil again we're probably about 5 15 mil bank total value now i've always done a week's worth of slayer and i had only made six mil until this point but now we have a 38.2 mil slayer tab oh no way no way i didn't know that was coming nice 99 magic cool and the next task i suppose this is one of the skill capes worth buying because you can change your spell book i think once a day with it [Music] oh i got a smouldering stone cool i'm not recording again oh i'm recording on the wrong account bruv sake okay well there we go i got a smoldering stone second time i've done that why can't i just organize my life damn it 1.6 mil cool i got an elite clue let's go oh i got 96 defense let's go uh joral okay i'll start from the crafting guild so i can pick up my spade and my strange device uh it's not a bloodhound but it is a jungle demon mask and a samurai casa two uniques all right let's see what we get wow 30th clue 300k i can die and be happy actually i don't want to die here although kimasu is a nice way if you die dying here now is like really bad because it cut like with this gear i think i yeah i think i have to pay like 400k if i die your ass is mine massive spec why what do you mean i'm dead i prayed accordingly no please oh damn it i have 44 left like i'm just gonna yeah i'll just keep this i think until the task over i'll i'll go do this master clue now 243k wow i am once again at forecast on tasks this time whoa i got a head nice all right that's the task over pretty uneventful but i made 15 mil in loot so that's vodka for you my friends i have a side task all right we're like 70 kills into this task so far and to be honest i'm enjoying it um i have like almost 5 000 kills on my main without the pet so i'm technically dry a pet here but uh i just got an elite clue all right let's open this casket am i recording yeah let's go i got one unsided 334 kc one in 25 chance to get the pet now was i recording the actual drop itself no of course not why because i was recording my alts point of view once again because i'm a not only was i not recording i'm gonna have to show you an irl clip of me dunking the unside in the pool because my obs decided to corrupt on that clip where i put the inside in but lucky for you guys you didn't miss much i got a jar as you can see by my face i was quite disappointed and my chat found it hilarious which i didn't all right 350 done not long to go now all right that's the task over we did get an inside this trip but we don't want to talk about it all right we killed 213 it took a a fair amount of time but i did manage to make 10.4 mil without really getting any unix aside from the jar the slayer tab looks pretty good to be fair 73.6 mil about two weeks of slayer so far done i feel like it's been pretty slow progress so far this video despite spending two weeks straight slaying my bank value is still 520ml which is awesome i've really been enjoying pvming having access to gear and i know it won't last long mmm back to back or demons i guess i'll do more siam no way foreign
