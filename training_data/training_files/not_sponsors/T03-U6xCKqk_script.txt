you think my knees are crusty thank you boy are you kidding me these and jeans of super satisfied hey guys and welcome to today's PvP challenge we have another auction video because it's what you guys want we know you guys love it I've been asked for it so much in live streams in the comments section so here it is so today it is all 70 plus items we know there are 13 items in total there is gonna be a total of 4 weapons covering all combat styles and the gear is also gonna cater to all three of those combat styles so today the twist is and there's always a twist is that it is going to be a silent auction in the sense where we don't know what each other bid so for example if link bid 7 and I bid 5 all I know is that link bid more than me he one link has no idea what I bid all he knows that I bid less than him link pays the 7 mil and I have no idea how much you spent I just know it's more than 5 so that's gonna be the premise we start with 28 swordfish for the final fight although this time around as suggested in the comments section every meal you have leftover you were able to cash in for a shark to replace one of those swordfish for the final fight so there actually will be some strat and having some cash left over but again we're not gonna know each other's cash stack through the entirety of this episode but first let's filmora for sponsoring today's video I know what you're gonna say man I'm gonna ask you how you're feeling it's another challenge totally footbeds I have no idea how to deal with it but you know the auction videos have been kind eyes are I can lose another one so let's fire in and let's see our first item we both have 50 milli let's do it all right here we go like oh my god Oh blast and we do the same thing here with no with the wiki so we can't

oh my god oh my god I guess we both get spirit shield why alright I actually did not say this I only want to say if it happened in the rare case where we both say the exact same amount we both get the

let's do this and as always guys there is an upload over on links channel the exact same time that this one goes live where we actually found 28 items from killing monsters and then we swapped 10 of them so the goal is to get the worst items pretty much and then when we swaps it was a very low tier fight but honestly guys fun is how it was it was it was good go check it out after this one you definitely don't want to miss it they'll be talking about that one for a while anyways so we are in the duel arena just because we don't want to be risking like 70 mil each because if you actually have been crashed before so decide to play this one safe we're not changing the location this is just a one-off sort of thing but like just full disclosure I'm a bit nervous of my high burning skills in situations like this oh yeah I'll respect that I'm ready you ready okay I mean as ready as I'll ever be honestly okay so we [ __ ] sake to you what the hell what am I doing with my life my god oh oh no what do I get okay okay [ __ ] bag yes this is gonna be bad okay yeah the recoil doing what it should be doing I mean haven't hit much yet so I sure hope so link oh no it's not oh-ho-ho-ho-ho
