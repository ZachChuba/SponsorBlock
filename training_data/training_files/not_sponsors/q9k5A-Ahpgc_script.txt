hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with sweet potato gnocchi that's right i'm going to show how to
produce little pillows of pasta using a sweet potato which is gonna be a lot of
fun and pretty easy and since we're using the orange flash sweet potato i
was just about to say also nutritious let that i remember we're gonna be
saucing this with a bacon butter so I guess we'll put good for in the
maybe column but definitely fun easy beautiful and most importantly delicious
so with that let's go ahead get started by taking 1 large sweet potato and
performing the old pokken roast which just means taking a sharp knife and
pricking the skin all over before we roast this until it's completely tender
which I like to do in the microwave since it's fast and easy but could
also of course do this in the oven ok it really doesn't matter as long as when
you're done it is very very very soft which we will know for sure by poking
with a knife and then what we'll do once this is cool enough to handle although
still very warm is go ahead and split that in half and then using a spoon
we'll go ahead and scoop all that gorgeous orange flesh into a bowl oh and
I should mention these orange ones are often sold as yams at the store purely
for marketing purposes but they're not they're actually just orange flesh sweet
potatoes and while any variety will work these orange ones are clearly the most
beautiful and from what I hear the most nutritious and that's it once all that
flesh has been scooped and scraped from the skin we'll go ahead and take a
potato masher and smash this nice and smooth which can definitely do in a
food processor but it's been my experience that cleaning a food
processor is way harder than this and while using a machine we'll get this a
little smoother with just a couple minutes of mashing with a hand tool this
is gonna be plenty smooth and then once that set we'll go ahead and add one
optional ingredient a nice spoon of ricotta cheese and if don't have it
or don't want to add it this will still work but I do think these are a little
nicer with a little touch of that in there we will also toss in one large
beaten egg as well as of course some salt and definitely a few shakes of our
good old friend cayenne pepper and then what we'll do is take a spoon and give
this a very thorough mixing until all of those ingredients are thoughtfully
combined and as far as simple everyday meditations go really can't beat
stirring something together alright scientists can't explain it but
really does make feel better but anyway once we have that well mixed and
we're feeling nice and relaxed well go ahead and add some all-purpose flour and
we'll continue mixing with the spoon all right sort of slowly at first if for
no other reason than so we don't knock all the flour out of the bowl and then
once that flour does start to get incorporated we can begin to stir a
little more aggressively and basically we're gonna keep stirring until the
mixture comes together and we think we can switch to working it with our hands
and by the way if have to add a little more flour for that to happen go
ahead and once we've reached that point we'll go ahead and transfer that from
the bowl to our work surface which is the surface upon which we work in our
entire game plan here is to just work in enough flour with some very gentle
kneading and massaging until we achieve a dough that we're able to roll out into
like half-inch thick ropes and if the dough seems too wet and it's sticking to
the table or to your hands just add some more flour until it stops doing those
things and while it is true this stuff would be easier to work with if we added
a ton of flour that would also make our gnocchi very dry and heavy and tough
whereas what we really want with these is something that's moist and relatively
tender so right about here my dough is feeling pretty good so I stopped and
formed into some kind of uniform shape at which point I'd dusted it with flour
and then grabbed my bench scraper so I could cut it into quarters to begin the
rolling process and since it had been a while since I made these with this first
piece I made two major mistakes all right first of all I applied way too
much flour which means there was not enough friction for this dough to grip
the table and my hands so I didn't have enough of what we call in the business
gription okay when use that much flour the dough just kind of slides
through it or as we say snow plows as I continue to just blatantly make up
culinary terms and then the other mistake is this piece was too big as I
think 1/8 of this dough there's probably a much easier size to roll out so I cut
it in half but anyway I kept at it and eventually I did obtain enough gription
to get this thing to roll out which generally we want to do in a direction
from the center out towards the ends I'm sure there were a few hiccups along the
way all right some spots still had too much flour while other spots were too
sticky and needed more flour but as know we never let the food
win so I just kept at it and a couple minutes later I managed to roll this out
into about a half inch thick rope or as my grandmother used to call it snake oh
and for your information each roll I did after this one got a little easier and
came out a little better so why didn't I film one of those well as the kids used
to say to keep it real and once we do have that rolled out into a fairly
uniform rope or snake we'll go ahead and dust the top with flour and then using
our bench scraper which we should also flour well go ahead and cut these about
every half inch to make some beautiful little gnocchi and if I thought my
muscle memory was bad when it came to roll in the dough that was nothing
compared to me trying to cut these I mean it really does look like I've never
done this before but like I said the second one did go a lot better both with
the rolling and the cutting which is why I'm gonna show to redeem myself a
little bit oh yeah now we got the hang of it
and now that was not sped up I'm insulted by your question and sure if
want to roll your ropes a little thicker and cut these into a little
bigger pieces go ahead alright as long as they're fairly consistent the size is
up to I mean are after all the Chuck D of your gnocchi
but personally when it comes to this sweet potato version I think nice little
small ones are the way to go okay I just think the final texture is a little
better and as we finish these what we'll want to do is transfer those onto some
kind of floured pan making sure they're nicely spaced and not touching at which
point I like to let them sit and air dry for at least 15 or 20 minutes before we
try to boil them and of course can make these ahead and pop them in the
fridge but I was hungry so I decided to enjoy some right now and while those
arrested we can go ahead and bring some salted water up to a boil as well as
prepare whatever sauce we're gonna finish these with which for me is gonna
be some bacon infused butter although it's really probably more like a butter
infused bacon but anyway what I did was slice up a few strips of bacon and brown
it up in a pan over medium heat at which point I transferred in some butter that
we can just simply let melt or if we want we can actually toast it a little
bit until it turns sort of a golden brown and takes out a little bit of a
nuttier flavor all right brown butter is a very common
sauce for gnocchi and I like to do it both ways all right it depends on my
mood many of them once we're happy with our
butter we can go ahead and turn off the heat and finish this by stirring in some
freshly minced rosemary or with some other sweet potato friendly herb like
sage or maybe time and that's it we'll stir that in and simply reserve that
until our gnocchi are cooked which I'm gonna go ahead and do right now and
please make sure this water is well salted all right the water should taste
like seawater or as the Italians say making sure the water tasted like a
seawater sorry I'm not fluent but anyway we'll go ahead and transfer our gnocchi
in and then we'll give them a quick stir and as we do you're gonna notice two
things these are all gonna sink to the bottom but also turn into the most
beautiful orange color you've ever seen all right check that out and then what
we're gonna do is cook these for about three or four minutes or until they
float okay that's how can tell when they're done and if they do float you
know have a properly manioc e and if they don't float they're witches but
don't worry they always float and once they do we'll go ahead and transfer
those into whatever sauce were using and we'll go ahead and turn our heat back on
to medium or maybe a little higher if want to fry these a little bit and
that's it once these are heated with our sauce we are pretty much ready to serve
and it's probably not a bad idea to give these a little more salt oh and by the
way if did want to fry these a little more aggressively over higher
heat you'll probably want to use a nonstick pan for that because these can
stick but I'm not gonna fry mine I'm just gonna cook these stirring for about
a minute before turning off the heat and finishing up with some freshly grated
parmesan and that's it my adorable little sweet potato gnocchi are done and
ready to serve up and hopefully a warm bowl and once I had spewed in what is
basically an appetizer sized portion I went ahead and finished with a little
more cheese as well as the obligatory sprig of rosemary for the pictures and
after taking a few of those I grabbed a fork and dug in and those my friends
really were lovely and I was very happy with how they came out
okay because I was careful not to work too much flour in they were not super
dense and dry and chewy okay they stayed nice and moist and tender and again I
think one of the keys here is making these nice and small just in case maybe
worked in a little too much flour or maybe work the dough a little too much
and as far as the flavors go that earthy subtle sweetness from the sweet potato
works so well with the bacon and also that little touch of rosemary and of
course copious amounts of butter and Parmesan never hurts and while this
really was an ultra simple way to enjoy these they don't really need a lot of
help to shine but having said that these would work in your favorite pasta sauce
whether that is a simple tomato based marinara or maybe a rich and decadent
gorgonzola cream sauce oh yeah that would be good or really anything you'd
serve regular potato gnocchi with and right here I was trying to cut one in
half so can see the texture inside but they're too small so you'll just
have to trust me and as fantastic and appetizer as this makes do not be afraid
to use this as a side dish all right especially since can boil
these ahead of time and then just heat them up in the pan or whatever you
cooked is your main course whether that's a pork chop or a piece of chicken
or a steak or whatever but anyway whether serve these as a side dish
or as an appetizer or a main course the important thing is that serve them
which is why I really do hope give these a try soon so please follow the
