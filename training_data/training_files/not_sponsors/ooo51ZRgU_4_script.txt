alright I'm gonna do it I'm finally gonna do it I'm gonna give pixel-art a proper go granted I've sort of done pixel art before but not proper pixel art there's a long time I think was like three years ago I did a pixel animation challenge trying to do pixel art animation aside from I guess the bead video which looked like pixel art and I feel like is constructed in a similar way to how pixel art is constructed I haven't done proper pixel art that's also not true because any digital art is technically pixel art pixel art is a form of digital art created through the use of software where images are edited on the pixel level there are different saving impression modes there's isometric non isometric let's just jump straight into getting inspired deviantART on there we go this this is the sort of thing that I actually when I see pixel art I think is really cool these environments in particular I mean obviously that's a traditional art environment the house here by are this RGB fumes and then when you compare it to this one again by the same artist really talented a very different style and obviously very limited in scope as far as how you can create it a lot less detail but some find the simplicity of pixel art and especially the nostalgia I think you get looking at it because it takes you back to Game Boy games and and 8-bit and 16-bit games on the computer pixel as well there's really cool ways where when it's used effectively really does make use of minimalism and aesthetic and nostalgia to just make something really pretty also devianart I'm reminded is a very very strange place at all I feel like exploring the dark weird places on deviantART should be a video on the same let me know what you think in the comments do I dare oh my god whoa okay that's for another time and black I want to see what is a good introduction to pixel art and also how to make a great pixel on character or environment I really love that isometric soul so I dive into a bit of that but as this video is my proper dive into pixel art I want to see what proper pixel artists use what are the saw art industry standards or the community go tune that will be beneficial to learn about and try out today which is why I'm excited this video is sponsored by skill share because they have some pixel art courses so I'll have a bit of a guide in hand in that way and the benefit is as there are a variety of classes they also show using variety of programs on how to make pixels now if you haven't checked out Skillshare they have over 30,000 classes an illustration drawing design and more they are a long time friend of the channel so if you are interested in developing one of the skill sets that you have that you want to improve on all learning something new I encourage you to check out Skillshare and to do so they have actually provided you with two months of free premium school chair membership so I'll put the link in the description go check them out for free for two months error many many thousands of other courses on skill chair for business to illustration to how to build an Instagram following - how to edit and use lighting - how to do pixel art they have a great way of participating in classes and getting feedback from your fellow students to really enable you to engage in the learning process and I'm hoping that you enjoy going on the journey with me so in getting started I followed a course by Matthews called pixel art fundamentals create pixel art for games here at lies the fundamentals in a really clear way so it was really really useful to follow along with now most useful was how to set up Photoshop as it picks a lot tool by changing some parameters to make the process easier however if you want to learn pixel art and you don't want to pay for Photoshop there are plenty of artists and communities who recommend things like critter and there are the courses on Skillshare that teach them using those programs and of course as mentioned there are some other free online pixel art tools now I followed along with Mathias as demonstrations of the basics of drawing straight lines on any angle to understanding anti-aliasing and the basics of flat shading and diffusing hard edges slightly softening some shading or harsh edges and then I followed along with the part about dithering which is it turns out a way to use two different colors mix different densities of patterns of those two colors in various pixels to make it look like they're blending to a certain extent and depending on the density of the pattern it also of course affects how strong the color looks or how much towards one color it looks like a go so this can be used to create some called gradient effects or to soften the edges of some shading now it's worth mentioning this because I did follow along and do the dithering that he demonstrated in the video which was really worthwhile because it definitely came in useful later especially when putting together my phone it was the end of the lessons he demonstrated how tile sets were and his class project was to participate by making a tile set and a character your own so thought I'd join in I rolled up my sleeves and I got stuck into it starting off with an isometric grid now there are plenty of different ways to present pixel art environment from top-down orthogonal or planimetric however I've always found the isometric game art to be super satisfying we had games like rollercoaster tycoon or the early version of The Sims however I think my appreciation for it probably stems back to my obsession back in the day with the Diablo games Diablo 1 & 2 especially then with the recent announcement and trailers for Diablo for having just come out I thought it would be fun to attempt a tile set and character inspired by Diablo imagining what the game might have looked like if it were developed for the SNES [Music] now I figure the best tileset would be some sort of a dungeon and the task of the project was to create two tile sets and to create border tiles that blended between the two so in line with my theme I chose the stone dungeon floor to blend with the lava rivers of Hell started off going nice and easy on myself basically following the isometric grid I initially drew and tweaked her patterns until I had an organic looking randomly alternating tile set and it's worth mentioning having two views visible was absolutely crucial as you can see I had the repeated pattern constantly zoomed out and referenced on the left while I focused on the super zoomed in pixel II canvas and every time I say zoomed out version would refresh and I would constantly see what worked and what didn't next came the lava and I followed a similar method but this time I sort of drew a wavy grid to the lava flow referencing my isometric grid lines so that I had something to anchor myself to specifically where the pattern would stop and would loop with the other side of the tile but otherwise I kept my lines really wavy an organic and I broke it up with some lines in between and generally just sort of made it a bit more flowing and then it was time to get stuck into the shady to make it look as lovely as possible [Music] [Music] [Music] next I needed to create a bunch of transition tiles from the stone to the lava and first I needed to figure out how the patterns would collide I started playing with the sort of a cliff overhanging drop over the lava as if the floor was loading over the lava but in the end I opted for more of a river look at the edges of the bricks visible and slightly tipping down into the river of fire which allowed me to create some nice contrast dark shadows on the side of the bricks with the earth underneath and some sharp cool orange yellow highlights where the lava collides with the ground then I had to repeat the process with some other transitional tiles now I was already nearing the end of day 1 on this project at this point so I couldn't realistically do transitional tile for every angle inside so I decided to stick to the tiles that would allow me to create a pool of lava along the bottom of the image of two straight tiles and two curved tiles and I just repeated the same process for each of the tiles from start to finish just drawing from that brick stone ground as a base and this was a pretty time-consuming process but I actually really enjoyed it especially because I just chucked on the original soundtrack to Diablo 2 to get in the mood and oh my god did I get [Applause] with the tow set finally Anastasia was satisfied with I laid out the edge of a lava river in the dungeon map style and then got started on some props now for this I followed a different course namely making an item set in pixel art by Simon Sanchez on Skillshare a short but sweet and straight to the point class which I followed closely when creating my first potion with some minor tweaks to suit my scale and the isometric view then I moved on to trying to make a prop without any references and of course what would any RPG or dungeon be without it the most important of all features is epic loot [Music] finally with enough props and play space to feel substantial it was time to move on to the hero of our journey and I started off with a silhouette first facing the treasure but the angle was a bit awkward and I pretty quickly realized that making a hero facing away from us would be kind of lame but I tweaked him to be facing down and then after refining the silhouette and adding blocks of color I got stuck into the shading and coloring highlights and finishing touches or I guess you could say finishing torches you get it because you saw that your thoughts oh my it is truly dodge in hell and very spooky but hey check this out there's epic loot so here it is this is my finished pixel art creation I'm really proud of this the crazy thing is I only just realized this this is super zoomed in this is what it looks like at 100% I guess when you work on a per pixel basis you forget how small everything is now I did compose it to be like an image I wanted it to feel like a final scene or part of gameplay or whatever but because I took inspiration from Diablo and that obviously has a very sort of vignette 'add aesthetic in a very dark tone it ended up sort of sapping a lot of variety in color out of the the actual parts so I separately laid out all of the parts there just so you can see the tiles I created individually the little props over here and then the character himself I actually want to save this and submit it I spent so long in this I feel like I need to put it out there I want to blow this up but if I do this just at a guess let's say 1000 pixels and by the default expansion settings you can see it sort of starts to look a bit fuzzy I don't use a bit of logic here I'm gonna multiply the size by 4 in theory that means one pixel will turn into four pixels Matt yeah and though it's still fuzzy if I set quality from bicubic to nearest-neighbor look at that nice and crisp expanded pixel art that actually worked perfectly I've learned stuff and I want to thank you for watching it if you enjoyed this video please like it so other people can see it and see the whole fun experience of making the pixel art that we did today and of course subscribe for more fun with art creativity and all sorts of shenanigans zero more videos over there which you might enjoy I recommend checking them out but that's it for now and until next time I'll see you later
