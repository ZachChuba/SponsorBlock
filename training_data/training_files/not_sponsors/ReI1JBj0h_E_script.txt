player in the super san francisco shock uh well honestly i'm gonna i'm gonna be rude with you i think uh you know tank players they're you gotta be the smartest player in the team i'm smart are you really i can play chess oh really yeah and mine is sleeping what what's your chest elo are you a grandmaster uh yes really in my technician's heart yes do you know any openings yes such as i know many openings many many many much openings so many openings that you can't even um you know you can't even fathom you know what i'm saying i know all sorts of openings there is an opening called the sicilian defense and you you move the pawns okay and yeah you you make [ __ ] how you make okay black takes control of the d4 squares of the pawn from the side thus the imbalance the position that avoids giving white a central target i want to be honest i played two games on chess.com and i lost both and my elo is like 120 so i can't really make fun of you too much when it comes to chess but i don't think i'm too bad honestly aha yeah yeah we can play chess together sometimes if you want i don't think you would you little 20 years boy i just don't think you would ah i like your confidence little boy oh my gosh should not call you little boy that sounds super weird yeah i'm a grown man actually but so would you what would you prefer if all games were from king's row so that you can play better yeah you have more chances of winning well i mean i i've win a lot of stuff outside of outside of king's row yeah favorite map i mean come on what is that i mean it is king's row but that doesn't mean that's exclusively what i do uh-huh okay okay it just means i prefer prefer right i enjoy it yes yes yes if you if king's row was a sexual orientation that's the only thing that you'd [

people believe what do you think about right now this interview i guess so your thoughts are completely empty yeah basically so no this is like a legitimate question now wow okay why do you get benched so much well so much is kind of uh an exaggeration i would i would i would reckon um however it does happen on occasion okay you know from time to time yeah why is everyone saying smurf oh that's that's the uh that's the other tank player on my team yeah and we play the same role oh so sometimes he'll play uh you know specific heroes and then i'll play [Music] specific heroes uh-huh and then we you know we swap if you will you guys are a switch to each other yes exactly we're a switch oh i see i see so it's more better it depends who you ask i vegetate a lot kind of you know like lay around you know people don't believe this i actually before covet i used to go to the gym but people don't believe that for some reason i'm not sure why people think that's like a joke um but i did go to the gym sorry what happened was there like a joke or something yeah you just told me you went to the gym [ __ ] yeah anyways so like i was saying um before covet i would you know sometimes i would go to the gym because you know it was uh fun right you know you got to exercise and you got to you know stay healthy and then covet happen and then the gyms got shut down and then i haven't gone in a while and then basically ever since then i kind of just vegetate i sit in my room and uh i don't really do anything you know what i mean you know you're talking to a bunch of coomers i mean yeah can we comb at the gym no can we comb at the sidewalk no can we comb in our rooms okay don't worry about it are you single yeah why [Music] because i don't leave my room why because you said you you said you went to the gym oh before yeah that was before kovid yeah you're you're not a loser [Music] i mean i still play overwatch in 2010 yeah which is basically a loser that's okay hey look that's okay because you know i'm content with that you know what i mean yeah i agree i like i like sitting on the bench too at the park wow no you do look great yeah i thought i looked pretty good there actually auga look at your legs yeah i actually shaved my legs for that wow i went all out for that yeah you definitely don't go never mind super is a real sunday listen chad it's not like i did this for you guys because this is so cute okay first of all i don't have chicken legs either i saw that one person that i don't have chicken legs okay i mean let's define chicken legs for a second this is this is your legs right um yeah i mean that yes in those pictures yes they are okay and then um so this is chicken legs uh-huh okay that that is a that is a chicken leg yeah i don't look like that right um um i don't think you know i think it looks pretty good well i can slightly see the resemblance but uh uh you know i wouldn't go that far but you know slightly see it but i i think it's like uh more like a 90 double ganging you know not not a hundred what i mean i don't know when but what is the next time you're gonna you're gonna win the overwatch league well the season is on hiatus so where i don't know i don't know when when it's gonna you know when is it gonna come back well i don't know a few months maybe i don't know anything everything does nothing they don't i'm convinced blizzard doesn't like me at all actually but what do you mean why not because i think they dislike me what do you mean why you gotta tell me why you know why because they always have these like featured events thing with like they have like they have like a skin or like an event coming out they're like feature streamers or whatever and then they never they never want to feature me there that's why and it hurts my feelings because i think they don't like me it's true okay what are some things that you like to do besides overwatch and going to the gym um and minecraft interesting i like how you just stroke your beard when you're thinking yeah honestly that's probably the biggest reason why i don't want to shave it is because i'm so i'm so used to like touching it because like you know i never like grow a beard before so like i kind of just like to you know what i mean is it like it's like is it like your own boobies because that's kind of what girls do with what the girls they just like yeah all the time all the time what do you think we got like two fat stacks to put you know upon our chest like you don't think we just like play with it sometimes so like like in the way like a guy would stroke their beard you would just like start you just start like you know what like like that yeah boobas any questions for me oh sorry there was a streaker yeah i was about to say what the anyways all go live sorry yeah is he good yeah he's fine well i'm yeah oh no but yeah do you actually play overwatch i still can't tell i think you were lying to me why don't you believe me well okay because you

everybody plays overwatch no they don't yes they don't everybody plays overwatch everybody cosplay says diva do you think you can go pro in any other game if i really tried really hard maybe like if i if i put in like the same hours that i put into overwatch what game would you go pro in isn't like the the right answers like league of legends because then like everyone you know you get like super popular and you get super rich and then you get like a bunch of girls that like you isn't that the same with overwatch if you were to have a normal job what would it be when i was younger i wanted to be a doctor if you're a doctor you have to actually always be on the operating table okay but you'll always be batched so no i don't think i would trust you [ __ ] it first of all being a doctor does not mean that you're a surgeon okay you can be like any other kind of doctor you don't have to be like a neurosurgeon or something nothing you know what kind of doctor are you gonna be i don't know when i was just younger i was like i'm gonna be a doctor that's cool and then but you know i don't really put any thought into it did you know that doctor is just a bench surgeon is that true i mean think about it uh no you're mistaken that wasn't me what did what do you prefer more ellen or jimmy fallon well i didn't go on ellen so so if you could have went to one to ellen which one would you prefer jimmy or ellen isn't the shelter cancelled i was about to say isn't she kind of like a weirdo she got cancelled what's wrong with striker striker one yeah what are you trying to say yeah i if
