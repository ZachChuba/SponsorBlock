in today's video once again we're testing out something you wanted to know what types of candy can we turn in to cotton candy [Music] alright guys we've done some stuff similar to this before but every time we do you guys ask to see more of it so we've got our cotton candy machine and we have several types of non cotton candy and we're gonna see if we can turn one into the other here's the basic idea we've got several types of confections that we haven't yet tested in our cotton candy machine and we're going to see how well they change from a solid state to a fluffy one you got quite a few different types of candy we've got several and most of them are based on comments but some of them are just based on what I thought would be fun to try yep so we're just going to start trying different types of candy we do have our little bullet blender here so we can powder eyes them somewhat and I think that gives us a better chance although the cotton candy sugar as it comes in the container is not very fine so it'll be great there's a reason we've intentionally left things as sort of larger pieces in the past is it works pretty good if you have the right kind of materials but just to give everything in decent chance I think for the most part we are going to go with fairly small powder what do you want to start with okay so I do want to address something real quick you got a lot of different types of candy at the store now bottle caps is one that was just all over like I don't know why that wasn't a comment but it was Pixy Stix I get why you want to see that one it's already a powder yeah what happens if you just pour Pixy Stix in there you had mentioned that you've got a lot of candies because they're already powdery however I have my doubts that those are gonna work best because to make cotton candy the sugar has to dissolve and then sort of string up now I found in the past when we've done this with everything from tights of juice to sodas we try to coffee one once it worked okay the more powdery something is doesn't necessarily mean it's going to work better it might pour into the machine but we need something with more of a granulated sugar substance for it to work so something I'm doing right now I'm checking the ingredients of all these candies and honestly most of them the main ingredient is dextrose which is a type of sugar but it's not the same type of sugar that we just normally use so this just says sugar which means it's probably sucrose and word we're just gonna try we don't know if that's gonna make a big difference or not so like bottle caps and sweet tarts those are powders that are compressed really hard into a candy shape no if that's how the lifesaver mints are made these ones have sugar and corn syrup as the first ingredients that we've had success with that before as are the cinnamon hard candies corn syrup and sugar but most of the rest of these are dextrose so it'll be interesting to see what I'm going to call it now those are gonna do better anything with dextrose is the first ingredient I don't think it's gonna do as well try bottle caps I think we should separate out by flavor so that's not a ton but that is about the amount of sugar that gets put into the Machine at once if you're just trying to make some cotton candy so I think as a start this will be a good amount you can taste it right out of the air I'm just feeling really sad for a purple and very upset about orange okay pretty whisper free that just sort of blew away Oh see me wisps I see dust in the air I just dropped in three unbroken bottle caps and I don't know what that's gonna do we poured in all of the red powder and we got like no cotton candy anything out of it you're about to see more red powder in this cuz I'm just gonna break open a whole lot of Pixy Stix in here ready for you a giant pile of dust it's gonna be a cloudy and some of that mist did not land in the machine properly I tried I did my best it's not exactly a funnel shape [Music] well there we go a little bit's little bits all right you want to give this a taste with me this massive quantity of pixie stick it is our okay look the flavors fantastic get to pixie stick brush my teeth oh that's got to teach offal we're going to double the triple that I did last time ha ha Kelly no sneeze yeah bless yeah we didn't have any success when we blended our bottle caps now I'm singing because these are so powdery the Smarties are gonna react kind of similarly I'm just gonna toss a whole handful this is an entire pack of Smarties may weigh over balance the Machine let's find out I got most of them in there now as I reached in I felt like oh yeah oh ow oh don't do that also I don't know why he did it set out and then I immediately had to follow suit but I did also this time I just put the cone right there yeah and look what built up on it burning hot dextrose so it's clearly melting the Smarties and spraying it out but the dextrose doesn't form into strands the same way so this is what we end up with Tic Tacs first ingredient is sugar the second ingredient is Malevich stryn okay so I think we're just gonna take this little handful of orange tic tacs again I wanted to do all one color for the you know keeping everything consistent and I'm just gonna throw these tic tacs in and see what they do one don't watch the corn across the room it smells like orange tic tacs that's good let's try like mad some chunks and some powder and some that's nearly the same oh that's not like sour but not bad sour just a lot of sour that would be interesting Wow much lots of splatter we have made a lot of messes with cotton candy in our time but never quite like tick-tock this is the wispy esteem s use we have ever had I especially like the build up that's happened on the sides of our cotton candy machine it's not like we'd normally when we are putting these in here it's not supposed to go in here we normally burn it this isn't burned it's just like gooey candy at this point that's pretty good little lifesavers this is it's not a texture I think will work but the ingredients maybe yeah look at that oh my happy day I got more so that's not quite as good of a result is real cotton candy sugar but it's still amazing pretty dang good did we just make mint cotton candy I think we made strong mint cotton candy - it's still going actually so the bigger pieces that didn't know are anyway going I'm not doing a good job of scooping it it's not like dispersing quite the same way as normal but look how light it is fluffy cloud like mint cotton candy mint clouds oh that's like eating a lot of breath mints at once that's intense I do a lot of breath mints on one that is minty very very minty that is very interesting and different and it works well Wow I'm gonna say the key is sugar yeah real sure not Jose these are corn syrup sugar natural and artificial flavor red for tea so it's mostly corn syrup and sugar which is what a lot of hard candy is made out of we've made it before it's worked so I want to try these I don't want to powder eyes them but I want to break them up into slightly smaller pieces so I'm just gonna whack them with a spoon I bet this is actually gonna work really well I bet we're gonna get some strong cinnamon cotton candy yes yeah so maybe not quite as cohesive and you know what they're bigger they're thicker yeah that's the corn syrup we've done in corn syrup like we cooked it just corn syrup by itself until there was a hard candy stage and then we put it in the machine and it does this it has like it's almost sparkly sheets rather than pure strands when we've made the old-time version of cotton candy this is what it was like it's brittle mmm and crunchy it doesn't Bend and squish the same way normal cotton candy does it just crunches and then dissolves before it starts dissolving you're almost worried it might like cut your tongue or something yeah but sharp it's like fiberglass oh [Music] okay more fluffy all right so last time we actually had the motor on but the heat turned off and so it was kind of cool and when we turn the heater back on we definitely are getting back to fluffy it's still not the same it does have that sort of like fibre glas.t texture but is fluffier comparatively relatively that's cotton candy compared to the cotton shards that is fluffy cotton candy like a good but not overpowering cinnamon flavor yep sugar corn syrup combinations those work and I think the first time we did this we used lifesavers and we found lifesavers were great Jolly Ranchers also worked pretty well although if I remember right the flavor with Jolly Ranchers is almost too strong we're willing to do more of this if you have more suggestions but it needs to be candy with sugar and corn syrup as the first ingredients no dextrose so if you have candy that follows that criteria let us know and we would totally dry this again [Music] well there is Saracen I did it magic guys that's not all you know we've always got more for you to see hit that box up at the top for our most recent video and we'll see in the next one talk to you then [Music]
