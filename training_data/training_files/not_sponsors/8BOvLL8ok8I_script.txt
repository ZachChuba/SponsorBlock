hey everyone today I'm going to be showing you my marble powered computer now the reason I'm making this video is for you to understand that the computers that you use in your regular life aren't just black boxes the processor that is the brains inside of there actually has very simple working parts and those simple working parts work together very quickly to create what we know as modern computers now our computers that we use today use electricity but you don't have to use electricity to make a computer you can use something else for example marbles so this is my clear slate board showing you how this works all it has is two switches here you can see that when this one moves it triggers this switch up here same is on this side and that just happens because these are connected in the back here so nothing exciting or special here now the computer works by dropping marbles from the top here now without any logic on the board here I can just put on these green little devices here and what they do is just transfer the marble to the next level so it starts here it travels down down down to the bottom and then it'll hit this switch and trigger the next one to go so so far this is very simple because I don't have any logic here now I can add something in here instead of these green devices here I can add something that I'm going to call a bit now the bit works like this in this setup when the bit is on the marbles can continue flowing but when the bit is off they're going to stop so I'll start it with it on and then it'll turn off once it switches the bit and off so you can see that by adding switches in here that can be either on or off then you can start to add some logic to this now when these bits are arranged in groups like this it's called a register and a register represents a number now let me show you how this can represent a number okay so in order to understand this or even think this is cool you have to first learn how to count in binary so in our modern way of writing numbers we use a base 10 meaning that we write 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then if we want to write 11 we basically write the number 1 and then we start over at 1 again so we keep a base 10 we know that this first number represents the number 10 and then we add 1 to that and that's 11 and then we can go up to 20 and then we write the number 2 there we know that that represents two number tens but with binary we don't go all the way up to 10 and the reason we don't do that is because we have to use bits and bits can only be on and off so we only have the number 2 to work with and so here's how you can use these bits to count in binary to represent a number so when the bits are off everything is at 0 but then when I turn this first row over to 1 that's the number 1 but you can see that I don't have any other choices with this top one I can just go back to 0 so this can be 0 or 1 but what I can also do is go to this next level so I say that when this next level is on this bit represents 2 and when this bit by itself is on the number is for when this bit by itself is on the number is 8 and when this one is on the number is 16 so to get the real number from this register you just add the numbers for each right-pointing bit for example this is 5 because 4 and 1 make 5 this is 16 because only the 16 one is on and everything else is 0 so you can see with the number of bits that I have here I can represent any number from 0 to 31 so the highest number would be when they're all on and that's 31 because 16 plus 8 plus 4 plus 2 plus 1 now once you learn how to count in binary then you can use this computer to count the number of balls that you have up here so let's see how many balls we have so without even having watched this or even knowing how many balls were up here or down here we can know the number of balls there were you can see just from reading this there were nine balls eight plus one and sure enough one two three four five six seven eight nine there's nine balls at the bottom now that we know we can count we can actually do a little more complex things like add numbers together so now I have two registers here and I'm gonna add this register to this one and I'm going to put the output in this register so let's just choose a number here let's turn this one to five and then let's turn this one to eight so I'm going to add a five plus eight and then I'm gonna put the output in this register let's start it okay let's check our result now in this register we can see that the number is 13 eight four and one 13 and that's correct five plus eight is 13 so you can see that we can start to do simple math which is marbles rolling down these switches here now we're gonna do eight minus five and store it and register B so this is eight this is five let's see what the result is okay so we can see the final result and this register here is 3 8 minus 5 is 3 that's correct now we can get even more complex and multiply numbers together so to do multiplication I need three registers register 1 register 2 and register 3 and register 1 I'm going to be using my green parts here as bits and so I have to switch direction if I want to off it looks like this if I want to on it looks like this so they permanently point one direction so let's start off by doing 3 so this is 3 times 2 let's see what the result is so at the end you can see in register 3 here the result is 6 so 3 times 2 equals 6 it's correct now we can also do other things like this like divide numbers or compare two numbers together and see which ones greater or less and because of this that means that using this device here we could actually do anything that a modern computer can do granted we have enough parts and we make it big enough but the problem with making a computer out of marbles like this is how long it takes to complete one cycle you can see how long it took for one marble to fall from the top to the bottom but computers can do this billions of times per second that's the magic of a modern computer a modern computer works the same way that this does except instead of a bit that can turn off and on like this it has transistors in it that can turn off and on meaning little echt Rissa T flow or make it stop but instead of 10 or 20 of these transistors it has billions and billions of them and it doesn't take a few seconds to complete a cycle but it can do a billions of times per second so the true magic of a computer is not that they're smart or can do complex things but they can do a lot of simple things quickly they can actually only even do one thing at a time but they can do those things so many times per second that is mind boggling now this type of device is called a Turing machine the first Turing machine was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing and it was named after him and since then computers haven't really changed at all they can do the same simple things but the only thing that's changed is how fast they can do them hey everyone thanks for out and thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
