Ear Zoom with Minnie! Hi~ Neverland~! This is Minnie~~~~ I'm going to read the story you guys sent me. You're gonna listen to me, right? The first story! I wonder what Minnie's Thai name means. What is your favorite Thai word? My Thai name is ' ณิชา ยนตรรักษ์ (Nicha Yontararak)'! 'Yontararak' is a last name. 'Nicha' means pure and clean. My favorite Thai word is....... Um.............. (She was confused with the words at a moment's notice) My favorite Thai word is 'รัก(rak)'!!! 'รัก means 'LOVE'~! Well... This word...... I rarely say "I love you" in Thai. If I say 'I love you' in Thai, I will do it with all my heart. It's a very meaningful and precious word to me. It's a word that I cherish very much. The second story! My mother is going to have an operation soon. So now I'm very scared and nervous. I used to cry alone at dawn and fall asleep exhausted. Every time I listen to your song 'For You' I feel comforted. Would you like to release a Korean version of 'for you'? I'd appreciate it if you could release it. Thank you for making the song. I'm always rooting for you, so cheer up. Thank you~ Thank you so much~ I'm so glad to hear my songs cheer you up. Thank you so much~ Cheer up~! The third story! Your voice is charming. Say "Jam tto-tto-tto-ee" in your charming voice. Jam tto-tto-tto-ee~ (What's that?) Actually, No 'Jam tto-tto-tto-ee~'! The answer is 'Jam Ja Jo tto-ee'~! Jam Ja Jo tto-ee~! The forth story! You speak five languages. Is there any language you want to learn from now on? Actually.... I..... I am not confident in Chinese and Japanese..... So~~~ I want to learn Chinese and Japanese harder. When we were doing "Uh-Oh".... We once sang "Uh-Oh" in Portuguese. It was more fun than I thought. So if I have a chance, I want to learn Portuguese. The last story! Your face is pretty. But what do you think is the prettiest part? My......................... Eyes~!! I don't have double eyelids. But I feel like I'm going to have double eyelids these days. The lines on my eyelids are getting darker and darker. I'm afraid I'll have double eyelids someday. You'll still like me even if I have double eyelids in my eyes, right? I was touched that you told me many stories. Although it was a short time, I read all the stories you sent me. I'll keep it in my heart. The most memorable story of all is... (Drum roll) The second story~! I will send a special gift to you~! Don't be too upset if you don't win. I like you Neverland~~~~~!! Always I love you~~~ Thank you~~~~~
