hello everybody and welcome back to a brand new progress video for my main account i have been making a lot of progress on this account over the last couple of weeks and we have gained a lot of experience in a very short amount of time now we did this by investing a ton of money into one of the most expensive training methods in the entire game but also one of the quickest i invested over 500 million gp into adamant darts and dragon darts no that was not a very efficient use of money yes there was a couple other methods that could have been nearly as good and cheaper but i didn't really realize that until after the point being though that we're spending a lot of money to level up skill up quickly so today we're going to figure out how much money i lost getting to a 99 fletching my prediction is it's going to be a lot anyway guys i hope you enjoyed the video if you do i always appreciate it if you leave the video like always helps out with the youtube algorithm thank you so much and let's get started now one diary i haven't done any of the parts to yet is the desert diary i didn't really feel inclined to do it even though i've had the requirements done for a long time now but i actually want the upgraded camulet which requires the desert hard diary so we're gonna go ahead and get that done with uh we got 2500 runecrafting experience i will take that there is the medium diary done pretty easy on that one as well and we're going to chuck that into room crafting of course my god we only have base 70s yet that's pretty sad catfight queen is bad i actually did not enjoy that very much but anyway we got the one kill count for the hard diary that was pretty much the hardest task and there we go there's the hard diary completed well at least we get the experience for finishing this up uh beyond the camelot i don't really know what else i'll be using here but there we go that's done now i've kind of set myself a goal of trying out new bosses that i've never done before uh the first one on the menu here is the corporal beast my friend and i did it using the poh method uh it's pretty fun actually i wouldn't say it's my favorite process that does involve a lot of running that's 136k right there that's not bad i just want to get a couple kill count done of a few different bosses so that well just to expand my knowledge a bit and when my account is finally maxed and i can start playing the game for real i'll know how to do these bosses all right so we're going to get started with the fletching grind here finally another level coming in here 86 fletching now we're doing adamant darts and this is definitely a mistake unfortunately i'm way too deep into this now at level 84 or higher it would be way cheaper and almost as good experience to make dragon bolts 84 plus i would highly recommend doing dragon bolts instead it's about half the gp per xp but i already spent a week or two buying all of the atom darts so you know what i'm kind of committed now so we have around 250 000 adam and darts to make so let's just go ahead and get that done with [Music] now that is kind of an interesting grind the speed that you can get it done with really depends on your own stamina and endurance kind of weird to say that about runescape but it's true i couldn't do this for more than 20-30 minutes at a time in most cases so it took me actually a while to do this but we're up to 95 fletching which is awesome we can now make it dragon darts that is going to be about twice as quick as adamant now if i was focusing hard i could get over a mil an hour on my pc and i'm sure even better on my phone keep in mind that i did do a lot of this on my phone but just for the sake of recording i hopped on my desktop just to make it a bit easier so now that we're doing dragon darts we should be able to get up to two mil an hour on desktop and i don't know three mil an hour or even more on the phone so the grind to 99 could be done with in as little as two hours or should say two hours of heavy clicking which obviously is gonna take me longer but we're gonna pick away at it maybe 10 20 minutes at a time ladies and gentlemen my very first forecast unique the dragon bone necklace was that thing worth a 51k that is actually worse than a regular drop i think most of forecast drops are worth more than that but you know what we got unique we got a new collection log item on kill count 280 we got a unique so whatever i'll take it ah there it is guys we finally got base 70s we finally got 70 room crafting we got 70 room crafting with very minimal actual training so i feel pretty good about that eventually we'll have to tackle it but i think we're going to leave it to maybe uh 2021 i mean we can't have a pandemic and train room crafting that's just way too much for one year another thing i've been kind of slowly picking away at is fishing we just got another fishing level here that is going to be 81 fishing pretty much whenever i get a chance i'm trying to afk a bit doing this because again i know it's a skill i need to get done with and it's been my afk activity of choice for about a month now okay another milestone level i've been looking forward to for a while now is 91 thieving again been kind of picking away that whenever i get the chance here but that is a really big level because now we can finally move on to pyramid plunder to get the highest experience rate for thieving at around 250k to 300k per hour so we're gonna start doing that and i think 99 thieving could be a realistic goal for the next month or two at around 280k per hour it's only gonna be maybe i don't know 15 hours or something to max which really is not that bad considering we're approaching the halfway mark we got the majority of my thieving experience all at the dorriscon ridge chest which again i would highly recommend talked about them a lot though okay one thing i just remembered while i was in dorkishcon is i have a bunch of long bones in the bank i don't think i ever exchanged them in and we're actually going to get a significant amount of construction experience i must have turned in my curved bones because they are nowhere to be seen but i mean we had all these long bones they're worth i think 4.5 k experience each or something around that and it's actually a significant amount of construction experience that has just been kind of waiting here 157k not bad that is actually going to give us a construction level as well there's 87 construction i only need like one or two more things in my poh that being the fairy ring and spirit tree combo but that's pretty much all that's left okay we found a fun little area to work on my dragon dart grind we got another big level coming in here at 96 fletching i really want to get this done with as soon as possible because not only am i losing a ton of money just making the darts the darts are also falling in value like significantly from where i bought them about a month ago like they've lost about 10 to 15 of their value which means a guy i don't want to calculate it yet but i think we're looking to maybe lose 100 maybe 200 mil doing this it's going to be nearly twice as expensive just because of kind of bad luck every day i check it they are worth less that has motivated me to get this done with we have under 100k dragon darts left and we're approaching our third to last level here that is going to be 97 fletching you don't really unlock much at the higher end levels but you know what we're getting a ton of total experience and a ton of total levels we're up to 2026. already gotten 16 so far from the start of the episode only 50 000 dragon darts to go here and another big level coming in here there is level 98 fletching one more level to go here we're getting a ton of total experience so we're up to 178 million which is really exciting we're actually quickly approaching the 200 mil mark all right so only one more level to go guys let's just get that done with if i do it quickly it should actually only take around half an hour and here we go we are almost there i really wasn't a bad grind although my arms are a little bit tired realistically you could get this done within under 10 hours if you really wanted to under five hours i think pretty sure eevee escaped it in like four hours or something but here's another bible skill done with here this one really cost us a lot but you know what it's done with we saved a ton of time doing it this way and i'm happy we did it anyway even though we lost a ton of money but there was 99 fletching the jingle pretty underwhelming but i'll take it so there we go guys another 99 under the belt not a particularly useful one but every time i get a 99 down with i just get a little bit more motivated so from a purely mental standpoint i think it could have been a worthwhile investment so i'm gonna go ahead and grab the cape and oh that hurts two thousand two hundred oh my god we're gonna get these in here to sell we'll go grab the cape and then we'll do the very depressing calculation of how much this actually cost all right so it's time to have a look at what the damages are for going with such a quick and expensive training method now pretty much from level 70 to 95 we did adam and darts now the gpr xp is more reasonable than dragon it's only 7.2 gp per xp but the cost is still extremely high now we ended up doing 500 000 atom darts to get to 95 and in the end that cost us around 60 million gp as i mentioned earlier doing dragon bolts from 84 plus would have been a much better idea but i had already bought 500 000 atomic darts and it just didn't really feel like changing now from 95 to 99 just four measly levels ended up costing me 125 million gp just in dragon darts now a significant chunk of that just had to do with the fact that dragon darts lost value from when i bought them to when i sold them a bit unfortunate on my part but i knew i was going to be blowing through money anyway so i don't know what's another 30 or 40 ml so that brings my total cost to getting a 99 fletching with the quickest method in the game to 185 million gp sunk into the skill for a skill that offers pretty much no benefits so in the end would i recommend doing it no for most people unless you are extremely wealthy definitely not worth it doing bolts are going to be a much more cost effective way to do it doing broad bolts can even be profitable sometimes or at the very least you'll be spending significantly less anyway guys that is going to be it for today's video i hope you guys enjoyed it and next episode we're going to be working on another bible skill this time we're going to try to recoup some of our money if we can but i'll leave that for next time thanks a lot guys and i'll see you next time
