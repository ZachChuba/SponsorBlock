build a beautiful website you can do it all in one place with Squarespace I'm back I'm back I'm back I really excited hello I'm back I missed you guys I hope you missed me too well I I don't know do I hope that I don't know I just hope you didn't think oh yeah she's gone forever that's what I heard I have a very special vlog for you today I hope it's gonna be interesting but I'm not sure because it's kind of the boring bits of my job in saying that it's not necessarily boring because being an illustrator is super super fun but it's more the stressful less loved parts of my job so more business side of things meetings lots of talks like conferences and stuff like that which isn't my favorite part I know it's good for me to do but I'm such a nervous speaker that it just is so much anxiety in one month and this month I had for speaking things I'm definitely glad the months over and I hope you enjoy this vlog [Music] hi are you busy okay I think I've come up with an idea so for the workshop I want to do something like silly still-life so it's about like teaching people to draw from the world around them but in there right away it also allows people to walk around and do their own thing because I don't want to just be staring at me giving a presentation yeah oh cool yeah cool all right I'll send you the blob and the idea I just want to see what you thought cool this handsome wants me to have a blood I said you know shade are artists and they said I was too sure something white just say about myself [Music] this is officially day one of VidCon oh my god I'm so scared I am excited to be here but I hate speaking in front of me when this happens to me every time I have to do an event whether it be like a reading for group of kids or a design conference and this way I feel especially nervous about because I'd like why am I here everyone else is so consisted on YouTube they know what they're doing they also have millions of subscribers that I was such a small little baby [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] how'd you get I feel like myself now so you just give you lost thing yes oh good now everyone was really good they talk a lot the aim of the game is a cat or a dog you ready yeah smells good okay ready go oh yeah oh wow oh wow this is this is something else that means we need some more eye color Oh No okay very good oh that's a very good place quite impressive hiccup blind home and have a look that is not what I thought I was joining but okay abstract will go with them yeah so my job should be my new style I think that's a solid zero zero [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is how I plan out my presentations I kind of have main dot points and then how I'm gonna break it down as is super super rough just off the top of my head and then I kind of translate that into a document [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] no battery but I just wanted to say I totally forgot to show you guys the presentation I gave at my school I couldn't film obviously because it's a school but basically I just kind of told them how to I managed to make it picture book what goes into it might its owners race through should admit of my work there hey hey and then I talked about how drawing is the best because anyone can do it it's just a bunch of lines then I went in to do different steps about how I managed to make my own book and how they can do it too and I showed them that one of my earliest picture books which I think was hopefully was motivating for them because it shows that there that's a picture book and so was this you know what I mean then I went through zoom show the behind the scenes process of zoom preparation all of this stuff this is the stuff I want to put into a video for you guys as well because so I'm just kids that probably don't know about all the work that goes into it picture book I'm sure it's also adults yes sorry that I couldn't show anything it's just you can't really film in schools for obvious reasons I work out my what I'm doing for my workshop for Samsung which I'm very excited about now usually I'm quite nervous about speaking and doing workshops but I think because I've been doing it more and more comfortable with knowing what process to use to come up with the topic of the talks so I calm now I'm sure I've become later maybe the art the final artwork that I was producing for Samsung yeah because it's all about being able to work on the phone this is an Adobe to get I think it's really cool look it's like a little landscape you can see can't you there's a little Bodhi boat there we've got a lovely sky with a little particles I'm really really happy with this I'm so amazed that I can do this level of work on such a tiny device and then I'm tonight I'm going to a little dinner with Samsung such as Samsung day today her hojae's been working Samsung and I'm gonna have a guinea with staff sock [Applause] [Music] it's all about my Samsung workshop already like plans the what I want to be talking about I just have to kind of plan those slides and then we're doing a recce today at we work which is where the workshop will be held I just want to see this space and because it's still life I want to see where I can set things up and ask them a lot of questions so I can make it the best experience as I possibly can and then hopefully I'll have some time for painting but we'll see [Music] [Music] [Applause] how's it going Hey look those people in there hi people how are things all right what are we doing oh I don't know what do you want to do I thought you were watching a video and I came to watch with you okay pull up a chair she wanna be as loud as possible [Applause] [Music] I'm currently working in bed I'm really finding it hard to work at the moment I feel so deep motivated that's why I'm in bed but yeah everything's really overwhelming like the smallest things I don't know if it's hormones or just the fact that I haven't been doing a lot of illustration work this month it sucks for every like small thing is really really difficult it makes me freak out okay since my last little update where I was really stressed I have filled in the forms I also got an email from my publisher and they're saying my second book is being taken into an acquisitions meeting so the first step is to be taken into an editorial meeting where the editors go over scripts that they've gotten my scripts that they thought were interesting to see what other people think I'm pretty sure that's what it is and then the next step is taking into the acquisitions meeting to see if the publisher wants to take it on so fingers crossed keep where your fingers crossed with me I'm really excited not really brought my spirits up I'm gonna do some drawings and painting does that help me yesterday too [Music] [Music] oh my god the Giarrusso money so good [Applause] yoga baby this is fun five it is nice we can earn a fleet of ships that's lovely beautiful platform number one Wow [Music] that's it that was my month I'm so happy it's over I don't want to sound ungrateful but man it was pretty stressful for me but I'm still busy I'm more busy with stuff that I love to do so I'm really really happy I hope you enjoyed this vlog I'm gonna do a Q&A but will get 10% off your first purchase I actually really unhappy okay Q&A time so I asked you guys on Twitter if you had any questions for me and there was a lot of questions I'm only gonna read a few today because this vlog was super long and I'm sorry if you thought it was too long but this was like I did ty a month that I had to condense and cut down I do want to skip the important part so forgive me okie-dokie how do you choose your color palette for each illustration do you do test studies and compositions beforehand or is it more organic and do you just go for it and love from Toronto love from Sydney I wish I was in Toronto that'd be cool wouldn't it honey usually like when your creative person you why it's self-critical but I know that color is one of my strengths I think that color is a really easy way to translate a lot of information and I find it quite easy to put together palettes that I really like but it comes to my personal work I'll just make sure while i'm doing it i'm swatching it on a scrap piece of paper to make sure it's the color the colors that I've mixed or what I want to have if you're having trouble with color at the moment good ways to do it are studying color theory looking at harmonious and contrasting colors and also you can use the app Adobe captcha if you see a bunch of nice colors on your walk or something you can take a photo and make a palette out of that you could take photos or stills from films that you like the color palette up and create this color palettes and it will give you like the hex codes and everything that's a good way to do it it's just a matter of practice and just finding the color combinations you why and it becomes a lot easier next question je cost me a question honey yeah Jake rich said what are you looking forward to whilst you're in America so Jake rocket I and a bunch of other people we're going to LA and we're going in like a week oh my god it's like just over a week yeah so if you guys have any suggestions for LA like things to 8 things to see interesting things to look at I like natural history museums and galleries and design museums know obviously like restaurants and food places so if you have recommendations specifically and you're a local please let us know oh the question was what are you looking forward to whilst you're in America the thing that I'm looking forward to most is seeing friends that I have in LA and also hanging out with my Adobe family because Jake you know what I talked about we became really close last year and it's just so much fun it's like school camp the last thing I'm looking forward to is seeing the people that I'm seeing speaker 2 Dobby max because I'm seeing some of like my favored creatives I'm seeing a V Atkins he's a graphic designer for film she's done a lot of websites and stuff so obviously I'm a huge fan people like tad carpenter Jessica he SH I'm sure there's a million more I know there is but I'm just so excited because every time I leave Adobe MAX I'm so inspired to make stuff it's just cool to see people being successful at what they're passionate about you know it really motivates me question what are some cute prompt Lisfranc Toba I don't know honey can you think of any cute prompt lists for October I randomly yesterday I was like I've gotta doing Tova but I was like I'm gonna make my own prompt list because I find the prompt list that exists to be very abstract and difficult and on top of my illustration workload it's really hard to fit in another session of like concept again sketching so I created a little low pressure low key fun prompt list and I invited people on Instagram and Twitter to join it if they wanted to Frank Toba there are a handful of people doing and I'm really excited it will pop it up a screen now but and if you want to check it out I'll link to it down below as well what do you think is the advantage of having a YouTube channel to your career as an artist I think immediately when I was not consistently but when I was more often posting for posting videos I have to be careful because I'm really not consistent but when I was more consistently than I was before like ie not once a year but more like once every couple months and now once every month as soon as I started posting on YouTube and the Kip of my community here grew it was quite evident that the relationship I was forming with my audience on YouTube was a lot more intimate it's weird to explain but it's just I feel like you guys understand me more you know me better than my other audiences on other platforms another one is being able to see where I was a year ago so like the documenting my process at my work in my business I'm able to see like how I've grown as a creative how is how I've grown as a businessperson how I've grown in front of camera I think speaking use the camera has really helped me with my public speaking skills like it's something I was always nervous about but being able to talk through the ideas and even answer these questions it really helps me when I get asked questions face to face in real life what I'm giving a talk so there's like quite a few ways that you choose really helping me but those are my favorite ones I think that's all I'm gonna do because we did have a lot to cover this vlog I will not ask for other questions for my next Q&A I'll just go through and answer some of the ones I missed out on just last things to remember thank you to Squarespace of course I still have prints in my store that you can grab if you want to support me in other ways and also if you guys are gonna go along with me in Monaco but it's just like a super relaxed sketch club as opposed to like a hardcore inktober it's just like a little sketch called between being my sweet little fairy little peaches I feel free to follow them if you want to I'll be posting my drawings hopefully every day on Instagram you know I promise these things and I'm like the most aren't reliable person I'm so sorry I'm sorry for the person that I am oh yeah thank you so much for still being around even I haven't posted in so long I will be back soon it won't be a whole nother month for sure thank you for being here I really really appreciate it and I'll see you soon [Music]
