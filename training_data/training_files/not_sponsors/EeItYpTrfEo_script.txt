Hello~ Solarsido~ This is Solar. Today, as a Chobok special
(The first hottest day of Summer) I'm going to make samgyetang 
(ginseng chicken soup) And do a samgyetang ASMR 
mukbang challenge! I'll be making scorched rice abalone
 samgyetang today. Scorched rice, abalone samgyetang. Right now, my mom is preparing the
ingredients to the side for me. I will introduce the ingredients. Chicken. Scorched rice. Abalone. There is Garlic here. Jujube. This is Chestnut, that I like. And... Siberian ginseng. Astragalus root. Kalopanax. [Ingredient preparation finished]
(Mom did it all) I'm going to prepare it.
[Ingredient preparation herself!] It's weird~ Rub here? (Mom is filming, out of focus warning) It's weird.. Armpits. [Suddenly washing its armpits lool] Its armpits are clean~ Stretching.
[Let it stretch, too] Wash the inside, too~ But... It's a bit gross.. Now, cut this and the fat...The fat... Remove the fat! This is what I remove.. [With scissors, cut off the fat part] I'm sorry.. Chicken preparation, done! I prepared the chicken right now.. I prepared the chicken...
(Mom cleaning up) Boil it! Put all this in! And you just need to boil it. Mom,. do I just put all this in here?
(Mom help) Jujube! (Thinking how many jujubes she should put in) [Put in about 4 jujubes~] [No!] 10! [Put in 10 jujubes!] It's somewhat brutal.. About 7 cloves of garlic~ [Lots of chestnuts~] [There's no room for it..;;] Put it in like this You normally have to sew this shut. But I have to hurry and eat it. So I'll just put it in like this. Then, in a container like this I put it in. [Add in the remaining ingredients] Astragalus root! Lacquer tree. (Mom) It's kalopanax. Oh, kalopanax? Ah, it's not lacquer tree, but kalopanax! This is.. Cartilage? No, what was it? Siberian ginseng. [It's Siberian ginseng] Add Siberian ginseng. Scorched rice~ Popular nowadays Scorched rice, abalone samgyetang. Abalone! Cleaned! Add it. Take this! (Actually the main chef)
You have to put the chestnuts and jujubes on top~ Ah~ All of this?
[Dish that's almost all done by mom] [Put all the remaining ingredients on top] Next.. Bring this~ (Mom is busy having to shoot the
video and telling her how to cook) We're going to cook it now. The fire, on high~ I'm boiling it like this. This.. Will be on high heat for about 30~40 minutes And then Check the state of it (Mom) 30 minutes on medium heat! Oh, 30 minutes on medium heat?
[Got it wrong again kekekeke] (Mom) 30 minutes on high heat. (Frustrated) 30 minutes on medium heat. I'll make a correction! [Almost like her mom's avatar keke] First, boil it on high heat for 30 minutes, then medium heat for 30 minutes. And then I'll meet with you. See you in a moment. [After a while] 1 hour has gone by now. (Bubbling) I'm going to boil this for a little longer. Ta-da~ Aerial shot~ [Made by mom's direction
