probably the most Herculean effort that took place early in the game's life was the hunter natha's glyphs encoded texts written on the background of the world in various locations most of which are extremely well edan I already made a video focusing on the secret or broom glyphs which can watch by clicking the card right here but this video will focus on all the other glyphs which reveal to us the remainder of the known lore we'll be tracing a path through all 12 glyph locations uncovering them in order decoding them as we go before I then go into more depth and talk about what I think they mean anyway massive spoiler warning let's go if you've beaten the game you've probably already seen this first passage since it's located right above the boss arena it's also by far the easiest to find of all these glyphs so expect the other ones to be a bit out of the way anyway once decoded these read who do worship who is your God your real God don't even know it don't even understand it understand so little that we pity poor little thing you've come so far yet have so far to go or maybe understand more than we think are reading this do even know who your God is your true God the God of gods the one true God think we're the false god but we created your God and your God of gods and and your free will end this world and all the worlds all of it we allowed to have free will think have free will poor thing don't think we are the monsters we're not who is the real monster your God is your God of gods is the real monster your true God is the real monster Wow anyway like I said I'm gonna show where they all are first and then we'll talk about them in more depth from here it's a short trip over to the next location though we'll need a way to traverse lava because the glyphs are actually beneath the lava to the left of this statue covered an extremely dense rock or EDR [Music] come here seeking answers think we have all the answers we don't not think we are so different we are the same we both serve the same God the god of many gods the god we've created think you're destroying us are not are helping us so we're helping the god of gods interesting from here we have to head down into the right deeper through lava and rock until we can read think can destroy us will not destroy us we gave your free will we made this place and not just this place all the places all the dimensions all the free wills think you've come to steal from us no we stole from we stole your time and your money and your sanity they've stolen our time our money and our sanity hmm now we have to go on a bit of an adventure first we continue to mine through the edr until we enter hell and then we have to pass all the way through to the far left of this demon and lava choked area once we find the home of the essence of water we have to mind down beneath it until at last the words are uncovered this is very clever of very clever we're impressed with know where to be and now for the most difficult to find set of glyphs for these we have to dig back to the right soon we'll emerge into an enormous hell chasm slowly descending to the right we'll eventually find land carefully crossing this we must then pass yet another chasm dig through even more EDR before ultimately arriving in an endless abyss of lava finding the glyphs is a bit tricky I'm using lava to blood which produces a large amount of blood and water so as I search I have to try to disperse some of this liquid an easier way would probably be to use the freeze field perk with luminous drills finally after completely missing it we uncover the text which reads while we're impressed we must ask this is it really worth transcribing these do really expect us to reveal the real secret we can tell this it is possible but ever we don't know how so might be noticing a theme to this at any rate let's continue because for the next one we must head all the way up to the lava lake next to the mines and the chasm connecting them to the snowy depths and trust me getting back there is easier said than done [Music] at last we arrived at the area beneath the lava lake and have to dig down here until we start to uncover yet more glyphs which read we know what are after but it is not here no where to be for the seventh glyph passage we just have to head to the top of this chasm and then across the lava lake to the brickwork of the first holy mountain not far down we'll find the glyphs which read why why did look here what answers are trying to find in here at this point I'm not even sure from here we have to head down to the he see base once here we'll dig through the far right into the hidden holy mountain and then down on the right side of this one until we're just above the jungle and then we work our way even further directly to the right until we arrive at the 8th set of glyphs why must go destroying everything why for glory for your precious God of gods is it really worth all this is it is it really it is worth it always now we have to head all the way back up to the beginning of the game for glyph passage number nine which incidentally I've already showed as an example in my previous Lord video but I have to show it again since it is part of this set of twelve glyphs and here we are at the most familiar site in all of noida now let me just destroy the serene beauty by demolishing this mouth inside and we have uncovered glyph number nine devoted seeker of true wisdom know this we are watching which as I said in the previous video is pretty creepy from here we head back down into the cave past the mines through the snowy depths to the magical temple through which we must progress to reach the orb Arun once at the orb altar we have to dig down past the brickwork and through more edr until we can read why are doing this why are reading this what do think will find in here the answer to the treasure after this we have to head down two more floors to the jungle and the two leftmost holy mountains at the bottom of it here at the space between these holy mountains we dig down until we see this seam in the brickwork beneath which is glyph number 11 what do worship don't even know it think know the answer but don't think the treasure will satisfy but it won't don't even know what you're seeking think do but don't and finally we're on our way to the last glyph glyph number 12 located just one floor down deep inside a wall of extremely dense rock left of the holy mountains separating the vault from the temple we're just gonna blackhole our way to the left until we see the room housing the teleporter to the tower and then we're gonna turn and dig upwards until we find our final set of glyphs gave your freewill to the true God why else would be here why else would be reading this we wanted to come here we wanted to read this think have free will we made come here we made read this it almost seems to be pleading with us anyway so taking a look at all of these at once we can see that they're all in the voice of the one true God which we consider to be a false god we already know of three gods which were mentioned in the glyphs of the previous lore video nature magic and technology which were hatched from eggs carried by a bird so based on passage number one that bird seems to be our God of gods which this God is calling the real monster and that real monster is responsible for the creation of technology magic nature and all the creations of nature including us so the writer of this runic language created the bird and thus everything else and seems unhappy with its creation but apart from the actual lore of alchemy and Finnish mythology the Kalevala and the Sampo which is the item we are seeking being guarded by the boss the fact that we might be a shaman entering the land of the dead in order to stave off some calamity like a time loop we might be stuck in since when finishing the game in the fault manner we see a golden statue of one of our former selves predicting our end we die as the world turns to gold because we made a mistake and did not achieve true knowledge then there's the normal Mountain altar ending which lets us survive to wander the world of gold and admire our handiwork until we realize there's nothing it's meaningless and we're forced to kill ourselves or just start a new game apart from all of that it makes sense to read bees in the voice of the developers because they created all of this they gave us the rules our free will and they're talking to us through the game testing us seeing how far we'll go in the search for secrets or higher meaning and at the same time we're helping them the game is still in early access perhaps by showing them just how far we'll go in the search for secrets just how deep into the game we'll dig it's helping them because we're bug testing and also potentially giving them ideas for further development of the game with this collaborative spirit in mind please let me know let us all know down below in the comments your take on all this your ideas and your theories let's work together on this as a community oh and as an added bonus before I forget these say what deserve pretty ominous say anyway now I'll see next time have a great day
