hello guys and welcome back to another video today we're going to be taking a look at a Macintosh 2cx that was originally released back in 1989 which is just about 31 years ago to this day now the problem is its sat in my shed for many years and I haven't tested it since so let's try powering it up and see if it still works to test the machine we're going to be using an RGB high resolution monitor which was initially released back in 1987 I also found a period-accurate keyboard and mouse the 2cx was discontinued in March of 1991 and superseded by the Macintosh 2ci this particular machine looks like it's in decent shape on the outside so let's try firing it up sadly I'm not getting any signs of life at all but all hope is not lost yet as we have another Macintosh 2cx that we can use for parts which makes a rather ominous death boot chime however it does appear to have some functionality since I wasn't getting any signal through the CRT I thought I'd try using a monitor that I know works I was getting some sort of corrupt image on the display with all that let's open up these machines and see if we can get one of them running getting inside A to C X is very easy there is actually only one screw that needs to be removed to completely disassemble it these Mac's are notorious for having their electrolytic capacitors leaked another component that frequently goes bad is the power supplier to try and rule out a dead PSU I put the known working one in the other machine with still no signs of life the power supply from the completely dead machine seemed to work in the other machine meaning I have two good power supplies I tried using another known working CRT to see if the Mac that powers on gives out a good video signal with no such luck another idea I tried was switching the video cards between machines and testing it in different nubes slots this time I got a startup chime video and it seemed to boot into Mac OS 7.1 considering I've got two cases in different conditions I'm going to build the best 2cx I can out of both machines it's good to see that the lithium battery hasn't leaked it's definitely the original with a date of August 1989 as we remove the speaker assembly we can definitely see many signs of corrosion electrolytic fluid has sadly leaked all over the motherboard and it's caused extensive corrosion although luckily enough the spare Macintosh 2zx has had all its capacitors replaced I'd like to personally thank a guy called John who did the recapping and also sold me the spare to CX for a very good price a cool little easter egg is the fact that the names of the product design team are molded right into the plastic chassis now I'm off to dust out the case in our backyard I love that all of the components are very easy to remove getting inside the floppy discs required me to remove four Phillips head screws now we can see what 30 years of dust looks like that has to be the dustiest floppy drive I've ever seen it's basically carpeted in dust and we're going to have to fix that after a quick dusting I tried inserting a floppy disk however the mechanism seem to be very stiff I began by cleaning the gears and removing built-up gunk the floppy disk still had trouble being seated correctly with a spray of wd-40 in specific places the floppy disk now loads and ejects very well to finish off the drive I lubricated the stepper motor and eject mechanism with some mechanical grease the 80 megabyte hard drive is a quantum Pro drive Els which is likely the original drive that came with the 2cx the clips that hold the power supply fan in place had actually snapped off so I removed the fan and gave it a dust out I also scrubbed the blades thoroughly with methylated spirits this is the only fan in the whole system meaning it runs pretty quietly while I was at it I also cleaned off the reset button module and the rubber feed with the power supply dusted out and the fan holder clips glued back in place i slotted it back together the outer casing could now get a much-needed wipe down I chose this specific case because it showed the least signs of yellowing using a bit of eucalyptus oil made short work of the black gunk that had built up on the case I used a toothbrush to get into the hard-to-reach places the lid of the 2cx is starting to look a whole lot cleaner moving on to the front of the case I applied some eucalyptus oil and pretty quickly I noticed that the logo started to smudge luckily using an antibacterial wipe I was able to save the logo from being damaged lastly I cleaned off all the outer surfaces now that we've got the case pretty clean on the inside and outside it was time to put the Mackintosh back together the clean recapped motherboard was first to go in once lined up successfully I slid the board into position the reset buttons and speaker went next to be clipped in place the drives and power supply slotted in pretty easily I took some RAM off of the dead motherboard and put them in here last of all the nubes cards were put in place they're very clean macintosh 2 CX is now back together did it survive the cleanup since we aren't getting a video signal something must be wrong another quirk of this machine is the fact that it wouldn't boot up when I had the network card installed perhaps it actually doesn't work now the machine springs into life I'm very curious to see whether the floppy drive still functions the disc inserted fine and appeared to format without issue most importantly the disc ejected very smoothly so let's fire it up and play some games as well as see what's on the machine thankfully the extra RAM I put in seems to be working bringing the 2 C X up to 8 megabytes right the humorous sound effects provide endless entertainment the graphics card can output in 256 color mode which was decent for the time the 80 megabyte hard disk seems to have quite a few games and applications installed however the file management leaves a lot to be desired a really old game called Daleks seems to work fine tetris 2000 is a fairly competent version of tetris - the bazaar control scheme video poker 2.0 is another primitive card game a few of the games on here just didn't seem to work at all though I really let my creativity run wild in klaris works drawing graphic design is clearly my passion now let's take a trip to the Far East with Shanghai a version of mahjong this kind of game doesn't really excite me to be honest something that really does excite me is seeing a doctor use a stethoscope on a hard disk platter relieving Li the over 30 year old hard disk gets a clean bill of health and after dark screensaver was also installed on here the starry night is kind of beautiful isn't it my next hurdle was getting programs and games onto the Mac via floppy disk after much trial and error I actually managed to download some old programs and get them installed on the Mac I did this with the help of my trusty old iBook g3 finally we can try some of my favorite old games first up we've got lemmings [Music] visually it looks great however I couldn't seem to select any of the lemmings to dig no computer is complete without pinball as far as this game goes it's definitely fun if you don't remember Super Mario looking this unofficial it's because someone made a barely playable ripoff if you're in the market for a 1989 Ford ooh you've come to the right place Ford Simulator 2 lets you browse cars and also try a driving if your car engine sounds like this it may be time to get a new engine for such an old computer it still feels very responsive and was a lot of fun to use the design just screams 1980s that's honestly what's so cool about it easily upgradable with plenty of room for expansion this was a much different time for Apple one that I'll always look back fondly on so there we have it yet another Apple computer restored to its former glory the outer casing didn't exactly have much yellowing on it so I felt no need to try and widen the plastic it's always great seeing this machines up and running once again thank see more definitely consider subscribing I'll see you in the next video
