If you’re riding a bike and want to turn
right, you might think that you should turn the handlebars to the right. However, that’s wrong. Because, unlike a car where turning the wheels
merely changes the direction the car is pointed, turning the front wheel makes a bike lean. When you turn the bike wheel to the right,
the wheel goes to the right, right out from under you and the rest of the bike. So now you’re leaning to the left, and the
force on the bike from the ground will be directed to the left, and a leftward force,
of course, makes you go to the left. Since physics seems determined that you’re
going left, you’d probably better just give in and let the handlebars turn to the left,
too. And that’s how you turn left on a bike – by
first turning right. If you really wanted to go right, you should
have started by counter-steering to the left. Once you finally get yourself into a right
turn, you’ll also need to work to keep yourself in the turn, since most bikes and motorcycles
have a tendency to automatically stabilize and straighten out on their own. This happens because a right-leaning bike
automatically steers itself even farther to the right to get the wheels back underneath
its center of mass, so you’ll actually need to apply a slight torque to the left to keep
the wheels from turning too far to the right. Yes, it’s counterintuitive: to turn right
on a bike you turn left, then keep trying to turn left while leaning and turning right. Bikes
