with both my sponsorship and my promo code but all I know how to do is make videos welcome to a breakdown of fairyland the world of tiny magic pranksters no one's written much about it yet so like most of my stuff I'm gonna have to pull threads from existing snippets and the rest out of my ass the one guy that did a full look pulled inspiration from other sources so I don't want to just copy and paste him but but I did copy and paste him in the description the Fae wild is essentially the Material Plane Plus where everything is twice as vibrant and twice as unpredictable it and the shadow fell are unique Plains because they're copied and pasted versions of the normal worlds layout and then they change the opacity in either direction the most repeated detail in every source says it's easy as hell to stumble into the Fae wild without realizing it every other plane needs a gate but the land of fairies just shits outdoors to mess with people you know Alice in Wonderland maybe The Wizard of Oz hell even Rip Van Winkle Ulf a wild portals and you know what happened to each protagonist they got [ __ ] with by fairytale creatures Shrek too but he might just be in the Fae wherein lies the only main feature of the Fae wild it's bright it's pretty and it makes you feel good but it's not a plane of good where our van door is the outer plane of goodness and natural beauty or the hells are the embodied evil the Fae can be summed up as prank energy being the home of every variant of fairy tale monster all of which were created to warn kids about dangers the PHA is dangerous and misleading before I talk about everyone's favorite class that has the best stats and is never cringy I'm gonna run down most of the ferries we have so far and what they might do to you boggles tiny pests that constantly [ __ ] out oil and crossover to mess with lonely people you'd think they'd make good magical friends but really they just amuse themselves at your expense and then they hop in tiny portals before you can grab their slippery oiled up ass blink dogs are just dogs that disappear a lot also they really hate displacer beasts which aren't Fae for some reason Pixies hold true to their elusive nature as adorable annoyances who never actually fight they abuse their invisibility and tie your shoelaces together and misplace your gold for shits and giggles sprites are those tiny things in that one scene from bridge to terabithia and don't really [ __ ] with people they look at people's alignment and if they see evil do evil they swarm like tiny locusts people equipped with bows and arrows darklings are cursed assassins who messed with the summer queen so now they can't be in sunlight and they explode into fireworks when they die satyrs have a lot of sex and they're always drunk that's it dryads speak for the trees and the trees say just don't mess with any forest that they're in or you're as good as dead quick Ling's are just like Pixies but with Quicksilver superpowers they live fast talk fast and they die faster mean locks are weird evil bug people who embody bad drug trips if you start to panic in the field they appear just to amplify that panic read caps or Keebler elves who want your blood to die their hats yeth hounds are holy [ __ ] what is that get it away right now I don't want it cords are dirt fairies with lasso hair and are a lot stronger than you'd think lastly for mauryans are evil Giants with a stink eye that straight up kills you they used to be sexy as all hell but made someone mad and got cursed that's a common theme here there are also non Fae creatures such as unicorns the afer mentioned displacer beasts blights one ogre and a donkey all in the Fae aside from those guys we have the Hat who earn their own video and the elves the elves are the equivalent of humans in the Fae wild and pretty much the only creatures that build permanent settlements there's a whole big chunk of history that divided the elves the Aladdin and the drow that's covered in more than Kaiba's frothy hose that'll either get its own video or you should just read it in the book so moving on from that the Aladdin ended up staying in the FEI wild their seasonal elves so they're only employed for like a month every year you have childish elves sad elves hedonistic elves and confident elves it hasn't been explicitly explored in detail yet but I believe these folks are the ones who build twin settlements of normal buildings which brings me back to the natural layout twin features of the real world are good pointers as to where you are if you do end up lost in the fey for example Mount Rushmore might be a dormant stone giant with dozens of Rocky talking faces that give misleading advice Florida would be a grand winding twilit swamp home to hundreds of hag covens conspiring against each other not everything is cloned but a lot of large features are just doubled in grandeur the last thing I'd want to cover and probably your only means of escaping the Fae are the residing politics as far as I've been able to tell there are two parties who govern two halves of the Fae Wilde called the sealy and the uncie li essentially darkness versus light and when I say that you thought oh so one's good and one's evil no you're dumb and you haven't been paying attention they both function like courts with a queen for each the summer queen who I blame for California is 110 degree droughts and the queen of darkness and farts the settlements in the Fae wild aside from the elven ones are ruled by these two courts aside from the minor division of tendency toward good and evil and varied levels of light both queens are constantly butting heads to decide who is the prettiest and who is the best when they aren't fighting they're slinging curses out like nobody's business or giving gifts to travelers who humor them as a final note understand that time moves differently just like in the Jesus the Satan in the clothes cupboard if you're there for longer than a a the next few days could range from years to minutes so you might be [ __ ] just follow the yellow brick road meet the summer queen get funny ha ha pranked and then asked to go home because if you don't the rest of your days will be spent suffering loose bootlaces under Twilight and that's basically the Fae wild you
