money you should download honey join honey.com pewdiepie also big thanks to honey for helping me celebrate this huge milestone of 100 million let's get in with the video nine years ago i uploaded my first video onto youtube this is what that video looked like it blew up i got millions of views and i was big right away no instead of 12 million views this video had about three or four this is what my content actually looked like back in that day and i am back with black ops with an awesome game of search and destroy it wasn't good it wasn't engaging it wasn't even original but i loved it it took so many uploads just for me to hit even 100 subscribers and hitting a hundred subscribers was huge huge for me and yeah today we're gonna celebrate because i got 100 subscribers oh my god 100 subscribers it's funny looking back to that video and what i said i obviously had big goals i like to aim at even at big goals even though they might not be relevant at all but uh no no i don't wanna i don't wanna be famous but at that time i was 20 years old i was living in sweden in a small flight i had just moved away from home i had no idea what i was doing i just knew i enjoyed it i was also studying at university at the time industrial economics and management my calling in life that's what i want to do so i decided this youtube hobby i'll probably have to set aside because i should probably focus on my finals so i upload a video saying i was going on a break but in reality i was i was quitting this was it for me just can't put my hobby in front of that right now so uh i'm sure a lot of you i'm sure most of you will understand that and i'm gonna miss you guys a lot actually which was a pretty reasonable choice to make considering i had about five people that actually watched me during this time but luckily the break didn't last long just a few days later i was back uploading videos again i had found what i was actually passionate about and i wasn't ready to just let it go i knew that a career in youtube was so far away it was more of a myth than a dream at this point because people didn't even know if it was possible but it was always at the back of my mind that there was a tiny chance that this could actually happen i was back uploading videos and i tried out this new horror game that had just come out called amnesia and it was scarier than anything that it didn't even compare welcome back and the top comment of this video really says it it is what started it all for me at least i wasn't popular as soon as i played amnesia but for the first time the five people that watched my videos they really enjoyed it and i could tell i was onto something and this wasn't just new for me it was a new thing on youtube as well and i had never played horror games before it was genuinely horrible i made montages and compilations of the best moments where it's really just me screaming they're kind of loud they're kind of obnoxious but they got a charm to them [Music] eventually i had grown a thousand subscribers but it was also clear i had grown an audience that really cared about me i used to be an introvert and but youtube really helped me open up because on the other side there was people that really appreciated the side of me that i didn't show to anyone at this point i had completely failed school i'm sorry mom and dad my passion was somewhere else and i famously started selling hot dogs to sustain myself but i look back at this time with great memories because i was finally pursuing my goal my dream not selling hot dogs but making videos in my spare time that is at this time i managed to meet a girl online who later became my wife i won't bore you with every step of the way of the journey it it's been long it had its ups and downs i made a lot of mistakes on the way but i've grown i feel like i have at least and i feel like i've finally come in terms with the responsibility i have as a creator about 100 million subs too late but you know but the channel's done a lot of good too a lot of things i'm truly proud of we literally raise millions of dollars to charities and i'm really proud of my audience for helping me do that looking back at myself in that flight in sweden is a very surreal experience i would never ever have imagined this outcome beyond my wildest dreams came true ten times over a hundred times over i'm nine years older now i'm still awkward as [ __ ] but i finally got confidence in myself and i'm really proud of who i am today and instead of 100 subs we hit 100 million subs we did it i want to thank all the people i work with over the past couple years you know who you are i want to thank the people i collaborated with i want to thank all the great friends i'm at along the way i want to thank my previous and current editors michael bride cybe i want to thank my family for supporting me in doing something that i didn't even know what it was and i want to thank marzia for being by my side every step of the way but most importantly i want to thank the pros i don't need to tell you about the journey you already know it profess got a letter in the post hmm what is this i like the color scheme youtube very nice it even got a letter from susan i won't read the whole thing but it finishes with congratulations again on becoming marcy's husband and please give sven a big hug from us thank you susan now if you've been on twitter you've seen this already but here it is let me get this out of the way oh my god i've smudged it already pewdiepie congratulations on passing 100 million subscribers and a lot
