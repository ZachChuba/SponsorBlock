welcome back to new rockstars I'm Erik Bosse in the mandalorian on Disney plus we'll return for a second season or if you live outside the US a first season when you finally get Disney Plus in March I'm sorry Disney hates you but we've uncovered some new details pointed out how the second season will address the show's lingering mystery spoiler warning for the mandalorian the cryptic backstory of Moff gideon and how we got the dark saber baby otis species and what they want to do with him the mystery Tatooine figure in Chapter five and what horrible things happen to the Mandalorian race excuse me creed and thanks to privacy at our conference sponsoring this episode you can sign up now have privacy icon slash new rock stars you can get $5 today to use on any purchase online okay let's go through each of these Mandalorian mysteries to explain what new details we have learned and where they're gonna go in season 2 starting with Mothe Gideon and the dark saber in my breakdown of the finale episode I went into some detail about the dark sabers history with the people of Mandalore as the ancient saber of tarah Vizsla the first Mandalorian Jedi and how its traded hands over the years from the Vizsla family to maul and eventually this Sabine Wren and Bo Catan and rebels this is around the year to BBY the family episode gave us some backstory of Moff Gideon Moff Gideon was an isp officer during the purge so is be refers to Imperial Security Bureau essentially the SS of the empire military interrogators who snuff out disloyalty in the ranks so as an authority known to mando Moff Gideon may have led this purge to raid Mandalorian best scar and weaponry including their sacred sword this purge would have happened sometime between two BBY this was two years before the rebels steal the Death Star plans and blow it up and for ABY when the Empire began to collapse following the Battle of Endor Giancarlo Esposito confirmed in an interview that season two would explore more of his character so I assume next season will feature flashbacks to sometime during that six to seven year period in which moth Gideon himself plunders the most precious artifact to the Mandalorian people the dark saber perhaps even crying it from the cold dead fingers of poket on and using this weapon to instill fear and discipline within his stormtrooper unit even after the broader imperial apparatus collapses but what does Mothe Gideon want with the child our Lord and Savior baby Jesus Yoda we still don't know much about this little meme Verna Herzog's client character one in baby Yoda captured dead or alive suggesting his boss Moff Gideon didn't really care if the child died either but they did want to extract something from him dr. Pershing was using an imperial interrogator droid with a syringe either to inject or extract something from this child Pershing claimed to want to protect the child to care about its safety and to understand its greater significance if uniform featured a patch with a signet matching the logo of the clones of Kamino suggesting an origin in genetic engineering but later in the season Quayle shot down that theory I think it might be a strand cast I don't think it was engineered I've worked in the gene farms this one I think we could take pig Nolte at his word perhaps maybe Yoda was a natural-born life form of its species but these imperial forces still wanted to extract his DNA so that they could head back to Kamino to clone him to make an army of force-sensitive Yoda's for the dark side it appears that season two will further explore baby Otis origin and species as mando seeks his home planet a mystery that Star Wars Canon has never really elaborated on previously expected to search the galaxy for the home of this creature and deliver it to a race of enemy sorcerers this is the way but equally murky is the unfilled gap period in Mandalorian history in which our hero emerged before privacy icon slash new rock stars and sign up now okay back to the mystery of meeeeee and Oh in the death watch the finale episode revealed mandos name vin Joran and the people who rescued him from the separatist conflict a group of blue armored Mandalorians with this three-pronged Signet this is the signet of the Death Watch originally introduced as a terrorist warrior clan of Mandalorians from the Clone Wars animated series who at first challenged the authority of their pacifist leader during the Clone Wars conflict in order to try to spur their people to reimburse their warrior ancestry and join this conflict they form an alliance with Maul and after that backfires years later they kind of become a heroic rebel group rallying against Imperial occupation in some are speculating that that female leader of mandos tribe on Navaro the armor could be an older boca tan though her helmet designs stems from the Maul era of the Death Watch so I don't know if that's true but one of those tribe members was named Paz Vizsla and was voiced by Jon Favreau who also voiced the death watch leader Pre Vizsla in the Clone Wars series so I'm assuming the season two will reveal that this tribe that we find manda with was the remnants of that Death Watch post purge Favreau was really the reason we know what second seasons come in thanks to his Instagram post revealing art of a gomorian those pig nose creatures who guarded Jabba's palace on Tatooine and returned the Jedi and a return to tattooing brings of our final big mystery which came up in season one statue in episode chapter 5 the gunslinger in which Amanda joins Toro Callahan who track Phenix and who left4dead is found in the episodes final seconds by a mystery figure in Boots in a cape so who is this though not confirmed all signs point to our man Boba Fett's who was last seen falling into the Sarlacc pit on Tatooine in Return of the Jedi there have been various hints over the years and several Star Wars supporting material that Boba Fett actually survived that Sarlacc but this has not yet been firmly established as canon Jon Favreau and Dave Bologna said way back when that Boba Fett would not be in season 1 but you know you could interpret that to mean anything above the knees beyond the Tatooine setting there are two audio clues from that chapter 5 final scene that point to Boba Fett listen closely okay first you can hear what sounds like Spurs on each of those figure steps which matches the sound of the Spurs on Boba Fett's boots in the Empire Strikes Back also as the figure approaches he can hear some beeping sound this is very similar to the beeping that you could hear on Boba Fett and be a new hope special edition added scene with Jabba and Han the deadline report of season 2 cited insiders hinting that several established characters from the Skywalker saga showing up in the next season and with the return of the gomorian whom we last saw on Tatooine I think there's a very good chance that mando returns to that planet and runs into that bounty hunter who made Mandalorian armor so famous to us what are your predictions for the Mandalorian season to comment down below with your thoughts follow me on instagram and twitter at a vas following the rockstars on social media and subscribe to new rockstars here on youtube and check out our new Q&A series the big question fulfilled when I get a little drunk and give you way too much information about Palpatine sexual history lots of other fun questions it's actually become my favorite thing that we do here at new rockstars so please watch and share it around with your friends thank you for watching bye [Music]
