hey guys welcome back to my channel so last time i reacted to wikimeki it was for dazzle dazzle and i said i mean i don't know if i said that during the reaction but i still think till this day that this is one of the best release of this year so far it was just like so freaking catchy i still listen to it today you know so yeah i wonder if this one is going to be able to top that on i mean i feel like this concept is going to be a little bit different like i'll watch the teasers and everything and first of all i liked the the concept where they are like the hunters and the prey and the teaser pictures and everything but yeah anyways so unfortunately there are no english captions at the moment no that i can't find at least uh oopsie let's just go ahead it's funny how nowadays girl groups are coming back oh gorgeous the summer with a seemingly like dark concept you know [Music] i gotta say she's rocking the hairstyles every time she's in the center i just like i just melt somehow i don't know [Music] it feels like [Music] like the more woman mature version of dazzle dazzle or maybe not wow i mean yeah so far this looks like their most [Music] mature looking and sounding music either damn she's gorgeous i love the accessory [Music] oh that was morse code right [Music] damn beautiful [Music] she looks great like that [Music] like the music video is so simple though but they're gorgeous [Music] they're stunning that's that's not fair okay you know weirdly enough i thought it would be more summery like i went in this thinking that they would go for like a full summer concept like we're almost in the summer so that's why i was expecting that but as i said at the beginning it feels like nowadays there's a lot of twist in uh you know the concepts and everything and while we are getting closer to summer like the summer bops etc they went for a twist like it doesn't sound summery like maybe at some point but overall it doesn't have that like refreshing sound that does whatever has for instance which is why i think this one is their like most mature sounding and looking comeback so far like this that very woman like you know with the suits and everything the jewelry like there was definitely something that was more elegant than like most of the music other music videos that make sense i feel like the song might take me a few listens to actually like enjoy it fully at the moment it's not as catchy like i don't find it as catchy as their other songs like for instance dazzle dazzle just stuck to me immediately i'm in here again don't get me wrong that chorus is extremely catchy but the verses don't stick to me as much or like the dents don't stick to me as much i don't know as i said i think this might take me a few listen to actually really enjoy this i like i like it i like it like but like it's not like their best in my opinion also the music video as i said was a bit too simple i wish they had gone for something a little bit more like with the more like hunter and prey concept that they had going on i don't know i feel like they could have gone a lot further with the concept but then again what do i know anyways to subscribe to my channel and i'll see you in the next video bye
