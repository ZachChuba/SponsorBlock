when Windows 10 launched in 2015 PC users were confronted with a dilemma Microsoft had in many enthusiasts eyes been making blunder after blunder in their efforts to turn what we all thought was a perfectly functional operating system into some kind of idiot friendly touchscreen fisher-price looking nonsense and on top of trying to fix what ain't broke Microsoft wanted unprecedented access to their users data and resolved to just force system updates when you're right in the middle of something and all for what DirectX 12 so many power users ended up sticking with Windows 7 and are still using it today but they have a problem if you're one of these individuals you now have less than one year before Microsoft cuts off Windows 7 you may not want to risk an upgrade but as Aragorn said to fit in in the Great Hall of EDS upgrading is upon you whether you would risk it or not wait I don't think that's quite what he said you know what else is close I can almost smell it so close that's our sponsor it won't help you with your Windows 7 problem but they still G skills Trident II royal series ddr4 memory features a polished aluminium heat spreader that's available in both gold or silver and a crystalline light bar that radiates beautiful RGB check it out at the link below [Music] now you might not realize this but in spite of Microsoft practically giving away Windows 10 even to those with pirated installations most users stuck with Windows 7 rather than upgrading either to eight or ten something that only finally changed late last year in December net market share reported that Windows 10 installations rose above Windows 7 for the first time and now account for nearly 41 percent of the user base compared to Windows 7 37 percent now hopefully that number is going to continue to go down as we get closer to January 14 2020 the day that Windows 7 dies because otherwise we are gonna have some serious problems because yes yes ok Windows 7 it's not gonna die it's not like you just turn on your computer and it doesn't turn on anymore it's just going to stop receiving feature updates bug fixes and most importantly security updates which are very important if you want to I don't know continue Oh safe using the Internet now as it did for previous versions of Windows Microsoft is offering extended security updates or yes you ECU for Windows 7 enterprise and pro additions up until January 2023 but this extended the update service won't come cheap and adding insult to injury the price will double each year so three years of support is gonna cost a hundred and seventy-five bucks for enterprise licenses and three hundred and fifty for windows 7 pro og also if you're a mega ball or PC gamer thinking yeah no problem 350 bucks looks like what mid tier graphics card sorry I've got some bad news for you too ESU is only available for volume license subscriptions which are usually held by companies or schools so business is running Windows 7 machines on Microsoft's Azure cloud as part of the Windows virtual desktop program those folks get ESU for free but again baller gamers I would imagine that scenario doesn't apply to you so then if you're just a regular Windows 7 user with a personal license what can you do well before we get too deep into your options let's take a look at why people want to hold on to Windows 7 like that grudge against their brother for stealing the last piece of their birthday cake even though they told them that they were saving it for later and hid it away way in the back of the fridge so you wouldn't know it was there Windows 7 was is kind of fantastic it's mature stable and reliable and offers a great amount of control over the way it behaves its interface is functional familiar and extremely customizable and it's got all your settings just the way that you like them I mean furthermore I wouldn't be surprised if anyone upgrading now has a program or two that would either require a new not to mention costly license to run on Windows 10 or that isn't available for it at all and there's other little creature comforts typing in the search bar retrieves results that make sense instead of a Windows setting you weren't looking for or a web result from big windows 7 doesn't incessantly ask you to send more of your personal information to Microsoft or decide on its own when it's time to update whether you like it or not updates are available sorry you know what I'm actually kind of in the middle of something kind of Roger that updating now but as awesome as Windows 7 is there are quite a few cons to staying with it past the end date for extended support besides lacking the latest antivirus protections Windows 7 won't have Windows 10 features like device guard UEFI secure boot and Windows hello which offer higher overall security for your system and while gaming performance is about the same some things like system boot times are slower in Windows 7 compared to Windows 10 so it turns out Microsoft software engineers weren't sitting around playing beer pong for the last 78 years also if you're worried about future proofing at all which you should be at least a little bit Windows 7 is not a great bet as software and even hardware makers eventually do stop providing support for legacy operating systems so even if you pay for es you support only lasts for three years and costs more than a Windows 10 license and you might be able to upgrade for free anyway yep even though Microsoft officially ended their offer for a free upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7 or 8 many users have reported successful fully activated upgrades by using Microsoft's official upgrade utility and even if you have to pay bare with me for a moment here Windows 10 might not be as bad as you think there are a lot of happy users out there who appreciate its combination of the efficiency and customization of Windows 7 and the modern design of Windows 8 and despite Microsoft's best efforts there is actually a fair bit that you can do to minimize their data collection and postpone system updates until absolutely necessary or at least until it's convenient so we're gonna have some resources for you guys for this linked in the video description but let's say you drop a line at Windows 10 fine you say I'll stop using Windows 7 but hashtag never Windows 10 whoo tell you guys are serious cuz that hashtag there well for you guys there are other options first up there's Windows 8.1 I mean I doubt that you guys have stuck with Windows 7 for this long just to get into the OS that Gabe Newell called a catastrophe and it's data collection and update system are kind of similar to Windows 10 but at least it'll be getting security updates though realistically now that Microsoft has learned from their mistake of supporting Windows XP for like ever that'll probably only buy you a couple of years so maybe that's not a great option so then what how about Oh Mac OS while Apple's desktop OS has come a long way and is obviously used by many tech enthusiasts the thing is I don't see many windows 7 diehards willingly affecting to apples Camp Plus you would need to either buy a totally new computer or begin the long arduous process of trying to turn your existing PC into a hackintosh now it might be doable but even most hackintosh enthusiasts are pretty open about what a finicky experience that is leaving Linux now a couple of years ago I would have said that that's madness but Linux is a more viable option than ever before even for gamers now we're planning another follow-up video on Valve's proton compatibility software but for now the main thing you need to know about it is that it makes an ever growing list of Windows games run flawlessly on Linux and community reports indicate that thousands more run pretty well as for the non-gamers popular Linux distros like Ubuntu work great for productivity focused views especially if the majority of your work is done on the web and there are even distros that borrow heavily from Windows for their interface like Linux Mint so your homesickness will at least be saved a little and then of course there's the last option stick with Windows 7 hold fast as your destruction edges ever closer so you goodbye to hardware or software upgrades and just well just don't browse the internet after January 14th 2012 with regards to that option I mean you know what Godspeed you brave bastard but needless to say we don't actually recommend doing that what we do recommend though if you we're gonna have that linked below so thanks for watching guys we just like this video you can hit that button I'm sorry it's a really bad news I get it but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured Windows 10 I guess at the link in the video description also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join we should have where you can now buy it a bunch of CD canonical we'll ship you one if you pay like a couple bucks I think you can yeah but and don't pay for Linux either way it's free it's kind of the point
