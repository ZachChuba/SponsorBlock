so things here at the workshop have kind of been grinding to a halt but something that's exciting is that i have hired a new team member so i work in a really small team mostly consisting of plastic creatures but also some actual real humans and i don't want to throw shade at anyone like my team is absolutely amazing but one of the things i really felt has been lacking is that none of them ever poop on the floor or even pee on the floor also i try to rub a contractor's belly once and that did not go well so i realized that it's time for me to hire a workshop dog yeah all of this is just to tell you that i got a dog a real life non-robotic dog this video is sponsored by simply safe hi so this is scraps she is a menace but she's marvelous ow and she's also teething and wants to chew on absolutely everything but her favorite is human flesh and unfortunately she also likes eating poop yeah you're not really a true dog owner until you've pulled [ __ ] out of your dog's mouth with your bare hands it's a very special bond we share so i got her from a shelter and all i really know is that she's 100 purebred workshop mutt i think she's like a west highland terrier mix of some sort and as you can probably tell she's lost a leg and i don't really know what happened to her she was surrendered to the shelter with a really severe fracture and they decided to amputate it but she's doing really well and dogs can have really amazing lives on three legs there's really nothing that she shouldn't be able to do other than like scratch her right ear so i just have to do that for her i used to tell people that i'm vegetarian because i hate animals so much i don't even want to eat them but that was a joke i love animals and i love dogs in particular i've had dogs almost my entire life i love training dogs i've taken so many dog training classes i will like zone out reading random wikipedia pages on different breeds and their health problems and i give people so much unsolicited dog advice yeah i'm a total dog explainer but there's just been so much stuff going on these last couple of years and i didn't feel confident that i could provide a really good home for an animal but one of the benefits of being a budding has-been is that i feel like my life has finally become predictable enough where i could actually take care of an animal all i want is just to frolic around in overalls building things and refusing to download tiktok [Music] so what are your qualifications as a workshop dog how do you feel about the name scraps what if i make it commander scraps are you okay with loud noises so when can you start working as much as scraps is amazing about barking at absolutely everything i would prefer to have a security system that doesn't sleep for 18 hours a day so this video is sponsored by simply safe they let you pick and choose the pieces you want to create a system that works for your space and they send everything directly to you so you don't have to wait for like a four hour window for somebody to come and install it i installed it at my house took me about an hour and if you do have any problems you can always call the simply safe care team they have sensors for every window and room and door and they will be professionally monitored 24 7 and a good thing is that they can tell the difference between intruders and pets so scraps is off the hook a side note is that i've installed a camera in her crate because i've started training her to be alone it's really great to be able to check in and make sure she's all right i mean we're currently at like 20 seconds but it's mostly me needing to get used to her being alone but i'm doing great what are you doing do you want to tell me what's up this is your frustrated bark i don't know what's there's nothing in here oh there is something in there there was another bone oh wow you smart little doggo check out simply safe by going to simplysafe.com forward slash simone thank you simply safe just before we move on i didn't realize it when i was filming this but i was having issues with my microphone and uh guess who fixed it i installed it in my house it took me about an hour and if you have any problems you can always call the simply safe care team ow that's my microphone no don't don't chew on the microphone maybe she's not a workshop dog maybe i should hire her as an audio engineer [Music] yes i've outsourced myself to a branch [Music] this is day three of dewy heel and she's already so good that i have to like try to trick her to get out of it yes also in making this video i have come to realize that my dog voice is absolutely awful oh yeah good girl i have gotten so used to my voice and like every unflattering angle of my face but hearing the way i talk to dogs it was more truth than i was ready for but at least you like it don't run away from my comforting voice why would you run away from this voice i don't know initially i wanted a larger dog i really like bigger dogs and i fostered a boxer mix for a little bit but i've had to realize that i can provide a much better life for a smaller one because they're just so much easier to bring along maybe not to space but we have been practicing writing in a backpack yeah you want to write in your backpack yes good girl good job do you want to come out yeah good girl no wait we're going to put on your do you want to come out here you want to come out let's put on your harness oh my god you were so [ __ ] cute [Music] if you've ever raised a puppy you know it's so much work it's definitely been a roller coaster but honestly it's the best use of quarantine i could ever think of except for the part where i'm becoming like a caricature of the dog owner and sending all my friends so many photos of her i've started doing the like to stop receiving scraps announcements please reply stop am i selling t-shirts with her face on it though no not yet why do you ask would you want one but i will confess that i started an instagram account for her i just hope when you grow up that you won't be upset about the photos i posted of you as a puppy so yeah simone and commander straps at your service i promoted her to commander because i was worried that scraps wasn't dignified enough and also because she totally runs my life right now i think she needs to pee we've been practicing peeing outside and by we i mean just her except for occasionally at that like 3am p where i also really need to go and i just i have an enclosed garden i don't i hope my neighbors aren't watching this okay bye [Music] you
