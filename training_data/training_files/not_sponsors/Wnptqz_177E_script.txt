and we are live ladies and gentlemen this will be truly one of my greatest feats I am going to be live building not one not two not three not four not five but six yes that is six trust me on this six computers today why you might ask well because nobody else had time to build up our new editing stations no you don't have to pick it up just pan over here for me nobody had time to build all the new editing stations and everyone said I did such a wonderful job of the one that I did on livestream a few weeks ago and people would like to use their new editing stations so we delegated that task all the way down from the top from the CEO down to like the writers down to the the studio management guys and then it went back up to the writers and all the way back to me so I'm gonna be building six computers today now you only saw five cases there that's because case number one or more accurately case number two because I already built system number one is right here oh boy without further ado why don't we get this puppy started down by using offer code Linus to save 10% and get free worldwide shipping that is so convenient having that all pre done for me like that all right let's get our power supply graphics card not going to need those for a little bit and let's build up our motherboard here so just like last time we're using the rog zenith 2 extreme and I actually want you guys to hold me accountable here because we've got six systems to build which means we don't have a lot of time to waste today so if you guys see me dilly dallying I want you to let me know in the chat Hey you got to get on this you've got to build some you got to build some computers no no I am not only building five Yolo phases I am building six there are six total of everything and of course I should take this opportunity to give a massive massive shout out to the folks who provided hardware for these systems a soos obviously AMD g.skill Intel knocked to a/c Sonic and NVIDIA also fantex with the with the cases there do I have Nicolas you are truly a peach look at this he got one of these thread Ripper slash epic torques its torques and torque which is very amusing to me your sense of humor might not match mine but I love it it's it's a torques torque screwdriver he got me one of these and then do I also happen to have an eye fix-it kit handy because I'm gonna need that for m2 installation alright let's talk through some of the specs for these rigs and why we went this route for our editing workstations now it's no secret that this generation the amount of attention on Intel's high-end desktop / workstation has been very low AMD's third generation thread rippers here have absolutely stolen the limelight and for good reason for a relatively affordable price like remember guys it wasn't that long ago that on the consumer or even high-end desktop you could only get six or you know maybe eight cores if you were lucky so for a relatively affordable price being able to put 24 CPU cores in a socket is freaking incredible so we've gone rise in thread Ripper 39 60 X because we found that it's a good mix between cost although AMD did send these but we were just trying to spec something that we thought would be actually reasonable when we show you guys filling the machines so a good mix between cost and core count because depending on your workload it's quite possible that you're not even going to be able to take advantage of all of the cores of a CPU like this not just quite possible it's like pretty pretty probable so 24 course felt like a really good middle ground with the possibility of upgrading down the line so one thing that's really exciting about the TRX 4t chipset and maybe not maybe not the chipset so much but definitely socket str x4 is that AMD has committed in sort of vague terms but have committed to supporting this socket in the long term so right now we already have an upgrade path to up to 64 core cpus which means that if nothing else we could expect another generation of higher-end 64 cores or I don't know like it seems crazy to even say it out loud but even higher core count CPUs like it's madness right let's go ahead and throw on some memory so g.skill generously provided these 32 hundred megahertz CL 16 kits so these are 32 gigs per stick meaning that once we've got I'm going to do my darndest to install these on the right slots this time I'm actually screwed that up on the last stream it's like the easiest thing in the world because all you got to do is follow the rule of thumb which is populate every other slot starting with the ones that are farther from the socket but I managed to put the wrong slots last time so these are another sort of great today and solid upgrade path for the future giving us 128 gigs of ram per station with the ability to move to 256 without replacing these and it came to my attention recently through a tweet from one of our editors that 128 gigs might not actually be all that we need moving forward someone posted a someone posted a screenshot on our twitter of i think it was a hundred and nine gigs of memory use on their workstation it's like what are you even doing come on like help me out here oh I remember this from last time I think I had to use the the dim dot to carrier for my obtained drive the other it's in the website oh yeah yeah that's that's fine I can find it that's another big upgrade that we're making here is all of our workstations are moving to opt Ain and it's not a throughput thing like if we wanted the fastest drive throughput obviously we could put like you know PCIe gen four SSDs or you know a a bunch of like a bunch of SSDs in a liquid or am full tech carrier or something like that but that's not necessarily the most important thing when it comes to system responsiveness and system performance so what we actually want is really really low latency storage I'm gonna go ahead and install it on the outside one I want a little bit less heat for my poor obtain m dot 2 because these things can get let's go ahead and get this installed so anyway so we went obtain these are PCIe gen 4 I guess I would yeah it's still a card technically it meets the definition of a card so these are PCI Express die state Gen 4 PCI Express gen3 by 4 m dot 2 modules there's you've got is that seven what a weird huh what a weird configuration so you got your controller right here and then you've got seven obtain packages right here on the top and bottom and these things can get a little bit toasty in fact Intel even sent us over with them these oh they're not here anymore but they're on the right oh here they are yeah they even sent us over these like crazy ek heat sinks for them the problem is that with our board configuration we can't actually use those so I'm just going to go ahead and get this installed in the dim to carry your doodad and it's not the end of the world because the thing about the dim dot to card like daughterboard thing is that it does actually make it really really simple to swap out or upgrade your storage down the line I mean I'm all for just yeah I'm all for like making systems cleaner looking and more compact and all that good stuff and that's one real benefit of installing your SSDs in slots like this so there's there's M about two slots under here as well the problem is that when it comes time to actually upgrade the darn thing you've got to rip out your graphics card or any other PCI Express expansion slots that you've got installed in order to get at them so it makes something that could be very fast and very simple you know you know half hour 20 minute project instead of a 5-minute project which you can do with this little carrier thing even if it is kind of bulky and an ugly huge aspect of it now am I gonna be able to can I give you guys a bit of a closer oh no that's focus oh crap oh boy Andy I screwed everything up there that's pretty good hey it's real wobbly I'm so sorry guys it's also not in focus hold on I got this how's that you know what we're calling that good enough we're calling that good enough ladies and gentlemen it's good enough don't wobble it again you're wobbling it you didn't wobble it that's pretty good Nicholas all right did you actually I knew that that was on your resume oh no there goes a screw alright so let's go ahead and get this puppy installed here oh boy okay third time's a charm Asus just does such weird stuff sometimes you know like a PCI Express 8x interface on this like weird custom memory looking thing and then you installed two like four by cards on it so yeah one goes on this side and one goes on this side so it's as simple as just pulling off the the heat spreader on the other side if we wanted to add another card or just popping off this one and replacing the one that's on there let's go ahead and take the all right get this puppy install and Malay did I just want to make sure that we're actually covering everything because the thing about NAND flash is that you don't want to necessarily over cool it because it can actually make it not last as long obtained to my knowledge has no such concerns so cooling this thing is a net positive so I'm what I'm kind of thinking is first system I do it like a relatively leisurely pace and then I keep trying to beat my time as we go what do you think should be think I can get more efficient six times let's go ahead and get this puppy install you're on Andy there we go so it's right next to our memory modules there and everything's looking pretty freakin tidy you can come down and look at this there we go oh yeah got that computer building porn right there that is a hundred and twenty eight gigs of brand24 course and three hundred and eighty gigs of octane storage and you might ask and actually intel asked me this for like really you only want 380 gig once like what year is it and I said actually yes do only want those because as soon as you give editors local storage in their machines they're gonna start using it instead of putting stuff on the server where it is supposed to go so I intentionally do not give them any storage and we have a company-wide ban on editors having portable hard drives or anything plugged into their machines not because I'm like concerned that about them you know corporate data theft or anything like that like I trust my guys it's nothing like that it's just because I don't trust those things I trust my editors I don't trust external hard drives hole so shiny when I get it - I want to see this shiny peel all right I'm gonna take my time I'm gonna take my time on this first one so that I don't have to get is there really Nicholas you think of everything now after that after that one video he's never gonna live it down the video where we repaired the pins on the CPU that was a that was a classic that was a classic I swear to you like I got gray hairs that day and none of them are on my head mind you you know I can't show you where those gray hairs are but I swear to you I have gray hairs from working on that video but this guy's oh no no it was nothing to do with that I had already I had already planned that you're not Mike so you can't talk too much otherwise people just hear kind of like like Charlie Brown adults talking well won't want Walt Walt Walt Walt well I'm not saying you know I don't want to hear from you I like it very much I'm just saying that we actually get complaints on the stream when people talk from off-camera without peeing like too much all right let's do some thermal compound Andy I'm on the overhead you can relax so why don't we try six different thermal compound techniques what do you think we'll see we'll see at the end log we're not we're not we're not gonna we're not gonna painstakingly like benchmark all of these but we're definitely gonna do some different thermal compound techniques so we're gonna start out the day doing something you know pretty conventionally wise so we're gonna go for an X here and then we're gonna put little dots there there there there and there all right we're gonna call that we're gonna call that pretty good you might have noticed if you are extremely keen eyed one of our very keen eyed viewers up in there that we changed out our CPU cooler we were hoping that we would get away with the Nhu 12s but as it turns out the 39 60 X is one inferno of a CPU and we had to step up to the u14 like how many watts does this thing can you can you uh can you look that up for me nicolas can't remember exactly what the spec is but it's surprisingly and we we talked about this actually when AMD launched the 30th nicolas do you know how to fix that I'm sure you can figure it out we talked about this when AMD launched the 39 50x so when they took their flagship consumer 3900 X which is 12 core and they went to 16 cores and we had said how on earth are they gonna do this how are they gonna go from 12 to 16 cores and you know keep the power and the thermals within within reason and then they turned around and made a chip that somehow in our testing ran even cooler when we when we launched our review and I was like what yeah it was like what I named II was like so anyway that also goes the other way so just because this has only 24 course compared to 32 or 64 in the rest of the thread Ripper lineup doesn't mean that it doesn't run really hot and consume a ton of power so we were we were little taken aback by how mostly toasty the last system ran and we are not taking any chances we're going you 14 u 14s see Daniel so for informs me that the fan is not spinning thank you see Daniels you unbelievable troll I can't call you anything worse than that because you're a floatplane remember but I would I would just just know that okay alright let's go ahead and get this heatsink attached here Wow half of the half of the floatplane chat I mean I singled out see Daniels there but half of the floatplane chat is just talking about and not spinning K the fan is not on the heatsink at this time so I don't even want to hear about it and the fan was spinning 280 watt TDP so this is not your Grandpa's you know CPU not that your grandpa had a CPU probably actually we're getting to the point now where you could conceivably be a grandparent and you know have run like like Pentium Pentium 1 or like even going back a little further yeah yeah ok no this is not your Grandpa's CPU I mean when you were a kid like obviously you could just be a grandpa that just like has a CPU I just mean like if enough time has passed that I could say this is not your Grandpa's CPU like you know previous generation CPU you know like when they were young when your grandpa was young and had this CPU that's what I'm talking about nobody has any idea what I'm talking about that's ok ah all right and do you come on come on in a little closer I just want to show you what we're going through here in terms of cable management so I want to bring this over to the CPU connector right here but what I want to do is I want to keep this cable out of the way of my memory tabs so that if we ever need to perform an upgrade on the system it's not getting in our way here and what I typically like to do is I like to tie myself a little knot with the cable now I like to get naughty in here and it's kind of getting in the way of the memory tabs but actually that's not that ok there that looks pretty good that's knee in close handy oh it slipped a little oh there we go that's better all right so there you go so we've got this coming up over here and then we just got a little knot right there and everything looks pretty good actually and that's it that's it for the motherboard let's break out the case and yes these systems will play a no 18-hundred adjust a fine if people want to game in their off hours on their workstations that would be that would be no problem actually that's kind of that's kind of a crazy thought like there would be nothing that prevented them from using like oh man why is it escaping me oh yeah there would be nothing that prevented editors from using parsec or rainway or something on their workstations and just like not owning a gaming computer I mean other than just wanting the additional visual fidelity of not streaming but we've got like a 10 gig internet connection here so conceivably the entire company could be streaming their gaming from the office that's actually it's kind of sounds like a video concept well no I mean Nvidia shields oh wait you mean like the shield TVs I mean you don't need those because you can stream on basically any client these days it's just a matter of what kind of visual fidelity you can expect from the built-in hardware decoder and how good the latency is some of them are better than others so for our case we've gone with the Eclipse P 600 s it really was an absolute pleasure to work in last time really impressed with this case I did have a couple of blemishes on it which I'm hoping we won't have a repeat of but only only a close inspection will tell we also had some issues with this tape leaving a nasty nasty residue so hopefully we don't have a repeat of that as well because that did waste some of our time last time here we go actually looks not bad this one seems to be pretty darn pretty darn perfect actually all right well I'm happy with that got our tempered glass panel over here now I just need to remember how to open the oh okay well that was that was pretty straightforward just magnetic and let's try not to knock this motherboard off the desk when I take this off sorry screw for this oh that is it that's a tight fit come on here we go wait you took away the case box where am I gonna put the panel now it's fine I got this I'll just dump it down there okay people take off the tempered glass panel there we go try not to break it there we go and let's start with the power supply Oh so if you're gonna have a 280 watt CPU you might as well have a thousand watt power supply is it overkill yeah it's a little overkill but that's okay power supply is one of those things that they just no real advantage to cheeping out over and because the standards haven't changed in well gee I think back around the time that I first got into computers so this is around not first got into computers but around the time I like really started getting into computers like you know custom ones not just upgrading a PCI card here and there that was around 2003 2004 and at that time the 20 pin connector was still in use but being phased out for the 24 pin and we had we had 4 pin no we had 4 pin p4 connectors which would soon be supplanted by eight pins and then you would see like do lay pins or eight plus four or whatever the case may be that made its way down to consumers from server hardware so I guess since around probably so like a couple of years after I got into it so this is around 2006 to 2008 like somewhere in that range they basically haven't changed they've gotten more efficient sure like this is an 80 plus titanium power supply which is like you know you almost stop calling it 80 plus at a certain point and start calling it like closer to 90 plus it's crazy they're crazy efficient them and you know things like modular interfaces have become commonplace when that used to be like an esoteric feature that you might find on you know some weird power supply but fundamentally they're the same the same things that they were all those years ago so there's nothing wrong with making and I hate to use the word investment because an investment is something that pays out over time in a computer unless you use it for work does not pay out over time but there's nothing wrong with making an investment into a good quality power supply one that you can carry forward with you for potentially years to come and when I use the term investment I mean investment in the sense of hey if you buy it now then that's just you know one piece that you don't have to replace or upgrade later on down the line when you go with something more powerful or whatever the case may be so the modular cables that I'm installing right now assuming I can switch angles here and show you guys what I'm doing here we go modular cables I'm installing in this unit are Andy you're not all right the 24 pin I think we need to eight pins for this motherboard I would assume so 280 watt CPU yep - eight pins for the CPU so those are going right here and then we've got 2 6 plus 2's and these are going to be for our 2080 super graphics card funny story we might actually end up swapping out those 20 80 supers and the reason for it is that some of our editors Taron sorry excuse me I had something caught in my throat there some of our editors are managing to use not just the eight gigs of VRAM that you would find on a 20 80 super but actually too much for even a Titan V so Terran has been regularly using somewhere in the neighborhood of 13 gigs a video memory which has been causing some like like hitching type behaviors in his software like which Nikolas which software was he having trouble with in particular was it After Effects it was premiered okay so the issue is when is V RAM is full she's getting kind of weird hitching in Premiere so we tried swapping out the Titan V for a Quadro p6000 which is a generation older in terms of the actual performance but as a has 24 gigs of vram and the problems went away so what he said was it takes longer to render when you're using the GPU so anything sort of GPU accelerated takes longer on it but it's more stable and makes for a smoother editing experience so we might actually end up shoot did I pick the wrong bit here so we might actually end up swapping out all of the GPUs for Quadra piece 6000 so you can get them on eBay for around $2,500 right now and in terms of something that has a lot of performance and has a ton of VRAM it looks like a pretty good bet right now part of me is tempted to wait around and see what if anything NVIDIA has coming in the next couple of months because once the cooler and shroud starts to leak you can usually bet that you're pretty close to a new graphic card launch but I don't know the thing is you know business doesn't business doesn't wait around for the opportune time to upgrade so you might just have to go ahead and do what we got to do here now what I got to do is install a motherboard actually yeah now there is one little trick with the motherboard install because this motherboard is a pretty busy board covered in lots of stuff it's actually missing one of the standard nine ATX mounting holes see that so we've got one two three four five six seven eight oops so it's very common for cases particularly ones where the case manufacturer wants the building process to be as painless as possible it's pretty common for cases to include standard motherboard mounting standoffs but especially because this one here if you kind of have a close look at this Andy especially because this one is one of the little knobbly ones that'll help you hold the motherboard in place it would actually do a number on the back of our motherboard here if we left it installed that is if we had a motherboard that didn't have a protective shield on the back either way it would scratch up the back of the board and that's not something that we want to do so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna pop this puppy off here oh boy I'm starting to get a little disorganized nope just leave it for now because I don't want to run into a situation where I need stuff and I've already packed up the box I don't think I need any more modular cables but one SATA cable for the oh-yo that's right okay great thank you this will go I love and Texas accessory boxes so they've got so I'm where's the where's the other things I think it's in here somewhere in here somewhere wait for it oh yeah all the little screws that I need all nicely arranged and here's an extra one that I don't need absolutely love it alright let's go ahead maybe you know what I'm gonna mix things up today I'm gonna mix it up I'm gonna actually lay down the case while I build a computer for a change well it's fine it's chill don't worry it's all good you're tilted all right I'm gonna just switch to the other view oh boy now we're zoomed in too far I knew this was gonna happen wait for it I got this oh oh yeah oh sweet all right Andy we're not looking at you right now so you can use that monitor to tell if we're actually looking at your camera or not here we go so convenient man it's like in most cases I wouldn't recommend high-end stuff per se because you can get a lot better value by going for something you know in the mid-range but it sure is nice to have creature comforts like built-in IO shields and pre-installed standoffs in your case and all that kind of stuff and I definitely don't complain when I get to work with high-end hardware just little things and it's like you know from from a performance from a price to performance standpoint it makes no sense which is again why like I'd you know I'm not gonna go out and recommend that you spend $400 $500 on a motherboard like that's tough to that's tough to justify when you can get a lot of that performance for for less it's just when I get the opportunity it is nice that was always something that I liked about building customer systems back when I was working at NCI xr8 because I got to have the fun of like you know hey well we got a stress test it so we're gonna have to fire up some games right because how else are we going to stress test it right so you get to kind of play with it but you don't actually have to spend all your own money on it that was that was a really great hobby when I was in school I would you know try to build okay you never hmm okay that's not very magnetic you never want to build systems and then like try to flip them on Craigslist but if you can find people who need systems whether they're fellow classmates or whatever the case may be it can be a nice way to make like you know 30 50 bucks here and there just feel like yeah I'll you know I'll build it for you and give you some help with it it's the kind of thing that once you reach a certain point you can't keep doing because people as soon as you build a computer for someone they're gonna come to you about every little stupid thing with it it's like you know oh hey you know it doesn't have doesn't have office on it I thought it would have office on it and you're like well why would you think that office is paid software did you pay for office well then I guess you don't have it but people have this expectation when you're like you know a fly-by-night student building a computer for them that you'll just pirate things for them and I was like you know you're running to you run into trouble where people have unrealistic or unfair expectations but it is something that I did have fun doing from time to time yeah I did have to get a real job eventually of course though okay I'm just gonna loosen a couple of these screws it looks like this is not quite perfectly lined up here and that is why you never tighten it down all the way until you've got at least most of the screws in I should probably pay some attention to chat that is kind of the point of live streaming all right effing chat for Orange screwdriver I cannot tell you guys anymore unfortunately there are simply no details that I am able to share with you at this time I would love to but and hopefully this doesn't give away too much Nick wouldn't like it there you go that's all I can say oh come on just thread in you vicious Punk you I'm just gonna have to see this is why this is why I end up building systems standing upright because I can actually reach them better in a certain sense and though there will be no video coming anytime soon anything to do with any screwdrivers no video anytime soon I can guarantee you that can do Goggan Annie says hey you always call roubles it's not it's INR rupees know what I actually always do is alternate between various currencies that have relatively low value when I'm referring to the Canadian dollar so that's why I'll say Canadian rupees or Canadian rubles because I'm poking fun at our own currency which has dropped significantly against the greenback over the last year or so and other currencies that also have relatively low value compared to the greenback so yes I'm I'm teasing the rupee and the ruble I am aware that they are separate currencies though ah this is unfortunate one of these screws I'm not able to I'm actually not able to get it I don't think oh wait maybe I can if I can kind of get it in there at an angle oh yeah it's not bad I figure it's one of those things where it's like if my if my currency sucks then I get to you know I get to tease other people for having currency sucks kind of like how I can make short jokes right all right motherboards in let's go ahead and flip this puppy up all right we're back on back on you Andy looking pretty good hey making good progress here let's go ahead and get that SATA cable that we're gonna need later um Oh interesting the see sonic includes like adapters and that's a molex to dual SATA adapter to handle adding extra SATA just in case you don't need any molex which I guess it's pretty common these days like what would people normally use molex for unless you've got like an older d5 pump or something like that I do wish they included a shorter dulce de cable with this particular kit we could have gone with cable mod kits like done custom tables or whatever but again that was one of those we're trying to present like a reasonable thing people might actually you know also build and you know most people when they're building a workstation for the office they're not gonna put like expensive individually sleeved cables in it like that doesn't make a ton of it doesn't make a ton of business sense you know all right I'm just gonna hide away back here and plug in my cables I don't know I can't see what I'm doing cable management cable management starts with cable management planning so let's go ahead and figure out which ones are going to be our bottom layer here we need there they are so we need our graphics connectors going up to where they need to go oh we need to detach all of our front panel connectors there we are please tell me this motherboard has the front type-c connector oh heck yeah it's actually got two of them is very nice okay so let's detach all these there we go we're gonna run our duel eight pins for our graphics over here yeah that looks about right easy there we go put that right about there or what do you think Andy where do you want the graphics run you want it coming up over here to the graphics card like that or should we use this this puppy right here and come out from the bottom you want up from the bottom all right if the andyman says so then so it shall be because the andyman I can't sing this song so I'll stop cuz I don't want to get demonetised oh yeah how long has this taken me so far 38 minutes Jebus ah I'm gonna have to start kicking it into high gear a little bit aren't I is that your point okay alright I'm gonna have to cool you're gonna have to build build computers a little faster oh no oh it's not gonna help if I start knocking things off the case here oh oh alright well that's fine that's fine let's do some cable management here get to get the 24 pin you know what though no no no I'm not taking the bait I'm still sandbagging this first one yeah because I want to beat this time later see that's why that's why I made sure that you know when I first got together with my wife it was always very unsatisfying okay because you gotta set a bar you got to set a bar somewhere you know like everyone likes to see a record broken you know like that's you know that's why we watched the Olympics or whatever right it would take all the excitement out it if you know you'd already seen the very best that you could see and you know there's no surprises left you know what I'm talking about guys so there you go that's a life tip right there marriage tip you know you want to keep it exciting start with the very worst start with the very worst that's another thing too is if you know if she'll accept that then you go this is great you know this is a lady with standards that I can that I can live up to you know it's good it's good just kidding I'm just messing with you she's not watching this all right let's plug in our to eight pin connectors here yes he's four plus for us they're very convenient in that you can use them in an eight pin or a four pin socket but a very inconvenient in that plugging them in can be a bit of a pain in the monkey oops helps if you turn them around the right way well there's your problem and a one and A two all right that's looking pretty good pretty sharp huh pretty sharp right oh boy some of the some of the luster of working on this system is gonna come off once I'm working on the like sixth one here comes our USB type-c connector you can come in and get pretty close for this kind of stuff handy that it's amazing how much IO they can put on these thread Ripper boards just cuz there's so many PCI Express Lanes like you can just load it up with whatever you want as a manufacturer it's pretty cool meanwhile Intel was like 2024 odd seems like all consumers would ever need and that's a fair point I do oh no what the heck we got bad news here ladies and gentlemen I think your best angle if this is actually gonna be from back here hey Nicholas had we unboxed these motherboards before a sous a sous a sous ok so Andy what you need to see here is the USB 3 connector which I'm trying to point at but I actually can't see what I'm pointing at so I'm gonna have to come around to the same side as you but here give me a sec here this puppy right here that one right there can you see that the pins are mangled and this is a board that I have not touched before doing this stream to say that I'm a little frustrated would be an understatement at this time the USB 3.0 so the like classic USB type a internal USB connector has notoriously fragile pins that are very easy to to damage or break so they're bad enough under perfect conditions and they're even worse when they are slightly misaligned or in this case very misaligned and you need to try to fix them ok I'm gonna try and use a small flat-head screwdriver tip here I don't know how well you can see what I'm doing here Andy you can see it ok so what I'm going to do is try to bend these up it's a really tiny awful pins to work with compared to the older usb2 ones look at this pin what a mess like come on guys now it is I'm not saying with a hundred percent certainty that this is a CSIS fault I mean it's possible that in inventory inglis board we somehow managed to stick something in this in this plug but I I really doubt it and I'm pretty sure this board hasn't been used before because these were all received and then put on a pallet for safekeeping for this project so yeah I'm not I'm not gonna say a hundred percent that it's a soos but it seems like a pretty reasonable probability that this was not us and the only two people that have ever had this board as far as I know are us and a soos man I'm having a hard time even seeing where some of these pins come from here a secondary one like of this type I thought there was only a secondary of the the type C type no shoot did I just bend that break that time well hold on if I can fix it then you know I might as well go boss mode and fix it right hard mode sorry hard mode I'm always boss mode okay that looks reasonably well aligned I don't know if it's gonna be good enough though okay oh boy this is quite a thing if I was doing this while the board was not installed in the case it would be a little easier come on baby I can't believe how mangled this was man oh my god my guys okay check it out how do we do Andy what do you think does that look pretty good you see you see don't look pretty aligned all right well don't tell me good job just yet we don't want to count our USB chickens before they're you know whatever you take the job back just good or just job not good job yeah I'm putting that on your performance review this year Andy job oh you know what's funny huh that's funny I can't even plug into this one anyway because there's an interference issue well we're never gonna know okay I think I even vaguely remember that from the last build I have to plug into the bottom one well okay then wow that is incredible this case or this motherboard has one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve USBs on the back of which one of them is 20 gigabit five more our 10 gigabit it looks like oh wait no five one two three four five six seven seven of them are ten gigabit and then four of them are five gigabit and then it has up to another eye is it just it's just one connector off each of these USB type-c ones right I think so yeah so two plus another six that's eighteen USB 3 port 18 USB 3 ports ok I want no I want to hear from you people who needs 18 USB 3 ports you tell me I want I want to know not just who you are but what you need 18 USB 3 ports 4 that is absurd our ingest station does not use 18 USB 3 ports are you serious pretty much but we have that running off of a Mac Mini ok ok but that's the thing is like you would never use that many of them all at once anyway so why not just use a hub right Taron for all those keyboards ok it's a fair point but terran only needs USB 2 for his keyboards he doesn't need high-speed USB 3 connections for keyboards i mean unless they're like fancy keyboards with displays in them or whatever and then you need the extra power delivery okay yeah but stream decks are USB 2 aren't they I think so I could be wrong about that I could be wrong that could be wrong alright power reset ok these are things that I can remember for future and that will make the other builds go a little bit faster I won't have to look that closely to get all the front panel connectors hooked up and stuff like that ah shoot no no so Kyle switches to the top angle Andy I'm just trying to get this get this plugged in here and I think I missed by a little bit Oh No reset I think the quality standards are probably gonna end up slipping as the stream goes on - that's that's not something I'm that's something I'm willing to accept let's do we'll do a little bit of a cable management here not too much I'm just glad I'm not putting like AI Oh liquid coolers and these things or anything like that cuz that is a lot more work than mounting an air cooler like this especially with AMD's nice simple you know here's four threaded things and knocked was pre-installed thing just four screws you're done and I love it oh yes I definitely want to switch cameras thanks Andy you got me you got me I know you got me see I can always I can always count on a smooth production when the andaman is involved because the andaman can alright we're gonna go ahead and plug this puppy into our cpu opt actually no i'm gonna plug that into a case fan header okay so that one's labeled water pump and sometimes a Seuss's water pump headers can behave kind of funny oh is that another water pump with what the heck where's just a street okay that's a pump connector that's a pump connector I just want a standard fan huh just like a chassis fan there's a chassis fan when there's a chassis fan one but I can't reach those ones one of them no one of them is something flow water flow sensor or something it's a three pin okay screw it we're going into CPU opt then and we'll just have everything controlled via CPU temperature I guess that's okay there we go that's not so bad now we just got to do a little bit of cable management and graphics card oh yeah Wow Patrick's card how does Nvidia make their founders Edition cards look so good and then follow it up with that weird thing that we keep seeing leaks over 3000 series like seriously Nvidia you guys were on such a roll here alright let's go ahead and install in the yep there we go oh here's something I didn't think of with the U 14 yes are we gonna have any interference issues with this top PCI Express law I sincerely hope not no it's fine that is oh boy hold on a second wait for it wait for it holy crap that's tight okay we good we good all good wow that is that is really tight it's a good thing this board doesn't have an actual like top position PCI Express slot because we would not be able to use it with this giant cooler on here have to go eh IO or something like that and that would be boy would that be a lot of work to undo what we've done so far installing all-in-one similar nope nope nope nope all the nope definitely happier with this solution okay six pin right there eight pin right there that's in we're gonna pull this tight love how this case has a built-in fan controller so I only had to plug in that one fan connector then hold on a second there we go all right Andy that does look pretty clean that was a good choice good choice sir there we go everything is looking good from the front what do you think pretty good all right now what we gonna do is a little bit of killing management at the back and then like I said the only other thing we've got to plug in for the fans is this 12-volt SATA connector and we're done that's all we got to do so easy love it these are the kinds of things that give me joy when I'm building a computer it being as easy as possible why would you want it to be more difficult that's more time for like tinkering with your overclock or gaming or you know whatever it is that makes you happy should I even bother cable tying the bottom here okay I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it where do we have some LTT store.com cable ties just behind out all right thanks Alex you threw them at me speaking of throwing our sponsor for today's video I'm gonna throw to that this video is brought to you by drop com the mass drop x sennheiser opened back HD 5x jubilee headphones were tuned by Axel Braille of Sennheiser and mass drop based on feedback from their community it features new 150 ohm drivers and a colorway inspired by the HD 5 80s they feature clear fast and dynamic sound with a glossy black headband elliptical ear cups that are super comfy with replaceable soft velour earpads which are also super comfy you've got a detachable the cable and you can get yours now at the link in the video description you guys totally missed it you missed all the cable management I'm just gonna just gonna close up the panel now yeah it's pretty good don't don't give them a close look and you don't get too close all right there we go yep good job Linus on the cable management there a hold on a second oh yeah there we go oh yeah very nice oh great cable management line it's good job yeah if you want to see the cable management you're gonna have to you know stay tuned for the next machine because for those of you who are just tuning in now we got more where that came from all right what are the odds you think I built this correctly Nicholas I was trying to be I was trying to be pretty pretty careful as we went through here all right do you want to fire this up over on the side there and I'll take is that system number two right there all right let's get a little bit of let's get a little bit of tidy up done here so that we're not cross contaminating the pieces of you know one system and another go here this is power supply stuff this is fan tech stuff this is power supply stuff got to keep all the accessories together it's like one of the hardest things for me anyway is I don't know if I've ever managed to build a computer without the area around me looking like there was an explosion you know I'm just gonna leave the screws container thing like in the bottom of the case is that cool no because then if we need it it's there otherwise if we need it like there's we have to go dig around and wherever we stored the box for all this stuff like yeah so I'm gonna do that oh I've got this goes in the motherboard blocks that I have and hold on a second this thing right here is top-secret ah there you go Oh ah wait why would they need Wi-Fi no because it's a matter of time until one of the editors accidentally connects via Wi-Fi and then complains that their stations not performing well and then I have to be like hey why are you on Wi-Fi in fact we should get hot glue and we should just this this one gigabit interface here we should just fill it with hot glue because the number of times you know what I'm gonna name names I'm gonna name names the number of times that I have had to switch Tarin's Ethernet more than twice more than twice I'll say that much cuz he'll be plugged into one gig and like having performance issues and I'm like I eventually go down I'm like hey you're plugged into Gigabit Ethernet it's bad K it's bad Gigabit Ethernet it's like it's good if it's 2005 but anything past that like we need to we need to move on ladies and gentlemen we're gonna move on oh yeah all right there you go ahead so you look how happy this guy is uh it can be if you want you want this one all right the first one well the first one I built weeks ago so yeah no the first one probably the first we're not probably the first one definitely was the best I built this in about half the time of the first one so okay is this all signed out correctly doesn't have an OS you know it doesn't have a no less right okay Nicolas is gonna put no less on it for you look at this guy he just takes it away and just leaves it there all in the name of social distancing geez SEZ SEZ just put a dummy thing in the port yes don't worry guys I'm not serious about putting hot glue in a port of a five hundred dollar motherboard nobody is doing that what are these in oh they're numbered look at that how clever alright so we are building system number three now heatsink number three CPU number three hey have you guys ever seen a full tray of thread rippers because get ready to have an experience oh that's disappointing Nikolas you let me down here I am let down we've got an empty tray we got this is like this is a whole Russian doll full of full of disappointment okay we've got a half-full tray a 3/4 full tray and an empty tray I hate everything about this you know what AMD I want a refund I want a refund of these CPUs that you guys sent over that I didn't pay anything for massive shadow to Matthew for getting that sorted out for us by the way good good guy Matthew all right I mean you know he just couldn't see us he couldn't see us you know using you know ancient technology to edit our videos so I take the front one here right okay got a ram oh yeah SSDs we actually don't have all matching SSDs one of our editors is getting one of these kind of it's like last gen but higher capacity it's PCI Express card instead of an MDOT two Intel wasn't able to find enough of these so we're like okay that's that's fine so we dug some similar obtains I don't want to put anything other than obtained in these workstations we have seen a noticeable difference when it comes to stability in our video editing software from having more Spahn civ lower latency storage not higher bandwidth that doesn't matter unless you're like doing something totally unrealistic like you know oh hey you know I'm doing like a crazy tech demo I want to have 16 8k streams coming in like whatever you know something that will never take place for a YouTube channel but when it comes to latency it matters so I'm a huge huge octane fan if I was gonna be a fan of like any kind of technology there was nothing else I needed from the motherboard box right and there is so much redundancy in this build because it's like all high-end stuff like our case is really nice so it includes a nice little fan controller and then our motherboard is super nice so it includes this nice little fan controller wow this thing's fancy-pants 12 volt RGB headers like three of them note in node out what's the node in oh that's pretty cool that's a pretty cool thing that I won't use at all for this type of build but like hey you know yeah go team ROG like nice sleeved SATA cables I remember SATA II alright put that in there and I'm gonna keep this open while I take the socket cover off so I can put this straight back into the box this time all right Andy you're gonna have a bit of a break because I'm gonna be working on the overhead cam for a bit here so we open it up three two one Stiles I should probably also have a look at some super chats are you starting the timer did you stop the timer for the last one we're being pretty loosey-goosey on the timing here guys but the general idea is I'm gonna try to build each system faster than I did the last one 57 minutes okay so I got a beat 57 minutes this time around I think I can do that I think I can do that tell you what starting the timer now okay I'm gonna beat 50 maybe 50 with this system so thread Ripper 39 60 X this is 24 course of Zen - goodness absolutely love this chip other than the fact that it has a 280 watt TDP which caused some cooling issues with our first system but that's okay we got our u 12s coolers replaced with u 14s coolers and we should be good to go now let me go ahead and tighten this puppy up here oh yeah and you gotta let me you got to keep us updated over there Nikolas with if those systems post and stuff I want I want to know if I actually managed to build them correctly aside from the speed all right there we go oh yeah now let's go ahead and you know what we're gonna do what order should I do things in I could put the motherboard in the case before I put the cooler on this time no let's let's put the cooler on right away it wasn't that hard to get it all right we're gonna use a different thermal paste application technique so last time we did the X with the dots this time we're gonna do we're gonna do five blobs here we go or blob in it blob in Stiles blob oo bagans you know that's that's the lesser-known it's the less lesser-known cousin of bill bill though yeah yeah blah blah blah blah pagans you lift that bag start not to be confused with Bag End you know beg start that's why you never hear about a long time ago right at the start let's appeal this stuff good old cousin blob Oh so named for his figure which is funny because you know you get names when you're a baby so he would have had to be and babies are already kind of fat you know so he would have had to be quite the quite the fat baby blah blah yep sure yeah yeah I don't want the suspense okay Andy have a look over there and see if this thing fires up please fire up it would be very embarrassing if I got the very first one wrong although in my defense you know if there's another you know mangled you know mangled socket or whatever oh yeah sorry sorry about that there you go could very easily not be my fault if it doesn't post that's my story and I'm sticking to it please post please post please you can do it oh that is not promising mind you it does have 128 gigs of RAM which can lead to longer post times okay here we go baby show me that monitor light this is a third one okay yeah yeah you got good stuff you know just first boot things come on baby you can do it okay yeah well come on just boot hey see yelling at it works it's a free tech tip right there computer not working have you tried yelling at it hmm you have yeah try yelling at it harder let me tell you that works with my kids just gonna I'm just gonna yell at them yell oh I'm a little harder everything recognized Hey look at that alright come on come on over here Andy look at this we got 24 cores we've got a hundred and twenty eight gigs of memory we gotta hit that that XMP profile up in here alright let's see what happens let's see if it actually manages to boot again I have just had such terrible luck over the years with XMP or sorry excuse me do C P which is what they call it over on the AMD side of things that I would not be surprised if this just does not even post just have very bad luck with it well would you look at that alright well it's still we've yet to prove that it's stables but that's at least a start it's better than I usually do with that stuff all right speaking of what I'm doing over here let's switch to my overhead and let's get some octane installed here get that octane up in this biz I love this I was just like determined to use these m to obtains not for any particular reason we don't have any intention of installing a bunch of expansion cards in these systems so I could have just as easily used large PCI Express cards for all of them but it just tickles me that you can get obtained as an MDOT - I would imagine that motherboard can pad with this wouldn't be amazing in laptops I know we ran into issues with the Sabourin 8 terabyte drive where some laptops just because of power constraints wouldn't run it because it's just a lot of it's a lot of NAND flash and octane does tend to be a little toasty a little power-hungry I'm really looking forward to the next gen stuff because if Intel's sort of intention for obtain is anything to go by I'm expecting it to be extremely it's like extremely low latency it would be pretty cool all right let's get the memory installed first I still can't believe I screwed up the memory installation and that other stream building one of these is so dumb it's like people were like that's what you got for not reading the manual I don't need to read a manual to know which memory slots to put a thing in and like everyone was talking about like oh you need to put it in ABCD whatever I don't like I don't even it's been so long since I've had to think about you know what letters are which for whichever the last time I had to do it was on epic and they do it backwards on that platform for whatever reason which screwed me up and has made it so that I just don't even know anymore like you know which ones you're supposed to put in from like a numerical like an alphanumeric standpoint I just know that you're supposed to install farthest away from the socket every other one very very simple very simple rule of thumb I just somehow managed to not put it in the right things it's brutal so I was like so sure that I put it in right and people were like this is because you didn't read the manuals like no this is because I had a complete idiot moment that's what happened I'm not even gonna hide behind that it was like being too stubborn to read the manual is just actual stupidity let's get this puppy installed here oh that's weird you know the other system right I put it in push there is your problem okay sorry I have the motherboard oriented the opposite way that I truthfully - I'm not gonna hide behind that as an excuse though that's what happened but there's no excuse for it that was terrible alright it's time I time a little not here get naughty plug in my cpu fan and that's it motherboard is already good to go it's got another case here which case am i I'm this one all right cool I'm already losing it guys we're only on system number two plenty of time for this to get worse before it gets better I've got some people asking why we're not using an NHD 15 that's because to my knowledge there's no NHD 15 with thread rapport compatibility thing as thread ripper cooler compatibility is not as simple as Oh thread Ripper cooler compatibility is not as simple as just building a compatible mounting mechanism for the cooler you actually have to consider it like you have to consider the size of a thread Ripper here you have to consider the size of a thread Ripper from the get-go and make sure that it's that you're not focusing all of your cooling like having all your heat pipes touching like just a small area right here because you're gonna end up with hot spots on these dies that are actually quite spread out under this integrated heat spreader so on Intel CPUs even the larger ones you could generally make the safe assumption that most of the cooling needed to be focused in the middle of the IHS no so for AMD where they can have chip let's kind of spread out so it is definitely the right call from Noctua to just say look we don't have we don't have a thread Ripper Cooley and you know not not put people in a position where they install this thing thinking it's working well and actually it's not because something you guys got to understand is the way that CPUs report their internal temperatures is based on sensors that are built into the processor and as long as as long as you have like a validated CPU cooler so one that is cooling the CPU in the way that it's expecting to be cooled that temperature sensor is going to keep it safe but if you have a situation where you've got a cooler that's doing a great job of cooling the area right where the temperature sensor is but that is not doing a good job of cooling some other area and creating a hot spot where there's no thermal monitoring you can actually have over the long term damage to that processor by not having a proper cooler installed on it so good call knocked to a just holding off on releasing a product until it's correctly engineered for the CPU for that CPU specifically and you can actually see here if you take a close look at the heat pipes at the base of that cooler they are specifically designed to cover pretty much that entire CPU area so that there's no part of it that is not directly touched by a heat pipe or very close to a heat pipe to carry that heat away up to the fin stack here alright so 6 plus 2 6 plus 2 I'm gonna plug in my SATA cable ahead of time this time I'm gonna get out ahead of that I'm gonna beat that time we're gonna beat 50 minutes here Nikolas let's go says so why is Linus making a bunch of identical pcs because it's where we're overdue to upgrade our editing workstations it's we do it about every 3 years actually not on purpose it just seems to kind of work out that way and as we as we've grown we've had to build more and more editing workstations every time we upgrade them I think by the next time around it is quite conceivable that we're not going to be able to find any any hardware sponsors generous enough to actually send us that much hardware and we might just have to like you know go you know dude you're getting a Dell or whatever I'm just kidding there would it feel wrong wouldn't it for like a channel that's all about building custom pcs to have its videos edited on pre-built pcs right that would feel wrong to you guys - right Andy what's wrong yeah yeah that seems pretty that seems pretty wrong to me I think there's no getting away from it we're just always gonna have to build our own editing stations there are actually a handful of people in the company that do use pre-built but it's only because we had to obtain those pre-built --sf or like a video and it's pretty bad manners to buy a computer make a video about it and then return it so Nick is running a like some a sous gaming PC that we bought at Best Buy a number of years ago for a video so many people thought that video was sponsored and I was like are you guys nuts but there was so much criticism of the shopping experience but sometimes it just baffles me the kinds of things that our viewers will think could possibly be sponsored like you clearly have never worked with a sponsor for anything like you have never even you know tried to coordinate a corporate sponsor for your high school volleyball team because sponsors do not tolerate like criticism especially like mocking criticism of the product or the brand in a sponsored video I mean we are really strict with our sponsors about that we do need to be able to you know factually present the product or service or whatever it is so a perfect example of this is in the rainway video recently we absolutely acknowledged some shortcomings of the product but that's not the same as like criticizing so Kanaka criticizing so constructive criticism versus what's like what's like just like no but we're not trashing on it there so we can we can constructively criticize it we can say hey here's things that we feel could be improved but we're not gonna just like like bash it whereas in the the best buy one it's like we come right out and say you know ha you know these these retinas recommendation was laughable or we waited forever or whatever else you know you can't you can't embellish like say we waited forever you can't embellish like that on a sponsored video we try to be very careful to keep things extremely factual both when we praise things and when we criticize them because otherwise you run into trouble with the audience right because if you don't keep it real factual when you praise it they're gonna call you out they're gonna say hey you're a shill and the definition of shill is very specific it doesn't mean someone who takes a sponsorship and says something is good it means someone who takes money acts like they're not taking money and it says something's good even though it might not be that's the distinction that's the actual definition of it so we have to be very careful when it comes to praising things because we don't want to put ourselves in a position where Linus media group gets a ref you've been reputation for being chills and we have to be very careful with the negative stuff because obviously a sponsor is not going to want like unfounded negative press around their product from someone that they're supposed to be having you know promote it so it's a super super fine line that I think everyone kind of I think it's fair to say everyone struggles to find their own balance for i.k guffawed says what's the current vibe about nord VPN there was a thing a while ago there's a there's like a weird perception and I have no idea where it comes from that we are sponsored by nor DPN we have never been sponsored by Nord VPN so I have no idea what's going on with Nord VPN other than what I said a while back the one VPN that we do keep tabs on is the one that we are sponsored by so that's private Internet access P ia we even did a stream with their executives a while back when they were acquired and we had some some discomfort surrounding that they basically came out and said like hey you know here's what we're doing to increase our transparency this is not going to negatively impact the the PIAA experience blah blah blah we left it to our viewers who ultimately said yeah you know we're good we feel pretty good about this so we stuck with them one of the really nice things about P ia for us is Tom Scott actually did an excellent video a little while back talking about BS when it comes to VPN marketing and one of the nice things and he actually said in his video that the video was supposed to be sponsored by a VPN but that ultimately they pulled out and he decided to make the video anyway and his his issue was that he wasn't willing to say some of the the things that this VP this I mean I don't know who it is right but that this undisclosed VPN sponsor wanted him to say that a VPN does because there's only so much that a VPN can do it's just part of your your online security toolkit is what we've been using as sort of our copy lately but what's cool about CI a is that we don't actually have any fix talking points whatsoever we can ask them for guidance if we want or we can just say hey it doesn't really matter so it gives us a lot of flexibility to why is this not going in wait the top one what yeah yeah yeah I took that out oh I figured it out you must have pre-prepped that other case for me because these tabs are in a different spot swoop swoop swoop swoop got to make a little bit more room for our sort of blanco sort of ei TX motherboard here so anyway yeah that's that's one of the main reasons that we use P ia aside from that we decided to go with them in the first place because they had a good reputation back when we switched from tunnel bear and I had already been using them personally for over a year at that point cuz tunnel bear was really great for certain things and if you watch like you can even go back like it's not like there isn't a public record of everything we've ever said about any sponsor right so we we really sold tunnel bear based on the ease of use but for certain power user use cases it wasn't ideal and there's no one VPN that is gonna handle every possible use case like for example getting past the the Great Firewall in China every VPN is always trying to provide consistent access to to Western web services and stuff like that in China but it's always a game of whack-a-mole right where Chinese government is trying to shut them down and then they're trying to find a new way to circumvent it and so on and so on and so forth so whenever I will whenever i well haven't traveled to China in a long time with all the tensions between Canadian governments and the Chinese government I won't be going anytime soon but when I used to travel to China more often I would always preload like three or four VPNs just because I wanted to make sure that if one of them didn't work I could fire up on something else it also is less of a big deal for foreigners just because if you're willing to use nothing but mobile data I've found most of the time it'll actually route through your mobile carrier back home so you won't have to deal with it anyhow but hey you know it's it's nice to be able to use Wi-Fi and if you can do that through a VPN then great one of the really cool solutions is to just put like a tunneling device in your home or office we did a video about that last time it actually worked really well it was a shoot who makes that thing was it ubiquity I want to say ubiquity but I could be wrong I don't know it's one of those things were like I think we crossed our five thousand video threshold a little while ago and it's like people sometimes give me a hard time about you know not remembering the model number of some something or like I'll I'll get a detail wrong they'll be like I literally learned this from you on tech recants like yeah I know I do my best but you guys got to understand too that I am I've generalist you know if you want to know the specifics of you know hard line water cooling do you sense there you go there's there's me there's me promoting another YouTube channel that specializes in something and therefore is you know more likely to to get you the nitty gritty details it's like it's not like I can't build a hard line loop I just do it like once a year so with all the other things that I'm working on you know whether I'm writing videos about you know a quantum computer tour at D way we're like you know a data center thing for shadow tech or whatever else it's just a lot to fit in my brain and sometimes you know the correct temperature for the heat gun for bending a hard-lined who doesn't stay in there it falls out you know what else we got in the chat nti compass says other than circumventing censorship is there really a need for a VPN like I guess I don't want my ISP seeing my browsing data but can we really trust VPNs with that same data or like doesn't even really matter so one of the things that we like about PIAA is that they don't keep logs and that has been challenged in court and they've had logs requested from them and they simply didn't have them so that's pretty credible so yes the idea is that you shouldn't trust a VPN and you should absolutely you know ask them to prove it on a regular basis but so far we haven't seen an indication that they do in fact keep those logs so that's good number two is and we've actually you know we've gone as far as to talk about this in our talking points because P ia doesn't dictate our talking points but if you pirate content for example a VPN is a handy dandy way for you to not get a letter from your ISP saying like a scary letter that says you infringed on this thing so if you're a filthy pirate then there you go that's that's another reason to use a VPN as part of a strategy to keep websites from serving you personalized ads a VPN can help but it's not the entire solution so there's a handful of reasons to yes in fact use a VPN but also I would say that like for me personally the times that I need to use one are not that frequent really because as a public personality with so much footage that Google I mean I upload so much footage of me to YouTube that Google can come through like there's really nothing left for me privacy wise so I tend to I tend to take kind of a Cavalier approach to to that stuff but hey you guys aren't that ship hasn't sailed for you guys so you know feel free to take it seriously I do find it a little creepy when I get like a news article in my Google feed that's like about something that I've never accessed through Google like I got I got an article the other day about what one of the Arrested Development actors is doing and I haven't seen anything about that in my google feed before that but I have been rewatching Arrested Development on plex so I have ripped the show and I have been streaming it to my Android phone on Plex so the only issue with that is that because I'm not actually using any Google services for it the only way for Google to know would be if it's actually monitoring the media playing through my device even though it is not through a Google owned application unless Plex has some kind of data sharing agreement on the backend which I don't know if they do I kind of doubt it it seems like a bit of a what seems like a bit of a far-fetched tinfoil hat conspiracy but there you go yeah microphone data would be a good debt creepy so yeah it weirds me out a little bit sometimes but then also like I said if they wanted to know anything about me Here I am talking about it on a live stream running through Google's servers so it's not like I do I guess I've just found that my life is easier the less I try to keep anything private because the more I do the more I just find that I end up really frustrated because I was not able to I remember going through this debate back when we decided to disclose the location of our headquarters like Linus media group headquarters my wife was strongly opposed to doing it for privacy reasons she didn't want the the address of the new office to be out there and my take on it was that I felt that just you know at some point we were gonna have to we were gonna have there's gonna be a reckoning right we were going to have to deal with it because someone was going to did you know based on real estate transactions in the Lower Mainland and the timing and like you you wouldn't believe the kind of work people put into this just to me unbelievably trivial stuff someone was going to figure it out eventually and if we just took the fun out of it ooh ouch if we just took the fun out of it by just publishing in the first place then there's less intrigue you know and I think there'll and what I said at the time was I thought there would be sort of less less interest in it and it has actually turned out that way pretty well as soon as we published the address oh no we pulled a little paint bit away from this one dang it fan text you gotta use less strong adhesive on here look at this I mean it's not too bad but it's like definitely a blemish right front and center on a brand new case I blame the adhesive not necessarily the paint because it was because the adhesive was probably put on shortly after the case was finished which means that even though this has been sitting in a warehouse curing for quite some time now it probably wasn't fully cured when it was put on so that's that's there's some paint tips for your fan techs but anyway it has it has actually worked out pretty well people mostly just don't really care anymore which is exactly what we were trying to achieve I forget where I was really going with this story or what comment I was responding to but Nord VPN oh yeah right so like privacy and stuff or whatever okay yeah I don't really have anything to to add to that any more than I guess probably good it's all I have to say about that I really need to read watch that movie I haven't seen it since I was like a teenager I remember it being great I'm a little worried that the CGI might not have aged particularly well but they also didn't overdo it they didn't go prequel trilogy on it and just like overdo everything alright we are already at the stage of cable management look how time flies when you're having fun huh it's good how are we doing how are we doing for time thirty minutes baby alright let's grab a graphics card I'm totally gonna beat that 50 minute mark we got this plush over on floatplane says it's still good apparently all right well that's good I'm glad Tom Hanks is definitely right up there on my you know if given the opportunity definitely definitely a fan definitely a fan he hasn't had any horrible scandals has he okay good I was hoping not I don't know I've definitely run into that where there's like I don't tend to I don't tend to fanboy over celebrities for the most part maybe part of it is just like something about being in the business of you know promoting oneself and kind of trading on fame just makes it a little less appealing to me yeah it's like an influencer or whatever because you think about it like in actor musician youtuber like it's all degrees of influence so I'm not saying I'm in the same tier as someone like you know a Hollywood actor or whatever the case may be but it's different different quantities of the same ice cream you know what I mean but definitely definitely Tom Hanks absolutely love his work sadly the German voice actor of Tom Hanks died he was better than the English one oh this is like what like like for German dubs of Tom Hanks movies there's like a specific dude that did it ha that's pretty cool I had I had no idea having never watched the German doubler of any film how fascinating all right pop that puppy on their whole cable management time baby all right these are super easy to cable manage these systems because the eight pins don't go up here so basically everything just comes up this one side of the system and straps down right like that look at that would you just look would you just look at that all right we're gonna put in we're gonna put in one cable tie again LTT store dog just just one just the one all right let's uh let's gather gather as much cable mess up as we can in one cable tie here and call that our big big cable management effort all right put that down flat there there we go just wrap that up oh yeah this is some this is some half half effort okay what why is that following you guys it's not a V now why is it falling it's taped to the back well that's why it's falling okay can we put it maybe just on the cart instead of taped to the back of that thing that might be a little bit might be a little better because it's hot that's our Wireless video transmitter thing from the overhead camera and it keeps falling off the back of the monitor it's attached to cheese guys usually sometimes he screws it up but not very often sorry just gonna wiggle wobble this don't oh yeah system number two done what's my time 34 minutes baby oh boy so I have to beat that okay but I had started a little bit earlier why don't we call it like 38 minutes all right 38 minutes and this one was bound to go a little bit faster because I didn't have to open some of the boxes like the power supply box so really the true measure is gonna be how the next one goes and oh hey how are we doing on the system did it work is everything working real quick here make sure our make sure our Ram is running at 3,600 gigahertz or 3200 are these three 200 oh that's right there's 3200 CL 16 right okay 32 gig modules so you don't get the same crazy frequencies or super tight Layton sees but it does give us the option to go 256 gig in the future you know I'd be curious to know if these would even run do CP at those speeds with 256 gigs I kind of doubt it you might have to yeah I kind of want to try it too might have to back it off a little bit okay where do you want this one okay two meters move move watch out for gotta watch out for that Rona actually you know what we probably don't have to worry about coronavirus I was at the grocery store yesterday and I was I was on my way I was on my way out of the store and I'm probably about from here to the fan wall over there yeah the fan wall right there I was probably about from here to some walking behind the guy I'm just like I'm holding my sausages right I had to get some sausages and bacon because you know had like a salt salt craving case having some pierogies you know probe's sour cream get some like steamed vegetables sausages anyway the point is I'm holding my sausages I'm walking behind this guy and he turns around and he goes cool it's all a lie it's all fake news they're trying to trick everyone and then he just like walks to his car and I'm just like I'm just like walking behind this guy he's like he turns around like talk some walks backwards talking to me and I'm like what is it about my face that made it look like I care about what you think you know what what is it do I look gullible to you was sort of the the question I found myself asking do I look like do I look like I didn't you know attend any of my high school biology classes where you know they they give pretty credible you know information about things like viruses and how they might work and spread and all that good stuff I never did get an answer unfortunately because I didn't ask because I didn't want to prolong that conversation but hey there you go that's my that's my cool story bro moment let's build a computer real fast all right this time we're doing the timer properly let's start that timer I should have said OTT store tom says 9 9 9 ZN over on flow plane yes I probably should have said Ltd store.com you know what I should also do is I should probably have a look at a handful of super chats at some point because some of these people sent them literally hours ago oh man how do I even scroll through this thing ok oh man we'll do a couple here you told me to go to the beat saber stream I can't stream any beat saber right now because my living room is torn apart we're replacing our floors brian says greetings from my tech room dungeon in upstate New York watching a PC build while repairing pcs I love it Fredrik I have an r5 2600 Exxon B 450 wonder if it's worth upgrading to 3900 X on X 5 70 Welby 450 check if your board supports third done before you go and replace your board yeah I mean when people ask me should I upgrade that's always a funny one for me because how can I tell you if you need an upgrade or not like you tell me is the performance enough for you if it is don't upgrade if it ain't broke don't fix it but if it's not then you should upgrade well hold on a second we got a flow chart here okay so should I upgrade right let's move got this right here okay should I upgrade do you need question number one is the performance enough if yes then the answer is no okay if no then next question do you have money for the upgrade okay if no then no if yes then okay do you would would there be something better for you to spend the money on okay if yes then no if no then okay would there be a material performance benefit to an upgrade because sometimes you might not have enough performance but it might there might just not be enough performance out there for you you know maybe no or not no single computer is enough for you so you know if there's no benefit then no and if there is a benefit then yes so it's like it's kind of up to you if you need an upgrade or not all right start this timer I'm ready all right I'm going fast this time I want to go fast there we go let's go ahead and get this get the CPU socket all sorted out here opening it up three two one gotta go fast SB 101 says somebody please make this flow chart over and our flow clean yeah that would be good fat Alberta says hey about that semiconductor factory to her until it'd be out of the question people here have brought friends and family for a personal tour and gotten fired on the way out your best bet maybe TSMC I doubt they would be any less secretive that's why I said that would be like a pipe dream for me for those wondering that particular users referring to an interview that I did with ARS technica that they uploaded on their channel responding to some of my top comments or like uploaded comments on top videos and stuff like that it's a fun little fun little interview definitely worth checking out if you give to cares about what I have to say about any of that but that was one of the things I talked about so that was like kind of like a pipe dream video for me would be to actually see where the magic happens and tour a semiconductor fab would be so cool I would love it everything about it but like the thing is I wouldn't even want to go just for like a cameras off tour that would be lame I want to make a video cuz I want to bring that experience to the world and those folks tend to be real super duper cagey about all the trade secrets that take place in a semiconductor fab I get it I understand I get it lettered in dot too we are moving fast on this one guys now I've got a flow you know I got a flow here's my installation screws for that MDOT to that we're gonna install and we are done with the motherboard box you can get that out of the way where are you putting all this stuff actually have no idea what he's doing with any of this all right we got Oh a bunch of memory let's go ahead do we want to do cooler first yeah let's do cooler so cooler number four oh yeah I did promise that we were gonna apply thermal compound differently on every single one of these systems so here comes thermal compound application method number three we're gonna draw ourselves a little target all the people at home be like triggered drew a little little thermal paste target alright you're gonna have fun you know spend the whole day building computers you got to have a little bit of fun with them right alright which sides which here this way cool I got my allen key how are we on PC number three but cooler number four yes because PC number one was built already on the first stream where I built one of these machines that's right and they're numbered according to like their their designations internally not according to the number like which one I'm building on this stream yeah thar fear if our top four is asking or answering someone else's question about which cooler we're using these are Nhu fourteen s's the Nhu 12s was not good enough actually do you still have that first system running right now Nikolas okay what I would like to do then is hit it with a super intensive CPU load and let's make sure that this Nhu 14 s is enough I sure well you don't really need to finish the updates first just okay yeah sure fine that's fine yes go ahead and do that yes Alex what can I do for your Colin never mind oh yeah sure come on up come on down oh I'm good with just like no I actually don't know if that's the most stressful maybe give it what they use on the last dream I don't remember I can't remember either you know what maybe just use blender yeah yeah I just run in the classroom or something we should know pretty quickly if it's gonna thermal throttle I think it should be okay I think we're gonna be all right but I want to know for sure let's go ahead and get this one I'm installed there's a pro tip right there you don't have to bend back the memory tabs if you just pop them with the memory module before you install it oh yeah computer speech all right that's Philips head here pop this puppy open God our doom got to install going up in here what's my time at five minutes forty seconds all right you're making good time here ladies and gentlemen I think by the end of this I should be able to have the entire motherboard down under five Oh not if I make mistakes like that not if I make mistakes like that I didn't put the standoff in for this obtained module here okay there we go Swamp and Oh see this is where this is where when you try and go fast you can get sloppy pop that on there oh yeah get that cooling installed edy Yaga what can I do for you you're talking to Nikolas is it related to this project yeah what can I do for you oh yeah yeah yeah everything should be hunky-dory well Nikolas they all saw the video where we were repairing the CPU and he never lived it down on his tombstone Nikolas all right motherboard done let's grab a case my case number three is this puppy right here no four rather yeah see now you guys are getting me mixed up okay we're at 7 minutes and 30 seconds oh yeah let's get our case accessories popped out of here yeah this is not working very well yeah awesome okay this is gonna be a big efficiency for later I got a memorize on there this okay I gotta memorize which one the screws are in that'll be pretty helpful save me at least five seconds when I'm getting into like true speedrun mode okay got an eye this is another good speedrunning tip check this out guys so in my iFixit kit okay most of the bits are flipped this way okay you see that most of them are flipped this way except this one this one which I just took out was how I found it so quickly and this flat head that I used for bending those pins that's because those are the ones that I need that way it's immediately visually differentiated so I don't accidentally grabbed the wrong one when I'm going for a socket for example so that one's for me to remove the okay that one's for me to remove that extra standoff that fantex has pre-installed in this case I mean it wouldn't be extra except that our motherboard doesn't have a hole there okay all right how quickly can he do the computer we're gonna find out I actually really wanted to do a while back I wanted to do like a blindfolded challenge I wanted to take on one of our writers here where I'm blindfolded and they can see so I just was like okay I should have 15 minutes to kind of like look through it and and and memorize it a bit first but then I wanted to build blindfolded against them but the problem was that we did kind of a that blindfolded challenge using first person view goggles and absolutely bombed on YouTube so sometimes we'll have concepts that we want to do that end up getting kibosh because it's something similar that doesn't perform well so it's unlikely that we'll ever see that idea come to fruition but I don't know let us know in the comments if you want to if you want to see that if you would if you'd watch that okay so in here I need just one SATA cable that's molex that's gonna cost me that's gonna cost me on my speed run here sheep duck says it's sad to know it bombed I really like that video I liked it too I think the Edit could have been tighter I also think that we could have chosen more fair teams it always helps with like a a challenge or a competition style video when there's actually some suspense about who's gonna win I really thought that well how do I say this without getting in trouble I thought Yvonne was going to be not as good and I thought that Dennis was going to be somewhat competent and then I thought Anthony and I would be reasonably equivalent so I really thought I was picking fair teams but it was it was not it was not fair it was a blowout so random RDP says if LTX 2020 doesn't happen I'll eat my stealth hoodie won't you better get some better get some ketchup and mustard yo cuz I ain't happening unfortunately 2021 we're obviously gonna try and bring it back nothing's a guarantee at this point alright and ma soeur says where is the car review believe it or not I am no longer the bottleneck on that project I have completed my script including the writing for like kind of a fun cinematic style intro what we're waiting on now is actually the motivation that I really needed to get it done was we got a sponsor that wanted a car video so we got them signed up and then it was pushed on to me to finish the script I have now finished the script and what we're waiting on is a location because our sponsor is a drone company and we can't just fly drones anywhere willy-nilly in Canada so colin has been training up getting a certification which fun fact is actually from a company that my brother-in-law works at so he's been getting his drone certification once that's done I believe we actually hey Ted do we have a location booked for the vault video do we have the location books like do we have the actual date booked for the Volt video we have a hold okay so what are we waiting on oh okay apparently the issue is that we want two 12-hour days and they're giving us a 6 into 12 ok and we're hoping someone will cancel or maybe we could find another set of 2 days where we can get 12 hours I think we can do it in 18 hours Brandon I think if we can't do it in 18 hours then we need to adjust the scope oh we're trying to shoot both of them at the same time oh I see all right well what if we just don't do that then what if we just do the first one actually we'd have to check with the sponsor and see if that's all clear with them because there would be a significant delay on that one okay all right well we'll talk about it more later thanks Brandon yeah good chat all right I'm gonna lay this down Andy you're good for a bit at ease soldier how you held them up over there oh shoot this is one that I keep I keep missing keep screwing this up there's a little thing here no no Andy you're good there's a little thing here that's kind of too tight out of the factory and you gotta loosen it and I keep having to lay the case down then pick it back up loosen it and then install the motherboard cuz it's too tight and it gets in the way of the i/o shield all right that's in now we're just gonna screw it in oh yeah we fly in now ladies and gentlemen uh-oh uh-oh people are spamming in the floatplane chat something from our / pcmasterrace let's remind lioness that he said this said what I don't have audio what is this it's from a video with Steve oh oh okay oh okay oh that's the thing about saying things on the internet oh oh okay oh for whatever reason I haven't oh here we go I think I have a pretty good idea of what I'm about to say so that whole if LTX 20/20 doesn't happen I'll eat my stealth hoodie thing was apparently a direct quote from me okay yeah come on come on that's not fair that's not fair Vitamix oh yeah okay I did I did say that okay I mean we we made our best effort you guys come on go easy on me here did our best okay now everyone's just standing LTX emotes in the flute play chat yeah I guys come on you're not making it better you're making it worse not better I am so disappointed that we're not doing it this year I was really looking forward to it and like especially for people who are like new to the company like Nikolas you must have been like stoked on CX this year yeah I forget were you here yet like just joined right I just had just joined it is a lot of fun and like you know it would have been great because people could have been going up to him the whole time like last year he was just a nobody right he had just joined the company he was still on his probation I think and this year he could have had people going up to him the whole timing like Nikolas yeah we have to make it a meme we have to make it a meme yep yep Andy I just sing about constantly the andyman oh yeah right right right right right right okay what's the limit like how many notes can I sing before it before it's problematic five or six seconds I doubt it that sounds very arbitrary I don't think that would hold up alright let's go ahead and rip out this pre-done cable management here 1 2 3 come on there we go let's do our USB type-c connector where are you at there you are yeah you are alright let's plug you in there we go you got that let's get our front panel audio all plugged into this B's that's done all right let's get our front USB 3 that hopefully isn't mangle ated neither of them are man deleted so that's good he's in the bottom one though being very careful are we being careful enough come on baby get in there there we go oh sorry Andy I know you can't really see much as I'm doing right now but I'm trying to build a computer fast okay give me a break here you're merciless Andy he's a taskmaster that Andy master of tasks okay so eight pin I need another eight pin where was it I mean they're all basically eight pins but I need particular types of eight pins let's run these up here okay all right you want to actually see what we're doing fine fine Andy you asked so much so much and so little okay you give lots okay dual eight pins there they are nice oh you know what we can do right now is we can get that secondary CPU connector our CPU fan connector but um but um huh having it sideways like this you can't see either side that's uh that's definitely a big brain moment here and II can't see you know the one side I'll just flip it around this way then he won't be able to see the other side either that moment when you're a Boomer trying to use a mean format and you do it wrong a tambourine sorry is this something I'm not aware of opt pine is for game yeah I still don't get it I mean the thing about Felix's videos is like yeah we did the like minecraft build forum or whatever but I actually I have to confess I have never watched one of his videos aside from the ones that people tagged me in and they're like hey - you're in his video oh my god cool computer guys video like I've seen clips here and they're like especially when he makes the news or whatever but I actually no I'd like I don't like I don't know much about like the dankmemes and all that so people were all like floor like floor gang this and ceiling gang that and I needed like an hour slash out of the loop what's going on like it's nothing personal it's not that I like or dislike the content it's just that I don't have a lot of time to watch YouTube reset switch power switch I keep forgetting which ones power led and you know I shouldn't have trouble remembering because the power led is usually in the same row as the power switch I just had forgotten that little handy rule of thumb all right there we go haha let's throw in a GPU what's our time at 21 minutes I think we're gonna be under half an hour by the end of this especially because the last system doesn't have an MDOT 2 SSD it uses a PCI Express SSU it's a little bit faster to install here we go boys and girls we're we're going in for a landing here [Music] subtle man I better start sandbagging this one a little bit because if I finish this too fast I'm not gonna be able to keep improving and I told you guys earlier remember my tech tip you know - marriage tips start off terrible so that the bar is low I mean not not super terrible like you still have to convince her to marry you right but not great no oh yeah cool how we doing four attempts Oh I was 10 or f/11 I can ever remember fine f12 bloody hell okay well I can't yeah it needs to load in this scene into the yeah okay that's fine oh sorry we're gonna put in our cable management tie okay Wow a floatplane chat went absolutely bananas after the whole LTX thing in a scroll way down oh I probably also have a couple super chats oh just a lazy bastard says my stealth hoodie and shirt arrived a few days ago but the stickers were ruined and shipping yes we have had some issues with that just contact customer support hopefully we can get you sorted out our new sticker packs are going to be packaged differently so that they should be less likely to get ruined and shipping like to me it seems so simple like I don't understand why stickers would manage to get ruined and shipping but somehow they do so yeah it's something we're aware of and we're working on but definitely message customer support hopefully we can get that sorted out for you 74 degrees okay not bad give me a second I'll come I'll come pay attention to you alright let me just get these strapped down oh yeah there we go yeah yeah you know we'll just kind of know right you know there yeah sure this is my this is my bare minimum bare minimum cable management here there we go oh yeah - doing just enough to not get fired tips bare minimum there we go let's throw the right our screws in there the others are gonna get these machines they're gonna like move them around be like oh goodness there's so many loose screws in here no no it's fine that's just in case you want to you know add a PCI Express card or something down the line side panel one USB three popped out it's fine good thing we're getting that sorted out now rather than later when I get pummeled for my bad QC on my system here that's my time at 25 50 ok I'm not done yet ah okay how's our temps doing hey not bad okay so TDI is under 80 degrees on every one of our C CDs freakin awesome we're drawing about 200 yep 280 watts so this is full Full Tilt here excellent I am extremely pleased to see that it's a good-looking system in it frickin awesome yeah I just realized that it's been in my phone flashlights been on in my pocket for a while no nobody's messaging me today feel unpopular that's okay I'm over it alright fine I'm done that's what is it 27 minutes all right well I guess technically I'm not quite done yet Adam for this panel on now I'm done okay so I got a beat 27 minutes okay do you want to shut that system down and then let's make sure that they post okay cool I'm gonna start on system number five oh man wish me luck here guys I got to be 27 minutes okay ah gotta stay focused here can we have an LTT wide online connect for tournament for winning a gaming PC I mean anything's possible you know no guarantees ah ha ha Pepe says suck a fat one - I mean paid $100 for the privilege so I guess like I can't really complain Ct 29:45 says no one needs that mini USB ports oh lordy that was a while ago over an hour ago 10 e92 says the Amazon and Newegg links are the same for the CPU in case Oh oops I do my message in this team and getting them to fix those links thank you sir Kirsten Kane says I missed the beginning of the stream what did you land on for cooling for the thread Ripper Nhu 14s and it seems to be working just great actually I guess we probably just answered your question there Luke says do you think the storage pipeline similar to that in the PS 5 will come to PC if not will we see graphics cards start shipping with flash storage for comparable performance optimizations I think either as possible we've already seen graphics cards with built-in flash although only on the workstation before from AMD it's a matter of time though assuming that the industry bodies who would have to cooperate to do such a thing can get together and do it I think it's a matter of time before the PC sees something similar you know one one you know possible terrible terrible sort of band-aid solution would be to just have graphics cards with enormous amounts of fear and that's that's a bad that's a bad solution though what about it oh shoot I don't remember our car crazy says if you're going to dismantle the hack Pro can a viewer buy it PS bit wood is gonna hate you for all the ketchup and mustard you're gonna need with your hoodie I don't know what we're gonna do with that system if someone local wanted to buy it for like cost of parts honestly I'd kind of be willing to do that I think just the problem is I wouldn't want to provide tech support on it because it's a super weird machine yeah I don't mind windows fine it's just like yeah it's a little it's a it's a weird computer you know I wouldn't move it around too fast cuz the CPU in case wouldn't move it around too fast cuz the power supply might pop off the thing you know okay and I need a timer as well it's good let's get a three two one go here guys help me out here yep okay 27 minutes that's the time I got a beat and this is the last one where it's gonna be an apples to apples comparison as well cuz this is the last one that I've got an OP team and about two four dad I'm getting out my 10.2 we're reaching kind of like frantic pace mode here a little bit cuz 27 minutes is like I'm a pretty fast PC builder but that is not a lot of time okay no time no time all right let's get this CPU socket open here open 3 2 1 3 2 1 oh yeah we got this I'm not gonna have time to like properly align the motherboard under the overhead camera and stuff like that guys it's just not realistic for a beating 27 minutes build all right let's pull out the carrier thing pull up the socket cover close this box on a nice little stand for me to work on it's get a CPU editing workstation number 5 24 and 2 cores man these things are unbelievable so fast like the only thing that makes a 24 core thread Ripper look slow is a 32 core thread Ripper or a 64 core thread root that's it that's what it takes I'm not skimping on little details like not completely tightening down 1 2 then 3 you get a go kind of you want to go half way if you can then torque them down okay I did promise a different thermal compound application method for each one so we're gonna go with the smiley face here okay we're gonna give it a nose just to make sure that Center is covered there see that's good that's good you guys like it anything it's a happy seat to you happy Ridge wallet wants to soups accidentally ran their pre-roll again all right let's get where's my RAM RAM number five don't don't dun-dun-dun and that's all I'm gonna say or sing to avoid getting demonetized oh yeah okay peel peel peel I just put a fingerprint right under that peel well that's a that's a cardinal sin if I've ever seen one but I got a beat 27 minutes here ladies and gentlemen 27 minutes is all the time I have to build a computer I could do it though I'm sure I can do it all right what the eternal dreamers it's not unusual no that was a Mambo number 5 reference what do you don't don't don't don't did it get come on I wasn't that far off and it was Ram number 5 that I was talking about no way oh wow the one Sarah's holding looks better already that looks more accurate okay yeah yeah yeah let's have a look no I want to see it now okay hit me with it yeah I mean hey if we're gonna if we're gonna like tease merch things and yep what I don't know what you're talking about so check this out guys we had some people speculate that this might be a meme or a joke when I posted a couple of teaser pages on Twitter it's clearly not completely done yet but it is real the ABCs of gaming we are hoping to have this ready sometime this year for people to buy for you know little gamers in their lives or the parents of little gamers in their lives so I can show you guys a couple of pages here it's just a fun little board book sarah has worked extremely hard on this nick has also done stuff well he's like he's like the LTTE store sort of like he's like the merged like department manager now because we actually have like multiple people who work on merger now which is crazy to me and then I wrote the copy you know we kept it we kept sorry don't show any more okay well I'll read you I'll read you from the first from the first three two pages here okay a is for arcade do you want to have some fun insert two coins please player one B is for button pushing these is fun to do can you touch the one that's blue then this is where the color issues are coming in because that looks pretty purple to me but we'll get that sorted out we've got we've got multiple samples here so here's another one that actually looks no nevermind is the cover supposed to be blue or green oh the print quality looks a lot better on this one though yeah we've still got a lot to sort out in spot gloss you say there's there's a lot of there's more samples coming in we're working on it okay alright alright next next one c is for console your friends are here it's time to play maybe they will stay all day see how they're playing on the couch okay D is for d-pad lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consecutive I did sing elitsa doe okay I haven't finalized the coffee for this one my draft copy is ah up down left and right are fine but try to make a diagonal line or something like that I'm not really happy with it might end up in the final copy we'll see those look awesome I'm very excited I'm very excited to see the more samples that hopefully are a better print quality yeah the bindings seem okay compared to some of the initial ones we saw got it so do we have the option to make the covers thicker than the rest of the pages so one of the things that I was adamant about with this book was that we weren't gonna cheap out on the last two pages I think it is maybe it is or used to be significantly less expensive to do like some certain page count and then going over a threshold was like way more expensive so apparently that at least could be one of the reasons that ABC books often have like Z and Y or Y Y & Z whatever have them combined on one page at the end so you'll see like some of the letters share a page with another letter and I always would see that in the books that I would read to my kids and be like what they can't afford to put in like another page is ridiculous right you're paying like $8 or $15 or 20 bucks for these books you know they're not always cheap and they can't like put in the right number of pages you know they can't have they can't have one letter on every page it gets me very upset so we made sure that our book is gonna have one letter per page the way it should be and I have lost my MDOT to screw so magnetic deafening rod here yeah I know there's extras but it's the kind of thing I prefer not to lose if I can avoid it just do a sweep here this is not boding well for my time on the system all round mark recognized nice that means I got the CPU installed right excellent okay well oh man that's really frustrating did I accidentally perhaps throw away the screw in the baggie I mean it's possible I didn't think so though going dumpster diving here ladies and gentlemen got a dive in the dumpster okay I found all the little baggies but I don't see the screw how do I lose that I am so annoyed right now I hate hate losing screws like that fine I cut the stand off but not the screw probably all those things were it's like stuck to a magnet somewhere I've run into that before it was like stuck to the bottom of a parts tray no I checked both of them already yeah it's not stuck - okay well I give up I will go get another one I hate this so much okay I mean realistically no one's ever gonna install all five SSDs in this motherboard I guess that's how many sets of mounting hardware it includes okay we are gonna have to like haul butt here what am i that for time ten minutes okay it's fine I can do this I'm going super speedy gonzales mode here you got to tell me guys honestly honestly in the chat do you guys think the kids book is cool do you think the ABCs of gaming is a cool cool idea be honest if you guys think it's stupid and lame I want to hear that from you along with your address and the names of all your friends and family speed build go go go I know right okay people apparently think it's pretty cool oh oh I just got my bacon I just got my bacon saved by who was it vicious hellacious see these are I even said it earlier in the stream these are the types of mistakes that are very easy to make when you're rushing and it'll cost you more time wait no I did take off the thermal pad tape dang it you got me I shouldn't I just wasn't certain I wasn't certain shoot that cost me some time fallacious way to go way to go people on Twitter and Instagram didn't seem to care that much about the the board book but apparently you lot are a little bit more enthusiastic cool because hopefully what we'd like is if it's successful to do more stuff along those lines wait why does this say five seven eight oh six was built because we needed it earlier yeah so there's a total of eight systems okay let's take off the fan oh man I got to go fast if I'm gonna beat that 27 minute time so I'm halfway there huh okay no problem I got this I can do it Andy do you believe in me Andy Andy Andy do believe your faith could be enough to get me through this okay thanks Andy Andy here beat em up we good hello all right cool well back in business ladies and gentlemen for those of you wondering most of what I said there was just gibberish and then I said give me two minutes okay power supply five screws cables I can do this what we got 15 minutes so I have 12 minutes left give you power supply mount the motherboard oh jesus this is going to be very tight fortunately I know exactly where in the package the CPU connectors are now so I've got those I have got PCI Express and I've got come on SATA SATA right please I don't need okay speed run this biz okay one key to speed running never pick something up and put it down twice if you can avoid it all right PCI Express blob CPU connector womp okay sorry guys can't pay attention to chat building a computer as fast as I can CPU connector I think I put those in the right spots oh oh yes I did - Kay good job got the matching up this makes it a little bit easier for cable management later and finally say the connector what's my time Nicholas 16 minutes so I've got 11 minutes okay all right that cost me a minute no problem why you in the screwdriver when you can use thumb screws okay power supply just gonna grab these cables okay grab these cables tighten D screws but watch out for these nuts I got him he would he get nobody how'd he get them he didn't but that's what's charming right my boo marinus myself probably sleep at night world's youngest boomer okay it's all about the ratchet ladies and gentlemen kids today and their electric screwdrivers how fast was that that's what I thought all right let's rip this cable management out the good news is oh wow the bad news is I don't actually have this motherboard in yet holy schnikeys okay we're going we're going up right install here ladies and gentlemen we got to save some time we've got to shave some time off on the clock here there it is please stay okay stay good boy okay let's go with something that is can I compromise on the motherboard screws kind of not put them all in what do you think know what the Andy I thought you had my back bro well I know I put all the other ones in but like come on bro I've got how many minutes do I have I've got nine minutes to finish this computer I believe Nick I believe Nick and Sarah they came in they got me all excited about the board book okay board book project okay good the good news is I got the harness screw in now that one's in okay let's tighten these puppies down I've got enough of them in that I'm not really worried about them not tightening anymore okay that's in this one I can just go all the way in okay oh shoot there's one more that I haven't put in yet where's my screw at don't have time for this okay that's in okay CPU power connectors where are you at where are you out don't got time to look for you okay strap so strap strap strap a nice strap please go through here all right installed come on baby you can do it come on Linus oh man okay eight pins are in how much time do I have hurry up I have seven minutes how the heck am I supposed to finish this in seven minutes LTT stomp yeah all right thanks Nicholas that's really helpful tape off a wet one the tape well okay that's a minor that's a minor thank you I will take the tape off this one all right there you happy okay 24 pins in the eight pins are in the PCI Express connectors are coming there they are okay graphics cards almost ready to go in oh no I haven't done front panel connectors yet okay no I'm in trouble USB see yeah that's not quicker it's actually slower it's for newbs it's not for quickness okay are you calling me a noob Nikolas Nikolas are you calling me a noob because that was what I heard he wanted me to use those stupid q connector things that a soos includes with their motherboards they're stupid they're stupid and a suit should feel stupid for including them because all they do is slow things down and make case compatibility worse that's right you heard me I got judgmental there for a little bit I try to avoid it but I'm under a lot of pressure right now got to finish a build here okay reset reset his bottom power is top tower led is also top it's a power top yeah you get it okay and that's in there that's there cool that looks pretty good where's my graphics card at okay this is a bit of an awkward angle back that's fine that's a minor detail what are we at I still got five minutes I might actually make it I need this graphics card to go in a little more gracefully than this though there we go there it is hey I found that screw nice okay I'll put that away later actually I'll probably make Nicolas put that away later I've already been punished no you don't have to go through all the systems they're gonna be working they're gonna be flawless go through all the systems check systems this system is built sir quality control this is the quality okay there how's that look that's not the worst that's dad serviceable okay let's put in our cable tie where did that stupid screw come from I have no idea how that turned up I swear I swept the entire table did you sneak it back onto the table I wasn't looking Nicholas are you sure how sure are you out of 10 11 out of 10 sure alright that's a lot at a 10 seems to check out okay that's down I almost forgot to strap down these cables all right where's my last one here does how we doing for time I do want to know yes I wouldn't ask if I didn't want to know Nikolas okay so I've got like two and a half minutes I can still do this all around there nice okay this is an unnecessary finishing touch I don't need to do this but I'm gonna do it anyway all right back count that's my time at 25 minutes I mean given that I spent half the time talking about a children's book I think that even I could beat this world record something with my time at 25 25 K still got time I didn't plug in the second fan header for the fan controller power for it yes it's table strap that down okay come on baby this one's smiling on the inside and the outside okay and for bonus points where's that motherboard box no I'm gonna put it in what's my time at 25 minutes and 56 seconds thank you out of consideration for the next builder I am even putting this screw back in the bag where the standoff that goes with can be found it's called leading by example kids okay pencils down I'm done 26:36 yeah flexing out oh yeah I need some water did you store calm yeah super chance oh yeah thermal paste yeah I got their little paste in there I got the smiley smiley paste still cold eli asks when are the LTC mousepads coming out same thing is what we're talking about what the board looks like man we have a design finalized like many many months before you actually see a product from us because we tend to be really really picky we've been going through like some t-shirt supply issues that we could have easily solved by just ordering just like any t-shirts but we've been very very very picky so it tends to take us a really long time to do stuff but I guarantee you when the mousepad arrives that you'll like it so there that's all I can really say holy crap that's a lot of flow plane chat ha - what's your opinion on pancakes with honey I mean do not have maple syrup jeez okay I noticed this build uses an e ATX motherboard and a fan Tex P 600's which only lists ATX is a supporting size okay so they are e-atx but EA TX used to be an actual standard that actually had like additional PCB over there and like mounting holes and stuff now EA TX for enthusiasts boards just means like ATX but we couldn't fit everything in ATX and we like widened it a bit it's not a real standard what this is it's just like a bastardization of what was a real standard and the server and workstation space city okay ae pep says shout out to cat my cat which is better than your cat Wow rejects casino says the IO shield is built-in smart ones I don't know who you're replying to concealed wanted to let you know I'm celebrating the birth of my first child today dang you Jay Paul and Kyle helped me through a tough season in my life best to you and yours hey thanks broken shield thanks Henrik Anderson Brian says whatever happened to members getting a promo code discount for the ltte store every month yeah what did happen to that um yeah Nick what did happen to that four members on YouTube we're snitching key message Nick just remind them they're supposed to get promo codes and Tom too sent like a reminder cuz that's Lane okay cool zap man 17 says the standard was called SSI ee b no it was not ssi ee-vie is a different standard for bigger motherboards oh sorry yes hold on a second actually I just hope I haven't said something dumb because I'm pretty sure EA TX is just an older standard and si SSI ee became around later EEE [Music] [Music] remember or not I don't remember I can't immediately find non-tech forums SSI EB 3.6 1 vs e ATX the differences between them ya know they are not the same thing and someone says there is no e ATX standard so going so that's uh just trying to think what's the first time I saw ei TX as a as a thing like it's probably way back like some of the early coolermaster stackers and stuff like that so Steve can tell you give them a call yeah you know what I could call Steve right now but I'm really not gonna do that if I if I wanted to know that badly which I actually don't give it two hoots about because I just don't care then I would go watch his video which maybe I will later but probably not because I honestly just don't care for all intents and purposes ei TX now means bastardized ATX that's too wide and might be incompatible with your case all right and then if it's something bigger it's gonna be XL ATX which is longer and also a very poorly defined standard because we don't know if it means eight or nine slots and then there's also getting into the server workstation boards all the SSA EB stuff SS IC EB and then there's just like the completely non-standard stuff like that weird gigabyte thing that poor Nikolas had to mount in the hack Pro hptx does that ring a bell because I know EVGA did like hptx for there and that was basically a new standard they created for their sr1 sr2 if I recall correctly I'm a little bit hazy on the details the point is if you're buying anything other than a normal motherboard then just just make sure that whatever arbitrary string of characters your motherboard manufacturer has decided to use to describe their nonsense form factor is also listed on your case alright you ready here we go three two one all right let's do this thing so my time to beat is 26 minutes and 30 seconds all right I should be able to do that pretty easily as long as the merch guys don't come bother me in the middle of this this is our second-to-last system - doesn't time fly when you're having fun I actually do like building computers but I like building them at a bit more of a leisurely pace than what we're doing today like if I'm just you know chillaxing and building a computer that's pretty chill this is this is a little frantic for my tastes the first one was fine now it's a little you know little crazy town all right put that there let's peel this bang it's shiny so have all of my systems managed to post with all of the RAM what do you mean so far oh the speed build the frantic build okay well so far everything but the frantic build has managed to recognize all the RAM and install windows successfully so I'm on a roll here guys I am on a roll I think without even going full panic mode I can beat that last time pretty comfortably I do not have to install this one dirt well okay then ah Nicholas for the last build do you want to actually just fetch me a random m dot - to use for it um no no and I'm about to is fine because I think what I'm going for is consistency with the earliest ones for the last build I'm going to speed run it as fast as I possibly can right now all I'm trying to do is beat that last time which I think I can do pretty easily and then the last one I'm gonna go crazy town so I want it to be the most similar to all the other builds a CPU number seven I had handled so many big PP CPUs today just kind of makes you feel like a man you know like a like a nerdy man CPU meat yeah you can't beat this CPU meat unless you have you know a bigger thread ripper than me which you might I mean they are in fact out there I get it yeah you got a you got some to compensate for that's fine now with these new PCs will the editors themselves become the bottleneck oh it's quite possible we actually we actually just recently started testing Adobe's new version of media encoder that has GPU acceleration and we may do a new render server as well that between this and the new render server could actually result in export times for projects that are like half of what we're looking at right now it's pretty sick all right what do you want for what you want me to draw on the CPU this time Andy draw a Linus okay that's way too complicated look at look at the thing I'm using it come on give me something realistic here a start all right we'll do a start do you want like a Star of David or like a five-point star five-point star cake okay neat just put some junk there perfect there we go you want to come and come get a closer look at that okay thread Ripper thread rippers the real star thank you you don't have to lie to me all right heat sink number seven how am i doing for time Nicholas all right I am actually going pretty slow here I should probably pick up the pace a little bit so I want to know from people who actually tuned in to both streams which one was more tedious to watch me assembling multiple computers for hours or me working on just a one computer when I did my personal rig upgrade for hours I really do want to know guys I want to know Darrien immune says LT t store comm yes well that's an unhelpful answer thank you for that does anyone know who makes Linus's normal Orange screwdriver good question it's a snap-on model it has served me very well the original one is actually has a broken ratchet now they have a lifetime warranty so I could get it replaced pretty easily but I'm actually just holding on to it for sentimental reasons so I used that one at home and then I replaced that one here at the office with a different one everyone says personal rig was personal rig was more tedious alright well thank you so you guys just want to see me like Mass assemble computers versus working on my own that I actually get to game on well duly noted thank you guys all right tie this in a nice little naughty knot this is more computer but personal reasons more entertaining alright fair enough okay now people are chiming in the other way blue zero says are you gonna give away those pcs over on YouTube yes I am going to give them to my editors who are going to use them make to give away content for you to enjoy how's that sound good good deal a plus deal like dough hole bang it god has hopes up or her alright oh shoot I took the end to mounting screw up but I don't actually need it for this machine rat cells coming up with those monetization friendly cuss words rat so Edie rat so it's a it's a bad word no no that's an intentionally not very bad bad word what can I do for you sir just watching you know you have a job to do I guess he could do it more easily if he had his workstation do you either net it videos around here anymore I'm not convinced he does I think he just watches other people at it and somehow that's like a job Oh production production manager post post production manager look at this guy alright here we go how am i doing for time here say great okay don't suck up seven minutes and 50 seconds I can work with this oh okay Nick says he added for those of you who are members on YouTube congratulations on giving a big chunk of the money to YouTube rather than float plane or Linus Media Group also there is a promo code for you guys for the month of June in the community hey look it's not that I'm greedy I'm just saying I think YouTube makes plenty off of our Adsense and all that other stuff and super chats and like all those things YouTube's doing all right they're doing they're doing okay YouTube's gonna be okay Susan's gonna she's gonna do fine yep she can have you know what she can have a house to live in wherever she needs it okay I actually have no idea what I'm just assuming it's probably fine rice rice er says starting a war oh oh oh oh floatplanes freaking out they're like hey hey hey hey floatplane discount code floatplane discount code okay i'm floatplane the discount code is not part of the deal we were just trying to come up with something anything that could possibly like give you tube membership any kind of value whatsoever that's what we were trying to come up with if you guys would like over on floatplane can you send a nick a message just to make sure the floatplane discount code is slightly better than the you tube members one it's not that we're trying to pit certain subsets of our community against the others it's just that you know floatplane is run by us so you know there's a little more there's a little more margin there that's all that's all I'm trying to say okay cuz if you think you're getting a discount on stuff that's not how it works you're just getting some of what was already the margin on it giving back to you that's how these things work okay I don't make the rules I just enforce them what are you sending me teams messages you're standing right there oh okay apparently we we put a Twitter poll up for people's response to the board book oh that's fun it's taking forever to load for some reason so I'm gonna go ahead and install the cables on this power supply while I wait around for that how you holding up Andy you're good you are a champion sir champion is Andy a champion or what ed that's not what I said okay floatplanes promo code is up no you can't say it what this is what you got sent what are you getting sent oh okay what does he what is he what is he doing okay oh you've got to be all that's so dumb okay apparently the floatplane promo code is one percent better than the community one the the YouTube members one so there you go floatplane you are the 1% thank you ridiculous that was a safe way for him to play it good old Nick's a flight hey Larry Ganz over on YouTube says you taught my son to build his first gaming PC i7 ten 700k with 2080 super nice nice love it gaming with GB says keep the beard I think I am gonna end up having to keep it I haven't seen the final final numbers for the beard versus clean shirts but I'm pretty sure beard did end up winning that Ryan Miller says I feel a little vindicated for parts for my newly built PC MP 601 terabyte SSD Seaside TX 1002 MP five 10s man that moment when your mass storage is solid-state it's crazy what else you got Xena too extreme for trying Z 16 gig 3,600 set it's quite the machine Ryan Miller no wonder you have 20 bucks to waste sending it to me as a super chat system five works yeah so I'm four for four right four for four nice feeling good ladies and gentlemen where's my screwdriver at thirteen and a half minutes wait whoa am i halfway through my time here holy smokes I've been kind of going casual Stiles I need to I need to pick things up a little bit get this power supply peel I actually don't think I did this power supply peel on any of the other ones for the sake of consistency I could just leave it but now it's like it's like ravaged oh man I just I'm getting like little tiny bits of it at a time this is horrible see Sonic get your peel gaming gear here I love you guys but come on oh wow it's it won't peel oh thank you okay oh that was traumatic hurry up set right now all right pop that in there I know you don't exist to aesthetically please strangers on the Internet but the beard is hot AF says Eric noble well thanks Eric I do try don't try that hard I didn't even find time to clean it up this weekend so it's a little little scruffy merch item beard comb how Lord I don't think we're gonna go down that path of like making the beard a big part of the brand because my intention is still to shave it once I have fulfilled my commitment which was to keep it till the end of the year yeah I just can't can't say that i SuperDuper feel like dealing with it on an ongoing basis I'm coming around to the look of it but it's still a little that's a little scratchy units like you know another thing to wash when I'm in the shower and stuff I'm pretty lazy when it comes to my personal appearance I mean you only have to go back and look at a few old videos to really see that that's probably true and some of those old ones in particular where I just like don't even bother to get a haircut for four months get in front of the camera it's amazing that mci ex let me be their brand ambassador I mean maybe that's why they don't exist anymore yeah single-handedly killed it all those months after I left all right screwing this in we got this ladies and gentlemen I doubt it's the board so it must be the case but the tolerance is on the location of the standoffs don't seem to be amazing everything else I like about the case is super super easy and fast to build on as you guys are seeing here today but I'm less sold on the actual like tightness of the manufacturing tolerances just a little less old not bad I'm not complaining too hard here it's definitely usable how am i doing for time here do I have a fair bit of time room I like I have only nine minutes finish this how am I putting myself in a position where I'm as tight for time as I was last time okay oh shoot this is not going in Oh see right as I say it's not you know a deal breaker I get my deal broken with a screw that won't go in and the problem is this motherboard has such a gigantic heatsink up there hard to get it to thread in can't really easily going on an angle okay I got it okay that's fine I still think I can do this okay let's tighten this down all right oh man I'm I'm curious to see how having done four in a row already or a five in a row already I'm very curious to see what I can do for this last one honestly this build is like more about catching my breath and you know getting in the right mindset for a super-fast build after okay get my screws done with that let's do some cable management here shall we sorry how much time do I have right now 19 minutes wait I only have oh no I gotta go fast oh man I thought it was gonna be like kind of relaxing cruising to the finish line on this one dagnabbit okay front panel audio front USB type-c hey there it is mmm is that going in that's a little weird it's a go the other way this is really not a great connector I wish it was a little bit more obvious which way it goes in like it doesn't hot doesn't bother me as much when I see like a really old connector that's not very well thought out it's like ah yeah you know it was a different time right whereas now when I see a brand new connector that's like oh yeah it's see it's really hard to tell which way that goes in it's very frustrating like I get that there's a huge there's probably less overlap than you would think between people who design computer connectors and people who actually like build their own gaming systems but come on guys you know if you think you'd at least ask someone you know okay so we're gonna get the fans hooked up right away so we don't forget swamp six minutes left that's all I got hey I think I can do it should be okay where's my eight pin CPU connectors here if I made any mistakes and I have to undo anything I could be in trouble here but otherwise I should be fine oh shoot well that's a mistake how could cost me a little bit of time come on come on here we go pins every system works so okay we mean so far oh dude oh okay a little instability though okay I'll keep me posted get it no no right part of the secret test you have to pass just kidding there's no test you just have to have sex no I'm not getting involved in that conversation 22 minutes I got five minutes only that's it oh geez okay it's still possible actually it's still possible only belief was enough okay ah graphics card yeah I don't even have the graphics card in yet oh shoot balls okay come on baby get in there let's get that graphics card in this is not the best angle to install it from guess we're stuck with it now new new new new come on come on out come on out hey go buddy okay got that God okay I just need the graphics card to go in real nice and easy this time nice okay you got this how do I end up down to the wire every time three minutes I'm gonna beat it so just watch oh yeah certainly not for free put that on there okay minor details shouldn't be wasting time on this those are valuable seconds but I will never have back where's my cable tie my one cable tie my only cable third hey that's there now we just need to you know yeah sure little something like that why not there you go cable tie in there hey come on two minutes that's fine I got this I got this no prob Bob okay nice extra screws in there okay quick inspection connectors yep good and one side panel up peel peel two side panels what are we got 25 minutes 20 seconds boom that's time not too shabby alright how's that system doing did install Windows this time okay good okay so here's the next one final system the final system which is all I'm going to be willing to sing of that song so I don't get demonetised okay what's up oh snap I didn't put the SSD in oh crap totally forgot okay you starting the timer again oh boy that's okay I got this I don't have time to like properly check and see which slots are connected to which things so I'm gonna guess I'm gonna say bottom slots probably fine oh boy come on baby here you go got this I'm still gonna be at that time no well I mean it shouldn't count the time that I thought I was done okay I think we're still good wait is this that one oh that's close whoops huh no boot drive it's all good okay I need a minute to collect my thoughts I'm gonna get a drink of water and then yeah do a couple of super chats and then we're going for it final build oh man hello plain chat is so active I can't believe how many people are subscribed on Flo plane at this point play your toy over on float plane says Alliance how many times have you hurt yourself building pcs how many times have I not hurt myself building pcs it's actually a miracle now I don't have any cuts today like my hands are you'd be hard to see them oh yeah there's one it would be hard to see them on camera but my hands are covered in like a web of little scars all over them just from like cutting myself on computer cases well yeah for sure it used to be a bigger deal back in the day because cheap cases used to have just like a razor sharp metal like I'd like just loose edges and it was it was horrible these days even cheap cases they tend to fold them over all right floatplane asks for a dick but thermal compound application I'm gonna have to double check my my dick but shape here okay Oh also I found a thread that seems to explain SSI EB vs the ATX so they're both physically 12 inch by 13 inch but it's the location of mounting holes so there you go that does sound familiar okay what is googling a dick but bringing up seems like a scary thing to to Google Images it's a viral internet character who is a penis whose balls are all but within which is a smaller dick but yep it's a thing this is from dictionary.com I don't know hello why is this bringing up just like one image search and why is it this random one looked like a moustache on it my phone seems to be being really really stupid and slow okay there we go all right so I've got my reference dick butts up and I am I think I'm ready oh yeah I'm ready hold on hold on on the other ones I started with the motherboard box on the table so what's the time to be 26 minutes okay hold on hold on hold on don't start it yet I'm not ready yet okay think I can beat 2020 I think I can do 20 20 minute okay that's my goal the goal is the goal is 20 minute build hold on let me get I I can't have my tools like not where I'm expecting them to be if I'm gonna try and build in 20 minutes though so let's get screwdrivers ready I have an MDOT to to install here yep okay parts here 20 minute build okay three two one go okay there is zero time for around here we're just gonna build a computer sorry chat I'm not gonna be able to have long drawn-out but enjoyable conversations with you for a little bit here all right that's all the accessories that I need let's go ahead and get this socket cover open sorry Andy there's nothing that I can do to get to a better angle this time around I mean there is but not if I'm gonna try and build a computer in 20 minutes I have the final countdown stuck in my head I mean I'm still sticking to best practices not tightening down these things until they're all half tight I still want this to be a working machine when we're done because it doesn't count if it doesn't work all right my cooler rat I did promise dick but shaped thermal compound so here we go he's kind of got an arm and a leg okay they're calling that good call not good enough okay this goes on this way might as well take the pan off now cuz I'm gonna need to eventually that way two minutes okay thank you sir where is my allen key okay I didn't make sure my allen key was in place before I started that could cost me that was a valuable second every second is gonna count here once again though I am half tightening these first then full tightening them making sure to build properly no matter how fast you need to go you always have time to build the computer properly I am definitely gonna end up slicing myself up and on this heatsink if I rush too much though okay another fun rule of thumb is it's almost always sticker side in not always but usually like in towards the CPU socket sorry Andy no look no lucky that third one it didn't sound like it wasn't all the way make sure it's in yep okay how am I not all systems to the same standard of quality for better or for worse okay CPU cooler fan is on Van connector is in dim dot two time just find a little bit faster to work with the iFixit screwdriver for small stuff like this okay need these peels to just be real cooperative for me right about now okay where's that Oh where'd I put it there this good so this is a temporary boot drive will get another obtain drive or something later 960 Pro also a very very respectable drive just I once all the workstations were actually deploying right away to be obtained I want them all to have the same config fundamentally so that we have an issue we'll know that it's down to you know whatever that editor loaded on their computer as opposed to down to the hardware just makes life a little bit easier that's my time at 4 minutes 30 seconds remember I said earlier in the stream I was gonna have a five minute motherboard there it is okay case which one is it I think it's this one yep see told you guys I was gonna have to memorize where the accessory package was oh that's hard come on don't have time for this fantasy power supply there's another thing that I've been memorizing as I've gone through the machines we're in the pack the cables are but I don't even have to look closely at them I can pull out all the right cables with the one exception being say that because these ones are all kind of jumbled in there here we go Oh got this six minutes all right system sevens booted nice it's all the RAM recognized fantastic success so I'm five for five so far today I have a hate to screw it up now oh I accidentally just lowered this table by leaning on this thing and a little bit okay I shouldn't have taken that time that was probably a mistake 24 pin it's being billed to be clear I would never expect myself to do a 20-minute build if I hadn't just done the same build four or five times in a row or harmony this was I mean I might be able to but maybe a simpler simpler build you know like no GPU you know integrated graphics little things like that can help a lot so I'm doing them all fan side down we have low enough pile carpet that I don't expect it's a suffocating power supply I haven't yet I was aware of it thank you the most terse thank you ever one more time eight minutes all right peel peel come on you bastard how about that stupid and cats cheering for me well thanks Chet yeah I'm sure some of them are rooting against me I'm used to it it's close that's the edge of the table right there oh good okay ooh this is not a good one to start with I'm gonna start with something else that's not going to rip the board in half if it falls out this one will do okay I'm taking a risk here guys I'm gambling I'm tightening these in all the way as I go so hopefully I'm not gonna run into one that won't fit because of the slightly not amazing tolerances of this case 9/32 okay this case in boarding we're gonna know pretty soon if there's a strong possibility of me finishing because we've already seen what I can do in seven minutes going top speed come on get in just gonna get this one this one's tough oh yeah it's in got it good okay this is right at the edge here it's making me a little uncomfortable okay if this one grabs we're in pretty good shape I think this is the last significant roadblock yep got it okay I got one more screw this one right here let's get a line that up there we go okay extra screws go away that any more cable management let's rip these off but it might splits my time at 10:45 okay maybe this is doable HD audio okay it's done this USB all right oh that's gonna cost me okay other USB three hands shaking knees weak arms heavy okay why do I set these arbitrary goals for myself why do I do it Nikolas no this is just building computers it's just one Talent thank you though thin okay all those connectors are in so now we need to do power supply theta where you at boy eight minutes remaining Kate okay save is in that our PM monitoring is in indecisiveness could cost me okay alright 24-pin yeah I'm gonna bring all these above this okay here three good ah good got it oriented correctly and the other ones go the other way so it's clipped towards the edge of the board for the 24 pin and clip towards the center of the board for both of the eight pins that's one little little funny video sync receipt of this all right let go stop you connect her CPU connector sorry and I know you can't see anything nothing you can do about it you did your best no he can't really do it without getting too close but I've got to build a computer in 20 minutes how much time do I have I have 6 minutes in 30 seconds okay I'm actually feeling not bad still plenty of time to screw this up okay let's put these puppies through here there's graphics come on get get get up there okay 2080 [Music] for those wondering I have not forgotten about the number-8 masking tape down here properly five minutes left hey okay all my connectors plugged in quick sanity check yep yep yep yep okay cable management all right that's down come on here we go come on baby in there where's my cable tie LTT store calm okay just uh you know I don't know just kind of hold it all together down there for minutes that's fine I can still do this I wonder which editor gets the like crappy speed build one okay and all seriousness though it will perform the same just what do you mean pull it apart oh the new opt and drive oh yeah you don't have to pull apart much cuz of the dimmed out too sure it's on there time what I forget saw it right as I said it time 17 minutes 27 seconds yay okay I did chief out on one thing I didn't put this back in the motherboard box fine we'll say 17 minutes and 30 seconds okay done okay wow we could have saved ourselves a lot of time if I just built that full speed the whole time this could have been like an hour and a half stream that would have been way easier what do you think Andy would that have been better handy solders are like well yeah that does sound a lot better [Music] it's our stream then no no it's not okay good I'm just I'm just checking I'm just checking all right Andy the lab says I need help with my veil blacking opposable thumbs seriously um I don't know what I'm supposed to do I mean clearly it would only take me 17 minutes to help you with it but I don't know where you are or how I would get your parts get them to you once it's assembled um sorry Andy all right so that's uh no no different different Andy oh yeah okay all right okay doesn't say more messages below it's just like not not working apparently no stream is dead good stream all right that's pretty much it sure you know what yeah we should we should do a boot up test on this one and make sure it actually it actually works cuz this was clearly oh okay yeah nice so Nicolas is pulling out the body he'll what's the model PA thirty-two you see X or whatever they call yeah PA thirty-two you see X so this is the monitor that isus is sending over for each of these stations so we are hopefully going to be equipped to do HDR content on the regular moving forward we've spent a lot of time over the last couple of months actually working on the workflow aspects of it so now as soon as these new workstations roll out we're going to have the monitors on all of the stations and we're gonna have the performance to really do it up for real I think we're probably going to start with short circuit just because the lighting is more consistent makes it a little bit easier to do the HDR to SDR conversion but at some point in the future we would like to we would like to move to HDR and this is a big part of that step or a big step in that process oh man that was stressful 17 minutes ah 17 minutes that's not bad I'm rounding it down I'm rounding it to 17 minutes oh here we go mouse keyboard nice nope whoops all right don't worry plug this puppy in all right add all your editing workstations are built oh that was a that was a small oversight let's see if it picks back up hurry back I see YouTube YouTube's up oh lordy I needed an ethernet cable for this machine so I grabbed the one that we normally use at the desk not realizing that it's hooked up to the stream cart and it was it was before it came out like my like my arm momentum is what pulled it out because I realized I was like [Music] but it was too late and it did the connector wasn't clipped in so it was it was too late it was too late I was fine we don't really need a network connection for this anyway oh okay and we have another one anyhow all right cool so I'll plug into 10-gig oh man that was really stupid all right power button what do you think is it gonna No did I miss the power button Oh yep okay 30 seconds I just mean this is gonna take me about 30 seconds to fix 18 minute build dang it I was one set of headers too high alright now let's see if it actually posts though been a long time since I've made a mistake like that I definitely that can be quite easily attributed to rushing okay got our memory post codes up in here yeah got so much RAM takes a little while CPU fan is in fact spinning though thank you twitch chat you know for all of those of you who I'm assuming are helpfully pointing out that the CPU fan is not spinning are all of the streams live oh yeah I see twitch and YouTube's definitely live excellent connection that's uh I wonder what that does to the vaad on YouTube I hope it doesn't start a new one that would be that would be extremely inconvenient you got to change battery Oh how does that work we'll have wait how dead is it do you have a hot swap oh okay then we're good yeah sorry guys it's gonna be a little shaky we're just swapping batteries here this has been a longer stream than anyone anticipated I only see one stream event on YouTube so maybe it's all good alright yeah we'll see wait is this posting come on baby post error hmm hard drive well that's interesting yeah check seems like it I mean that's honestly something that I don't think I screwed up I guess receipt it dang it why did I push why did I push for 17 minutes in 30 seconds well 18 minutes now for assigning a 30-second penalty for the first thing and 1830 is that what we're at now we're doing 30 second penalties for everything I screwed up dang it let's see if it even I wonder if it's just a bad Drive though that shouldn't count against me know if we have to swap the drive that doesn't count alright if reseeding it fixed it though that's probably a 30-second penalty dang it all right I was kind of hoping for a bad dress if Puget systems data is anything to go by it doesn't happen super often with those sound sense though oh shoot this is not I don't know where the power button is whoo this thing is such a thick boy monitor it's ridiculous does this power button not working new hello monitor did you flip it out yep no I think we're Paragon wait what yes we might have to reboot just to get it to pick up sometimes you run into that also HDMI to is not the correct input oh and I turned it off here we go don't worry it's all good it's all good I still can't believe I unplugged the stream that's a new that's a new high for me I think new high new low it's something I've probably done it before now that I think about it seems like the kind of thing I would have probably done before HD decode a 9 Hey that SSD might be flaky Oh No - setup menu supposedly that's weird why is it being derpy why you got a derp you know alright let's try that DisplayPort there oh we could also try plugging into the monitor that you were using this one should work it just pulled it off this workstation yeah yeah I mean should such a word you know should is meaningless like this DisplayPort cable it's a 15 foot cable should work see how that goes alright we'll try that again oh the suspense is freaking killing me right now like come on you know like come on don't need this okay well it detected the input hey there it is alright who see if all my ram picks up yes yeah I'm not gonna bother with that yep oh well whatever okay fine do CP standard whatever the crap okay there you go Oh where's your Windows installer hit me I'm gonna catch it without looking yes I guess this will be this will tell us at the front us we're at the heck is the front usb on this go oh there it is look I don't know do I look like I know these things oh wait which one is it of course there are the other side okay apparently it's already oh you know what there's probably already own OS on this drive this is probably a bench drive oh that's convenient we'll find out pretty soon if it's gonna make it into Windows Oh Matthew stud says I'm looking for a new chair for my a work slash battle station I saw Herman Miller and Logitech were partnered to make an ergonomic centric and gaming chair stoked to see what that evolves into review it please absolutely yes wow look at that I've just fired right up there didn't it do we have any useful stuff installed on here here we'll do a quick Cinebench run okay we'll do a quick Cinebench r20 run just to make sure that our do CPU memory isn't gonna immediately crash the system thirty-two hundred megahertz seems to be running correctly man look at that rip those threats it's it's almost like it's just a thread Ripper only they had a word for it let's CPU like that something that rips threads like that a thread rip inator the thread Ripper Raider the thread rip stir all right I'm calling that good enough just like I'm calling this dream good enough thanks for tuning in guys how long we're alive for it holy crap we're alive for four hours thank you so much for your patience everyone don't forget to what and roll for what I already ran it what oh yeah I ran the integration after the first system yeah I can run it again all right go buy stuff at LTT store do I come and here's our sponsor this video is brought to you by drop comm the mass drop x sennheiser open back HD 5x
