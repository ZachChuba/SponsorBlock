so I'm making a movie lots of you have expressed interest in supporting its production financially today we're going to talk about why I won't let you I've been here before I crowdfunded my first feature film on IndieGoGo I set the goal at 3 grand made less than half of that only had 8 backers but even then it was a huge headache that attempt at crowdfunding was back when I probably had around a thousand subscribers I know I could start a crowdfunding campaign today and get a metric ton more money I'd have way more people willing to pitch in way more people willing to be ambassadors for the projects folks who will go out and seek other people to get involved in the production - I've had some big money people talk with me and give me some big estimates of how much money they think that I would be able to raise if I go the crowdfunding route a second time but I ain't gonna do is there are three big reasons why I'm choosing not to crowdfund this time around even though everybody around me is telling me that I ought to reason number one is that crowdfunding is time consuming and the more backers you have for your project the more time-consuming it becomes if you're going to do a successful crowdfunding push that means you're going to have to be well-organized and often the organization comes at the expense of the project itself managing a crowd fund is multifaceted to start with you're gonna have to get the word out this means doing press both local and online with all different kinds of publications from hometown newspapers to podcasts to internet publications getting those interviews managing them timing them well it is a ton of work to put it all together plus you've got to spread the word within your own community I'm still struggling with getting youtube to notify my subscribers that I'm posting new videos at a crowdfunding campaign on top of that no chance there's also a near certain possibility that you're going to end up alienating people in your corner of the internet if I want to make sure that everybody knows about the crowdfunding going on that means I have to mention it again and again and again across all different types of social media to some folks this feels like you're constantly beating them over the head and asking them for money big turn-off figuring out that proper advertising balance within your community it's hard and once you step outside of your community and you try to get the general public in volved you're gonna be on thin ice to not look desperate and you'll have to work hard to make your campaign stand out amongst the sea of other projects folks can choose from I don't think I can do that but let's say you're better than me even if you do manage to get the word out about your project then you've got to actually start delivering those promised perks fulfilling perks is probably the most time consuming aspect of the entire crowdfunding process if you've got t-shirts hats merch physical deliverables and even digital exclusives all of that has to be organized and coordinated I'm trying to make a movie it requires my complete and total attention if I burn myself out trying to make sure that over a thousand backers from all different levels and all different locations get their appropriate rewards in a timely manner I'm not going to have any time to properly prep the film but even if I do somehow get the word out and somehow get the perks out I'd still have to make sure to regularly update the backers as to the status of the project every step of the way but you know sometimes there's really no news to report we aren't all Hazzard time there is no news some backers grow really really upset when they feel as if they're out of the loop and some backers they feel really entitled to make that loop as close as possible so if they don't see an update for your project every week you're going to end up catching heat for it the point is for my flick managing a campaign would take a lot of time and it's time I would rather spend making the actual film better secondly the dirty little secret that they don't tell you about crowdfunding if you want to do it right it's gonna cost money most crowdfunding platforms charge a small usage fee but that's not the whole story all of that campaign management that we just talked about that requires help sometimes big budget crowd funds actually end up having to hire folks whose sole job is to sort all of the logistics of the fundraiser out if I'm a filmmaker I want to use the money that I raised to improve the overall quality of the picture not to pay a bunch of staff who have to sit around and figure out who gets sent which reward and web which by the way creating those perks whether it's merger signed props or whatever those production and postage costs they all have to come out of the final that you end up raising so let's say hypothetically I have a thirty dollar perk in which backers get a free t-shirt I might have to spend ten bucks of that thirty dollar investment to get that shirt printed and sent off combine those costs with the costs associated with advertisement and the downsides start stacking up pretty fast and what if you end up not reaching your goal are you really okay with being out the money for attempting to kickstart a project that never even gets past pre-production the reality is that crowdfunding is an uncertain investment in and of itself which sounds counterproductive right I mean why add more uncertainty to the mix please that's what I'm thinking but finally and perhaps most critical to me is and this probably sounds selfish I don't want to owe anybody I think there is something to be said for total ownership of your work I've often found and Kickstarter's gone bad that backers sort of feel an entitlement to the project which they should to some extent after all they've given out of their own pockets to support it but when over a thousand people feel as if they're part owners of a creative work that they did no creative work on it can cause a lot of volatility I mean think about it best-case scenario let's say you meet your goal you're gonna owe people a movie and that in and of itself is a tall order you owe that movie no matter what if you don't finish they will be upset and they will seek retribution what if things go wrong during production and you aren't able to finish the movie to your liking poor what if you're not able to finish the movie at all too bad you've got backers that are expecting a product these investors will be mad if there are delays but delays happen an independent film production all the time sometimes they stretch on for years these investors will be mad if the movie stinks they will be mad if the movie flops note that those two aren't necessarily the same thing but considering that this is an independent production the probability that the end product will not meet expectations is incredibly high if your backers are disappointed in the movie if they feel you could have used the funds better you're going to have a damaged reputation this can jeopardize future projects you may want to attempt and you might lose what very well could have otherwise been a lifelong fan backer backlash is Incred Blee common why would I want to subject myself for any of you to the possibility that that happens so after a lot of thought in consideration I think I'm going to take my own risks with my own money I'm gonna try and make something with no outside financial strings attached now to be clear I don't know if this is how I'm going to operate in the future but I do think it's how I want to operate right now for what it's worth I know that I am incredibly fortunate to be in a position to do any of this at all I've been able to make my ends meet primarily through things like Adsense on many of my channels videos which allow folks to support me in an indirect way and through the occasional sponsorships that help keep food on the table and help keep the lights on while I pursue certain passions I've got a merch store that's the thing I do now apparently and every purchase on that store goes towards supporting the stuff that I'm working on I also do have a patreon page folks can support me as a creator directly it's not just a particular project although it's been around for two years it still accounts for the smallest form of income for me 128 people as of recording this video that's a little over 1/10 of a percent of my subscriber base so about 99.85% of my audience doesn't support me monetarily and they don't have to most of them they simply can't and that's ok they can help me as a creator by sharing my videos with others as cliche as it is that really does help the channel to grow I know that I'm lucky to have the support that I do I'm lucky to have you all watching and although this thing that I'm working on will take a while maybe a long while before it'll be ready when it is I hope that you'll be here to check it out and if you are considering some kind of crowdfunding for a creative project just do me a favor and stop to think count the cost who knows maybe it's worth it to go a different route alright that's it now a sponsored ad I
