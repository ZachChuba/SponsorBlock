liked that video it was just a little small on this Thai little break from the 40-minute vids I thought I would do a Q&A for you guys usually I only drew them for studio vlogs but since I haven't done a studio vlog for a couple months I thought I would answer some of your questions today thank you sponsorship boom boom boom okay so let's answer some of your questions I asked you guys on Instagram if you had any Q's and you did you had a lot so I've got a few here let's see a lot of people actually asked about New Year's resolutions and I say screw resolutions you don't need the New Year to decide that you want to do something although it is helpful I just talked to rocket about this like it's good to have a fresh start blow blah but for me I like try I don't really have any New Year's resolutions but I did make a list of things and I put on Instagram of dream projects I have and this isn't just like oh I will do it this year this is like currently I would love to work on these projects oh I put my dream projects with no time limit just in general my current things that I'd love to do on to my Instagram because you never know like who's gonna see it a lot of my clients find me through Instagram and a lot of people might have connections of ways that I can get these jobs so I thought I just put it out there and hopefully someone can be like you have this job I might list I have illustrations for a fruit farm the reason this is on my list is because when I was in university someone was like want to do the branding for this strawberry pump I was like I can't I've got all my assignments do I regret that I was stupid the next thing is patentable I think we were watching The Shining and they have like these our wallpaper well we watching something else I can't remember but though I remember specifically red and black our wallpaper and I was like I want to make wallpaper they'll be so super whether it be for like someone's house or even if it's just like for a company that sells wallpaper or for film that would be so cool I would love that neon I don't know how I would do that if I'm qualified to do it I would really just like to design a fluorescent sign or just do something that then is turned into a fluorescent sign that's what I want I said neon isn't the same thing florescent science and what's the difference I don't know I basically want my working lights okay just give me what I can lights design stationary what will that happen who's to say who's to say hopefully anything for kids but my favorite demographic to create for his kids so that's why that's on anything for kids I love making stuff for kids children's books love that I love making you my plane out this year for koto code I think the reason I like design for kids is because we have similar tastes so it's quite simple it's like I know what they need they need what I want boom and also like it at last one more color which is something that I really really like next question boys how did you gain such a large following um to know probably like 10 years of posting on the internet like focus on creating great work and find ways to document the process of you making that work so you don't just have one post per artwork you could be posting the materials you use you could have ranged out a really nice way you could be posting a flat lay of the process you could be posting time-lapses do you know what I mean so figure out ways to create interesting content around good work that's my advice boom any tips for an illustrator in uni that's struggling to get tutors approval such appreciation of work hmm well I feel very privileged to have gone to university and have a degree and while you should aim to get good marks what you should be prioritizing is creating good work outside of uni I don't have any tips for like getting tutors approval because I didn't really I just made it what I wanted to make did you yeah oh we had different approaches I was just like making whatever but like ask lots of questions what are they after what will they be marking you on etc because I think a lot of people they're trying to figure out who they are at University and if you're spending your time pleasing your teacher it's kind of like you're not really figuring out who you want to be as a creative how do you battle self-doubt failure and negative thoughts with art you don't put so much pressure on yourself and then just enjoy the experience I don't have a lot of negative thoughts my main thing is like doubting myself a lot so like when I went to VidCon the whole time I was like I why do i why am I here like I don't deserve to be here and then when I go to a design conference I'm like hell why am I here I think I should practice positive self-talk because that's not good I guess I just try not to do it like bathed in the self I just sit there and just be sad about it nothing will change whereas if you try and change it or try and at least like speak more positively to yourself things will change so don't sit there just try and find a way to get out of it whether it be betting us bettering yourself so you're like worst fears aren't actualized or realized or big kinder to yourself quick what's your favorite emoji this deep this thing is becoming an artist or realistic job goal in Australia it depends how you are going to go about it if you're gonna go about it by not posting on social media then yeah it's gonna be difficult because like then you only have the pool of people you directly engage with in real life whereas if you're posting on the internet anyone all across the world can see it so it doesn't really present any geographical issues are they gonna be more frequent vlogs in 2019 we need while please ease a lot of people like I'm asked about like what my what my goals are for YouTube and what I want to do with my channel and the goal is I would like to do one larger video one longer video like a studio vlog a month and then one shorter video a month so two videos a month I don't want to aim too high but yeah I'm scared because it really depends on the projects that I have and like how busy I am months a month turn is like the rain oh sure okay I just want to say thank you thanks so much um thanks for being here I love you and it's I trade and I hope you like this video I'll see you in next year and yeah woo actually this is probably gonna go out next year is this too loud [Music]
