I've been sworn at so much,
I have indigestion But even if I'm upset,
what can I do, I do Everyone's working so hard to hate Will knocking me down put
food on your plate? I'm lonely, what do I do?
I've even swallowed the hatred I have no strength to get mad
No time either What is so disgusting for you?
Just go on your way Why is everyone doing this,
making me sad? María, María
I'm saying this for you It's a shining night
Don't torment yourself Oh María, these words are for you Why are you struggling? You're already beautiful (yeah) Oh na ah ah (yeah) These words are for you (yeah) Oh na ah ah (yeah) You're beautiful, María No frame, no fake
Throbbing headache The color of the sky is sky blue
Life is that cliché I'll change the path I take myself
I'll change crisis to opportunity If you really wanna see me cry Here you go, tears I'm lonely, what do I do?
I've even swallowed the hatred I have no strength to get mad
No reason either So don't taint your heart
It's too early to be corrupt María, María
I'm saying this for you It's a shining night
Don't torment yourself Oh María, these words are for you Why are you struggling? You're already beautiful (yeah) Oh na ah ah (yeah) These words are for you (yeah) Oh na ah ah (yeah) You're beautiful, María María, María
These words are for you It's a shining night
Don't torment yourself Oh María, these words are for you Why are you struggling? You're already beautiful (yeah) Oh na ah ah (yeah) These words are for you (yeah) For you You're beautiful, María
