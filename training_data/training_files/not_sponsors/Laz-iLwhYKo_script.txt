good morning everybody and welcome back to a brand new video now it's been quite a while since i have covered roon light and over the last year there's been a lot of really awesome and interesting plug-ins added uh both to the general release of roon light as well as the plug-in hub so today i thought would cover some of my favorite plugins i've been using recently because i truly do think some of these are kind of game changers now for those who don't know the rune light plugin hub is an area for less official plugins maybe ones that are more niche or haven't been polished as much however they are checked by the main devs to make sure they're not malicious and that they don't break any rules anyway guys i hope you enjoyed the video as always if you do appreciate a like in the video helps a lot thanks for watching guys and let's get started now installing plugins in runelight is very simple however you may not have noticed the plugin hub so if you come over here to your roon like configuration you can see all of the plugins that you have installed however at the bottom here there's a button called plug and hub and by clicking on it you can have a look at a ton of other plugins that are kind of under the hood there are tons of plugins here and most of them are useful however today i'm just going to be highlighting some of them now the first plugin i want to cover here is probably one of my favorites of all time it fixes one of the biggest problems that old school escape has yes bigger than the dual arena bigger than bots bigger than real world trading gold farming probably the biggest issue i've had with the game is the fact that you can't kick down doors going through doors normally is just so boring you just walk up and the door opens that makes no sense luckily roon light has you covered with a door kicker plug-in all you have to do is simply enable it and we are good to go [Music] okay of course this one doesn't have really a practical use but it's not very intrusive and it's kind of fun just to leave on anyway side note have you ever noticed this bird and all of these clothes up here in varrock i feel like i've never noticed that before now another really awesome plugin i found recently is called optimal quest helper now essentially what this plugin does is it will detect which quest you have done on your account and it will suggest the most efficient order to complete them in so we come over here and turn it on and go over to the sidebar we can look at which quest it recommends doing and in which order now it has detected i've done a few quests already now not only will it show you the optimal quest order it will also show you quest requirements i wonder the last recommended quest is uh looks like a song of the elves oh wait clock tower now when they say it has been put in an efficient order that pretty much means that the quest experience rewards you're getting are actually going to be useful when you do the quest so most likely if you do the quests in this order you are going to be getting the best bang for your buck while being very efficient now probably one of my personal favorite plugins that came out in the last year is the nexus map plugin now for those who don't have a nexus this is generally what it looks like when you come over here to the teleport menu a fairly basic ui that just has a list of all the teleports that you have in your nexus now i only have 10 teleports so that's manageable however once you have the crystalline portal nexus and added in all of the teleports you can have up to 30 which can be overwhelming very quickly however no fear if you come over here to the plug-in hub and type in the nexus menu map it will instead turn a basic ui menu into the trailblazer league map where you can navigate the teleports by clicking on the different regions so for example if you want to go to camelot we'll come over here to kanderin and click on camelot i don't have a teleport with me now one thing to keep in mind is the hotkeys do still work however the only drawback is isn't displayed immediately for example camelot is the number four as if we come over here to the teleport menu and hit four we'll just teleport to camelot instantly one of my favorite additions and they hope one day they add something similar for fairy rings i think that would be incredibly useful now another one of my favorite plugins recently has to be loot beams now jagex is actually looking to officially add that to the steam client i think however just a few days after a few really big popular threads on reddit loot beams were added into roon light now loot beam is similar to the chambers of zarek chest however we'll simulate a drop right here dragon scimitar for example and we get a nice big blue loot beam if you drop in the colt necklace we're going to get a green loot beam the dragon pickaxe we're going to get an orange loot beam and finally the bando's chest plate if we drop but we're going to get a red loot beam looks pretty stylish looks like a party is going on but it's really hype when you actually get the drop with the loot beams turned on let me pick these up before i lose my bander's chestplate now that we turn it on is actually within the ground items plug-in it is officially supported so we come over here to ground items and go down to the bottom you'll see uh highlighted item loot beams you want to turn that on now loot beam tier is going to determine how valuable an item is required to trigger the loot beam for example if we have it on medium and we got a dragon scimitar drop it wouldn't have a loot beam which i think would probably be fair which is the way i have it set up personally so anything green or above will show a loot beam which i think is above 100k or 150k that just looks so cool oh yeah there's also a separate loop beam for any highlighted items so for example a clue scroll if it drops on the ground we're going to get a nice stylish loot beam making it just a little bit easier to see it but that of course is just determined by my highlighted items [Music] now another really helpful plugin that i find myself using quite a bit is the profit tracking plug-in now the way this works is essentially it will just track at any items entering your inventory and any items leaving your inventory it will show you with a little notification at the top how much gold you've gained or lost so ideally you want to turn this on after you've geared after you're all ready to go do your pvm moneymaker scaling moneymaker or whatever and it will track how much gold you're gaining how much gold you're losing and fundamentally how much money you are making per hour as for example i came over here to the skeletal wyverns just to show you guys and every time we sip a prayer dose we lose a couple thousand gp every time we drop something we'll lose a bit of gp however every time we pick up a drop like this rune kite shield for example we're gonna gain gp per hour and i mean currently we're getting 1.5 mil an hour or whatever but that will even out over time now you don't want to have this on all the time because if you access your bank at all and deposit items it's going to kind of mess up the entire counter but it is really helpful to get an accurate picture of really how much money you're making because often players will disregard the supply cost of money makers and sometimes they're making a lot less money than you would actually think so this is a great way to track it the plugin is called just profit tracker there are a couple but my favorite one is this one so definitely a very helpful plugin now because we're already over here by a bunch of monsters another one of my favorite plugins i've just started using recently is called loot tables it is available in the plug-in hub and we'll just go ahead and install it here now once you have it installed you'll notice that there is a separate tab once again for loot tables and essentially this allows you quick access to loot information for example here we have the skeletal wyvern we can see what they drop the drop rates and the quantities we can come down here to their mega rare stuff also you can see they draconic visage and how much everything is worth you can also just right click on monsters and go to loot table alternatively you can just search them up ice giant for example and we can easily look at loot tables without ever having to really leave the client which i think is super helpful now probably one of the most talked about plugins this year is gotta be the bot detector plug-in now i am planning on making a more in-depth video on this in the future but i'd be hard-pressed to make a video about rune light plug-ins in 2021 and not talk about the bot detector plug-in now essentially what this does is it turns anyone who has it installed into well a bot detector in the background your client will be looking at players around you and sending their names stats and information off to the bot detector now the bot detector uses machine learning to attempt to determine whether it's a bot after review any suspected bots will be sent directly to jagex to determine if there are bots or not now with the positive feedback to get back from jk they can feed their neural network or whatever you want to call it more information to get more accurate now if this becomes successful this could be a really powerful tool for both the players and jagex to help combat bots now another fun feature is you can actually predict whether players are bots for example this one has a 98 chance that they're a real player good job now keep in mind the percentage that they're given here is not really a percentage in the general way people view it it just has something to do with how the machine learning works but anyway without getting too far in depth a really cool plug-in that really could help combat bots but like i said i do have a plan to make a more in-depth video including some statistics on bots that they banned how much gp has been removed from the game other stuff like that that should hopefully be coming soon now finally here i want to finish off with two very helpful quality of life plugins now first up here we have the annoyance muter now essentially what this does is it will specifically mute certain noises because some of them are really annoying for example the arm of the crossbow or different npc noises or pet noises i'm looking at you general greador those can be extremely annoying and with the annoyance mute you can turn them off specifically without having to turn all of your game sounds off which i do personally find really nice i like having the game sounds on to some extent but there are a lot of annoying noises out there which this plugin will deal with and probably the smallest of changes of all these but something that really started annoying me as soon as they added in the new clan system is the fact that there are now two different clan chats one is your friend chat and one is your actual clan chat now if you install the slash swapper plug-in you can swap whether you need one slash or two slashes to talk in either your clan chat or your friend's chat super helpful because i'm so used to just doing one and depending on your clan setup there might be more players in your regular clan chat over your french chat that's obviously gonna depend on your clan and with that guys that's going to bring us to the end of the video those are some of my favorite plugins that aren't really included in the default roon light install that i've been using a lot over the last year there are so many out there and so many useful ones i didn't cover but those are my favorites thanks for watching guys as always and i will see you in the next video [Music] server thanks again guys as always and i'll see you next time
