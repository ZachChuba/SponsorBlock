what's happenin bees and G's and welcome back to another upgrade and unlock top right corner and that will explain everything and all the rules but pretty much we get to unlock squares of the map very slowly by doing tasks and getting levels and completing quests losing our hardcore status loses ten squares and dying at any time after that loses one there are a few other rules as well so make sure you go to the first episode in the last episode we just unlocked the best mining spot we can possibly have so we're gonna go ahead and get some levels I think it's time to do some grinding and I'm just gonna go ahead get the mining and smithing up to a decent point I would like to get to the point where we can make some steel plate bodies so maybe I'll do that but I definitely bit of grinding here get this up to 15 get these smithing up to 15 and then we'll just start doing some iron so this is where we're gonna be doing a lot of our smithing until we unlock another chunk and we have the ambulant aback here hopefully we've got a few more I think got two more bars in the bank I don't think it's gonna be enough we're gonna go with the battle axes make all of those that should be the most efficient in terms of speed wise but yeah I don't think we're gonna get the the 15 smithing we need I'm thirty XP off so we'll go up a couple or a few oh hello my man's in the sea see if you're not part of the CC join the CC links Ocarina guys there is it there free Smith those two into bronze bars and then make something with those bronze bars that's gonna be enough to get us level 15 smithing which means we could start smithing the iron down so we are gonna start mining the iron now and this is a lot nicer turn you it's a lot nicer now I don't know I've got a thing about iron I just I just like being on the iron grind here we go this should be 15 there it is we can now make iron daggers and smelly or of course so I'm probably just gonna stop by the load of iron here and so I don't have to keep making trips over and over again and yeah well we'll stop a load of iron see where we're at and we're currently 314 so 11 levels off another chunk there we go this is going b30 mining coming in boom which means we can now mine coal camp your rune essence okay didn't really care about that and access the mother lode mine well I didn't realize it was thirty I thought was fifty for some reason but that is gonna be a thirty and mining which means we're going to turn all of this inal in to our iron bars and we'll see how far this gets us smithing wise I'm going the wrong way ended up with 246 I know which I'll take and the first imagery exactly half there's that 50% Conan Koch I've been watching TV and stuff and didn't even realize we hit three to five so I'll finish off oh we've already finished it off there we go we still got quite a few iron ores to go but you never know what might happen if we open up this next chunk so we're gonna do that before we continue eighty-one bars at the moment with a seventy eight iron ore to go and obviously when we turn all those bars into things that that smithing is gonna go through the roof but let's hop on over right here we go guys I mean I really don't want wilderness cuz I just won't go there on the hardcore no point I don't want to start over eating up all of that that would be horrible so let's go and pick a random chunk and see what happens [Music] the shipyards I was thinking is that the gnome glider but no the nine gliders down that that's yeah not gonna be very helpful at all but you do use it in monkey madness and maybe further on down to the account of like thank [ __ ] we open that up earlier the shipyard unlocked nothing nothing to get there though and we will carry on so we've entered with a hundred and twenty three iron bars which is a a fair amount of XP actually I guess we'll just make some med Helms I think they'll sell for the most when we go back to sell them there's level nineteen coming in straight away iron shortswords actually to be fair making making the short swords probably isn't a bad shout because we could sell them straight back to the the sword shop here so we'll make those and then probably just follow that process make long swords when we can again because if we go and sell them to the shop we'll get a higher price than we were just selling a certain this stuff back to a general store so I ended up getting 24 smithing I actually thought was gonna get a bit higher I don't know why I'm gonna go ahead and sell all of this 54 coins each and 84 coins each I know it doesn't sound much but uh with the money we currently have I think you have a hundred coins in the bank so I'm actually over the moon by those prices we sell one of these and one of these let's see what it's gonna go down see yeah I'll probably sell a few every world and we'll there we'll see how much money you end up with I am absolutely chuffed with that 4.1 K I think that's the most money we've ever had on the account it was probably an hour to two hours worth of work probably a little bit probably about two hours but I I'm actually I'm happy with that I'm happy let's kill his imp and get a bead we're still doing ink Gacha I haven't seen any beads yet I don't have any em stuff killed maybe 10 10 to 15 I'd say it's probably about right come on first Thursby note in the box so seeing as we've got that money seems absolutely crazy not to go and and get the range up because it's so far behind everything else you got a decent amount of money and we also got from that maze earlier so many arrows won't bother with the bronzes to 20 iron 55 steel so we'll go next door and buy some by some range stuff I don't know if there's anything else in the bank that I can actually use I need to sort this Bank out at some point very very soon I'd have to go all the way back to our crib to get some chaps I can use so I'm just gonna leave it for now and we'll just we'll just go with what we've got at the moment definitely gonna use an oak short bow and we will get into this and probably just kill some guards because uh do I kill guards do I kill something a little bit lesser maybe we kill something a little bit lesser just to just a start off you know what we'll go to drain off that's what we do and you know what else I'll do I'll home tele or go to our career or get ourselves some chaps we did Prince Ali's rescue we get to go there for free now might as well use that you know we also had a few scimitars to sell as well it's a little bit more money on top just sell a few each world and hop again gonna go ahead and make some chaps here and okay no we're not okay I totally forgot about that Kamik damn braces I can make van braces we need to make a hard leather body from scratch for our easy clue so we are gonna go ahead and do that now those fourteen crafting coming in and it means we can now make that leather armor so we can give that one over to Charlie and complete there we go you complete choice ask go and give him the leather body I'm gonna continue with the range we're gonna go ahead and just get that right up and then I probably will come back and do some crafting because I would like to make myself some chaps so plan is kill some cows for the cowhide and stuff and we'll go from there because the quicker you get these chaps the better our attack bonus is gonna be right so we've got ourselves a full inventory of cowhide gonna go ahead and tan this and turn it all into some crafting X pigs I do want to get it to the point where er I'll probably get the 20 crafting maybe that will do another inventory another inventory maybe two more trees of cowhide but uh yeah I think might as well just go ahead get that 20 crafting and we'll see where we are from there also managed to get ourselves nearly 15 range which is nice 31 XP off that 15 range I'm gonna go ahead and get ourselves some coins Tan this hide and go ahead and make this all into things actually really decent XP from these leather bodies getting 25 per body we can now make three ships which would be nice if we could make them if we could go and kill some lizard man but that's probably not gonna happen is it but yeah decent XP in my I don't know I might even go look maybe we do maybe we don't but at 17 crafting coming in there very nice indeed not quite gonna be the level actually just one hard other body off which is incredibly annoying but we will continue to kill these cows get these range levels up and my phone will continue to keep annoying this video that is 15 range coming in which means we do anything new I feel like we do something new no huh nearly a blue-eyed cross pipe okay not really anything new but I thought there was going to be better 15 range coming in we have four levels away from a new square to be unlocked that is gonna be 17 range and we did get a HP level we got a prayer level and that does mean we actually got 350 just here so I'm gonna finish off this inventory and then we have a square to unlock we will see what we get here we go guys straight in and let's see what we're gonna get random chunk oh we got it we got it we can do Restless ghost yes oh that's beautiful I mean it took so long I know so many chances to get that one okay great stuff doesn't actually unlock any new potentials but it does mean we can now do Restless ghosts we can also go down into the the Lumbridge swamp through the candle way which is quite nice a bit more mining unlocked I think there's some myth over there might be a D and what 100 cent sure I'm sure there's something else that unlocks but it does mean we can go ahead and do a quest so we'll probably get this crafting done and then we'll head on over and do Restless ghosts that is going to be 18 crafting which means we can make our chaps which means we can add upgrade our range gear which is very nice and we will continue to make the rest into chaps we are just shy of 20 but I'm gonna leave it there because I'm excited to get this Restless ghost done gonna go ahead sell all of these off just to uh generate a little bit of money cuz this is literally our cash stack at the moment I'm not looking too great and yeah go and do racers ghost guys if you think about dropping a like it really does help the episodes grow father been waiting to speak to you for a [ __ ] Y all mate and right I'm looking for a quest let's get this done go see a skeleton about a skull come back get our get out go speak amulet search that altar should get the skull thank you and we will see you later mate open the coffin up use the skull on there and the cutscene comes and that is gonna be quest complete which means another square to unlock there we go one quest point 1125 prayer XP which should take us to 19 prayer which does unlock rapid restore nothing too crazy but you know it's more levels it's more prior which is nice 354 total and a new square to unlock if we could open up number 7 we would then be able to do Vampire Slayer which would be quite nice and if we open up 16 we're able to then do rune mysteries so there's a few quests that could be unlocked I'm sure there's a few others as well that we could unlock if we get a certain number let's have a look and see where we are going to be going but on the ports Aaron is actually not gonna be usable for us now but I guess you know it gives us another role on Port Sarim because that would be a really nice one to get really really nice once again we could start fly-fishing and stuff like that as the older magic shop there so not a bad one to get but not gonna help us in this situation that is one of the squares we will need for Dragon's Lair so I guess we got that so obviously we can unlock trunks with a GP we unlocked our first chunk for 1000 GP the second one will be 2000 then four thousand eight thousand 16 32 64 all of that it just doubles every time we unlock one and it caps at 500k so why I'm gonna go ahead and do is we got 5k at the moment but we do need a little bit more money so we're gonna go do the stronghold of security that way we'll have 15k and I can do a couple of unlocks I think I'll just do two unlocks depending on what we unlock from that GP if we unlock total [ __ ] maybe we'll do three but we are gonna go ahead and do that good and just buy some wine before we go ahead and do that because that's gonna be some decent heels [ __ ] that was expensive oh my how much we buy them for ya [ __ ] that sell those back oh my god okay we just wasted okay there I'm gonna start hopping and we just buy jugs of why not bottles of wine cuz they're like 1g pH they're like 500 that is the first level open this bad boy up and we have 6.3 K next level this is number two but I think I might need to authenticate my account Oh or I have I already done it I don't know I guess we'll find out in the next one 9.3 K very nice getting into the more dangerous levels now where our food will be necessary number 314 K beautiful and on to the last of the rooms we do get the the fighter boots of the fancies as well for doing this I think this would be the last dangerous thing we do that is a seven off the bat I'm just gonna go ahead and eat because I'd rather not die and boom easy as that let's go get our reward cradle of life just drop this jug so we can actually get the stuff boom she's between the boots I will have to be honest I've always gone for the colorful ones always have as a kid so we've got to go ahead and do that boom there we go 14k and the upgraded boots as well which is nice a lot of you guys said that we should just turn the coins into platinum tokens rather than just dropping them so we can sort of see how much is spent over the series on unlocking chunks that is what we're gonna go ahead and do gonna go take out 2k here which is gonna be our first unlock and that way we can we can go ahead and unlock one chunk let's turn it into platon tokens and we will chuck that back into the bank and that will never be usable on the account Platinum tokens will never be usable so let's go ahead and open our first one if it's a really good one I won't spend any more money if it's a bit of a [ __ ] one I might go ahead and spend another one right here we go what are we gonna get that's [ __ ] great banter right well that won't be used I'm not going there when we lose our hardcore status I might stop going I will start going to the world even right now definitely [ __ ] not right we're gonna spend more money so let's go ahead and grab ourselves out 4k it's gonna be the next doubled up on the money and that goes into Platinum tokens and back in got 8k left on the account so we could spend another chunk after this if we want but I'd rather not I'd rather not and have a look what are we going to get something good please please oh my god clan wars I guess it's an altar and we can reset our stats other than that it's pretty not helpful it's really not helpful right yeah I would just grab second as a rejuve pull aren't we okay yeah so we can reset our stats if we need run and stuff once we get some ring of dueling's together I guess you know what I'm just gonna go ahead and do it gonna spend the a K and we'll see if we can get something a cage EP coming out which leaves us with 391 coins so we will have to make some money after this but uh eight more platinum tokens and we'll put those up there I'm actually gonna drag them up to the top so we can always see those and let's have a look at what we're gonna get here please something good here we go oh yes that's what we wanted to see we can do rune mysteries now and I think that opens up a few quests here as well I'm not sure what these three quests are if I don't work out that I can do them guys please do drop me a comment down below also unlocks a tree patch we get the altar the yew tree there the estate agents not bad I'll take it I will take it but could have could have could have been better but it is a quest unlock which means we can go ahead and do that and we'll look into these quests as well okay so looking at it on moonlight its priests in peril which we definitely can't do because we haven't unlocked any of that side of the map yet and then it's also gone tranquility which again not able to do I think we need farming level and we need to go some places we can't go but Shield of Arab I think we go back to here how are we looking down here we can we can sort of semi go into the hideout but I think you need this side of the room I'm not sure I probably won't look into that this episode but if anyone knows if I can do Shield of Arif without going in there because we've unlocked the the downstairs here so possibly let me know guys if I need that half of the of the room right I am a proper idiot I've been thinking I couldn't do Roo mysteries all this time because I had to go speak to her elbow in the Verret palace but you actually have to speak to him to do shield of Arif and I've just got them totally confused so we're gonna go ahead and do room mysteries but we could have done it the whole time so we talked to Aubree up in sets give you this package and we're pretty close to finishing now thank you mate get some research notes or something and we have to go back to the Wizards Tower that's really annoying cos with the chunks that we've unlocked I'm gonna go all the way around like this way I don't think I can hotel II can I hope tele seventeen minutes no and this is the end give the notes to this bloke [ __ ] hell they talked for a while there we go one quest point runecrafting skill and the air talisman we know what that means that means we get to open up another square let's not look where we're going here we go I don't really know what I'd want six would be nice start opening up towards falador and stuff like that but we will see what we're gonna get pick a chunk oh god no starting to open up Roger now oh dear ah no you [ __ ] hate to see that well like we'll get anything new there so we're still confined to what we had before but that is also where I'm gonna wrap up and this episode guys currently 354 total level with 12 quest points few quests done if we could go ahead and do em catcher pretty soon I need to start hunting some beads that would be another chunk to unlock but they're pretty happy with the progress so far got a lot of the free to play area of the map unlock now and looking forward to getting into the next one thank you so much for subscribe if you haven't and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
