hey everyone you with Tesla tone thanks so much for joining us on ludicrous fee today we're going to take an autopilot test on the frenches forest underpass here in Sydney on software update twenty twenty point twelve point eleven point one on our Tesla Model 3 performance stealth let's engage autopilot right now and this is a new underpass in French as forest cuts out about three traffic lights and if this had been opened during normal times it would have shaved about twenty minutes or so in morning and afternoon peak hour traffic so a really important bit of an infrastructure here in the north of Sydney so here we are on the new underpass in front is Forest it's part of the package for the area for the new hospital the government promising us new roads and autopilot is doing very well keeping to the road at 70 kilometres an hour passing the Australia Post truck which should all be electric one day I would hope makes sense postal service trucks be electric just quietly so that's one set of lights we're going under the second set of lights now and honestly it's a shame well I shouldn't show it's a shame but you know had there been peak hour traffic you would see the full benefits but you know when we go back to normality whenever that will be we'll certainly see the benefits of this road in the frenches forest area and that's the third set of traffic lights under whirring sorry under the wakest Parkway coming out now to join the rest of wearing the road so that's going eastbound towards the beach what I'm gonna do here is turn right onto a lamby lamby Road the side road and then we'll swing back around and go westbound back towards Chatswood all right so let's see whether we can change lanes in the filter lane here we are nice that was very smooth I like that now what a pilot doesn't react to traffic lights just yet in Australia so I'm basically going to stop here and then disengage so we don't run the red not safe at all currently there we go so in full self-driving visualizations for you guys lane markings intersection line traffic lights like I said doesn't react just yet two stop signs or traffic lights but one day it will doesn't even react to double traffic lights although that one's trying it's like two traffic lights very close to each other it's actually a double row this one's just single row some pedestrians they're walking across the street it's important I think to get the car to recognize double row one day because there are two sets of instructions ok so we're turning right now there is a roundabout coming up I am NOT game enough to try it because especially because I'm turning right there's no way on earth it's going to recognize autopilot roundabouts to the stage that alone turning right so one day when the update does come from roundabouts I will try it but not today and this road does enjoins back up - were in the road going or westbound back towards Chatswood in the city again if you live on the northern beaches you'll appreciate how good this road will be when peak hour does return in Sydney okay let's change lanes and we'll change one more ever before I engage what I pilot there we are now just go be wary of roadworks speed limits here sometimes it goes to 60 it does change quite often because it's a new road so I'll just have to be wary of that yep there's 60 so even though this the autopilot is 70 I will bring it down to 60 with my right scroll wheel then want to change lanes because sometimes people don't obey the speed limits I'll get tailed so I'm just going to stay in this left lane here and see how the car change lanes very nicely there a bit of breaking there for some reason I think it doesn't like the shadow of the underpass just drop down to 45 50 kilometres an hour very strange oh I might have to disengage you guys there we go because they're emerging vehicles I just know it hasn't been very good with merging recently so it'll take that risk scroll back down to 60 again for roadworks sometimes you get roadwork speed limits like this even though the road has done up not quite sure why there's no one on the road no traffic cones or anything but hey I've gotta follow the road rules let's see there's anymore phantom breaking through this underpass you know pretty good today it's following the speed limit very well at the car in front of me Oh guys well that is the frenches forest underpass new bit of road here in Sydney in the Northern Beaches area alright guys thanks for watching hope you enjoyed that looking forward to your comments stay safe and until next time happy chart
