if there's one thing we know about school here at Linus media group it's that things should be left until the very last second so here is a laptop roundup for back-to-school that is dropping days before school starts link below [Music] so our first category for our top five sort of here is the budget machine being a student is pretty much synonymous with not having disposable income or at least not having any leftover after your shopping carts full of ramen noodles and your binge drinking so what's the best way then to get something that is functional enough on the cheap you might think that you want a Chromebook but you don't yes 90% or even 95% of the time it'll work fine but that other five to ten percent well let's just say that no one is going to be clamoring to be in a study group with you like having to use the online version of Microsoft Office or MATLAB is functional for the most part but in the end you'll have wasted a lot of time just getting to where everyone else started so with that out of the way let's talk about what you should look for to get the best value we can't be too picky about the exact model but eight gigs of ram and an SSD are both musts these days and as for the CPU well per core performance hasn't changed much in the last couple of years so any dual core is going to do us pretty nicely but power efficiency has so look for a sixth or seventh generation intel on sale we ended up finding a dell inspiron 15.6 inch that met our requirements for 95 bucks off at Best Buy that's under $300 so if we were to grab that and slap this $35 SSD in it we're sitting pretty if you've got a bit more to spend though we'd recommend the surface go it's super small and unlike previous costs down surfaces like the RT it runs full-fat Windows 10 for when you need it now it isn't the fastest little laptop or the cheapest but for $600 including their touch cover keyboard the surface go is hard to beat it's got an excellent screen it's got a touch screen it's got solid battery life and it's got a pretty good little keyboard on it with little of course being the operative word so it's got everything is NEADS and if you grab an optional stylus for it it is fantastic for taking notes in tablet mode the next step up from there is to go from the small and portable surface go to the slightly larger but also very portable LG Graham with a great IPS display for watching movies a decent amount of power coming from its quad-core processor and heaps a battery life you can leave your power brick at home without worrying about locating a plug later on in the day the sake lightness of the ground will also have your back thanking you for not getting that gaming laptop though with that said if you are a hardcore gamer and you can't rely on a secondary cheap desktop for your fix we do still have some options for you here first up then is the Acer nitro 5 coming in at $800 this guy packs some serious punch with a 4 core Core i5 that goes up to 4 gigahertz and a gtx 1050 TI this thing can handle basically any game on the market as long as you don't expect to crank up the in-game settings alongside this one is also the Dell g3 which has pretty much the same specs but it'll cost a bit more with the benefit being that you don't have to go to meetings carrying around the flashy er nitro 5 which is probably enough to sell this thing to a lot of people finally if the 1050 Ti doesn't quite have the grunt that you're looking for then the GTX 1060 in the predator Helios 300 is available for not much more than those two all three of these devices are highly recommended assuming though that you don't mind trading some battery life for performance now everything up until now has had its space little niche carved out for it but what if you're looking for the all-rounder laptop power portability battery life and style well my friend then you are looking for the Dell XPS 15 with a quad-core CPU a gtx 1050 one of the best keyboards in the biz not to mention an awesome screen the XPS 15 is maybe the most toppy laptop ever like there isn't a whole lot that you can point at and say is really special about it unless you opt for the two-in-one version but everything that it does it does to near perfection that is as long as you don't need to be on lots of conference calls because the webcam kind of looks up your nose so that's it for what's in front of me but in response before you say the line is the only way to get laid in college is with an Apple logo first of all that's not entirely correct but if you have to have an Apple laptop we will still tell you which one's the best one to pick in our opinion frankly you're an idiot if you buy the macbook air before it gets it's rumored refresh because it currently rocks a 5th gen processor when almost everything else on the market has moved on to 8th gen the MacBook isn't too bad but it is still a processor generation behind and as for the MacBook Pro well the one without the touch bar is behind the times meaning that if you must have a Mac we're gonna recommend the MacBook Pro 13-inch with an 8th gen Intel chip it's got the best touchpad around and it's got a great screen though we are still annoyed that you're paying that much money for a laptop without a touchscreen I personally find that a touchscreen makes a much bigger difference than you might expect offer
