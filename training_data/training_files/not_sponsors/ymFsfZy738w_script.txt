so I just quit my job and bought an abandoned building watch which I'm gonna be turning into my dream shop YouTube studio and home okay [Music] how exactly did I wind up here standing in front of a huge pile of trash in an abandoned building which is supposed to be my home in like only four months so let's rewind a year and this is me sitting at my desk as a patent attorney with the outward appearances of success but I wasn't happy I discovered making things I'd started this channel and I felt like every minute that I was at my desk and not not making things I was throwing my life way I had things that I wanted to be sharing them with the world and I had to give it a go at living life on on my terms I couldn't not do it and so here we are this is a two-story commercial building with 6,000 square feet and it had been abandoned for six years and basically just left to deteriorate until I bought it and by the way I paid three hundred and ten thousand for this building which in Chicago is a steal for six thousand square feet I'll be trying to share as much as I can all the costs that go into this the last time this building was used six years ago the first floor had a flower shop here in the front section and an auto shop in the back so let's take a look at my plans for it but 3,000 square-foot first floor will be the modesto workshop with woodworking in the front section and concrete and metal working in the back the second floor had some sort of kids party room in it and warehouse storage in the back and I'll be turning the second floor into my home with an open living area in the front and a YouTube studio and bedrooms in the back let's go explore this place a little bit and just see what we got to work with oh and one quick warning here this place has been abandoned and left to decay for six years including all the toilets and piles of trash and we are gonna look at everything this is about a thousand square feet it's about four times the size of my current shop just for woodworking and I'm pretty excited about that so let's just see what we can find just in this woodworking shop over here we've got this massive massive like tree stump this was I guess some display stand at the flower shop at least one maybe two things we make out of that carving the bass away to make some sort of solid one-piece coffee table definitely you know slab atop that off to make some sort of cookie slab project I don't know if you guys have ideas let me know heading over here to this massive pile of garbage kind of dig in there just see if there's any diamonds in the rough well there's like a bunch of this like I think it's oak flooring and this is solid hardwood floor I think we can do something with this yeah these steel legs come in handy some fake plants from the flower shop I'm just kidding we're throwing this at now I'm gonna gotta work my way towards the back of the workshop and over here we've got the Trainspotting bathroom so there used to be walls here but it just kind of left open this is gonna be actually my first project is remodeling this bathroom so we can get the shop functioning right away so as we're moving out of the woodshop we're gonna head through this door over here we're gonna have concrete working metal working everything set up in here where we can get sparks all over the concrete floor apologies this is massive so I know it's gonna be echoing like crazy and we'll fix that I promise it's gonna be awesome I don't even know it's do it this much space I'm just excited so check this puppy out over here this thing is like an old elevator seems like it could be working I don't want to mess with it because I don't want to hurt myself definitely want to do something with that I'm not sure what yet but having this old lift super cool over here is got this room it looks like like it's got like a service window over here and there's all the prices I guess this used to be an auto garage you get your tune-up your breaks cooling system you name it I think that maybe what this will be is kind of like a camera room in here so I can keep my cameras dust-free and all that sort of stuff over here nothing too spectacular it was their lounge here now it's just like it's disgusting in there I don't think we knew if we need to go in yeah it's pretty gross now let's head on upstairs and see the second floor which is where I'm gonna live even though it doesn't look like it quite yet so this is actually a third staircase this whole thing here is gonna be ripped out we're actually putting a guest bathroom along this wall I think at least that's the plan now and let's go check up here where the bedrooms are gonna be this is gonna be my future master bedroom it is pretty trashed in here I mean the ceiling is caving in the floors are well that's been leaked on for like five years so they're disgusting there is a skylight and look at that when it gets in the roof I actually may keep a skylight in here one idea I have is to put some skylights with some motorized shades like the idea of looking up at the sky at night if you want but then closing it off for privacy above the bed look over this way we're gonna have an ensuite master bathroom so disgusting we're gonna rip everything out here we're gonna blow this wall over here out open it up and probably double size of the master bathroom there's actually another bathroom on the other side we're gonna be absorbing some of there's definitely some people that mist over there yeah all right so coming down this hallway one there's literally holes where you could go through the floor that goes all the way through so we got this moving down this way basically you're gonna have a hallway here that access is the master bedroom and then we're gonna add two more guest bedrooms over here so it'll be three bedrooms total so this is the point where it's time for me to put on some gloves this is some sort of old storage room for whatever businesses were here I think this was for a flower shop looks like we've got some soap and wonder if they have any toilet paper in here oh wait hold on mini paper towels no this is something from the flower shop it looks like it could be a choker I don't know how do I look yeah what else my you would like to be part of a pyramid scheme and way over here we actually have some more oak flooring that looks like it was never installed this stuff actually looks pretty nice you could trim it up plane it down and do some sort of reclaimed flooring projects by gluing these up we've got an assortment of like these random random granite countertops there's definitely some 90s style or I don't know if anyone's used this color granite for quite a while I can always recognize black galaxies I mean this stuff was like the most popular granite everywhere from like 2000 to 2004 I think my parents have this way this like I don't know what it is some sort of marble but it is it is a weird color that was only popular in the late 90s it's like a wood table under here oh it's inside their tomato boo-yan with chicken flavor all right I think we're done there everyone needs a spare headlight I mean this is a big honker too rubber graining rollers this is I've never seen this I don't know why I'm oddly fascinated by this little gadget if you roll this and paint supposed to give various types of wood grain patterns all right at the very least we will be trying this moving down the future hallway this way using your imagination to pretend that there's a third bedroom over there we're going to move into the open area at the end of the hall and this is going to be my future youtube studio slash family room and right now it's just covered in boatloads of trash I can see already one thing I'm gonna absolutely want to keep guess of old wooden clamps this looks kind of like a workbench it's not the most stable thing ever but it's not falling apart extra work surfaces are always handy bunch of old cabinet doors so I'm gonna have glass panels I could definitely see if these taking that out of there oh there's water dripping on my butt right now we've got a bunch of doors and there are these these might either solid-core oh crap I might have found all the work chops from my whole shop and then moving over through the junk pile for old print cartridges got these huge these huge old beams definitely reclaiming these for something tons of granite countertops these are actually in good shape over here I've seen a lot of people will do concrete casting against granite maybe that would be maybe we'll try that I don't really want to touch much of the rest of this let's let's head over to check out what's going to be the main living area spec as we're coming back picture bedroom three bedroom two and then master bedroom along here with your master bathroom in here coming through this door we have what's gonna be my future living room dining room and kitchen first thing we got this awesome open space got these steel beams brick walls so that's the good part and the good parts kinda in there the floor at first glance looks like it was a nice solid hardwood floor but it is really trash you can see all the cupping and bowing so unfortunately we're probably gonna have to rip out this entire floor area oh and over here I think you're gonna come into what will be sort of a dining room area then over here I think you'll have the living room and probably like a projection screen on the wall somewhere there like home theater setup maybe a minibar or wet bar over on that wall lots of potential with this open space and you can kind of see where the kitchens gonna go based on where this bar is right now we're gonna rip out all these walls so they'll just be an open kitchen put in an island here it's gonna be a pretty standard open layout other cool thing here is this awesome old steel staircase that's are just kind of like literally pieces of plywood yeah we'll be replacing all those these steps lead up to the roof we're budget allowing hopefully we're gonna build out a roof deck so let's go let's go check that out it is uh it is cold up here today first things first all those brown spots you see those are huge pools of water and spots where the roof has basically started leaking it's caved in the ceiling and numerous locations down below and or basically just go after a place this whole roof second problem is that this building is right next to the building's next door so there's no way to put windows in those bedrooms which means we're gonna have to put skylights across here for all three bedrooms so that you can get some light so and if all that goes as planned then we'll build the roof deck across here which should be really cool and now it's freezing so let's go back inside I want to show you a couple really funny things here I don't know what this used to be but first of all or walking up steps to get into a bathroom what does every bathroom need but dual facing toilets so from the roof leaks up there you got ceiling that's caved in we are fast-forwarding two weeks into the future and man a lot has changed unfortunately not for the better the coronavirus is now a very big thing here in the US I hope everyone in here and the rest of the world is staying safe staying home and just doing as best as possible given the circumstances personally I've been hunkered down here that Trainspotting bathroom I showed you I've been renovating it almost done that video will be out in a few days or might even be out now depending on when you're watching this video and of course make along as I go on this crazy journey I but take care of your family and your health first once again hope everyone is just doing as best as possible in these difficult times for the world let's band together we'll get through this and I'll see you next time
