hey guys I would go back to my channel so I'm thinking of doing like a first listen party after that if you're interested please let me know because I actually bought the like there's three versions yesterday yeah I guess I'm that type of fan like honestly I never bought like the three or like multiple versions offered twice album before I have a few of them but when I heard the album teaser for this one I was like this might just be their best album yet like that that's just how good it sounded to me and I was like I felt compelled to buying the three versions so yeah I guess I did it feels to me that not only is this one their best album yet but also this music video is going to be phenomenal like just from the teaser videos and the teaser pictures and everything the aesthetic the effects the visuals got here honestly they look so freaky stunning and I think we can all agree that this dance you know the dance break trailer that they gave us that was just that that left me wanting for more and I honestly like replayed that an embarrassing amount of time so yeah anyway so as always GIP is always you know providing us with a caption so I have them on more and more let's just go ahead first of all Mina honey you're glowing I just wanted say that it's a pup my god that gorgeous dude oh my God look there's gonna be a twist baby oh oh oh this is that most like I don't sounding music so far shut up Moodle everything about this oh yeah yeah oh I'm falling for her very hard son I see you oh yeah yeah this is gonna be on a repeat oh my god they go cautious the drop though holy crap this is the best oh she ain't that that mmm I'm moved by us for reason queen oh my [ __ ] I love center though they need to stop ending them music videos on like a note as if that was going to be something coming up you know like they did that oh so for fancy or something you know that I don't know anyways holy crap that that's that's about that's first of all that's the some above that's a everyday Bob that's like a forever Bob this song is so unexpected coming from them but I knew coming in kind of like they really like they prepared us I mean at least myself but they prepared me to this twist almost like I knew just from the teaser pictures you know they they're selling is this like white and like innocent and like you know just very proper white fantasy but then there's the snake and everything and the snake with the Apple it's like the temptation Adam and Eve blah blah blah you know this whole thing so I knew that was gonna be your twist but this is even better than what I had anticipated that this just looks sound even too tense is much more how should I say like mature that everything that they have done in the past like it's been going like crescendo and they've been step-by-step really moving towards more mature sound and more like woman like concept which I adore you already know life said there's so many times already but this one is like first of all if it's the these we're not in the semi just yet oh we know but anyways it just it's with the the current season and everything it's trendy it's just it's everything the dance as well oh my god they have such amazing formation it flows is dynamic it's cool just to watch because I feel like their dance the same way at 17 does kind of they move along with the lyrics in this and the song and the flow etc it's beautiful it's like a masterpiece it's like you're moving pictures yeah that's what a choreography is isn't it but anyways I can't wait to see like the stages in the choreography version of this because I'm sure they're gonna be showering us with like you know dance practice and like special versions etc so yes line distribution seems also incredibly fair the music video looks like one of their highest budget so far like they're still a good bunch of those sets or CGI and and green-screen etc but still it looks more expensive for whatever reason I don't know there's something as I said maybe maybe it's the move might survive that gives me this more expensive feel usually speaking this era they all look stunning like breathtaking I like the fashion as well I don't really like the what is it those print outfits they're not really my thing I much prefer their like white outfits with during the dance break but that's a personal preference again but I feel like the prints that they were wearing fits with the nature concept that they were giving up like to me it felt like this was the gate of heaven and this is what you see and this is like paradise right so it was paradise with them in it and their ease is that is that what it is you know with the nature the animals and how it was after all they're everything it felt very much paradise like in their goddesses or like angels or whatever which they're pretty much all at this point to me this song is one of their best like up there it's definitely up there it sounds very much like them but like a better version because it's definitely what I prefer and that's the thing with toys is that they keep them like improving and getting better and better in inland I'm like how how much more in love can I give it like it's not possible alright but yeah anyways so again let me know if you would be interested in a first listen to their album down below and that is it for me thank you guys so much forget to subscribe to my channel and I will see you in the next video bye bye
