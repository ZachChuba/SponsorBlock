this episode is sponsored by the online mental health service better help calm I love working with their therapists on my personal challenges and I love that they increase accessibility to professional care for you what causes fetishes why are some people really into rubber how does someone get off dressed like an adult baby i'm dr. lindsey doe clinical sexologist doctor of human sexuality and host of this sex curious show let me explain fetishes sexual attraction to an inanimate object or a body part think feet clothing rubber leather urine feces I'm not talking about fondness for these things or a preference for them but a requirement for the object of desire to be present in fantasy or in reality in order to achieve sexual gratification can't get it up or get it off without fill in the blank diversity is one explanation we all get turned on by different stimuli simple in the words of prominent psychologist Magnus Hirschfeld the number fetishes is unlimited from head to toe there is not a single spot on the body and from hats to shoes there is no fold in a garment that cannot trigger a fetishistic pleasure maybe people are just creative another possible cause of fetishes is divergent thinking divergent thinkers are curious they come up with a question like what is my penis getting hard and then they start exploring possible solutions unlike convergent thinkers who stick to facts in an article published by the British society for phenomenology Frank shala proposes that fantasy must be coupled with quote in carnality or embodiment so essentially divergent thinkers in their far-reaching imaginations develop fetishes as a reference point for reality kind of like the totem in Inception lunes glasses dolls you know where you hope this train will take you but you can't know for sure yet it doesn't matter one of the most widely known hypotheses is that fetishes are caused by early childhood conditioning operant conditioning that the inanimate object or body parts strengthens sexual arousal for example pleasure philia arousal from stuffed animals if a person rubs their genitals on a toy and it feels good all soft and squishy this can positively reinforce doing it again again and again voila a fetish for plushies may ensue classical conditioning is when something typically non-sexual is paired with something arousing enough times that the non thing becomes a trigger for the arousal all on its own take for example you prokta philia a fetish for flatulence let's say a person masturbates and gets aroused a fart and they don't get aroused then they masturbate and they fart at the same time the arousal from the masturbating is paired with the farting until eventually when they fired separate from masturbating ejaculate in their pants potentially conditioning of this kind can create such a powerful connection that the person can't come without farting fart noises fart smells etc JD Foust and colleagues saw a version of this known as the Matta to sensory conditioning in rats put half of their male rats and jackets for them to have sex in and half wit without jackets he repeated jacket sex no jacket sex repeat repeat then they tested the rats sexual performance rats who'd had sex without jackets and were tested without them got on no problem same with rats wearing jackets tested with jackets on and even those who started without jackets but wore jackets during the testing however the rat sex trained with jackets who didn't wear jackets during the test were noticeably less likely to seek out sex or ejaculate I wonder if fetishes aren't the result of behaviors that serve this species we evolved from but are now less practical vestigial explanation I was recently told that newborn puppies aren't very hard to clean up after because the mother stimulates them by licking their genitals and anus to expel urine and feces into her mouth how does this relate there's a fetish around urine called euro Liang Jia and one for feces called copper philia maybe fetishes like these are vestigial maybe at one point in our evolution poop and pee were closely related to genital and anal stimulation for hygiene or nutrition but they aren't now maybe fetishes are caused by a genetic mutation that reactivates this part of the genome to express a biological drive to ingest urine there are actually many hypotheses that suggest fetishes have a biological origin cortical homunculus or cortex man is a map of how the brain manages the body the genitals are next to the feet so if there's any overlap or crossover in these areas you may develop a foot fetish then there's the older-brother hypothesis researchers studied 200 heterosexual men and found paraphilias atypical attractions including fetishes were more likely in men who quote had a significantly greater number of older brothers this is often attributed to the effect success of male offspring have on the mothers hormones John Money a psychologist who studied sexual and gender identity believe that fetishes are caused by vandalised regions of one's love map according to money each of us has a blueprint of our ideal erotic scenario if something distorts it like abuse or arousal from a non-sexual childhood experience it could lead to a fetish compensation proposes that fetishes are formed when people can't access traditional outlets for sexual arousal because of self-doubt shame embarrassment and or feared they miss out on socially acceptable sexual gratification and compensate by getting off with inanimate objects that won't intimidate or reject them this reminds me of crash fetes ism or sexual arousal from crushing objects like insects grapes cake lizards if I didn't have a partner to play with I can imagine it would be really satisfying to smash frosting around with a dildo no negotiating no game playing just unadulterated sticky sex not animals though fresh ice make tea one explanation for fetishes that I haven't found in the literature but hypothesize could cause them is ironic rebound or ironic process theory generally this refers to how the more we try to suppress the thought the more likely it is to persist don't think of a pink elephant or a white bear and then all you can think of is the elephant or the bear if we're raised not to touch mommy's fancy dresses or wear her high-heeled shoes doesn't it become the one thing we can't resist doing the most transvestite fetishism one of the most common fetishes there is refers to sexual arousal from wearing the clothes traditionally associated with another gender for pleasure maybe this is ironic rebound maybe imitation emulating someone or something that's familiar attractive or beneficial in some way there are other suspected causes for people having fetishes Hirschfeld theory of partial attractiveness braids out of his complex winnicott's theory of transitional objects that the things we associate with becoming an adult are what we sexually get aroused by adult diaper lovers would point to comfort making messes and controlling humiliation there isn't conclusive data on any of these explanations i postulate a combination of some of them be that fetishes are as natural as appetite and the actual deviation from the norm is the obsession with limiting sexual desire and expression they curious better help has licensed appropriate resources in the description better help complex explanations [Laughter] [Music] got it
