it was January of 2009 when a trucker named Alphonse Madden got stuck on the side of the road he was driving a roof for his company and his brakes froze immediately he called for help but nobody came and so he sat for hours in the freezing winter he sat so long his body went numb and his speech began to slur incredibly though even though no help arrived Madden managed to escape because the thing was he wasn't really stuck Madden was driving for a company in Kansas and the brakes on his trailer froze not the cab that's the drivable part of the truck but the back the part with all the stuff the company wanted him to ship company policy never abandoned the trailer so he sat there in the cold waiting for the company to send a rescue truck when it didn't come bad and drove away he chose not to freeze to death rather than sticking with a broken-down trailer in response his employer fired him [Music] [Music] [Music] that poem by a black bear named summers expresses a deep anger at the heart of 27 teams night in the woods the game is about May a 20 year old college dropout who returns to her hometown of possum Springs but it's also about the town itself May feels smothered by life and expectations so does possum springs a mining company once employed most of the people living there then a glass factory took its place and now not really anything even the big grocery store outside of town closed down as a result everyone still living in possum Springs is stuck for many leaving is just too intimidating this town is the only place they've ever lived but even if they wanted to go the remaining retail jobs with low wages and bad hours make it next to impossible possum Springs feels wrung out by its former industry companies came squeezed every last drop of profit out of the community and then just left them to fend for themselves in possum springs employment is frequently exploitative and always soul-crushing May's friends work in snack huts and video rental stores and constantly worry about upcoming bills her dad worked many jobs in the past few decades but his most recently landed in a grocery store he hates it [Music] [Music] working on videogames almost always comes with a catch and most frequently that catch is crunch crunches and almost cute term the sound of stepping on a leaf or biting into an apple but in the games industry crunch means 80-hour workweeks months of lost sleep crunch is often represented by PR as the ultimate expression of love by team they say the developers are so passionate about the game that these insane hours are an inevitability if an individual developer can handle it maybe they're just not cut out for the games industry dozens of starving 20 year olds would forgo sleep and benefits just for the chance to replace them individual developers are frequently treated like short-term contractors by their employers each year brings more horror stories of Studios releasing a big game and immediately laying off half of its staff these Studios expect total commitment from their employees but that rote doesn't run both ways making video games is a dream job for entire generations of kids and during the workforce the more desirable the position the less a company has to promise to attract workers exploitation doesn't always look like freezing truck just a little while ago telltale games laid off virtually all of its workforce the employees were given no prior warning and no severance package situation as described by at milktea on twitter my friend's fiancee left Microsoft to start a telltale games his first day was Monday today he came into a check and instructions on how to file for unemployment engage a record that's it now in 2017 s Tacoma everyone as a contractor despite the fact that all the characters are living on a spaceship and performing highly technical and demanding tasks none of them have any job security and tourists the spaceships owner doesn't need to fire the crew instead they can just neglect to renew anyone's contract the proceedings might be more polite but the unemployment is the same in fact venturous would prefer to have no humans on board the ship at all the fact that the crew can still work as a result of hard-fought victories by organized labor early on all the workers celebrate obsolescence day the ironically named holiday is a reminder of a decade earlier when AI was supposed to replace all labor on the ships instead a union campaign resisted total automation now the crew has the privilege of sharing the ship with an all-seeing computer that records their every move gather round gather round everyone as per obsolescence day tradition tonight's festivities have been planned entirely by our or mowing all-seeing computer companion Odin he provided specifications to cake the deck or we humans only did the grunt work in his grand plan and so for your enjoyment tonight Oh what was that when an accident knocks out both oxygen and communications on the ship ventures encourages the crew to enter cryogenic slumber and preserve their remaining air although seventy-two hours in cryostasis could cause brain damage the company policy assures them that everyone will be rescued before then as it turns out though no such rescue was coming and the ship's failing support systems were no accident in a forbidden part of the ship a character uncovers a previously recorded message a statement by the company already prepared to announce the death of herself and the rest of the crew it is with great sadness that I address today February 29th 2088 mere hours ago six loyal men and women the crew of lunar transfer station tacoma lost their lives serving venturous and all of us who rely on the orbital economy tragically due to human error on the part of the crew venturous rescue technicians were not made aware of the catastrophic oxygen loss as we know each minute that human workers spend station isolated in orbit is another opportunity for heroes like the crew of tacoma to lose their lives we adventurous say no more the partisan obstructionism that led to the failure of the orbital worker safety bill has claimed its last victim today we hereby renew our solemn pledge to fight for the legalization of fully automated orbital facilities we encourage we humbly beg everyone listening to this message to contact their Osetra presentative and voice their support in honor of the crew of tacoma there never need be another tragedy like this one and now a moment of silence in their memory okay then we just cut it they're silent for a minute and then what Amazing Grace I don't need another take that was the ship's system failures were no accident Ventura's plan from the start was to literally freeze the workers out using baseless accusations of human error to push through an anti-union labor bill fully AI driven stations without workers who needed food pay arrest would soon follow if the crew had simply followed orders and entered cryogenic slumber just stayed in the cab and froze with the cargo venturous would never have needed to allow another obsolescence day celebration when it comes down to it though Tacomas corporate schemes are only as dystopian as the policies of a trucking company in Kansas it actually implies an optimistic future unions exist in Tacomas 2088 and they're powerful enough that companies have to find the sneaky ways to sway public opinion meanwhile in our 2018 efforts that labor organization are often at the mercy of upper management the Internet's favorite billionaire Elon Musk is infamous for thwarting unionization attempts in his Tesla facilities Amazon works its employees until they collapse from heat exhaustion and then pay for ambulances instead of allowing breaks and yet the idealized sci-fi futurism these mega corporations are selling is intoxicating the wealthiest 0.1% have effectively captured the public imagination worker protests are seen as impeding progress rather than ensuring it my home North Carolina is a right-to-work state and what that means is that organized labor has essentially been legislated out of existence what's more any discussion of unionization is almost non-existent when I was a kid I knew my teachers barely made enough to make ends meet but I thought of it as one of those nebulous bads that could maybe be righted if a smarter person got voted into office completely absent from that conversation it was any acknowledgment that every state that treated teachers better featured strong unions and those unions demanded not requested a living wage I used to share shifts at a restaurant with a full-time teacher who waited tables to make rent the same restaurant recently fired an employee who is not so subtly attempting to organize the staff sure Tacomas corporation might have tried to kill its employees but it did so because those employees held power the fact that workers haven't been totally overpowered in the far future almost feels more fantastical than space cruises [Music] early on in night in the woods find the tooth of a mining boss and a long-forgotten drawer in 1870 that boss was skimming pay from his workers and when they confronted him about it he lashed out berating them and punching one of them in the jaw in response the workers held him down and pulled out all of his teeth the teeth were passed out to minors as a signifier of their shared vow protect each other and never forget their common interest the tooth is a reminder that workers not managers or CEOs should control the products of their labor but it's also a relic and it's lost most of the significance at once had once the workers were able to seize power through direct physical means but now not only is that act illegal no one can perform dental surgery on the changing economy that left possum Springs behind regardless though it's clear that the characters in night in the woods can't make it through individually in order to survive they'll need to harness the power of collective action obviously no one at telltale wanted the studio to go under but there were people who knew it was coming the level of mismanagement and lack of concern for workers required to hire new people days before going bankrupt is mind boggling among many lessons to learn from Telltale's bankruptcy one stands tall cannot rely on your boss to have your best interests at heart if don't demand otherwise will be exploited game developers and journalists are pushing for increased recognition of unhealthy working conditions in the industry waypoints interrogation of a dozen developers on crunch shows a wide range of both acknowledgement and denial game workers unite is a fresh attempt at horizontal organization across the field stating that they will empower the voices of workers and side with them and disputes with managers and business owners and because art is fundamentally a method of expression these same conversations can't help but manifest within games themselves neither Tacoma nor night in the woods present as games about labor sci-fi thriller zanbato MERS have existed for decades in gaming frequently happy to let players blast aliens or collect lost treasure without a care in the world but increase the visibility and solidarity throughout the industry has made these issues unavoidable the games industry has found itself at a crossroads it can confront these issues tackle them head on and hopefully re-emerge with a sustainable healthy ecosystem or it can just stay in the cab and let itself freeze with the cargo
