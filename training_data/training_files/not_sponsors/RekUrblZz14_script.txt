[Music] oh hey what are we doing welcome to another studio vlog welcome to another studio vlog this week I will be working on an EP out left full of Diana and also a super super huge artwork so I hope you are heart if you like it and I want to say thank you to little page / / / little face whoa see you later for a Q&A [Music] I received a bunch of kids letter they are so cute I just wanted to respond to each one one by one because I can imagine writing a letter to an author an illustrator and receiving something back would be so much fun when you were a super little these kids are like you want you to these are some beautiful paintings this ones have Jupitus which is a whale in my book this one is mercury which is a hedgehog these are very good these kids are in India one or something like that oh my god it was so cute anyway this is he's like this I'll definitely show you some of my favorite ones what I'm gonna start writing responses to these otherwise I'm never gonna get them done [Music] I've completely finished the letters I probably have two classes together like 60 letters to go but for now I'm gonna take a little break because my neck hurts and my hand hurts I'm gonna go do some sketches for dialler we decide on the title drift by the way Oh yep that's what I'm doing today so I'll be ready for the new week because I was oh I should tell them that I was at a thing I guess I can tell I only have me like three shots would be the hurt Oh Bailey help but I just went to the Gold Coast to speak at some of us at college basically they hold an annual celebration of Literature Festival and I was able to speak the ABS really really fun but also terrifying because I don't like speaking front of people why you smiling about how they're so basically my presentation was tailored two years two to four because that's who I was to get but I actually had a lot of preschoolers so I needed to be extra interactive and be like who wants to count down with me when I was reading she was like ten nine okay and also when I was like who has a dream for when they're older and they were like dinosaur feet the delivery person I was like okay pretty achievable so the point of telling you that was so that I could say I've been away for the last three to four days and so I have a lot of work to catch up on before the start of the week which is tomorrow at Sunday today we're going to Cafe for a little change of place and to eat only I'm starving yes [Music] so I've got some initial sketches for de Allah who is a musician whose music I use a lot in my vlogs you guys probably know her reached out to her and let her know that because I was using her work in my work that I wanted to offer my services for her because the music is so important in my vlogs these are just my initial ideas basically we made a little mood board of the things that we liked the look of and this EP that she's releasing his very very light 80s but not dated so I wanted to kind of take some of these nostalgic elements of the 80s so we've got like neon signs here we've got pixel and stuff old digital a lot of sci-fi so I'm gonna send these off and then kind of describe these to her and see which which ideas she likes the sounds of best just so you guys know this little lady is gonna go crazy because we just realized this has so much caffeine and Shawn doesn't drink coffee and look how big her glasses and we packed a lot of green tea powder stuff in here this robe in his life with this drink perfection outfit I made your painting now [Music] I give you a little check-in on how things are going with this this is the very first color layup and I think I'm gonna leave it like this because what I'm doing is something like this which doesn't actually require that much pigment on the paper to begin with usually I hate the first layers of my paintings they look so amateur and crap I really like this I'm hoping that it will look super good because once I start putting down the top layer like the really dark layer I'd rather not go back and then apply more pigment later I think from now on it's just going straight into emails in the morning I'm gonna do some painting because I think that are just loosen me up and it's like a nice way to use that motivation that initial motivation that you have in the morning so it isn't just like draining you anyway so I'm gonna pay for about an hour and then maybe do emails after that this vlog is definitely not gonna have a finished piece in it so I'm just gonna stop when I stop and then you'll see this piece be completed over probably the next few videos currently mixing up a color for painting over everything so it's gonna be very blue with a tiny bit of pink like so a kind of an indigo a color I love that I'm not doing a lot because I want the top layer to kind of change color throughout the painting so I want to remix it every time and also I don't know how much I'm gonna be painting this morning so I don't know waste ink because if it dries up and is not really very reusable it's very tough but if I only use a little bit of [Music] I know you guys have heard me talking for the shipping so just let me know time to do Q&A I'm good all the questions saved what is the meetings you have always wanted to try but never have or have been nervous about trying can you take us on an awesome fly shopping will also please show us and talk about that big favorite castel box I'm super curious about it well I think I've said this already but I really want to do ceramics is here and I did a bit of it in high school and I did it in university as well as a part of my degree but it was more just like touching on it I feel like my Styles progressed so much since I lost it's erotica I'd like to see what it looks like on a 3d object so I was gonna do a cost do you want to come to you baby yeah okay we'll go we'll find a ceramics class sometime in next few months can you also take us on an art supply shopping vlog one day perhaps I'm not really in Poland but I'm sure rocket can help me yeah I hope you all the hundred is so good yeah also please show us and talk about the huge favor Castle box okay so this the huge favor Castel box is actually was actually given to me by one of my mom's friends who's a designer it's incredible I'll dedicate that to another video next question next were you drawing a lot when you were little or older I'm curious did you have a talent or ability to draw from the beginning or were you training a lot right now I'm studying in art school and I don't know what to do in the future so how did drawing become your full-time job I believe that some people are predisposed to being better at drawing but only a little bit I think the main thing is working really really hard there's a quoted steal like an artist from like a basketball player so I don't really know who it is I'll put his name there it's hard work beats talent when talent does work hard basically it means that even if you're talented if you don't work hard someone that is not talented at all but worked really really hard will be better than you and will succeed because without Drive there will be no growth or anything like that I was always told I was a good driver when I was little but I was drawing a lot and throughout high school I always chose subjects that kind of would get more creatively throughout university and studied art and design now I just draw everyday so I think it does take work I don't think you can fall back on being talented I feel like those who don't feel like they're talented could could do really great things if they work really hard how did try and become your full-time job I've been like freelancing with illustration since the end of high school basically just creating a lot and putting it out there for people to see it is another reason you should use Squarespace because it's a great place to put your portfolio what do you do when you have a great idea in mind but aren't sure if you'll be able to execute it when I sit down to do a piece I have to feel so confident that I will be able to execute it because we've watercolor you kind of have to know what you're doing before you start so what I do especially when I feel like I'm not able to execute it I will find photos on Google of the subject that I'm going to be painting do Studies on that so I'm super confident in the form do some like swatch tests maybe like a thumbnail sketch or a smaller rough version of it until I feel comfortable enough to actually start and I think that's the best way to do it because if you practice on practice you know what mistakes not to make because you made them already what kind of advice do you have for new graphic designers entering the industry I'm reaching the end of my design major and internships are intimidating to approach so internship would be my advice to you because I did two internships before I became a designer full-time and that was before I was doing the illustration full-time there's no better experience for an actual real-life experience that will teach you stuff about business or will teach you about what clients expect what agencies expect I did one at an advertising agency and that was Geremi and deflect my last year of university we actually had to do an internship as a part of our degree helps me make friends with people and see how everything were to see how they would work with larger clients and be part of art Direction meetings and stuff like that and then my second internship it was a really small agency and the best thing about that was that I learned so much because they were able to give me more responsibility because they were a lot smaller whereas in the live one I just got like little little jobs which is totally understandable because the clients they're dealing with the much bigger mistakes are higher if I was going to choose one or the other whether to get an internship at a larger agency or a smaller agency I would probably go smaller agency because there's a lot more to learn you're often given a number of different roles because there are less people there so you could be you can be a designer there but you also have we were wearing the art direction hat you're wearing an illustrator hat video editing and stuff like that and so I find a really really really helpful I learn more in the like two months of my internships that I did at university so I would definitely recommend getting internship what you need to do to do that is create a portfolio don't just put your University work in there because I've been through the interview process for interns and it's very obvious when they don't do any other work besides school work so I would put some of your favorite uni work and then some personal stuff which shows why you're a little bit to everyone else and when you get accepted and you get an interview with someone from the agency just make sure that you show that you're friendly that you're passionate about what you do that you're willing to learn and that you're excited about being in the industry don't go in feeling like you're the best and you're cool and you're cocky and try and convince them that you're not like every other student because unfortunately even though you think that because I honestly thought that too you're you're at the end of your university process but you're at the very start of your career so you're basically studying and even when we interview people I would rather to someone that's more down-to-earth and willing to learn and admitting that then they don't know everything that someone that comes in is like I've got so much to offer because really you've you've only got what you've learnt at university and maybe some of the stuff you've done outside you don't have like industry experience otherwise you would be interning hey Sean any tips on when you have too many ideas that's a good problem to have a tip would probably be either write everything down or sketch little summarize all of your ideas down once you get them out of your head you won't have to think about them anymore the reason you go around around with all the ADIZ and it's kind of overwhelming at least for me is because I don't want to forget them but if you've written them down you don't need to worry about that anymore and then you can come back to them when you have time to execute them that's it I hope you like this video I had a lot of fun with this vlog I think it's exciting because it's a little bit of commercial work a little bit of personal work thank you again to Squarespace for sponsoring this video thank you to rocket for helping me sow these lights I feel like it makes a big
