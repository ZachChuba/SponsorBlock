i'm dr. lindsey doe clinical sexologist and host of this sex curious show sexplanations today's sponsor is largest sex toys and I want to understand the first mature penis I saw was probably larger than average I remember measuring it between my pinky and thumb so yes longer than five and a half inches Gerst how wide length or tumescence how hard it got the veins hair color angle I don't remember any of that being important to anyone then I learned about Japanese carrots some people penetrate themselves with carrots other people go for big big carrots Japanese carrots it's not that other sizes are inferior or wrong just that big objects are for some more desirable preference like breasts or buts or body hair hairlessness I remember my friend stacking her fist one on top of the other to convey the length and girth of a penis that she'd recently had sex with and another of our friends said I love big dicks I'm a total size Queen size Queen a term that originally referred to gay men who prefer large [ __ ] but has come to include all genders and all items of penetration like these beasts falafels twelve inch length filling 2.25 girth 10 inch total length 2 inches wide 7.5 insertable without the scrotum boom boom boom big bull and that's not even the largest I've seen someone's anus penetrated by a bucket bodies are amazing this is Miss honey ankle vicar she told me she's always liked big penises but about four years ago she got into fisting penetrating with hands and arm and had been solo training for even larger insertions she's up to twenty four point five centimeters circumference Emily and a little bigger than that vaginally in fact her big accomplishment of the year is a double vaginal fisting I know some of you are thinking why she loves the stretched and full feeling but also the pressure that large objects put on the internal parts of the clitoris maxi has this to say so one of the reasons I like larger objects is it allows me to feel it a little bit better definitely when I was younger I had a lot of trouble being in touch with my body being in my body not associating and when I used larger objects it was more obvious that was their larger objects helped me feel more because the sensation was stronger and I had to really be aware of my body in orders who have at work and have it work in in a healthy way not cause myself it just made me feel really good and I couldn't be more in touch with myself so now you may be wondering doesn't this leave their body cavities wide open and vulnerable everyone I interviewed said no we're using large object it's not gonna make you loose that's not how the putty works at all chase concurred stretching during large object insertion is temporary he's just as tight post big penetration as he was before and the consistent use of large insertions has actually increased muscular control in his pelvis so unless you're forcing the body to take extreme penetration a stretched cavity can return to its original size this is how it works when babies are born vaginally and the vaginas narrow to their original size hey Miss Honey told me doctors have tried to argue with her trick her into stopping large object penetration tell her that she can't possibly do what she's clearly doing but there are medical providers who understand body modification of all kinds in and out who respect her personal choice and have sensible health discussions without shaming others taking this is a form of athleticism no shame chase discovered his fondness of large insertions when he was being penetrated digitally with a finger kept asking for more and more which progressed into fisting this ding he said we were both really turned on by the idea of me being gaped so then we progressed to double vaginal with the toy and his [ __ ] one thrusts two objects using more objects at once is a common alternative to one large object they're usually easier to store more accessible and make it convenient to size up but they can rub on each other causing friction and tearing in the body cavity an extra note for anal toys all of them need to have a wide base or a cord to prevent them from getting stuck all the way up inside the body in fact large object penetration is not a sexual activity that people perform on their first try with home decor everyone who shared their experiences with me actually trains to take more it's like a sport they use proper equipment they spend months working up to their goals and some of them even have role models who serve as coaches our teammates all of them are so dedicated here I'll show you on these toys foot chase accomplished after ten months nine point seven five inches and ten point five inches around he told me he enjoys the vaginal pressure and the stretching sensation during and after penetration he also enjoys the psychological effects there's the satisfaction of looking down and seeing this huge dildo pounding into his body and there's the power exchange submitting to someone manipulating something like this entering a sensitive delicate body cavity is a serious surrender with intense subspace and it's definitely a gradual process to get there a man who I called dragon shared this video clip of tips so I was something smaller ideally tapered and also something with Lube because without Lube entry can be very difficult with liberal application of lubricant entry can be much easier dragon doesn't exclusively favor large objects like other people I heard from but he likes that big objects add fullness to his sexual repertoire and their deep inside causing pulsing contraction through his court it makes the mild soreness that persists for a few days afterward worth it make things more comfortable dragon emphasized avoiding spicy foods with anal exploration the professionals adult performers who are paid for big themes know this when you see us take big things in porn remember we've not only trained our bodies to do that but we've prepared before the shoot our vaginas and/or anuses have been warmed up and stretched and lubed off-camera communicated beforehand about what works and what doesn't work for our bodies don't assume that you can do it to your partner because you saw it on a porn that's a helpful checklist train warm up stretch Lube communicate don't assume biggest advice is to go slow and use lots of Lube I say this is a person who produces a significant amount of my own lubrication also be patient with yourself relaxing and enjoying the experience of getting to know your body and how far it can stretch is very fun size is certainly a way to stay curious there are many many ways adamandeve.com get yourself a big box fill it with lots of big objects thank you for learning about large
