see Sonic the heart of your system hi and welcome to the next part of my render PC 2019 you can already see my Titan RT Xbox on this table that's why a lot of you people already guessed it right in a previous comments that we picked a Titan RT X for the rendered PC build it's not only because we want to make this extremely expensive or kind of special this build it's mainly because the amount of video memory this card has to offer compared to an RT X 20 80 TI this one comes with 24 gigabyte of memory while the RT X 20 80 TI comes with 11 gigabyte of memory the tu 102 on this card is in the full version so it comes with 4608 shader units while the RG x 20 80 TI has 4352 shader units so there's a small increase in trader units as well which certainly gives you a performance benefit over the RT X 20 80 TI we also have an increase GDP from 250 280 what which is something I don't really care about especially because we're going to use water cooler on this card but using such a card in a render PC makes absolute sense especially if you have multiple video lines stacked above and then you're adding animations in a 4k video which is typically what we do and then for example you have an animation flying in where you have like a price tag that's animated or something like that and if you're doing 4k video playback like life playback then it really matters that you have an extremely strong GPU and preferably a lot of video memory and that's what the r-tx titanor Titan RDX offers we will in one of the later videos when we have everything assembled also talked about on compare values with the RT x 2080 TI versus to tighten our DX so I will show you some examples in Adobe Premiere and also some other stuff I'm doing because you know I'm also doing a lot of CID work like 3d CID developing products and SolidWorks this card is just better than a r-tx 2080 TI if you're a gamer I would personal not pick a Titan RDX because the price and we're talking about at least in Germany currently about 2018 b0 is not worth the benefit over NRT x28 EDI which is currently 1,100 years so it's more than less of more than half of the price the r-tx 2080 TI that's why for a pure gaming rig I would never go for a Titan r-tx but whenever there is something like professional work involved somehow let's say rendering applications or CID stuff and also not for to RTX 20 80 TI in SLI because a lot of those render applications or also see ad applications they don't really benefit from SLI some of them cannot even work with multiple GPUs even in 2019 that's why I really don't want to have a second GPU in there if a lot of applications don't support it and I have more space in the expansion slots which I can use for example for PCI Express devices such as storage devices in this video we will take this card apart and mount a water cooling unit on there because we you know we have a full custom water cooling loop that's going to be in my system obviously we cannot leave the air cooler on there [Music] so far so good removed the cooler from the VGA just removing the last bits of thermal pets from the card do you know this kind of feeling when you're just about to add a water cooler to a card and you have to remove the stock cooler first and you're sure that you removed all screws and it's still so extremely difficult there's so much force on the card and you're trying to take it apart and it still feels like it's stuck somewhere and it feels like you're breaking the CPCB in a minute every single time this feeling just doesn't go away but yeah here we are just collecting the last bits of thermo pets that are stuck on some smaller components like this I see in front and now we have those residues from I think this is also some kind of thermal paste or some mix between a pet and a paste we have to remove move all of that we have to clean the GPU and also the memories before we start with the watercooler mounting [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] GPU is nice and clean so we can finally get to the water cooling unit and this one comes from water-cooled aka heat killer personally for me this is the highest quality you can get for any kind of water cooling components we will actually use quite a lot of water cool or heat killer components in this build just out of personal preference I think let's just unpack those products quickly I decided to go for acrylic nikka version obviously all of those water cooling components no matter if it's water cool ek or whatever they always come in several different versions I decided to go for the one that has the acrylic window also comes with RGB mainly because we will mount the GPU vertically inside the case which we are going to use so it's possible to look at the card from the side therefore the optic is kind of important or the visuals of this card generally I just really love how this block looks like we have two acrylic right here underneath the structure milled out of the nickel plated copper we have some aluminium additional elements right here so looks like black anodized aluminium components and if we turn it around we have the melt copper as we know it from all the other vendors and all different kind of water blocks what would be one of my videos without some really unnecessary soldering on ridiculously expensive hardware components and that's what we were going to do obviously again today in this Titan r-tx video you all know this area where we typically plug in to eight pin connectors for power delivery of the card the backplate goes on right here very nice and smooth we have a location right here where you can see it's a little bit deeper the area of the contacts on the back and I always wanted to try this on a card where I'm soldering the cables directly so the connectors in the back and therefore I don't have to use the connectors on front and we will not be able to see any kind of cables in the build itself because the cables will basically come out somewhere here on the back and then because the card will be placed vertically inside the build we will we will not see any kind of cables go up from the card and then somewhere inside the build so let's just get to this and remove the unnecessary aluminum [Music] backplate is prepared and ready to go remove to this part with the Dremel also yeah use the file to have it nice and smooth the thing is I thought that the r-tx Titan has the exact same PCBs are r-tx 20 80 TI that's why I thought this playback pipe would fit but if I Alain align backplate and VGA it kind of collides on this corner right here there's this piece from the shield from the i/o shield of the VGA which collides with this part of the backplate in result we could either work on the back plate which is much more much more work than just using the Dremel and removing this part of the i/o shield - all right let's try feels much better clearance here doesn't collide anymore feels correctly we can feel that has contact right here and here over the standoffs that are underneath the back plate yeah it feels good just started cutting the wires I will cut them one by one attach each single one to the backside of the GPU so I don't mix up the cables somehow get the polarity straight and also make sure that I put them through the back plate every single time otherwise that would be kind of fail [Applause] [Music] [Music] first cable or first 8-pin cable is attached quick try if the backplate self it's feels nice we also have some space around cables which you can see here moves freely so there's no direct contact between those cables and the backplate because on those areas where we cut out the aluminium obviously we have naked aluminium therefore could be or there's a potential risk of short circuits that's why I think once we have the second cable attached we will insulate this a little bit with some liquid tape [Music] we will use me Benko liquid rubber which is pretty much the same as the liquid insulation tape you used to know from Plasti Dip things even the same product I use this several times for insulation of like back plates from GPUs especially for extreme overclocking to prevent it from condensation it is extremely convenient to use you can also peel it off afterwards which is probably the best aspect of this product of course we will use liquid metal on the GPU for the best cooling performance but to protect the GPU I will apply some of my nail polish first in fact Roma we are working on our proper insulation coating for the cup metal which will be available soon but for today's video we will stick to my old nail polish after the nail polish dries we will continue and apply liquid metal to the block by the way liquid metal is easier to spread the 15 the surface with acetone first [Music] enough break for me let's get to the waterblock mount on the manual itself you can see this part is for RTX 20 80 TI we have a lot of different thermal pads of 1 millimeter and 0.5 millimeter thickness and unlike other brands water cool is delivering those thermal pads directly cut into the correct size which is something I really like so we have bigger one with one millimeter have a really tiny one with one millimeter unfortunately we don't really know or it's not that easy to directly know on which location those thermal pads have to go that's why we really have to follow the manual this will take some time let's get to it [Music] for a final amount it's also important that you follow the manual there are basically two different options you can go for either without back plate or with back plate in our case because we went with back plate we have to keep in mind that eight screws are going to be mounted underneath the back plates we have to mount them first have to make sure that it's the correct one and then after we have those set into the cart there's still seven that go into the back plate directly or through the back plate through the card into the water park [Music] even though thermally it doesn't really make a difference we will sell at those thermal pads underneath the back plate the big one goes underneath the GPU directly makes contact with the back plate spreads the heat and the traditional small stripes go underneath the MOSFETs or on the backside of the MOSFETs and then make contact with the back plate [Music] [Applause] [Music] we are finally done with this card also with the video I think it looks quite nice just the fact that this is exactly how you will see the card in the rake and there will be no cables on here in fact I might add some covers to this I'm not really sure because currently it really looks like there are some cables missing but yeah the cables are not missing they're just exiting the card on the back right here which i think looks also quite nice and you will not see this in the rig in the end because card will just be vertically mounted all the cables will disappear somewhere inside the case so I think the result is very nice and clean if we add a cover to here I think this will be really really cool let me know in the comments what you think of this quite strange idea maybe insane idea considering the price of a Titan r-tx and yeah see you next time when we will continue building on my render machine thanks for joining in see you soon [Music] [Music]
