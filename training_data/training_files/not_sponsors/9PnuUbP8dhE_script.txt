on multiple occasions we have tried liquid cooling a computer with the cheapest parts we could find be they from eBay or the local hardware store but the problem always comes back to this building a loop with parts designed for something else like say using an aquarium pump is pretty jank so we endeavored to track down some parts that are actually designed for cooling pcs but are as inexpensive as the non purpose-built stuff and thanks to the power of Aliexpress they are finally here and a total mess [Music] Origin PC offers beautiful custom GeForce GTX 1070 max Q be sure to check them out at the link below the first step on our journey was of course to source the parts and because of that the surprises actually started early on I mean little did I know that there is a massive market of off-brand water cooling gear like brands I've never heard of like sis cooling and Barrow and my to fame and some of it surprisingly actually looks pretty legit so naturally we did what any sane person would do and ordered a freaking wack ton of it like a whole bunch of them including a few parts that I would describe as decent looking and a few that were not so much just sort of like a like a Auto shoddy approach you know fire at the wall and see what sticks so once we had everything on order I figured yeah okay probably like a month for free delivery on a boat from China right wrong so we actually ordered most of the parts back in September of 2017 and the last one arrived in January of this year so needless to say that was quite the setback while we waited we also ended up buying a couple more odds and ends like which radiators are you talking about these radiators like these radiators and a couple of pumps so that's why it has taken us until July almost an entire year to actually make this video so like yay free international shipping you get what you pay for and what exactly is it that we did get Jake like do I do I do I just like go through this stuff yeah go holy crap look at this thing so this is just a copper plate a piece of plexi a gasket that doesn't even seem to be made of like any kind of smelly Abel like soft materials just hard plastic it's just a straight-up like flat piece of copper on the bottom this one is based on a very similar design if you can call a flat piece of copper design this one is almost the same this is the same thing this is the same thing with a different bracket this bracket is stupider so I guess these guys are the the engineers of the dunce class okay all right the postings on the internet they don't give you that great of a description of what you're getting these guys went to school and this one actually looks not bad too so these are both kind of pin or a style blocks that again are based on very similar design so they are Direction agnostic they just go in pass through some fins and then come out so is that all the CPU blocks oh yeah okay let's kind of this one looks palling how much was this I think it's like 15 bucks 15 bucks it's cheap Wow I mean I'm not including these ek so of course right but like that's not a performance nickel-plated these pumps look pretty friggin sketch though like look at this thing it's got some weight to it so I can give it that but I don't know that that's necessarily meaning so like these two are basically the same just a different table you see this a lot when you order stuff from China where this is the same company it's like designs that are clearly you know borrowing from each other or straight-up produced at the same factory and then just rebranded with like Chinese companies rebranding Chinese products in the same way that like international companies just rebrand Chinese products so it turns out these radiators are actually aluminum ok so heads up for you guys you don't want to mix metals aluminum plus copper equals corrosion but the good news is that we did follow up the aluminum radiator orders like sometimes when you're ordering stuff from China you don't even know exactly what it is like one of the one thing we thought was a block is just a red LED to go in a block so you can get copper and brass radiators with just aluminum fins that don't cut touch the water for like five bucks more even if you're going the aliexpress water cooling route spend the extra five bucks now one thing you might notice that we didn't order any of is fittings and reservoirs and the reason for that is that while there are some really cheap options out there they don't affect performance so using them in this kind of a test where we're evaluating the performance serves no purpose other than to have more potential points of failure where we can leak water onto our hardware so we just stuck with the stuff that really affects performance like this LED that how much should we pay for this like it was like five bucks five bucks but then given that we probably paid about five bucks for this it's really it's a nice one so you can actually stick so this is just LEDs for this blocks yeah I've seen this kind of thing before probably worth the five bucks yeah not bad enough fun and haul videos for now though we need to actually test these things but before we can do that we need something to compare our numbers against some kind of standard luckily Jake keeps his test bench water cold for some reason so we can just use that this is actually a pretty standard set up from one of the best in the biz EK water blocks so to cool the four gigahertz 59 60 X we've got any case supremacy Evo mated to a three hundred and sixty millimeter PE series radiator and a d5 PWM pump and we're gonna crank that pump to a hundred percent for the purposes of this test now with the baseline test out of the way it's time to take some of our aliexpress wonders for a's Finn now we're gonna assume that if you're buying some parts super cheap from Aliexpress you're probably buying most of them there so because of that we're gonna build the whole loop out of these parts the only ek stuff we're using again reminder is the reservoir and the fittings so what do you wanna start with you know I was thinking I really want to try one of these just like gross box sure but are we gonna say match for the pine axe yeah I think we should get like a proper do you want to do like the really I'll just okay okay I do like a baseline of our aliexpress though sure yeah okay I don't think you should probably buy this but you can this is actually cut like have you taken this apart and put it back together or something because this is like not an amazing design actually from everything that I know about water yeah and it needs like a jet plate while Jake builds up our first Le Express loop let's talk pricing that ek config that we showed first with everything included would cost you a whopping three hundred and eighty dollars I know that sounds like a lot but for custom water cooling that's not actually that outlandish now with that said what Jake's building right now is around ninety dollars including everything that you need about a quarter as much okay so this is it we're on the full aliexpress loop yeah at the Express loop it sounds like a train or something the aliexpress loop with the SIS cooling SCP sixty-seven F which Jake found was pretty much the best bang for the buck and he had I 264 s FPU test running for about 20 minutes to give it a chance to reach equilibrium and we're sitting at about 65 degrees on average pretty darn impressive for the price really honestly not that far off our ek setup okay now I want to see the worst case scenario what happens when we throw this gutter trash okay it's the same thing this gutter trash alright find out my favorite type of trash so it's done Luke number two is set up using one of those completely flat blocks now our X spectators for this thing pretty freakin low most water blocks have channels cut or like machined or something into the base to increase their surface area because more surface area means more heat transfer so we would think something with negligible surface area by comparison would perform very poorly and now that it's been running for about 20 minutes on a 59 60 X it's actually doing okay like way way better than I expected so conclusion time then custom water cooling has really evolved from the days of like basement scientists with their aquarium pumps and like you know weird hunks of metal that they got from like someone that one guy in Australia that makes them and ships them around the world or whatever to having tons of options I mean everything from you know super high-end stuff that would scare away most newcomers just due to the sheer cost all the way down to thanks to the power of Chinese manufacturing and free international shipping low-end options where you can actually get reasonable performance and that coolness factor for about what you would pay for an AIO from a name-brand with that said the performance of your AIO that would come with a warranty or even a high-end Noctua air cooler that would also come with a warranty would also be pretty good so doing a build like this super cool was definitely fun to experiment I'm just not sure if we're gonna put the - tech tips seal of approval especially on the pumps please don't cheap out on your pump not recommended it's not that bad guy I don't recommend it okay never recommend it well this thing with id5 nothing else DDC nothing else is acceptable no I've seen so many TV C's filming where's my d5 what about this thing didn't I give this to someone at LTX last night crisis like tomorrow look I fixed it I welded it lordy at the link in the video description seriously though axel cool guy so thanks for watching guys if you dislike
