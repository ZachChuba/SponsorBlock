welcome to the windchill ladies and gentlemen it's gonna be a fantastic show today how do I know because it's a show it's Valentine's Day and I really just felt like I owed it to you because let's face it if you're here watching the land show it was because you didn't have anything better to do oh yeah yeah I went there oh and straight there what if it's just not till later just like us well you know for most of the continent it is later well you know you know what though that's fine appreciate ya spending your Valentine's Day weird you're us that's right we're we're here we're here but we're together oh that's true it's fine you can be my Valentine yeah all right guys happy Friday we've got a lot of great topics for you all today the word on the street yeah Street is this the street where you fight yeah why do people talk about things like this on the street I want to find this street where we just talked about like tech tech news yeah tech news story Street yeah Intel X Y Z P yous are rumored to be coming in configurations as hot as five hundred watts oh so I'm going to talk about that a little bit later Sony is apparently struggling with PlayStation 5 price due to costly parts well that's what happens when you just build a gaming piece the whoa my thing to scroll the way like crazy eli must StarLink plan was approved for australia oh I thought you were gonna talk about how nobody wanted to get Invidia pregnant that well that's oh that's where oh you really wanted to do that one didn't you I did that's pretty good but that's yeah we'll get into that later too yep yes it looks like their Valentine's Day present was that they pulled out yeah intro emergency intro bill heart bail sometimes I can't tell what we're talking all right let's jump right into in terms of XC Series GPUs there's another round of leeks and what I've heard is that we should expect something this year and it always happens as you get closer and closer to the release date the leeks start coming hard and heavy it is Valentine's Day after all hot and heavy excuse me sorry sorry someone seems almost in direct response to the previous leek it kind of does actually so Digital Trends has obtained parts of an internal presentation that's the thing about internal presentations if you never intend for anybody to see it why make a presentation well I know I know executives need powerpoints because they have the attention spans no idea what's going ok so Digital Trends has obtained parts of what is allegedly an internal presentation from Intel's data center group that gives the first real look at would Intel EXCI codename Arctic sound is capable of yes let's celebrate the Arctic before it's all gone before yeah the presentation details features that were current as of early 2019 so it appears as though until has at least three distinct cards in the works with the TTP's ranging from 75 watts all the way up to 500 watts which is the most we've ever seen from any manufacturer one of the hottest GPUs that I can remember was AMD's are 600 to clarify here for one second four people are like this it's gonna burn my house down it's not made for ya well probably not though but it's not really made for your house it requires a 48 volt power connector which is only provided in server power supplies I'm sure someone will find a way but this is not going to be like an average consumer card I want to know what the power draw of the Radeon HD 2900 was that thing was redonk a dog well you look at that the base card is 75 watt to 105 watt TDP it ranges it is single tile and these are probably going to be more of your average consumer cards then they step up to a dual tile GPU with a 300 watt TDP this will either be pretty high-end consumer or workstation level cards it's 50 watts higher than they already power-hungry Nvidia r-tx 20 atti and it's in their high power category then the last one that up to 500 watt it ranges from 400 to 500 watts it is a four tile card and it requires that 48 volt power connector that I mentioned earlier so is probably just kind of like a datacenter centric card okay so the closest we've ever seen in the past was apparently the geforce gtx titan z clocking in at i remember this because it broke the pci express like specification because it was 375 watts now have been some other kind of weird exceptions so the asus rog matrix GTX 580 Platinum that was a non reference card apparently could peak at 370 watts the GTX 590 was apparently around 365 with the power limiter on these are all dual Jeep I was just going to say so far though the the highest TDP single GPU card that I can see is the 580 this is I'm using the geeks 3d comm database I don't know can I do like a ctrl f3 asterisk asterisk is that gonna work no you sure you sure that won't work yeah why don't why don't placeholders work for this that sucks that would be kind of neat what about on the radio inside they've done a couple 300 water's so the two 90 to 90 X and the 295x2 yes it's been done before the r9 295x2 was apparently a 500 watt card crazy again dual GPU though so not quite unprecedented although although this seems to suggest that it's going to have multiple well maybe not Oh like how where do you draw the line between yeah a GPU and a tile because I mean I don't think anybody looks at something like a risin 3950 ax and goes oh well that's multiple CPUs we call it multiple CPU cores and GPUs in much the same way could have multiple cores on separate dice because that's exactly what AMD is doing on their CPUs they've actually got new chip 'lets so these are little like mini chips and highly related and they're all yeah they're all connected through like an i/o hub so if Intel is planning a design like that where do we draw the line between what constitutes a GPU and what constitutes like a GPU chip Latour would it just kill Intel to use the same terminology as everyone else could they just call it a chaplet I like Chiclets I like tile I you like tile I think tiles fine alright explain explain yourself I mean when you look at it can you know I think it just kind of looks like a tile like I don't think it's the worst thing ever looks like a tile I don't think it's that bad I think there has been much worse neat I think there's been much worse naming schemes including their own most recent fine fair was I gonna say hi I would almost look at it as the ones that don't have four tiles would be like cut-down versions and a four tile or chip 'let one would be one full unit don't call me a tile yeah that's fine tile Chiclets I guess yeah CIE for compatibility as well exciting not that there will be any Intel motherboards to plug it into no I mean I did that maybe by the time this thing actually arrives okay so with this in mind are you more or less excite for Intel graphics to enter the I am more excite you're more excited because previously I think we had only heard of the 75 version is that right yeah so I think we we were looking at that going okay this is gonna be like 10 50 10 50 TI level performance but would for 10 50 T is really excite you at 500 watts bearing in mind bearing in mind that the rumor mill is seeming to suggest that Nvidia is upcoming RT x 3000 series cards could be as much as 75% faster than the current one I'm not necessarily saying I am notably excited I'm saying I'm more excited more exciting because it seemed like they had like a I don't know what mid to low rent range laptop card ready to go and then they were just like yeah when we released the desktop version it's just gonna be the laptop one just on a card and that was really boring and now it's like hey h 500 watts it's not boring anymore all the power I don't know if it's gonna be good but it's not boring anymore and it might be one of those things where it's architected mainly for the data center so it ends up being like really great for machine learning something like that but on the desktop it actually ends up not making a ton of sense it could be not really aimed at consumers at all it could the laptop version one could be like it goes and laptops goes and cheap desktops then there could be a genuinely workstation come and we might end up seeing it in a lot of laptops because until we'll pull some kind of like Centrino type branding we're okay if you if you buy an Intel Wireless chip set and a motherboard chipset and a CPU and a graphics chipset you have this like Intel Intel a trail well Roe Lake you get a cool badge and make outs cheaper or something Fe with marketing and probably yeah usually that's the way it goes you don't really get a discount but you get like you know three dollars worth of MDF and if you buy enough of them then all of a sudden you can buy yourself a Super Bowl ad or whatever the case may be all right what else we go for we keep going oh yes as we're done that one yes you have new YouTube channel yes should we target and I have a new floatplane channel oh well just goes on floatplane as well yeah so yeah okay I am ready to talk about how it works on floatplane by the way we're uploading 4k videos to floatplane now nice okay so - tech tips so easy pause one week early access except when it isn't convenient okay okay so like if there's an embargoed product that's gonna go up at the same time though or if a sponsor is like yeah no you're not allowed to release it like early on that one we want it to go everywhere at once from Lego okay I guess or if for whatever reason we think that this item is time-sensitive because like I mean an exact example would be the kick proof TV I think we only did like a one day window on it or something like that because we were deeply concerned that it was gonna be yet another one of those stupid situations ah like the two terabytes of RAM opening chrome tabs one where that video was live on floatplane actually for about a month and then someone else Jonathan Morrison uploaded a video opening up as many chrome tabs as he could on his Mac and then two days later we upload the video doing it to YouTube and be their first like not really but sort of and also it doesn't matter where neither of us had the first ones to come up with that idea no anyway so if we think for whatever reason that it's time-sensitive then we might do a shorter window but we're gonna aim for a week tech quickie one week unless it's time-sensitive like oh it's you know a rundown of the latest Android OS or something that works yeah it's more like news oriented so that'll be pretty rare that'll be pretty rare but it'll happen from time to time tech linked simultaneous release I think sometimes it hits floatplane like half an hour earlier yeah so we'll upload it to there first but whoever's done processing basically wins the race so pressures on you guys p-channel super fun is back yeah the first upload in years years went up today well a week ago on floatplane so channel super fun is still gonna have a one-week window there would I'm not going to promise that we would never ever do a simultaneous release or a shorter window just because if there was some compelling reason then we might do it better we're targeting a one-week window just like LTT and then finally short circuit is the new channel so what makes short circuit different from LTT is the question that a lot of people have asked internally and a lot of our viewers have asked already seeing the short circuit teaser trailer sort of pilot episode that went up on the Linus tech tips channel earlier today as an extra release and then also the first official short circuit video that went up hours later I had actually intended for those to be like those days of art yeah so they went up like right after each other is sort of not what I hadn't planned but it's okay yeah you know what the team the team is dealing with it so I'm just leaving it be so we've had a lot of people ask well what exactly is the difference and the difference is that a lot of the time ltte has sort of become an unwieldy ship to steer well it has it's fine it has there's like you have a gray hair in your beard yeah it's weird yeah maybe pre-beard I know I know great anyway it has been that long ltte has become a little bit of a big ship to steer so when we decide to do a project we have to we have to take all these boxes like it has to be important enough to a broad enough slice of the community there has to be a title and a thumbnail that is going to keep up the momentum of the channel how to entice me you cannot afford on a 10 million subscriber channel you cannot afford to upload a week's worth of like nish you know videos about some you know weird phone with a keyboard on it that's actually the first video that went up on short circuit from some brand nobody's ever heard of when everybody else is uploading galaxy s 20 ultra videos that's the kind of thing that gets people to click you know not interested and quickly takes that momentum that you have and destroys it and when your momentum goes down it can take months to recover if you recover at all LT t took about seven months to fully recover from the dip that it was going through from January to April of 2019 so we are finally back on track and and I would not do even no matter how cool I think some product is I would not compromise the health of a channel and therefore the health of this company in order to make a video about it that is where short-circuit comes in so whether it's something that just doesn't have enough material in it for an l TT like one of the rules for an l TT video along with being something enough people are interested in thumbnail and title is that there has to be some kind of a learning outcome so even if it's some you know stupid little item that's like a dude a weird $2.00 adapter that I found on Aliexpress there always has to be some learning in the video so an example was we did a dim - m dot 2 adapter okay so I bought that just for an excuse to talk about the different standards that exist for m dot - because some of them run nvme some of them actually used the older SATA protocol and the drives themselves are not interchangeable and also because I wanted to talk about buying weird adapters on sites like eBay and Aliexpress and then being disappointed because they don't work exactly the way you expected them to yeah just looking at that product listing if I wasn't a really savvy shopper and I sometimes I play the dummy a little bit in the video I knew exactly what I was buying guys but if you if I were a non savvy shopper looking at that product would have looked like I installed this in a memory slot and then I was able to add an extra SSD to my system like yeah yeah but that's not how it works a memory interface is designed to have direct access to the DRAM dies that are on the module it's not designed to interface with a controller which is how any Drive whether it's nvme SATA SSD SATA hard drive that's that's how that's designed to be accessed and there was before that video went out there was genuinely like fake Oh oh man I can get like so much more RAM by doing this images I'm sure we're just meant to be troll Z fun but probably convinced a couple people so basically even though there was nothing really to the product there was supposed to be a learning outcome and so short circuit doesn't need that it can be just something we think is cool we don't have to necessarily do a ton of research and go digging to find all the ins and outs of it there's no pressure to have the greatest title or thumbnail it's just gonna be stuff we feel like is cool we want to cover and we're not going to do as much prep I have actually re-implemented the time budget system remember my time budgets are they like point systems no no it's just an amount of time like I just call it it's like having a budget in money but it's in time yeah okay so the time budget for short circuit is you've got like 45 minutes of prep as a writer 30 to 40 minutes to shoot it and then they've got like three hours so it's like refined unboxing it's based like know what you're getting into it's what - tech tips used to be yeah yeah so are you like Google that you bring the product to your desk you look it up you make sure you're not gonna say anything you realize the wall yeah and if you make a mistake then we just correct it we've actually already lloyd designed a fun little character who's gonna pop in and correct us and so like it's cool okay yeah it's just it's just designed to be more casual more fun it's it's what ltte used to be so back when and ix tek-tips was too cumbersome to make enough of them and liked it was such a long lead time that we couldn't hit you know an embargo with an NCI ex tech tips video just we only had like a week with the product and usually I needed it a week just to like finish my normal work and like get a script written up and so we were always late and stuff like that so LTT became the like quick and dirty just get it out there channel and now LTT has sort of become this much more elaborate production and short circuit is just going to be quick and dirty yeah and the chase exactly so James came up with the name for it actually a good name I like I'm surprised it wasn't taken I was kind of taken but not by anyone relevant so oh we just like there was like some podcast that had like four episodes from nine months ago and they hadn't uploaded anything since then they had like nine subscribers or something like it was like it's fine okay yeah now it already has a hundred thousand subs right yes so it is the first channel that we've ever started that had a hundred thousand subscribers before we uploaded a video that exact statement right there I want to lean on and utilize and is the actual reason why I brought this up I'm happy you're able to announce your channels and everything oh okay your motive yes okay does it have anything to do with you bailing on me tomorrow I don't figure it out well forget it I want you to build a computer case are we gonna figure it out Luke I want you to build are we gonna figure it out because it's Valentine's Day out of play buttons I'm afraid that you get from channels that you don't upload content to so I was working with John Oh honest I can't with a bass idea and then we grew it so we're thinking if you name the channels like right side panel one right side panel two board etc and then get enough people to subscribe to them you could build a case out of play buttons we could the case the community built I kind of like it awesome actually so cool it's one of my goodness very few ideas that I come up with that actually end up being pretty sweet yeah it's better than pizza warming PC that's for sure that got a lot of use ice I still want to revisit that concept like better than what you did if a lot of time is taken it would be awesome would be awesome you would need a pretty significant amount you just didn't do it the way that I had anticipated at all I didn't I was given I think because it was sitting there as an idea and then suddenly was like okay you have like six hours or something and I was like well I think I could have done something that made more sense maybe gala music people were so mad like for you for over a year yeah that was like the video that we people would point at and be like this channel is gone and the stupid thing is they post like like this channels gone to garbage like like where do and I'd be like okay how about something from the last three months they'd be like well that one was bad enough that it doesn't even matter if you've done food every day and it worked you know just sucked in every other one you know what two other videos of yours created a ton of community backlash back in the day but ultimately ended up performing really well what how to hide your yeah your materials yeah your materials we have felt so a lot of skin showing how is that doing great that literally like yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what we called the video we went totally non Adsense safe it's actually a little worse than I thought but yeah point 1 million views on that one yeah and people were so mad flow just like ratios even fine now and then the how to basics had no hated people were so that the like dislike ratio is great and there's one comment with a ton of up votes that's like I don't really get why people are there disliking this video I needed to install a graphics card and this was perfect like just few million views just a total noob who came in and like that was exactly what they were looking for but this is what I'm talking about yeah where there's a video we want to make that's a tech but if we were to upload it to TT it just wouldn't meet the community's expectations and sometimes that's not a quality expectation it's just a an expectation expectation like sorry this video just like wasn't for you was for someone else I actually thought that video was like pretty good I thought it was fine yeah it's got my gas got like 1.7 million views now because people do need to know how to install a graphic sorry I'm sorry you already know how and we'll upload it somewhere else next time but but yeah so that's uh that's that's kind of the update over here so what we're talking about like videos that work unexpectedly well oh yeah or poorly screen melter prank oh I know later really took probably half an hour from right hey I could do this too like pushing footage on to the whatever we use the batplane time I think it was a server and eight point six million views yep like one of the top performing videos of all time as Linus media group is the melting screen prank she's just soul crush or tear in his look young you are yeah Wow look how young you like yeah like a we bid a Zelda breath of the wild concept image that's my background oh yeah yeah star citizen poster in the background oh yeah how'd that work out for you well one of those one of those ended up being a success yeah yeah it's quite him 41 anyone oh boy 42 whatever squadron is who knows it's over now theoretical so not really to be honest anyways we can move forward that K this channel has gone to garbage I know right we're just gonna make a new one the new ones gonna rise up from the ashes alright we got I should let me come back and I'll do pizza here version 2 and everyone will be so hyped because they'll be like oh my god he took all this time to do it properly that'll just be cardboard again well what did you think I was working on I wasn't getting a metal workers apprenticeship building a video streaming site it's not I still don't know how to do this stuff actually working on computers less now this is probably worse oh man okay Oh in other in other news Tesla gave back the self-driving that they took away now I still maintain that I didn't like the precedent that they're set and a lot of people I think misunderstood my comments last week when I was talking about this like dystopian future where you don't own your cars and the features are like tied to a personal license so you just get in like what is essentially a blank car and how nice of a sound system you get or like you know whether the self-driving works or whatever else is dependent on like a license key that's embedded in your in your wrist and you just touch a spot on the dash like that that future that I was talking about I'm not jacked for it I loved it yeah people thought I was excited they're like - you're totally you're totally wrong and that's never gonna happen and like you socialists you know just want like I'm like what are you even talking about it was an expectation it was an excitement and or desire it's gonna happen yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm super sorry people look it's never gonna happen the horse and cart are gone there were people that said it was never gonna happen won't happen in the it definitely won't happen in the rural communities because you know they're gonna need they're gonna need gas stations out there - well turns out they eventually built gas stations they're like cars as a service is happening it's just a matter of when and the time line even Luke and I did not necessarily agree on the time line we both agree that it's gonna take a long time and yes it will take longer to reach different regions but what we were really talking about in all of this is the slippery slope that were on because neither of us is a huge fan I actually found out not that long ago about all of the telemetry data that the Chevy Volt sends back to Chevrolet to General Motors and the funny thing about it is the Volt doesn't even have any self-driving I didn't have adaptive cruise control and yet apparently it's sending a ton of telemetry data and as far as I can tell it doesn't even use like I could see it using things like you know topographical data like you know if I'm going up or down or whatever else to make sure that my you know cruise control would maintain the same speed or you know use my regenerative braking when I'm going downhill or whatever the case may be but as far as I can tell it's all reactive still instead of being instead of anticipating and I know that there are systems that do anticipate so yeah it's just sending a bunch of data so we were talking about this in the context of like this is a very dangerous slippery slope that we're on but it's happening because yes go you the viewer watching this show with your right to repair and your you know value of your personal privacy and all those things you might resist it but at the end of the day you are a tiny grain of sand on an infinite Beach and most consumers will take convenience over security and privacy every single time so we were talking about like what's happening and the concerns that we have not necessarily because we are fans of it yeah I mean if you need the proof of what I'm saying facebook.com/ do I actually do I need to say anything else I actually am not entirely sure where you're going with that it just exists what I'm driving okay and has billions of users that's my oh you mean words of people giving up their life yeah okay yeah yeah that's all there is to it yeah yeah I thought you're still talking more directly on cars no no no no no no I just mean like this is happening see I think there will be versions of it starting extremely soon I think last show when we disagreed on time I was more thinking when it was like ubiquitous oh yeah and even when it's ubiquitous there will still be people who own cars of course there will but it will be the exception not the rule anyway so in other news tesla gave back the self-driving that they removed so they did that this week it is unclear though at this time Tesla has a bit of a policy of just like not talking to press about stuff which is I should have added that to my list of things that I don't really like about Tesla so it's not clear if this is new standard operating procedure or if it was just a PR move because people were mad now there's also I don't know if this was fact or hearsay or whatnot but I read something over the weekend that was talking about how it might have just been like a like purchasing invoicing issue where they like thought the the owner and like timing with the owner selling the car and it made it sound like they meant the new owner didn't purchase it whatever but really they just thought the original owner didn't purchase it it was just like an error in entirety that is now fixed but I don't know yeah so it's possible the whole thing was just a weird misunderstanding but at least it generated a good discussion around the idea of licensed features and on the physical items that we buy and how this type of thing could evolve in the future because I have no doubt whatsoever that it absolutely will and nothing would prevent Tesla from changing their terms of service now that they've run into this situation to make it so that licensed features are separate from the actual hardware yeah I don't know necessarily why they would want to do that like if they would want to nerf people's resale value on their cars that seems just I don't have to to their users yeah reason I don't think they would want to do that right now but you never know what suspect you never know what the future holds and it could apply differently that was another thing that we talked about while we were going through our sort of dystopian vision for where things are going it might not apply necessarily to individual users but I could see them having a very different service term agreement like a different service agreement with things like fleets of cars where someone like a you know uh let's say Tesla did a moving van you know like a panel van and someone like you know budget were to buy a whole bunch of them are like u-haul or something like that had a fleet of Tesla you know box trucks if if Tesla were to license them with this autonomous feature maybe they would make them pay on like a monthly basis for the software upkeep that that is pretty typical of something like a commercial hardware agreement so it's it's pretty normal and well it's becoming normal Hardware as a service right like Cisco is doing this with a lot of their networking gear Meraki stuff yep whether it's a Cisco themselves as well oh there's an open things like their routers now come with a so you've got that you've got to buy the hardware in the first place and then you also have to sign up for a service agreement and you have to pay on a monthly basis in order to access not just the like certain features but even to have it work at all as my understand remember that was so weird in like well I think 2013 when they first started the Meraki stuff and then now like I don't I don't think people even bad now really now it's becoming the norm because the reality of it is it generates so much revenue for them that as long as you've got a product that you know that your customers are going to need anyway what you're effectively doing is you're finding a way to monetize that Hardware over and over and over and over again you're making so much money that you can dump it back into R&D which is supposed to be the value of a service agreement of like a like a subscription for you know ongoing software support that is hard for another competitor to come in and disrupt it so it's like it's in some ways just please don't take this quote out of context it's in some ways better for everyone because the consumer by paying so much more you just hold on I'm going somewhere with this the consumer by paying so much more is ultimately getting more development time back into the hardware that they purchased in a perfect world okay thank you awesome great performer so in a perfect world in a perfect world this fleet passing a box trucks that u-haul uses right we're talking a hypothetical future situation in a perfect world u-haul is effectively subsidizing Tesla's ongoing development of their autopilot features and then the consumer this is another thing that really does happen in the real world the consumer gets the cheapo one time payment version that is all so effectively subsidized by these large fleet purchases that have these ongoing service agreements in a perfect that does work out that way sometimes where the consumer version is subsidized by the enterprise version okay much much more owner an amount of that that goes into subsidized and consumer version is fairly debatable the amount of that that just goes into shareholders shareholders shareholders got to make money to oh my goodness oh my goodness oh man money no that makes sense I was actually gonna segue in a different way but today yeah Vesey but way we got the water bucket can I hold the bucket this time sure okay you're gonna get the shoe then well I have a water bucket in my lab let's do it it's Valentine's Day boys ago I knew there was something coming I'm like why is he doing this special day special day

leis is an unlimited cloud backup service from max pc's why do my clique learn what am I looking at yes for just six dollars a month they've had over thirty five billion files that they've restored to their users you can back up Doc's music photos videos drawings projects all of the data and you can store your files from everywhere downloading them directly or you can actually get them to send it to you by mail so you could purchase a restore via hard drive they will overnight FedEx it to you because like the internet can be slow you know how it is and you can even use their mobile apps to

data backup at a fixed price get a fully featured 15 day free trial at Backblaze calm / win we're gonna have that linked right there see it there right there and that's you can go play around with it start protecting yourself from potential bad times it's good stuff speaking of good stuff we had a long haul with private Internet access and we have decided to stick with them for a number of reasons number one is that the community was either positive about it or indifferent there were some that we're against it but it seems like the majority we're like okay yeah it seems fine whatever you guys go with or they were positive about it reason number two is that they've had some they've made some pretty good moves over the last little while in fact this isn't actually in the land show dock today but they open-source their Android app just yesterday so they continue to they continue to do good things that increase our confidence in them and from discussing this with both piña folks and cape folks they have a strong commitment to improve their practices not just at PIAA but also throughout the entire organization I have seen some people express concern that p IA will take some bad habits from cape but from talking to those guys Cape seems to be very interested in P ia and how they've done business while respecting their user's privacy to the greatest extent possible and are expecting to actually have it go the other way around adopting more of P IAS culture to the rest of their properties bottom line is I've been using PA for years now I'm still using PIAA so at the end of the day if all it is is an endorsement of what I trust and what I use I never cancelled my pay I a subscription I'm still using it and what's really cool about our relationship with PIAA is that we have no obligation whatsoever to say any talking points at all you'll notice that I am doing API a sponsored spot right now and I've gone completely off the rails talking about you know how they were acquired and all this stuff I have no talking points they do provide us with you know selling points of their product but at the end of the day if all I wanted to say about PIAA is it's great for making sure that if you're gonna download torrents your ISP is never going to send you a letter about the copyrighted material you're downloading I can do that I don't a lot of the a lot of the negativity around VPN sponsorship seems to stem from a couple of videos from a couple youtubers I respect a lot Tom Scott and Louis Rossman and the main problem that both of them highlighted welcome problems are a couple of things one is Schilling for products that you don't use or like in this case I've been using P ia for years many I like it um so no concerns there and number two was misrepresenting what VPNs do so P ia has absolutely no obligations built into our relationship with them for what we have to say about them and if you look at even some of the dedicated sponsored videos we've done with them like the one on how to get cheaper prices on flights that is something a VPN can do for you period you can save all the money you spent on a multi year subscription to P ia on a single flight purchase if you play your cards right and we made a whole video showing you guys how to do it so someone did that for getting to LT X actually saved a lot of money yeah you told me about that yeah so there it is we're sticking with P ia it's LM GGG / p I a win we're gonna have that link down below and you can expect to see us continuing to promote it we just wanted to take a very careful approach to this because again there's a lot of you know regardless of what I use in what I like there was a lot of potential for backlash in the community around a non careful VPN sponsorship and so we wanted to make sure that we were treading lightly I wanted to hear from them I wanted a commitment from them to how they were gonna handle things moving forward after the Cape acquisition I've got all those boxes ticked so we're gonna go ahead that's it and that's all hopefully they don't go the way of Blizzard and just completely lose their soul to their parent company but I really hope so too and from talking to both the PIAA guys and the parent company guys it seems like that's not the plan but I know that that rarely is the plan and just know guys that we won't hesitate to drop them if it turns out that it is going to be a problem and I'm sure I'm sure the Linus media group dudes and ladies will be listening to audience feedback if anything does set and seem to change I think from a external point of view the open sourcing of their Android app which I just looked up while you're talking about it is a really cool move yep I think they're moving in the right direction as far as I can tell Nick's here for something really exciting so we actually know he legitimately has reason to be that excited right now oh because we have a moose pricing structure oh for our shipping on LT t store.com yeah yes so let me just give you guys the summary here I'm just gonna bring up ltte store.com we've got USB type-c shirts the stealth hoodie the Hat the other more different hat the RAM shirt the processor sure we've got so much stuff water bottle actually any water bottles in stock right now Oh regular and stuff they're in stock apparently none of the special colors anyway got lots of good stuff including underwear and we've got lower shipping rates than ever before so in the US we now have $8.99 flat rate two to five day shipping within Canada we have $12.99 two to six day shipping and within the International everywhere else we have 1599 7 to 14 day shipping so the biggest change is honestly international because within Canada and the US actually the u.s. is better now as well for a lot of areas but International shipping with the old system that we were using was horrible so going to places like Europe could cost as much as 40 plus dollars but now we with our new deal we are able to and we're trying it out right now if it turns out that you know the majority of our international viewers are in like the middle of nowhere Mongolia or something like that and our costs on the shipping end up being a lot higher than we expected we might have to adjust it because we're setting these flat rates based on what we expect the average to be based on previous orders but all of a sudden a bunch of people in the middle of nowhere might be like hey I can afford D much now my Ramsay that some people that have been holding off will oh yeah order so we're gonna wait what we're gonna do is we're gonna stick with this for a bit that's cool that makes sense and then see what happens after the like wave of orders from people who just haven't been able to afford their LTT store comm merch is gone and then we'll take you know maybe another big sample after that and go okay now we can make any necessary adjustments so get your underwear now is what that means we're really yeah we are really excited about the new rates and we're going to keep trying to push the envelope but this is a really good starting point and should be a big improvement for a lot of people that's a pretty big improvement yeah we had people content and it that was like an untracked like that wasn't even like track shipping that was just the cheapest option and people would select it because of the cheapest option and then they'd message us after like a month be like yo where the F is my stuff maybe like well you did you did select like Camelback shipping like okay in fairness some of them didn't have an option but it's just like trust us we simply sent it all I say will be tracked getting from Canada to you okay to your country so we got some we got some free tech tips from some good friends do we shout them out do we not let's leave it out but we got some good tech tips from some good friends and we hope we have a better system for International shipping now and dad we need you guys to help us stress test it though so LTT store calm suckas stress test it hard stress test it hard Nick's got a KPI to hit this quarter come on guys let's go let's go now shirt well shirts have been a problem yeah but we're good on shirts how many shirts do we have like 2000 shirts coming in 20,000 it's fine it's fine everything's fine things fine so Hasani is apparently struggling with the PlayStation 5 price due to costly parts the original article is from bloomberg.com good and they report that the manufacturing costs for Sony's NEX PlayStation have reached around 450 dollars per unit fantastic Wow why do you think this is fantastic great why is it great who is it great for the last time my consoles I don't know if you remember this part in particular but usually not usually in the past before the last generation of consoles so chunking back a little bit consoles were often sold at a little bit of a loss yes and then they would try to make up money on peripherals and licensing licensing and they certainly make back plenty of the money on the peripherals and no 90 Canadian dollars for a pro controller is not reasonable carry on yeah I mean you need eight of the stupid things to play smash okay eight times nine that is seven hundred and twenty dollars that's more than the cost of a console by Allah go on yeah so with the most recent generation of consoles this was not true and there are games you can't even play with the pro controller like Mario Party so you have to go out and get extra joint cons so you've got a total of twelve different controllers if you want to be able to max out all your different games plus you can only charge the joy cons when they're actually on a switch so you better keep a couple extra joy Khan's on hand just in case a couple of them are charged because they actually take a while to charge its dogs yeah sorry go on yeah so with the most recent generation that was not a thing yes I believe I'm going back on really old information that was from quite a while ago that I don't remember and I haven't recently looked up but I believe average profit per console was around twenty dollars mm-hmm just not like insane or anything but they went from losing money per console to making money per console I'm not necessarily saying they're gonna not make money on this one but I think the performance jumped we had the last generation was a little bit disappointing for some people really I think that the reason the reason I'm saying that from a PC perspective okay so from a PC perspective not the website but you know the more hardcore they go with their hardware yeah the better the experience the PC people are going to get yeah but the more like a PC it's gonna be which is what's in it and how much it cost whatever who cares well that's easy for you to say some people struggle to afford a $400 console let alone a $500 console the current generation consoles are great to be completely honest oh okay so hold on a second are you saying that you don't see this as as much of a problem because using a last generation console like a PlayStation 4 is going to be a far more viable option for much longer we okay that's an interesting take direct current gen consoles can do a lot and they've talked a lot about the inter compatibility of the hardware and therefore the games interesting so you should still be able to be fine and they will probably drop in price so you might be more fine so tell me this would you expect to see Sony or Microsoft either of them employ a strategy where they launched an exclusive game to their new generation of consoles and then follow it up three or six months later with a version that is back ported for their last generation consoles with less graphical fidelity and that runs at a lower resolution would you be floored to see that like no I would not be floored to see that I would not be surprised I would be maybe a little bit surprised from Microsoft Microsoft has has had some dad's flashes and some good splashes lately I think their gaming side of things has been pretty positive with the community they've done some cool things they've brought games to multiple platforms I think their game pass is going quite well kind of stuff I think they're gonna try to hold on to that positive communication at least within that segment of that company but I think they could keep that pretty positive they could say like look it's coming it's a PlayStation 5 game or it's an Xbox Series X game and it needs more development to optimize it for the older hardware I don't yeah I don't think that would go over too poorly as long as it was coming eventually yeah they set a date there like six months whatever and we're working and even then that doesn't seem yeah I don't think that would go over too poorly because to me so there's such a huge backlog of amazing game so I'm gonna pitch something to you so there so you're imagining then more of like more of like a rolling upgrade well cuz okay and I want to throw one more point in here cuz they are a lot more like computers so I could literally see it just being where the previous gen are just cheaper computers hmm I'm literally right now they're pretty darn close there's a limit to how cheap you can make a compute so don't expect them to ever read like don't expect a PlayStation 4 to ever be $1.99 like it's just it has to have a power supply it's kind of like how hard drives can never get below $40 you have to have the house and a motor and like there's just bare components that you need you can't you can't do a 50 dollar PlayStation 4 it's not feasible just the flat the plastics and the screws and the labor involved in assembling it like this it might get pretty low and you might get really really really cost beneficial bundles and things like that yes you make it you might get software thrown in for example but that's really interesting so if we were to see okay look we've got these new generation consoles but we're gonna have games that are available concurrently I mean we've seen that before oh yeah Zelda Twilight Princess was available for both the Wii and the GameCube for example that's the wild one will you breath of the wild it's a naturally it's fairly standard for it to happen at the beginning of a new consoles life cycle but are you just expecting a longer rolls oh yeah I have no idea how long I've no idea this is gonna be a thing but I suspect a longer roll over people are saying ps4 than $1.99 but okay yes US dollars sorry I was thinking with my Canadian brain for a second right there and also that's not particularly sustainable just because it's a promo price doesn't mean that it could be a sale something yeah because remember to guys that Hardware has also been around for yeah something like that but yeah my point was just that there is a limit to how low you can go so anyway the biggest problems is apparently oh god it was the end of 2013 but it was technically 2013 okay so the biggest problems are apparently D Ram and mint both of which are in high demand from the smartphone market and they're ramped up to 5th gen devices from smartphone ramped up to 50 I don't know what 5th gen devices are talking about but it is expected that both be around and and are gonna go up in price this year Sony's CFO touched on this in an earnings briefing earlier this month saying we must keep playstation fives bill of materials under our control I don't know how they expect to control that oh I need to take this this is the technician for the UPS that there in the server room oh do you want to go through the publishers pull out of NVIDIA GeForce now while I go okay so I'm actually gonna just finish off the current one that were that we're on they did say that they need to keep the PlayStation fives bill of materials under our control I think he just said that but he also stated that the coronavirus while it has not yet impacted the PS 5s production definitely could and the company has yet to decide how many PS 5s they're actually going to produce in the first year which could affect their costs because buy more materials you get a cheaper sorry moving forward to Linus's intro joke to the LAN show publishers pull out of NVIDIA GeForce now NVIDIA GeForce now officially launched last week but several big-name companies have pulled out of supporting the platform now it was added to world Warcraft Terms of Service a while ago that you can't play games through you can't play Wow through this type of a service I know that cuz I was trying to figure out why the heck I was banned and that wasn't it obviously but I saw this coming it does obviously reduce the attractiveness of the platform because Blizzard Capcom EA Konami remedy Rockstar Square Enix games have all bailed out apparently and they they it's not it's so you can play games that you own on another platform through GeForce now so they are like disallowing that to happen which I really don't think Nvidia would go against so they should be blocking it an Nvidia rep said we hope to work together with Activision Blizzard to re-enable these games and more in the future you shouldn't expect Activision this is an inserted part of the quote Activision Blizzard games to magically reappear after a few days or even a few weeks so no time soon but potentially in the future Nvidia didn't want to discuss revenue sharing deals it may or may not have with publishers but of course these decisions will have been made by publishers with an eye on the dollar this whole thing is rather odd I haven't seen g-force now having the hugest audience at least in the short term so I think this is kind of one of those things where all these companies stepped back but I haven't closed communication and they probably just want a piece of the pie it's interesting because you already own the game or pay for the game actively but now you're paying a different service to be able to play the game elsewhere and those companies probably want to cut of that even though you've already bought the game it's just it's a it's a funky funky space right now Elon Musk's StarLink plan approved for Australia the Australian Communications and Media Authority or ACMA ACMA is the latest agency to approve Elon Musk plan to send thousands or hundreds in this case of satellites into space to deliver internet connections across the globe the satellites won't require geostationary orbits we've talked about this before because of the sheer scale of the deployment so they can be much closer to the ground than traditional satellites as close as one 105th the altitude of traditional geostationary orbits I we've talked about a star length multiple times on the show before you need such agency approval to in order to install the client-side receivers at your house okay that makes sense the plan will cost roughly 10 billion US dollars or more to complete but this is about one fifth of the cost of Australia's homegrown National Broadband Network which sucks Australian Internet is terrible every every time I bring this up on the wine-shop I get at least one person be like I live in Australia and I have a pretty good internet connection but I know it's it's it's bad man I'm sorry for you your net connection probably sucks or you pay way too much for it I have that it's so bad we try to get floatplane them to Australia and it's just horrible we've had to do it's it's so much better now it's way way way better now because of like things we've done in partnerships we've made and like tons of work that's gone into it but like when we were first starting off it was so hard to get flow playing video like high quality good bandwidth to Australia and like there's a bunch of Australians that were on the vine effectives form team I'm just talking to them but their issues their internet it felt like you just went 10 to 15 years in the past like it's so rough so it's cool that hopefully they can try to alleviate these issues and I understand there's like reasonable situations that got them to they're like I don't know but I also know people that live in New Zealand and they have way better internet so I don't know man I just it sucks I feel bad to you so hopefully this helps in any way at all latency while worse than hard wired Internet so yeah it's still better than geostationary satellite connection it's 25 to 35 milliseconds for Starlin rather than 600 milliseconds or even the theoretical best of 477 milliseconds so this will more help people that live outside of like Sydney like people that live like way out there Australia's actually gigantic if you if you like scale if you move it on one of those maps that like scales it properly to other places on the planet it's huge and plenty of people live not in those very centralized cities so it's good it's good excited about that hopefully it helps some people there get better more stable faster internet we already talked about Tesla giving back the self-driving thing there isn't a ton of news here as we talked earlier they don't do a ton of public facing stuff so unless it's like you know the Elon himself essential phone is essentially dead essential has announced its closure after just five years of business they released the essential phone they were working on a handset called Jem but there is apparently no clear path forward to deliver it which is a little rough the essential phone is going to be the last and only thing they've really done it will no longer receive any official updates but essential has released its software on github we have a link to it now apparently it is already high and so developers can keep hacking which is actually very cool I guess sad that they're gone but that's a nice way to exit if they're gonna have to exit give me one quick second okay sorry we're good to do oh sorry I'm just flying through topics cuz there's no back and forth discussion steam labs experiment zero zero eight this is actually pretty cool uses machine learning to help decide what to play next it chooses three games based on what you already own and presents you with micro trailers for each if you don't like your options you can re-roll for a new selection assuming you have enough games in your inventory and I love how they have to give you trailers for games in your inventory because I think a lot of people are in a situation like me I think I have close to like 450 something games on on Steam and a huge portion of that is just Humble Bundle stuff that I have never launched and I've had for so long so I think it's actually pretty cool that they have something like this coming I'm gonna open the link for it and try to get it on screen in a moment you have to sign it I see it our server room is just super cramped I'm just gonna hang up those forums so you can see the he needs to get to the back of the UPS which is like oh not trivial yeah it's not gonna be great it's a good thing he's not as tall I can smell that oh yeah when the doors open like it was was on fire yeah geez what a surprise is still so pungent okay so for the actual steam page you had to be logged in so I found it on the verge just give me a quick second I'm hoping there's a screenshot or something but I just see ads I see so many ads it's still okay there's a there's a I don't know some Jeep or something more ads or ads we're ads oh that's it that's the hole okay uh we're gonna leave again let me see [ __ ] a different article I'm hoping someone has a screenshot maybe they've just only talked about it so far jeez I like the concept though I would like to be able to okay so that's all you really get to see that makes sense so it's just a post about the article recommended gameplay next there we go that's what I wanted to see show in library tags on it okay not too crazy but I like the concept because sometimes you can look at a Steam library of hundreds of games many of which you've never played before and be like I have nothing to play I have nothing to do so it's cool that it kind of siphons all of that down to three it just goes like pick one of these and you can reroll it if you really want to that might actually get me to play some of those games which is cool I'm back so um nice every time I went through a lot of them cool so why don't I give an update on what's happening with our burning server and sure okay cool so basically what happened was I'm not gonna name any names but it was one of our camera operators who's been with us for a very long time he already messaged me he apologized and he had no way of knowing so he accidentally plugged a very high wattage filming light how am I wanted a thousand watts I already knew that it just sounds cool yeah into so I have an extension cord that runs out of the server room and then it's just coiled on a hook on the wall right outside the server room and the reason that that's there is because it's meant to be in the event of a power outage it's meant to be a quick and fast way without going and finding the key and unlocking the server room to get power to something in an emergency lighting emergence like whoever's working on today's video plug your workstation into this before you're at your UPS dies so that you can get today's video out so we can everyone else can go home we'll regroup tomorrow we'll come back to the office like this has happened so we've got both a network cable that plugged directly into the switch cool and a power cable that's plugged directly into the UPS therefore such situations we've always the most important machine exactly we've also used the power cord for situations like remember and scrapyard wars 3 the one with Austin to dirty power yeah ok so we've also used it in situations where like a lower quality computer power supply might have computer stability issues running off our admittedly not great power here in the building if we plug it directly into the UPS we've actually gotten more stable overclocking for example so it's just it's handy to have it yeah they flood the light into it because we had an HVAC technician coming to look at one of our a/c units in the server room which was leaking and he needed a light so they plugged in this thousand watt filming light and it started arcing and smoking oh ok so what happened at that point was everything shut down because the PS was arcing and I pulled all the units out and I realize the power units so it has four power units so that's a total of 1200 kilo volt amps or however they rate them yeah 12,000 volt amps I think yeah so did I say 12,000 kilo volt amps or you know 12,000 volt amps so that's how we have ours this one can go up to 18,000 so you can do 6 power modules and then it also has the rest of the Bay's filled up with battery modules so I had some people on Twitter suggest that the batteries were old and that caused the problem but the batteries were not the issue yeah we should probably replace our batteries it has been about three and a half years four years and lead acid batteries do have a limited shelf life so yeah it's probably time to replace those batteries but that was not the problem so I pulled out the power modules and I realized one of them smelled of burnt electronics so I thought okay maybe we fried one of the power modules by just sucking a thousand watts from it Oh suddenly unexpectedly now that still shouldn't happen over current protection should still like this is this is literally it was either 17 or 19 thousand Canadian dollars that we paid for this UPS I would still expect it to have basic protections on it that would prevent an overcurrent event from causing it to light on fire or spark or whatever the case may be so anyway I pulled that power module and I went well we're still well below the remaining nine thousand volt amps of capacity that these three power modules remaining none of them smelled would have so let's give it a shot let's fire it back up I fired it back up and it started sparking in the back of the cabinet so I wasn't that close to it the first time it was sparking I was like upstairs okay I'm running to get me so this time I was right there and I could tell that the arcing was coming from the back of the cabinet rather than the power modules that were inserted and I hit the main cutoff so we actually have like a 208 volt input that that goes in and then the UPS is hardwired into that so I hit the main cutoff for it and then it kept sizzling and the sound of fire basically so when I say crackling I don't mean spark crackling I mean like like bubbling plastic oh boy okay so my expectation now is that this unit is super fried and before any of this happened the front of the unit was still reading just like okay so that was what led me to believe that it might be okay to so turn it back on after you pulled one out yes I got what was like burning it still said okay it's oh yeah it still said okay so I powered it back up with the three with the three modules instead of with before knowing that and it actually ran for like tens of minutes okay like I got that everyone got back to work and then and I were still in there I happened to be here again Oh when it went and so it was it was on fire for some period of time seconds like I had long enough to go get the fire extinguisher that is right outside that room and stand there like really didn't want to loved it in the server if I could have played it in anyway so I'm like standing there with just fire to my shirt please please let me not have to use like you can't just blow on it like it's electrical fire potentially mind you I've already cut the electricity so I don't know if the rules change at that point but generally not sure either either way oh there I did not I did not want to press the button in the server yeah I fortunately didn't have to it went out on its own but my take on this is I am out of warranty so I've been totally upfront with eaton about what the situation is I didn't buy an extended service plan or anything like that but I was like so so on the one hand I am out of warranty on the other hand under no circumstances should a product designed for power protection light on fire so after that fire I actually did or while it was sorry while it was arcing before I had gotten the fire extinguisher I managed to read some gibberish off of the display on the front so that was the first time they'd ever actually knew anything was wrong when it was literally on fire and it didn't know anything was wrong I don't think I think it was just spitting random like it was like random special characters going across so so basically my thing with them has been like look why this help me look I know I'm out of warranty but also this thing failed in such a spectacular dangerous catastrophic burn the building failure is like a little bit of a special case so anyway to their credit this happened yesterday afternoon and they have a technician here right now in our very cramped and uncomfortable so he's like from yeah yeah so we have an Eaton technician here in the building so I mean really I don't define a company's quality based on necessarily the performance of one individual product we don't have you know a data center full of Eaton power input we have one unit we have a sample size of literally one yeah so really it's gonna come down to how they deal with this and on the one hand yeah I'm me and you might think I would get special attention and from someone like a consumer electronics brand that is quite often the case but I really don't think these guys knew me from Adams so we're gonna see how it goes it does seem as though they are taking it seriously just from a this thing should not have been on fire perspective we need to know what happened I think that's fair I think that's fair the difference between like a warranty on your car and your car just randomly exploding and the technician is not here to fix it he has no he has no capability to fix it right now he's here to determine exactly what could have possibly happened for this - okay oh do you think it's like I don't think you could fix it this is like a replace situation right it depends I mean this is a fairly modular serviceable product so like the housing might be okay yeah but I think that they would probably end up replacing significant internal components and if they ultimately came to me and we're like okay look you're out of warranty but we can offer you a deal on a refurbishment of this unit or you know something that would be fine honestly it would be kind of preferable to me because I don't know if you remember this but in order to get that unit in there we actually used to have a problem through the wall we would have to rip open the wall yeah in order to get it out or another one in I hate our server room so much people are like but hold on yeah great vlog content Oh tons I don't even know if I could handle it great views I just rather not have a camera pointed at that guy's looking for you oh okay yep BRB yep I think he should just rip the wall down anyways that's my theory to be honest also I saw it tons of people in chat calling on for fire pole I agree that would probably stop that from happening again for sure that's how science works I honestly don't have a ton of content left we're slightly over show duration at this point and I blew through a ton of the more boring topics I can go into Puerto Rico's government fished out of tube fish with a pH out of 2.6 million dollars I don't know if that is being registered in US dollars yes it is okay two points million US dollars in a fishing operation industrial development companies what a name finance director don't know how to set your name but I'm gonna say his last name Rivera says the government agency transferred the money on January 17th after receiving an email that alleged a change to a banking account tied to remittance payments okay this seems like it may have been a targeted spearfishing attack executive director Manuel Laboy oh man I hope I didn't say that wrong declined to say how officials learned about the scam or whether anyone has been dismissed as a result and I have no real details outside of that so it sucks that Puerto Rico got fished for so much freaking money it's always kind of epic in a way when governments have stuff like fishing happen to them because it's interesting because you always you always kind of hope I guess I was gonna say expect and then I was like modern year you always hope that they have like tighter locks on things like that but apparently sometimes 2.6 million dollars just get scooped sent where it's not supposed to be so who knows Backblaze harddrive stats for 2019 have been released these have been very controversial over the years so it's you know it's interesting but take it with a little bit of a grain of salt they have a little bit of an interesting use case which is probably not what you're doing but it's it's interesting regardless let me jump over okay annualized failure rate none of those look way too insane but you can definitely see some outliers and I believe this was detailed in our document as well there is something to be said here for the actual amount of drives so I wouldn't pay way too much attention to purely the just failures column some kind of interesting stuff is that like this one had zero but there's also only 99 of them so you kind of have to weigh and balance that stuff properly oh my the one that had sorry I'm a little sick the one that had over a thousand failures also had like over thirty seven thousand and four drives which is pretty fantastic but it was a failure count of three point three two percent which is a little higher than I would hope but I believe they addressed this directly yeah the Seagate twelve terabyte st twelve thousand NM zero zero zero seven our experience and double the AFR of every other drive type but see Gates own four terabyte it's similar to drive Backblaze previously reported on these failures and began aggressively moving to the twelve thousand series 12,000 nm 0:08 model that fixed the issue after working with Seagate to identify the root cause I do wonder sometimes like on the consumer side of things it's really hard to tell because most consumers aren't going to report failures and even if they do report failures you're gonna have really bad sample sizes and all the kind of stuff you do internal testing you do what you can but when it comes down to massive companies and especially a company like Backblaze who is gonna be publicly posting these numbers I suspect that's where you get a lot of your work done on improving stuff like failure rates so that's cool annualized failure rate or the acronym I said previously AFR for 2019 has increased sharply across 75% of the models in use which this is one of the things that I said like sometimes Backblaze these numbers are scrutinized quite heavily because why would 75% of the models all have sharply increasing AFR's who knows maybe something else was going on maybe there's temperature changes in the data center I have no idea I can make no claims but they're very interesting numbers to look into I actually enjoyed quite a lot but just take it with a little bit of a grain of salt it is not the same scenario or your computer will be in back at home wholly flippy phones Batman Motorola and Samsung boast both release folding phones this week they're basically the same size what do you guys think about flip phones I'm gonna take a moment to do a straw poll and then I'm probably just gonna end the stream because I actually want to see what's going on over there so I'm gonna talk about flipping phones and what I mean by that is if it like flips in a vertical oh if it flips on the x-axis and then folding phones if they flip on the y-axis so I'm gonna just say regular phones flipping phones or folding phones which one do you like the most most flipping phones folding phones and standard phones improve spam prevention even though people will find a way okay I'm posting this in floatplane first because I love you guys then twitch because you know og Wine Show stuff and then YouTube because I didn't actually have your lake up and I don't know why I think I like full D phones there's also sliders that are becoming more popular these days which is kind of interesting sorry my voice is kind of taking off right now I think I've been talking for a little bit too long despite being sick ok results let's check into it we're not gonna leave a ton of time for this we're gonna see those results come in live standard phones is 65% of the audience but at fairly even amounts 18 19 % fluctuating folding phones and flipping phones are holding roughly the same amount of the audience Oh folding phones are starting to take over yeah I'm not too surprised so just in case someone missed that explainer basically this would be a standard phone if this phone folded in half like down this way that would be a flipping phone if this phone folded in half kind of this way like a book that would be a folding phone I lost track of it myself for a second but I'm not yeah I'm not too surprised by these these results there's actually more people into folding and flipping phones that I personally expected but I think that's kind of cool because differentiation in that market is it's fantastic I would probably have to go with standard or folding phones I actually really used to like old slider phones just because they were extremely satisfying to use not because I would want to use one long-term and not what because I would want to use one with modern apps and things like that but yeah one sec why this I'm gonna end the show he's gone anyways thanks for tuning in this week maybe I'll do Super chats how do I do that here we go I'm gonna do super Jets I actually remembered it was close someone said Dennis please be my Valentine but he's felt Dennis wrong so I don't know man okay I can't answer that question please keep the server videos coming love them I'm sure they will I'm sure there will be a follow-up to the the battery backup on fire thing free Google my money thank you very much where do you see virtual reality in 1 5 or 10 years do you think there will be a hard limit on the no on the capabilities of the technology from je Trudeau which is I'm assuming not our Prime Minister virtual reality in one year I would see heightened adoption but no extremely major changes in my opinion five years I would see some amount of major changes probably lighter weight smaller headsets probably slightly definitely increased adoption rates I think it was like two years ago ish that I said I think we were five years out from it being a more acceptable thing for the average consumer so hopefully if my time is right we've got about three more years but we'll see and then in ten years I think it will be kind of a hybrid of virtual and oh man what is it called a virtual and augmented reality I think the headsets will be significantly smaller if they're not just glasses there might be more I mean ten years from now that might not be far enough but stuff like neural link or neural link whatever Elon Musk's thing is could tie into this stuff to make a much more interesting setups but that might be more than ten years out I don't know may request the next tech link you host Linus you call the quick fix bits the heebie-jeebies people be Bulls I have no idea he's not gonna see this I think so probably not can we get some sweet LTT athletic wear I suspect that might be coming down the line eventually but I literally know nothing so I'm not sure subject LT tees short-circuit or don't I'm a super chat not your Valentine state good call but you could subscribe you could do that right now if you wanted to Congrats on the new channel thank you love you dudes have a Valentine's Day thank you very much Linus I'm a weirdo too and have a VR slash htpc in the living room what keyboard slash remote do you use I've seen that little thing in your vids I don't that's not what he uses at home I don't know what he uses at home but that is not it I don't believe just got my 10 mil shirt you all rock with Channel super fun back what is the next big prank oh geez we'll probably have to see how well Sean super fun does you should melt down a play button and use it in the PC and make another sketchy heatsink that's awesome hold on oh you guys can see my thing let's do that is there anything funky on the start menu no we're good okay sounds cool moving on heatsink from play button I look I wonder how many things they could make out of play buttons and get Alex in on this he's probably gonna be like nothing other than heatsink because it's a stupid idea but whatever that's fine I'll try I really enjoyed the beats release video thanks man Thank You Austin tanner partner with my career channel super fun that would be epic he's awesome if someone has an idea for an episode how could they get in contact with summer show that information I there's I mean there's lots of Twitter accounts for people at the company almost everyone has a public Twitter account you just tweet them or there's a few different emails that are pretty easy to find fun fact the cyber truck would be illegal anywhere that isn't USA because of pedestrian safety regulations not being followed in the design okay what are the odds of future accounting position one random fun fact about that there are cars that are on the road in countries that would be illegal if that car was modified into that state by the owner but because it was pre-approved by the country for the manufacturer it is able to be sold in its current state so who knows maybe the country will just be like yeah that's fine bring back the matching shirts that was in a high-five it was a tri-five yeah I wasn't really sure what he was going for to be honest so I just slapped it - when you going to be on hot ones I don't know possibly never nope this person's not here for me okay I'm just going through a bunch of these are the Mel's pads coming along for the Ltd store I know literally no LTT store things but I know the one that we have that's an Ltd mouse pad is pretty sweet have really really no information for you I'm just finishing off super Janet okay cool I have a very small update for the people okay it's dead alright so it was a full replacement super dead so here I actually have a great picture he did manage to get at the back of it because he's some kind of ninja got a reef oh you should refocus and it might be a bit of a dark picture but that's not the main issue yeah I think that's pretty self-explanatory actually yeah giant dark spot on green PCB so they're gonna get back to me on Monday with what they can or cannot do for me and yeah hopefully he says usually that kind of an issue is caused by a loose connection and he thought it looked like there was no nut on this connector but I think it was just because he was looking at the shot and it wasn't bright enough with that one yeah so this one there's different ways to hook it up depending on whether you have single or three-phase power and what the input voltage is and stuff like that if I recall correctly so not necessarily every one of these I believe they're called bus lines not every one of them would have a connector on it but I know they're there is definitely a nut on there and it looks like a washer as well so how's that let's give em installation issue or a you installation well we had it installed but we had it installed professionally we didn't do it ourselves okay is there a warranty on that service if there is we would be passed it okay because it's been like three and a half years one last Super chat I'm 15 just bought a server what should I do with it ah plex file server safe place to store your files minecraft own cloud okay honestly minecraft could be a good one and all of those thanks for tuning in guys see you again next week same bat-time sit back down bye thanks for closing out the show for me yeah and you just had kind of had to deal with that we were like super out of dock that holds well I kind of wasn't expecting you to keep going actually I thought you would just say that I tried to yell at you like I'm gonna I know yeah yeah well I did a straw poll on and you actually didn't lose any life viewers but people watching oh that's cool so I'm happy because it was probably super boring
