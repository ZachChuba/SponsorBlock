it's been a crazy two weeks since I uploaded my last video here's why mr. beast is a genius the video has hit over 1.8 million views my channel has grown by pretty much 30,000 subscribers and I've just been casually chatting to mr. beast on Twitter as you do it was clear that you guys enjoyed this video but I got a lot of comments asking me to cover mr. beasts early beginnings and how he first gained momentum I suppose it's easy to look at the things he's doing now to grow his channel but what about when he was just a kid in his bedroom with a small gaming channel so today we're going to travel back in time before the money and crazy stunts to see how mr. beast really made his name stay tuned because this is going to be another YouTube masterclass from Jimmy Donaldson just 10,000 subscribers I mean I think I have over 450 videos on this channel I am I put a lot of time to the channel and I'm glad people are enjoying my content I'm glad people are liking my videos I want to start out with a quick summary of mr. VCG journey then I'll break down three more lessons we can take on board a small creators to help us grow our own channels Jimmy Donaldson started out his YouTube career by uploading gaming videos mainly minecraft and Call of Duty inspired by the likes of ah da and PewDiePie he had high hopes of becoming a game and commentary channel he uploaded hundreds of videos but had very limited growth he then started to shift his focus and everything started to change one of his first successful videos was a video talking about how much beauty point makes this was follow along by many other YouTube related videos where Jimmy began commenting on the platform as a whole and other large creators then came the now delete its worst intros the series where mr. beast reacted to cringey intros from other small youtubers leave a comment below if you remember those this momentum carried through into his first videos that really hit the big time when mr. beast started getting behind the camera himself showing his real personality the viewers came in their millions the biggest breakthrough during this period is the infamous counting to 100,000 video which gained millions of views in a matter of days propelling his name to the forefront of YouTube then came the money which mr. beasts used to make even more crazy videos and the rest is history about 28 million subscribers today it's hard to believe mr. beast started out his channel by making like this pretty cool isn't it this is the Bluebird just baby once he can go Mingo I thought was pretty close that is pretty cool so what were the key things mr. beast did to blow up his channel when he had under 100 thousand subscribers what concepts are still relevant to small youtubers today the first thing mr. beast did the really Spector's growth on YouTube was he took the focus away from himself now this may seem counterintuitive so let me explain when Jimmy started on YouTube he was just another upcoming gamer doing commentary videos people don't care about the 1,000 small youtuber making minecraft videos like everyone else think about it if you see a Minecraft video in your feed from another youtuber who you don't know yet what is compelling you to click on it it was when he first started making videos on trending topics and other large youtubers that he really started to see his first traction he realized that to be quite honest people didn't care about who he was back then he had to talk about topics people did care about first this is quite commonly called trend jacking within the YouTube community where you make videos about a trending topic or something that is searched a lot you piggyback on that subject and build an audience off the back of it now some people friend up on this and say you should only make content you want to make before anything else and I think this should be always the end goal with YouTube but in my opinion it's kind of like saying a business should make products they want and not what the market wants when starting on YouTube it is so important to realize that people don't care about you and you're small it's harsh but true mr. beast realizing this very early on had this content reach new audiences so when he did start making videos about himself and his personality he had a viewer base already there so I recommend seeing what's trending within your niche and seeing where you can add value and input for example if you're a small gaming youtuber uploading a video called my new record killin fortnight probably won't get much traction considering hundreds of people would have made a video similar to this before and the focus on the video is on you as a gamer but making a video called how to get high killer games in fortnight using the lightsaber would have a much better chance of being discovered as you were bringing value and appealing to new audiences while also addressing a trending topic the newly added lightsabers in fortnight this is just an example but this shift in folk is so important to keep in mind okay now on to lesson two from mr. B's early beginnings on YouTube and that is to experiment and innovate with your content when people hear the word innovate they usually think of eat almost score Steve Jobs not some kid from North Carolina who taped himself together with toilet paper but hear me out when you consider how much content is being posted on YouTube every single day it's hard for upcoming youtubers to create something new in fact let's be honest have YouTube these days is just rinsing and repeating what already works and there's nothing wrong with that but if you can innovate and bring something out that's completely fresh and exciting to viewers it's a recipe for success after building a base of an audience for himself mr. Bies began experimenting with his content and eventually he struck gold his crazy challenges were something no-one on the platform had seen before whether it be counting to 100,000 watching every day bro for 10 hours straight or saying PewDiePie's name 100,000 times these videos were crazy and don't like when you saw them the first time you probably said why would anyone watch that and then you proceeded to click right on it I know I did not to mention Jimmy timed these challenges pretty well as it was during a period where YouTube had started promoting videos based on the amount of watch time they were getting and what better way to get watch time up then to create a marathon stream you see a lot of small youtubers look at what other big youtubers are making in the space and just try to replicate it however experimenting with new ideas and innovating is exactly what you need to strike gold it's on a much smaller scale than mr. beast but when I made my first youtuber analysis video in 2017 there was nobody really doing anything like it in fact I spent 20 hours making my Peter McKinnon video and then considered not posting at at all as I didn't think it would do well if then went out to hit over 300,000 views in its first few months on YouTube which I know it's still nothing compared to mr. beast but for a channel that only had a few thousand subscribers at the time I was pretty happy with that mr. beast has never been afraid to experiment with his content sometimes it doesn't work but you only need to get it right once to have a viral video on your hands to stand out on YouTube you sometimes need to go against the grain I suppose the key takeaway here is to never be afraid to experiment with your content I just want to take a moment to talk about the music in the background in this video a lot of creators make the mistake of using copyrighted songs in their videos I've been hurt by this before when I use songs that I thought weren't operated until this came up on my screen I was using free songs from YouTube but I found it very hard to find what I wanted and was never really sure if they were copyright free then I found for you guys thank you for listening to that plug and now back to the video the last lesson from Jimmy Starr on YouTube is a simple one he started with what he had simple as that so many upcoming creators put off making content for a variety of different reasons myself included but one of the main things I hear is I don't have this camera I don't have these skills this editing software and so on and so on I've definitely been guilty of this myself in the past however mr. beast is living proof that good things don't come to those who wait on YouTube they come to those who start and persist if you look at the content mr. B started with and compared to where he's at now it's literally a world apart and judging by his latest tweet it's only gonna get even better the point is he would have never got to the point he is now if he had waited around until he got a new camera or a better microphone if you want to start a YouTube channel in 2020 just put our content yes it might not be to the level you want at the start but waiting around for the perfect moment when you have X Y or Z doesn't work listen to the man himself talk about his attitude towards the subject with kc9 stuff and then I got an iPhone which then because I had a Windows Phone which only recorded like 480 I couldn't record with that so once I got iPhone after over four years of like all this stuff then I started recording myself and I moved a little away from gaming and then I was able to buy a camera and but I got like 200,000 subscribers with like an iPhone 5 recording in 30fps 720p you hear that and yeah and that's why like I tell people all the time start a channel like I can't afford it and they have like literally like the new iPhone and people used to always complain about the quality and I was like okay well I can't do anything I need my next paycheck to buy something so that wraps up part 2 of the mr. beast analysis on my channel as a quick recap these are the three things I feel we can learn from Jimmy tap grow our own channels number one if your current content isn't working try change the focus of the video and experiment with trend jacking number two try bring something new to YouTube it doesn't need to be as crazy as mr. beasts marathon streams just make sure you're not rinsing and repeating what everyone else is doing and number three start with what you have if all you have is your mobile phone and an old laptop start with that there's no point waiting around when YouTube gets more competitive every year I can't put into words how grateful I am for the support I got in the first mr. beast video thanks for all the comments and likes it really means the world to me it's funny I set alight goal of 500 and right now the video is on about 140,000 and I should probably start making bigger goals so with that said I'm gonna set it like goal of 5,000 for this video I don't get too carried away but I'm sure we can hit that number thanks again for watching and if you're looking for great music for your videos while simultaneously supporting my channel check out the link to epidemics and below thanks once again for watching and as always I'll see you at the top
