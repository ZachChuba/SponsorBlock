in 1915 a German scientist sat quietly calculating mathematics which would revolutionize how we look at the universe his discovery would describe black holes and describe a new way of looking at space but it wasn't Albert Einstein he was surrounded by the sounds of artillery fighting in the first world war this video is brought to you by Clark for 20% off your annual subscription black holes are some of the most extreme phenomena in the universe they're objects so dense that their gravity is strong enough to prevent even light from escaping their grasp and as the speed of light is the fastest anything can go in the universe that means nothing can escape a black hole if it gets close enough they're kind of terrifying but how is this possible how do black holes generate so much gravity that not even light can escape them and question if light is either a wave or a massless particle a photon why does gravity have any effect on light at all well the answer to that question comes from the Eastern Front of World War one but before we get there we need to talk about this man in 1915 Einstein's theory of general relativity replaced Newton's theory as the modern description of gravity people get scared when talking about the physics of general relativity but it's actually really simple conceptually you just need to get rid of some of the ideas in your head about how gravity works because Newton's picture which is probably your picture looks something like this object a exists at some point in space if another object object B is nearby it feels a gravitational force towards object a and so object B then accelerates towards object a because of that force however there's no explanation for how that force got from A to B that's just some mysterious action at a distance where the mere presence of one object mysteriously causes a force to appear in surrounding objects so let's it's that picture of Newton get out of here Isaac much better next let's get rid of this idea of a gravitational forces kind of weird the acceleration stays though that's after all what we observe in the real world when stuff falls towards the Earth it accelerates towards the Earth and so that's the phenomena that we have to explain using a theory of gravity next we need to clarify something that might seem unimportant what do we mean by this grid behind the objects what exactly is it well in Newton's theory the lines represent an immutable coordinate grid the objects are placed on you can specify the location of an object in space with its coordinates on this grid same as in a game of battleships but instead of two coordinates in the real world you need three coordinates x y and z to uniquely specify the position of something so the lines represent a three-dimensional coordinate grid in Newton's world this is defined by regularly spaced infinite parallel lines they stretch on forever never touch each other but when the XY and z coordinates cross each other they always do so at exactly 90 degrees it's a reference grid which tells you how far apart two points are from each other it'll stay the same forever and it looks the same everywhere Einstein had a more complex idea for the grid his idea split into two key parts we are coming back to the war in just a second one the shape of the grid the grid which tells you how far apart two points are from each other in space determines the acceleration of objects placed on the grid and to the shape or more precisely the geometry of the grid is determined by the mass of objects placed on it so this is the famous image of general relativity where space is a rubber sheet and a massive thing like a planet is like a bowling ball by putting the planet in space or putting the bowling ball on the rubber you deform the rubber sheet you deform space around the planet such that if you put other objects on the rubber sheet they roll towards the planet just like how objects fall towards the Earth so point one the shape of the great that's the shape of the sheet determines the acceleration of objects and point to that shape or the curvature to be more precise is determined by the distribution of mass on the grid or the bowling ball on the sheet except the grid isn't just the 3d space grid of newton's world made of XY and z in einstein's world it's a four dimensional grid made of XY and z but also time in earlier work Einstein showed that time and space are super super connected and general relativity's kind of a that's a massive part of it but it goes a bit beyond the scope of this video Einstein's theory solves the problem of what causes gravity it's the curvature of the space-time grid which itself is caused by the presence of mass nice job Einstein there is a problem though the equations describing this were too difficult for anyone to solve even Einstein nice job Einstein in his address to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1915 where he unveiled his theory and unveiled the equations that described it Einstein showed an approximated solution he basically did a little bit of mathematical cheating and got an answer that's nearly exactly right but not quite Einstein thought that the equations was simply too complicated to get an exact solution for but somebody fighting in the war thought differently Karl Schwarzschild was a left hand in the German artillery serving on both the Western and Eastern fronts as a child he had published two scientific papers before the age of sixteen going on to receive his PhD at the age of 23 just before the war he was appointed director of the observatory in g√∂ttingen which was the most prestigious position for an astronomer in germany so he was a pretty good scientist but for whatever reason at the outbreak of war in 1914 he volunteered himself from military service despite the fact that he was over 40 years old during the war he kept up-to-date with the latest research and heard about Einsteins work on gravity and so while serving on the Eastern Front in what is now Lithuania he got to grips with the equations of Einstein's theory swartz child thought that there was a way to solve n Stein's equations exactly the Einstein had Mis and so when a lull in the fighting presented itself he did so for the simplest case possible and non electrically-charged non rotating homogeneous spirity symmetric mass it's a ball it's a ball of mass basically the equations he used in this derivation of Gouri and i will leave a link down there for those of you who are interested but the short version is he did it Schwartz tribals able to derive a geometry which satisfies Einstein's equations and so described that four-dimensional space-time the grid surrounding a non rotating blob of mass he wrote to Einstein with his work and received a very impressive letter in response I have read your paper with the utmost interest I had not expected that one could formulate the exact solution of the problem in such a simple way I liked very much your mathematical treatment of the subject which is the kind of letter coming from Albert Einstein you just want to put on your wall Schwartz chance result was correct and brilliant but there was something strange in it specifically this term so here R is the distance from the center of mass that you're considering when R equals R sub s this term becomes infinite which produces some unusual behavior and this distance from the center of any mass now called the Schwarzschild radius space-time is so curved they're not even light can escape from within the Schwarzschild radius defines the size of the black hole in space-time and it forms the boundary the objects which get caught in the influence of a black hole full towards but never actually reach if you watch an object falling into a black hole from afar you'll see it full slower and slower and slower and slower towards the Schwarzschild radius but never actually reach it but gradually looking more and more red as what little light does escape from near the edge of the black hole is stretched on its way out towards you to longer wavelengths Schwarzschild to find the key characteristic of a black hole something that Einstein hadn't done it took his theory and schwarzschild's work on it as well as decades couldn't work before we arrived a modern understanding of black holes Schwartz child was crucial but he didn't live to see it at the time he was solving Einstein's unsolvable problem he developed a rare and painful skin condition called pemphigus which almost certainly contributed to his death just six months later in 1916 at the age of 42 while working in the hellish conditions of the first world war Schwartz child found the answer to the question I asked earlier light waves or photons don't have mass but they still follow the curvature of the space-time grid which itself is altered and warped by the presence of mass so while the photons of light or the light waves themselves are directly affected the space that they exist in that they travel through is affected by gravity and walked by the presence of mass and in the case of a black hole that warping is so extreme that not even light can escape the influence of gravity I find it immensely powerful that among all the chaos that the death the carnage of the First World War someone was able to use maths and physics to think about the strangest parts of the universe that hadn't even been seen hadn't been observed at that time they were able to escape the reality that they were facing because you might ask why did Schwarzschild do this there's a water before but to me this was his method this was his way of escaping the reality of war as he wrote in his letter to Einstein as you see the war has treated me kindly enough in spite of the heavy gunfire to allow me to get away from it all and take this walk in the land of your ideas in school so if that's you make the most of this thank you for watching this video I'm trying to find the right balance of making stuff accessible and also going into enough detail for people that are looking for detail so let me know what you thought of the video and the level I pitched this at in the comments below also I have plenty of ideas for videos but if you have an idea that you'd really like to see me cover in the style that I do let me know down there as well thank you again for watching if you enjoyed the video please do give it a like subscribe to the channel if you're not already and I'll see you next time [Music]
