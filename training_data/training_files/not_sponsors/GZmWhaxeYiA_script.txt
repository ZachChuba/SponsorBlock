so LG would love for everyone and their dog to run out and buy an OLED TV because they look awesome oh and also high-end products usually have the best profit margins but let's face it hardly anyone can justify dumping 3/4 or even up to $17,000 into a new TV then there's the budget category I mean we're talking like $400 4k TVs like this one well it's no accident that LG has nothing to compete at this price stores like Amazon sell a lot of these kinds of products but this segment often gets ignored by the premium brands because the margins on them are so thin that it's just not even worth the effort for them which puts the sweet spot where it so often is in the middle with LCD TVs like a samsung q LED for a little over $2,000 you see what they did there it even looks like OLED on the box or this one the LG 65 SK 95 super UHD which you can actually get for around the same price but just what is super about it and can it take a chunk out of Samsung's dominant TV market share we'll find out Linus and get 25% off glasswire 2.0 at the link below [Music] the 65s k95 is LG's highest-end non OLED TV at $2,400 so no they're not ditching OLED yet but they're acutely aware that until OLED makes up a lot more than the 15 percent of their overall TV sales that they are currently they are going to need other offerings as we mentioned before Samsung's Q LED TVs really have nothing to do with OLED but they're really impressive for LCDs thanks to quantum technology which allows them to get brighter more saturated colors across a wider gamut by transmitting only pure red pure green and pure blue your typical LCD will emit a wider spectrum of light that includes in-between colors like orange and lime leading to color D saturation and inefficiency so that is where LG's super UHD comes in super UHD not to be confused with Samsung's su HD is an attempt to get similar performance to quantum dot but with a different approach and that's what this nano cell marketing that you see on the box is getting at now no one actually knows quite for sure but this technology appears to add a layer of uniformly sized particles each about one nanometer in diameter that's about a hundred thousand times thinner than a sheet of paper to filter out the unwanted color wavelengths and leave just r g and b thereby preventing color bleeding fading and other effects that reduce the vibrancy of the picture and it seems to be working the picture looks really good fiddling with the settings we were able to get about 89% coverage of the DCI p3 color space and color accuracy that's good enough to edit photos using the Technicolor expert bright mode I mean I mean if your desk had enough room to use this thing as a monitor and while they can't compete with OLED nothing can the black levels are really nice with smooth gradients thanks to the full array local dimming which is quickly going from a pricey exotic feature to a must-have I mean it makes enough of a difference but even though this TV is actually quite a bit thicker than last year's model I'm not even mad at all like finally somebody has woken up as a consumer I've been asking for this give me more performance instead of one more millimeter I mean this is thin enough anyway and the finish on the back and the sides is nothing short of premium I'd be happy to see this thing in my living room and I'm really glad to see that we are finally coming to the end of thinner just for the sake of thinner in the mainstream product line at least because I'm also acutely aware that LG literally has a product called the wallpaper TV on the subject of more performance the full array local dimming is here for a good reason to support HDR this puppy has actual 10-bit color no FRC malarkey and 700 nits peak with 400 nits sustained brightness so that is a bit under the 1000 it fresh hold that I would consider like true modern HDR but they did pull off they'll be vision certification whose main advantage over HDR 10 is that it comes with scene-by-scene metadata for a higher degree of backlight control and speaking of Dolby it also has a built-in dolby atmos decoder so if you're thinking of getting speakers on or aimed at your ceiling you don't need an extra Atmos compatible receiver as long as the HDMI signal goes through the TV finally the 65 SK 95 has a refresh rate of a hundred and twenty Hertz or 240 if your tasteless and you turn on true motion but don't get too excited about it quite yet even though I'm sure that LG has seen the video that we made outlining how our ideal TV would have DisplayPort so it could you can game on it high refresh rates this one lacks either a DP 1.4 or an HDMI 2.1 port so it won't be able to receive high frame rate 4k content from external sources so you would have to stream your HFR content not that there's a lot of that Oh there but and this is something I'm glad to see because we've been complaining about the gaming experience on LG TVs for quite some time at least they do allow you to run at 120 Hertz if you connect to the TV with your PC if you turn the resolution down to 1080p the input leg isn't too shabby at around 33 milliseconds so not as fast as a high-end gaming monitor but a significant improvement over last year and because it's not OLED you've got the additional benefit of not having to worry about your HUD burning in and showing up while you're watching your favorite movies also new this year is voice assistant integration coming from both the Google assistant and LG's own thin queue soft you know what no I'm calling it think think U is obviously not what the marketing team intended and if it is then shame on them anyway the TV is not microphone equipped so it's not always listening like a Google Home Instead you actually issue commands by holding down the microphone button on the included remote the Google assistant will handle queries like turn on the living room lights what's on my calendar or show everyone boring pictures from my last vacation while think we'll handle TV specific operations like changing the picture mode adjusting the volume or even turning off at the end of this program now of course we can't show any of that functionality because it doesn't work in Canada just yet something about the 49th parallel just makes manufacturers not care about the people north of it but that's a whole separate conversation so then should you buy this TV definitely maybe it's a beautiful set that goes toe-to-toe with quantum dot both in terms of quality and price but then again LG has finally announced that their cheapest OLED for 2018 the b8 which has the same features and processor but of course that gorgeous deep black OLED picture quality will be just $2,100 making it three hundred dollars cheaper than this super UHD that is if you're willing to settle for fifty five instead of sixty five inches the 65 inch version is reground so that's an extra $600 my advice if you're a movie watcher and you're already spending this much OLED is worth the upgrade but if you're a gamer or someone who just watches the news all day then I would probably save your money and go super lead super let super UHD speaking of super Squarespace below and use code LTT for 10% off your first purchase so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know where that button is but if it was awesome hit the
