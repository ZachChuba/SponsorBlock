hello everyone so last week I asked my Instagram followers who happen to be science or math students to email me in order to help me on a special project so my goal is to gather a big amount of Seti tape specially for maths or sciences I finally got around to gather tons of study tips tailored for maths and Sciences so all the tips you're going to see here are either from high school students with specialized courses on maths or from college students who are taking engineering classes who are in medical school who are taking biology applied maths and Sciences and so on you can check the description box for timestamps related to all the topics we're going to discuss in this video and without further ado let's get started so we are going to start with basic tips or the basic attitude you should have to study for this type of classes so Sarah what hobbie says that you have to do math like to solve puzzles try giving yourself a small treat after solving a math problem on the other hand in each Barboza's says that if you have formulas try to understand them instead of just remembering them try to understand the meanings of the results you get regarding the attitude you should have to become a math student Martha Gomez says that you should have a balanced life and make yourself a priority most of my classmates think I'm crazy because I go to the gym five times a week I sleep at least seven to eight hours and I never study on Saturday afternoons or Sundays when exams come around I keep the same routine and it's all about having a schedule that works and knowing that you can't perform academically if you aren't good in a physical and emotional way additionally Martha also says that you should not pressure yourself at least in medicine we have a lot of pressure from our professors and from ourselves since we are going to have people's lives in our hands and we want to be perfect in everything we are humans and we have unproductive days emotions personal problems it's better to take an afternoon off to unwind than to spend that afternoon looking at your notes doing almost nothing but hating every second especially when dealing with anxiety and exempt season make sure you aknowledge your feelings also it's really important to understand that specifically in maths and Sciences knowing your basics is fundamental the eighth files says that I have been a tutor every once in a while and what I've noticed when people have difficulties in a particular topic is that those difficulties arise from a blank in previous knowledge maths and Sciences are very progressive being able to identify the specific thing you don't understand is key to staying on top of your classes finally I also wanted to add Havis tips and she says that being confused is normal unnecessary it is very important to be persistent with your study routine at the beginning you are probably going to be confused with many information hard concepts abstract ideas that you don't even know how to picture in your head but we've all been there that is part of the process and it won't last forever learning is all about finding away out of that chaos also you can't figure everything out in a single day don't be hard on yourself if you find it hard to understand some concepts or formulas memorize or remember how to properly apply on problem solving in a few hours your brain needs some time to make meaningful connections without new information with everything already know and place it into long-term memory you'll probably need to consult your textbook examples and explanations more than once that is normal and expected [Music] now I want to cover some tips regarding these students study routines Luna says that you should take a random notebook and use it as a dictionary right at the top of the page what theme you're studying and a book chapter after you read everything and creates topics with only the definitions of the terms that you marked with at first color kollene says that all classes are different so studying styles varies from subject or course she says and I quote in my major which is biology our professors would provide us a copy of the course outline which contains the topics for the whole semester in reading we use the books or ebooks prescribed by the instructor and scientific journals for the recent updates from reading we are now able to make outlines for us to go through to master the topic we also make flashcards for courses that need a lot of memorization and my maps can also be useful specifically in systemic pathways in anatomy and physiology and in biochemistry Maryana says that finding someone who thinks in the same way as you and has a similar work ethic can be incredible for joint setting sessions if that person shares your classes that can be even better as you'll have the same references and notes which can help you complement previously learned information better mathilde also gives us three very specific study tips regarding your process for studying for maths so she says that I mark on a paper every time I come across either a really hard exercise or an exercise that has some kind of twist that makes me think I should do it again right before the tests I go through that list day before my exam and repeats those exercises I also marked with a bright highlighter key information that I come across while practicing exercises either that's a method on how to solve them or something that could be easily forgettable I mark things I think I should remind myself again before the exam and that's what I do is that before my exam I have a look at the exercise I did and read what I highlighted finally I write on a paper the formulas I need and I use them in practice exercises chanela also reminds us that we should focus on our weaknesses in exams or by doing pass papers you can find out your weak points you just have to relearn it and do more practice questions on it also Chanel says that it's really helpful when you've done your readings before class especially in biology every lesson is filled with so many new words by reading your lessons beforehand you'll get used for it also when you're in a gap vacation if you're taking any of sciences and maths you can build the foundations for them by reading related books and by using related online resources finally Chanel reminds us that you need to get through with equations so make formula sheets for each and every lesson you can use post-it notes and stick them on a place where you can see them also you can use flashcards write the equation in one of the sides and write an example in the other side Franchesca reminds you to also use online resources asking your teacher to resolve your doubts and give you extra exercises is always best since they'll likely be the one testing or examining you however let's be honest not all teachers are good at teaching math specially in high school if that's your case and you can rely on a lot of resources that you can find online the more advanced you are the less who fines but even with really advanced classes you can usually find notes or slides from other University study materials and it is worth to try and search some keywords on YouTube to see if someone made a video on the topic or recorded a lecture with more standard subjects there's a lot more to find you can find a lot of videos on YouTube or you can use sites that offer online courses lastly there are some sites and communities solely dedicated to maths with the forum part where you can ask questions to other users ava also says that you should mark your thoughts on the margins because something that makes sense today might not be as clear tomorrow and because through the process of writing down you are forcing your mind to examine your understanding so this will reveal any holes in your understanding in case there are any also Sahin reminds us that it's very important to be consistent so you need to study your science subjects each and every day even if it's only for 30 minutes each day for each subject regarding your class attitude Fernandez says that in case of practical classes or lab it's important to keep a lab notebook where you can register the results of your experiments sometimes the procedures provided by the teachers are only recipes and do not explain all the procedures calculus and explanations relates to that particular experiment chanela also adds that if you really can't understand something in class never think that she'll give a try on it later raise your hand and ask it from your teacher they'll probably have some simple and easy ways on their standards if not you can do self-study by using online resources Martha says that you should never be afraid to ask for help most teachers will be available to answer your doubts what I recommend is however to not just go to them with a question or a blank exercise but choose somehow that you've tried to think about it on your own before going to ask them and also if possible to go to them as soon as there's something you don't understand and not wait until a week before it sets or an exam this is why you will avoid unpleasant experiences that will make you afraid to ask for help again you can also ask a classmate to help you but I always suggest you to be sure you've tried your best to solve your doubts on your own before asking there's little use in just having answers given to you before even making an effort to find a solution finally I want to leave you with actually the first tip that was emailed to me by chanela and she says never think you can't do this and that it's too hard yes science and maths are quite hard but but if you work hard they will probably be doable if you want to take your math and premium subscription and all information will be linked down below I hope you enjoyed today's video don't forget to subscribe if you'd like to see more of this content and I'll see you next week bye
