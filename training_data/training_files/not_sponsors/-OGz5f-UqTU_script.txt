offer Wow welcome what a what a [ __ ] treat well how special unless you feel you get a video on a Friday pay money well be here and today we're doing something a little different we're just gonna jump into it because there's a little bit of backstory we got to get into here so first off you know we got to get the can weight home we need to put something on this monitor this is unacceptable perfect there's been some drama recently some drama with with with the youtuber life with Mac and if you guys don't remember the kid ASMR that I did that entire video on yeah that's the one according to her YouTube has been targeting her channel her videos are being removed for inappropriate content her videos are getting demonetized left and right welcome to the [ __ ] club Mac she believes it's complete here let me let me let me just read you the tweets that she's been saying dear YouTube your blatant discrimination will not stop me I will not let you use me as a target for your platforms shortcomings you condone a grown man to sexually bully me well hold up wait a minute now hold on look I'm not saying that was directed at me is that that seemed very hold on wait wait a minute now she's been having a huge fuss on Twitter her tweets I mean some of these tweets have hundreds of thousands of likes I mean this [ __ ] is blowing up her claim is basically that YouTube is unfairly taking her off the platform so no I was trying to stay quiet about it for a while but then I couldn't help myself when a channel by the name of a tozi you may have heard of him a tozi here with his [ __ ] open curtain looking haircut he watched the stream and heard that joke already he posted a video recently defending her channel his video has so much misinformation so much a mission of facts that I just I couldn't take it anymore I had to make a response the people need to know the people need to know so guys and welcome back to a brand new video today I have a big problem with YouTube so not too long ago I posted a whole video where I was talking about a bunch of different ASMR channels they were just really odd some just were outright disgusting but the channel we're talking about today is not an outright disgusting ASMR Chan what are the channels I reacted to is called life with Mack a younger girl who makes ASMR videos for fun and she seems to have a massive fan base an audience here and from what I've heard YouTube is actually taken down a bunch of her videos due to sexual content one thing that you're gonna notice affect this guy's video is he blurs out the term sexual when he's saying sexual content I think it was an attempt to play to YouTube's algorithm to try to knock it D monetize but sorry but the ironic thing is that he put out a tweet shortly after his video went live out of all the videos to get to monetize the system has some flaws you might want to get out of pen and paper because there's gonna be a lot to unpack if a minor is posting inappropriate content we can all agree it shouldn't be on the platform and we can also all agree if a minor is posting content that's not inappropriate it should be allowed she's just having fun on YouTube eating wrenches and shoes and stuff like oh okay hold on wait a minute though wait what I thought we hold on run that by me one more time this is a kid she's just having fun on YouTube eating wrenches and shoes and stuff like that obviously our fake you don't have a lack of weirdos here on the internet but that doesn't mean let's say if someone's doing a shoot Ryan Hall did that video needs to get taken down because some certain people have foot fetishes no it all started with this on Twitter life with Mac or McKenna she posted this tweet right here dear YouTube your blatant discrimination will not stop me I will not let you use me as a target for your platform shortcomings I am NOT sorry for being a confident young woman who speaks her mind you condone a grown man to bully me and it's time to own up to it but going further she posted a video on her channel vaguely addressing the subject this is just a personal preference but God did so hard to listen to her and take her seriously when she's loudly whispering the entire video in my ear I said this is my other video too it's not even good ASMR her mic is poopy poopy poopy ass it hurts to listen to of course she does the whispering info Lea smart style so she actually doesn't explain much herself in this video because this is actually all she says on the matter that was my man's a well-spoken because this is actually all she says on the matter my man's is my man is one take right here this you know I gotta give a tozi credit that is a first take send it so here's another tweet that she posted essentially calling out YouTube again for listing her videos is inappropriate so he's presented the first video that was supposedly removed for being inappropriate or sexual let's pull up the tweet and let's read it ourselves thanks YouTube this is getting really old to my fans what platform would you like to see me on twitch patreon other in the meantime please enjoy other minors trying on lingerie for their boyfriends wiping nutella on friends etc retweet for a follow when you say retweet for a follow I know you're just trying to get people to retweet you're just devaluing your follow so the claim here was YouTube is removing videos because of sexually inappropriate content well here's a video YouTube removed ASMR eating dish sponges and soap I don't know about you but it looks to me like YouTube removed this one because it's [ __ ] misleading it's not only a zit clickbait it can be argued that it's a dangerous click bait this is a this thumbnail is intentionally misleading that's why this video was removed yes the video she has here in the screenshot is her eating fake soap and fake sponges but she does put a disclaimer in the title oh well you know in that case the video is totally fine it's not like the giant [ __ ] thumbnail completely contradicts the title it doesn't even matter if you started the video and immediately she said the soap was fake the thumbnail the title that's on the thumbnail are intentionally misleading and potentially harmful it's not being removed because it was sexual it's not being removed because YouTube hates Mac it's being removed because it is intentionally missed and click baiting into someone eating soap how do you not understand this I feel like this is backwards how can you defend this listen I'm all for being edgy I'm all for having unique and fun and edgy content but click baiting eating dish soap and sponges to an arguably primarily child audience that that has no place on YouTube when that gets taken off YouTube I will support that you are minutes into a video where you're trying to convince us is something you have not done that at all maybe small suggestion maybe just I don't know don't eat fake sponges and dish soap that's a good place to start maybe I don't know she makes a very good point how is it that someone like Danny Khan can make videos where she's tryin on bikinis when Danny Khan herself is also a minor D of your pen and paper write down Danny Cohen we're gonna be coming back to that both Mac and tow'ring here bring up Danny Cohen multiple times write that down we're gonna come back to that you have life with Mac over here getting all of her videos listed as inappropriate when there's nothing in the videos that are inappropriate that's not true we just debunked that pretty sure eating fake soap and click baiting it is pretty inappropriate we just debunked that [ __ ] homie you a life with Matt continues the rant on Twitter with this tweet where she says that YouTube actually removed her clothing try on haul video and the tweet reads in this video removed by YouTube at it a try on haul with for clothing items a winter puffer jacket turtle net long-sleeved sweater dress gorgeous high-neck long-sleeve whose turtleneck long sleeve sweatshirt dress what on earth was inappropriate and I have to ask the same questions because here are the outfits that she tried on ok so this one's gonna be actually really interesting and I think you guys might be surprised with my opinion on it so she posted a clothing haul video where she tried on four different outfits and YouTube deleted it for being inappropriate they then appealed it and it was denied meaning they sent in an appeal and YouTube manually reviewed the video for a second time and deleted it here are four photos I don't think these are screens from a video the video they look like they were taken with an iPhone I'm assuming that they were they don't look like they're screenshots from the video but they do show the four outfits that were showcased in the video I have not seen this video I have tried to look for it before filming this video if it's posted somewhere and I'm just completely missing it at the time of filming I could not find it I don't know if it's behind a paywall at this point but either I couldn't find it anywhere so therefore I do not have an opinion on YouTube removing it I think it's reasonable to believe a tozi has not seen the clothing video because his response video was posted after it got deleted I can't find the video he's probably never seen it then why is he posting a long-winded response defending something he's never seen I'm not claiming that there's anything inappropriate in the video I'm saying I don't know we can't take Mac or YouTube's word for it we don't know why are you so confidently posting a video defending something you haven't watched it's blissfully ignorant to do something like that and honestly it's kind of irresponsible to this if I end up watching this video if somehow this video gets sent to me and it is innocent I will be first in line to defend Mac I think she should be able to post videos like this that are innocent however I haven't seen the [ __ ] video so I can't defend it a tozi likely hasn't seen it either so why the [ __ ] did he post this video it's so sneaky to post for frames and say look see the video was innocent what the [ __ ] YouTube I'm not claiming the videos inappropriate I'm just saying how the [ __ ] would anybody know that's Owen - for you a tozi you have brought up no strong argument for YouTube removing her videos unfairly any of this inappropriate no I don't think so I don't understand how you would know so how is this getting removed for being inappropriate yet Danny Khan literally uses her body for views as a minor Danny Cohen counter - now you came you track yes I would understand a little bit more if she was a tiny creator maybe YouTube just did not see that this is going on but no she's been directly adding YouTube on Twitter constantly and some of her tweets have gotten up to 200,000 lights I don't really ask a lot of you guys but please go to Twitter and tweet this why are you deleting life with max videos hashtag justice for Mac at you've YT creators at YouTube at Susan Wojcicki at life with Mac 2005 and Ida tozi so I can also retweet a bunch of them oh is that why you wanted your Twitter mention in there you wanted your Twitter Eto's ii in the in the tweet so you could retweet people come on listen i tozi come on man come on bro you know I want the clout to you know I'm looking for that YouTube money Dollar Shave Club if this was me man I'd be like yo include that app pay money well because I'm trying to get my dick way I personally believe a tozi wanted his name on that tweet for the exposure I'll be the first to admit maybe I'm ignorant maybe I don't understand fully how Twitter works I'm actually on his Twitter right now days after his video posted and he has yet to retweet a single person who put out that tweet so yeah YouTube really needs to fix this right now and she's being treated extremely unfairly and like I said early it's only some creators were actually being affected by this because while life with Mac is getting her stuff taken down left and right you have a youtuber named Danny Khan who's also a miner who seems to be left untouched yet her videos are pretty much all about her body YouTube told me that minors doing ASMR can be some flash fetishized by adults which is why they are removing my videos for inappropriate content I hate that we've gotten to this point due to sick disgusting people cannot be punishing kids who have 0 wrong intentions due to a small amount of sick individuals and spoiler alert banning kids from the platform won't solve anything the only thing that does is punish the kids for no reason whatsoever and then you have the sick disgusting human beings over there they'll just move on and find something else that appeals to them I don't know why we're actually like pedophiles leaving is a bad thing I'm not saying we should you know get rid of kids on YouTube but he's actually like well the pedophiles are just gonna go somewhere else good so the point that he's making the point that I see Mak making in the tweets this is kind of the whole one of the main reasons I wanted to make the video because nobody's saying this you can't blame the child for posting a video and there are perverts sexualizing them and to an extent I agree with that but member I said they brought up to 83 different times so Danny Danny is a minor she's 15 she posts videos of her doing different haul videos there's a swimsuit haul video she does all kinds of content that could be seen as sexual however according to both tow man and Mac we shouldn't victim Blayne here so how come on one hand they call for why is Danny's channel Stubb if she's sex she's being she's using her body to make videos but then on the other hand they say we should never blame the kid the kid can't be sexualized it's the pedophile swat4 sexualizing how can you say we can't blame the kid but then you're also blaming Danny it's you can't have it both ways you want to be able to post content and blame the pedophiles but when other people post content it's their fault not the pedophiles fault here's something I've just been waiting to say this are we just gonna pretend that the cop video didn't happen are we gonna pretend that the ASMR sassy cop video didn't happen because God knows this has been this whole drama has been talked about for such a long time I don't see anybody bringing up the company are we gonna pretend that this didn't happen are you kidding me oh by the way I wish I would have explained this in my first video SSS before a tender day if you're not aware SSS stands for [ __ ] showering and shaving it's something you would do to prepare before a night on the town it's not something a child should be saying in a role play you're gonna sit here and you're gonna chastise Danny for being sexual but then you're gonna claim your content is immune to that are you kidding me are we gonna pretend that this didn't happen it's double standard it's [ __ ] you're playing both sides here and I feel like I'm one of the only people calling it out I feel like there are inappropriate videos on both Danny and Mac's channel and I think they should be removed accordingly absolutely but to sit here and say we can't victim blame it's not the kids fault it's the pedophiles fault except [ __ ] Danny which one is it guys so she's 13 years old which means she's old enough to upload videos to YouTube herself but her mom managers her YouTube channel for her so for my understanding of the situation her mom is green-lighting everything that she is posting on her YouTube channel so if YouTube gives me the trust as an adult to not upload in pria content to my youtube channel why can't they give the same trust to max mom what do you mean why can't they give her the same trust this is what happens when you give her the trust what a stupid question to ask just to really drill it in this is the girl that YouTube's banning for being inappropriate neck tightness be nice to other kids and take the high road and live a peaceful kind life yet the very least if you made it this far in the video you want to hear what I have to say so I'm gonna take this opportunity now to really go in so if you saw there and that little insider [ __ ] interview a tozi showed this clip to demonstrate that Mac is is innocent and is is just a sweet girl and in the interview she even says the name Mac on her YouTube channel stands for meaning acceptance and kindness this is the girl that YouTube's banning for being inappropriate kids and take the high road someone for largest and arguably Mac's most iconic series is her sassy videos and in these videos throughout the entire video she role plays being the biggest [ __ ] [Music] [Music] what he used taller tree products like what she's sorry looks like you already [Music] [Music] to other kids and take the high road [Music] meaning acceptance 100% support anybody's right to be any online character persona ever in fact I think it's really interesting that that's how she does her ASMR the whole bit is that she's honestly just a giant [ __ ] that's that is the bit if you don't believe me if you think I'm exaggerating or being too harsh go watch the videos that's the intent you cannot tell me it is not incredibly manipulative to then go on an interview and say the name of the channel it stands for meaning acceptance kindness which one is it or is your channel all about meaning acceptance kindness or are you a comedy channel where you're intentionally an [ __ ] and the fact that toe man here use that clip to try to persuade his audience is exactly the problem with it I role play an [ __ ] too it'd be the same thing if I was out it'd be the same thing if I gave an interview like that lovey Wow usually buried beneath yeah you know I just like to wiggle and like you know just cute it's just such a rude sir that she does holy [ __ ] I hope that she can continue posting as smart videos to YouTube because you can really tell that she enjoys making them and you know what a tozi I think with that we finally found something we agree on the last thing I want to see is someone posting you know innocent fun content and it getting deleted if YouTube decides to actually start removing max videos unfairly I will be first in line to defend her that being said with all the evidence that was presented to us from a tozi and her tweets I don't see that happening here so I'm not gonna defend her at all I am someone though who is more than willing to have my mind changed I am more than happy like I said I will be first in line to defend a content creators right to create content but I'm not seeing that happen here thank you guys on the stream [Music]
