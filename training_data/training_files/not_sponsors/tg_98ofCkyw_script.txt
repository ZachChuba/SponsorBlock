my name is Max and I'm 20 but not really cuz I'm 5 my name is Johnny and I'm 31 well a 31 year old and a psychologically stunted 20 year old that thinks she's 5 I mean how could you not adore a fairytale such as this hello everyone and welcome back to a hot and fresh spicy chicken quesadilla my name is Leon lush and as always I am gratuitously gracious that you would decide to spend a few minutes here with me today now Before we jump into it I want to talk real quickly about something excuse me no one cares idiot just shut up and start the video this [ __ ] guy okay let's uh let's just get right into it I guess now I know what you're thinking but I want to stop you before you draw any more unfounded conclusions because this is just two consenting adults living their best life and okay maybe you think it's weird to want to roleplay as a five-year-old but I'm here to tell you I'm here to set the record straight listen it is way more fun than it looks [Music] and I gotta be honest with you guys I get excited when we get to watch these together in fact the only thing that is the definition of a win-win [Music] this is a Valley of Ashes a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens hold on a second I click on this video thinking I'm gonna have the pleasure of watching this broad act like a five-year-old and she has the audacity to read at a collegiate level all right this thing better turn around quick or I'm gonna that's more like it no way it's the only other Park I don't know exactly why but the way she says daddy baby day just tickles my [ __ ] do G by definition is daddy dawn little girl and it is a subsection of BDSM which is a part of the king all right so let me see if I got this fattest family tree right we have kink which is the father of BDSM which is the father of DDL g which is daddy dawn little girl all right I can fight with that and then she was eating these babies snacks and I think that's when we that's when we had the conversation about it I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall for that conversation so Nigel I know we've been dating almost three years and you bought me that beautiful ring but I have a funny story for you I actually like to pretend I'm a five year old almost all of the time [Laughter] [Music] a lot of people look down on more hardcore versions of the TV LG subset but for a lot of for a lot of people is non-sexual it's like for us it's non-sexual yeah it would be a little concerning if pretending you were a five year old was part of some sort of sexual fantasy but you have to have picked the worst kink of all time out of all the kinks you could have chosen you chose the one where you don't get laid and that my friends is what six years ago we would have called an epic fail sure it might be a little strange if you can't get off unless you stick a stiletto heel up your rhombic but at the end of the day you're getting off a lot of the time especially when we're at home when we're just relaxing and I'm with him I'm little when I want to be I'm little when it's right I mean is it ever really wrong to be Oh daddy I love this kid in the background you know I was beginning to doubt whether max was committed to being the little in this D dlg relationship until I saw the homemade pasty box which evaporated any doubts that I had you know I don't think those were real vegetables I just have to sit here in the corner you know I've been saying it forever but the thing that I miss the most about being a kid is being forced to take timeouts I mean going to sit on the stairs or getting sent up to your room with no dinner are you kidding me I wish it wasn't so weird to do these things in the Dell yeah yeah what else I just chilling in the cup my man yo listen you trying to get down tonight I heard Josh Groban's putting on a free show at the Palladium nah bro sorry I put myself in timeout tonight wait what yeah man I'm on timeout like you know like a go to your room take a timeout you know that you know that kind of thing what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] are you talking about you know what [ __ ] forget it brought I don't have time to explain it I'm not even supposed to be on the phone right now have fun at the show dude to try and explain this lifestyle in terms of a little this lifestyle is kind of like a coloring book where she hands me the lines and I can just fill them in with whatever color I want basically me being a willful participant in this awkward sexless relationship with a pretend five-year-old is kind of like a coloring book when she just hands me the lines and I get the color and however I want okay Johnny okay I have dealt I have definitely exceeded the limit of D dlg content of DDL G content that I can withstand for the near future I know there's gonna be a couple of sensitive little teddy bears out there that are gonna watch this video and you're gonna get offended somehow and you're gonna scroll down to the comments and say oh oh you're such a hater how could you hate these two they're not doing anything to hurt anyone they're just doing what they love maybe they're different maybe they don't like what you led with little oh alright okay couple of things I want to say that shut up the second thing is I'm not hating on them they're great they can do whatever they want but by god is it hilarious and the third thing is the second you offer yourself up to be featured on Barcroft TV and a special that's gonna be displayed to 5.2 million subscribers yeah you automatically waive your right to not be made fun just a little bit still just a little bit I think I've really kept my foot off the gas from being honest we're gonna say anyways is the old saying goes the only thing better than deep throating a summer squash is reading YouTube comments [Music] [Applause] [Music] enough internet for today I'm not a violent person by nature at all but for some reason hearing a grown adult doing a baby voice always makes me want to punch the [ __ ] out of something oh man I know I used this shtick last finish she doesn't do it in public whatever you do in your own home is up to you I guess okay I understand the logic there but you know when you feature yourself in a YouTube video that goes on to get 10 million views that's about as public as it gets so you're two consenting adults let them live how they chose I think it's amazing how comfortable they are with sharing their lifestyle y'all need to shush about it is anyone forced you to watch this or act like them no so shush y'all are acting like immature children you do you max smiling blushing face the irony of this comment is palpable where the immature children think you've got a Twisted Sister hey listen Kaylin just get get real close here I'm just gonna wait for this to focus real quick shut up well I don't disagree with her root message about them being able to do whatever they want of course they can do whatever they want that's totally fine they put themselves on blast by doing this Barcroft TV special so don't [ __ ] try and stick up for them when people are giving them a little bit of [ __ ] for being a little strange yeah my girlfriend do this it's a lot of fun try it if you're brave or adventurous it's so cute to me it's only at specific times we do this it's not most of the time plus I spank her when she's bad and she loves it yeah I'm gonna take a shower and finally my verified friend sneaker talks says I click these videos to read the comments amen brother alright guys that's a wrap thank you so much for joining me you know the drill comment subscribe head to the war robots today also if you could just take that pacifier out of your mouth and unzip that ones you're wearing nice and slow and then hip thrusts to that [ __ ] like button for me it would be oh so appreciate it I love you guys we'll see you in the next one Yahtzee I need some other [ __ ]
