hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian today's video the north african campaign part two [Music] on february 12 1941 a 50 year old renowned tank commander and veteran of the first world war stepped off of a german transport plane into the arid desert air this man was none other than irwin rommel relatively short with a solemn look he was the son and grandson of schoolteachers and he looked the part or perhaps more like the principal however this man who would come to be called the desert fox was not just a scholar of infantry tactics he was one of germany's most well-respected battlefield tacticians his image has been somewhat sanitized by both wartime and post-war propaganda and so it is worth remembering that rommel was one of adolf hitler's personal favorites he was here on behalf of the fuhrer to clean up mussolini's mess to their digital library with that said onwards to africa operation compass the code name for the first allied military operation of the western desert campaign had been an enormous success for the british thanks to general sir archibald weivel and his subordinate richard o'connor however the allies winning streak was about to come to an end on february 9 winston churchill ordered the sixth australian division to cross the mediterranean and join the allied defense of greece at nearly the same moment that germany's newly created africa corps began deploying in libya since the british did not expect a counter-attack in libya most of the 7th armored division returned to egypt to defend her majesty's holdings there as a result when erwin ramo arrived with 65 000 german troops in addition to the 55 000 italians already present he was able to bring a 120 000 man hammer down on the dangerously strung out allies in the entirety of the middle east theater wavel had around 118 000 men under his command as part of the newly reformed 8th army they were supported by a large quantity of aircraft and the superior british navy however the british forces over extension meant that they were unprepared for the concentrated axis assault despite ramos orders to take a defensive stance until more reinforcements arrived in may of 1941 the ambitious commander took action after remarkably easy early offensive victories at al aguilar and merced brega before long he put the german plans for operation zone bloomer or sunflower into action early our historian friend from the last episode stephen w sears notes that the army that faced rommel was not the fast-moving quick thinking force that had chased marshall graziani out of egypt the desert rats of the seventh armored division had been replaced by the newly arrived second armored division and the sixth australian division was relieved by another australian division untrained and poorly equipped like o'connor did before him rommel split his forces in an attempt to cut the enemy off ordering some troops to take the coastal route and ordering others to go through cerenaica as for o'connor himself in an almost inconceivable blunder the british officer's unescorted staff car took a wrong turn and drove right into axis forces he and his intended replacement philip neem along with john coombe the man who ambushed the retreating italian army in 1940 were captured and wevel was down three of his most experienced senior officers by mid-april benghazi had fallen and nearly all of the british forces in libya had been successfully pushed back to egypt with one notable exception those at brook this fortified position was held by the remnants of the australian 9th and 7th divisions along with several divisions of english and commonwealth artillery who had fled there during rommel's initial advance one of the recurring themes in this series is the difficulty of keeping troops supplied in a huge desert battlefield like north africa to quote steven sears once more as marshall graziani had ruefully noted desert war imposed its own special rules rule number one was that armies brought with them everything they needed there was no such thing as living off the country rama would need to brook as a resupply port to have any chance of pushing into egypt thus began a seemingly endless siege of the isolated allied position surrounded on three sides the 23 000 manned garrison was assisted and supplied by the royal navy but lacked air support becoming the frequent target of luftwaffe raids the germans and italians sent wave after wave of troops against the australians but the defenses of dubrook had been bolstered into a fortress royal engineers created a 30-mile semi-circle of trenches and hardened defensive structures peppered in were lengths of barbed wire tank traps and land mines without the reinforcements it seemed that rommel would not be able to root out the troublesome aussies on his flank and would have to be content with containing them spring saw numerous advances on either side that were quickly repelled first among them was the aptly named operation brevity which only lasted from may 15th to the 16th british forces made slight gains that were nearly immediately undone by axis counter-attacks those incursions culminated with axis forces seizing the choke point at hellfire pass on may 26th and the 27th but were unable to move any further as summer was nearing wavel received reinforcements as part of another operation codenamed tiger a daring mission that saw 238 tanks ferried across the mediterranean in relatively slow vulnerable merchant ships protected by a royal navy escort to be fair to wavel as supreme commander of all british forces in the middle east his troops had to contend not just with ramos africa corps but also with the remaining italians in east africa local rebellions in their oil-rich colonial holdings in iraq and the threat of axis troops landing in vichy french syria and lebanon what's more he was also responsible for overseeing the key allied defensive positions in the mediterranean such as crete and malta if the desert campaign really was the game of chess contemporary military strategists thought it was huevel was playing three games at once against three different opponents on june 15th huevo launched operation battle axe a british and indian offensive intended to push the german forces out of halfaya pass with the ultimate goal of relieving to brook and it proved no more successful than past attempts and was called off after just two days the frustrated churchill relieved wavel three weeks later and replaced him with the commander-in-chief of india clawed the awk akanlak on july 5th sears notes from the failure of battle axe the british concluded that their tanks were outgunned by those of the enemy when in most cases the actual killers were the anti-tank guns particularly the 88 flag the failure to appreciate the full value of the anti-tank gun was to haunt the british in months to come the awk spent the next few months resupplying and regrouping while rommel tried in vain to overwhelm the australian garrison into brook the aussies had no problem standing their ground presumably because everything back home in australia tries to kill you anyways the royal navy continued to resupply them under the cover of darkness and in september they were successfully rotated out of the city taking their place was the british 70th division the polish carpathian brigade and the czechoslovak 11th infantry battalion this mixed allied force would hold the city for the rest of the siege in november british reinforcements joined with those from india sudan south africa and new zealand swelling the aux forces and prompting him to initiate operation crusader by this point the awk had about 700 tanks comprising crusaders matildas and the american lent least tank the steward rommel had just 390 tanks mainly comprising panzer 3s and panzer 4s despite what battlefield 5 might tell you there were no tigers present in 1941. the operation which the awk had placed under the command of lieutenant general alan cunningham commenced on november 18th with a push into solemn and bardia while the british south africans and indians besieged the axis forces there the new zealanders moved north to relief to brooke on the 21st a detachment of british and south african troops were dispatched to attack sidi raziq but were cut off and nearly destroyed when rommel cut between those units in the north and the ones still fighting at salem and bartia the new zealanders did manage to reach cd rezieg by november 25th and make contact with the garrison at brook on the 30th however the units that were supposed to support them were so badly beaten that cunningham urged the awk to let them retreat in response cunningham was fired and replaced with general neil ritchie truth be told the british went through commanders so quickly that my artist couldn't keep up with drawing them so here's a stick figure one of my writers drew the new zealanders now experiencing heavy fighting on all sides were ultimately unable to liberate to brook and withdrew back to egypt on december 1st however as rommel was never able to take to brooke he could only be resupplied from tripoli and even then only one third of his intended materials survived the royal navy's interdictions once more british forces had been consistently reinforced throughout the year while the german campaign in russia and the balkans diverted any available access manpower away from north africa after a failed attempt to relieve the dangerously isolated italian garrisons at solemn and bardia the axis forces were forced to retreat as they were out of supplies allowing the garrison at to brooke to finally be liberated on the 10th after more than eight months of gruelling siege below to support our channel and register for your 30-day trial so what happened after to brooke was finally liberated well the awk hoped to destroy rommel's remaining forces by cutting them off at beta fam as o'connor and wavel had done with the italians the year before unfortunately the desert fox slipped out of their grasp under the cover of darkness on christmas eve ramo officially began adapting to the harsh desert battlefield and the next year would bring some of his greatest victories yet the seeds of his destruction had already been sown on december 11th one day after the liberation of to brook and four days after the japanese attack on pearl harbor germany had declared war on the united states a sleeping giant had awoken and it threatened to put ax's plans to the torch all that and more in our next episode [Music] you
