jobber Oh who's gonna be the number one overall draft pick to the Cincinnati Bengals we assume unless they inevitably take a trade from somebody else that's going to be looking for it I think that would be an interesting decision but the Bengals could potentially do that Joe burrows was just announced recently signed with CAA which is the agency you are from how does that process go do you guys do like an entire recruiting thing I didn't get recruited by any agents by the way coming out of college I signed with a guy from our high school because he was the only guy that knew who I was so what is the process how many people do you think we're giving him money is that what you guys do you got to give him a bunch of money from San Jose or how does it work no that's not how you guys don't just give him a bunch of money I assumed that he would walk up and say what do you want and he says this and you guys just give him the money no it's very professional very formal and you know for a guy like that like it's a really important decision to make and the team of agents from CA football todd todd france brian a role Ben runs in they have had a you know it's you build a relationship with the guy and you go through formal channels and when LSU says hey come on campus and pitch formally you listen to coach Joe and you listen the LSU athletic department and you and you make that you know your pitch day Oh so the coach is in the LSU football staff are the ones that put together a lot of time a lot of times a lot of these programs will actually help regulate the process there are consultants out there typically X front office guys that will come in and vies schools on hey here's advice schools the players and the families hey here's how your agent selection process should go and a lot of it is like not sexy at all what do you think I should train why do you think I should train there what do you think is you know a right system for me to play in I mean there's a lot of like really serious questions asked but the team of agents that sign Joe burrow are really really good agents they're really really good people so I'm betting on the reason that you know he chose to go with CAA is because a the track record CA football is a powerhouse in the sport and in their practice and then B because they're really really good people and it seems like he's a really good guy from some really good stock okay so Joe burrow he won't throw it to combine and do all that stuff where you will order from seeking now back to the magic would you I would if I was jobber oh I don't I don't know if he will or if he won't if i was joe burro i would strictly because everybody who doesn't automatically get spain as if they're scared and I don't like joe borowski r dove anything like what joe burrows a baller like I if I was Joe Perot I wouldn't run I wouldn't run a forty I wouldn't do all the other stupid stuff the three cone drill and all that stuff but if it comes down to just throwing the random wide receivers which is why it was it well he doesn't have the timing with the wide receivers gentleman look Joe burrow is obviously going number one here I mean you know I mean I don't anything he could do at the combine like that would hurt him there's nothing he could do unless he unless he tears his shoulder while throwing a ball I mean that's the only thing he could happen but I think it would be cool if the dude just did it you know Ohio kid I wouldn't be against it now granny I could see why he would sit out because if he has a couple water shivers to drop the ball maybe draft stocks gonna drop it's like his draft stock is not gonna drop Joe burrows going number one I would like to see him maybe step out there and throw the rock a little bit just make that entire thing a little like an extra practice for him
