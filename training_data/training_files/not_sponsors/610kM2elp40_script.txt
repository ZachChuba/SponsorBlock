our last hackintosh video an attempt to build the fastest Mac in the world using virtualization to simplify the hackintosh process was a huge success except for the awkward timing where it ended up coming out the very day that Apple finally announced their new Mac Pro which turned out to be faster than ours but we're not beat yet ladies and gentlemen hello yeah it's time so our goal now is to go bare metal hackintosh on the same 28 core cpu that we used last time water coolant and overclock it before Apple releases their new Mac Pro to the public which gives us what three months or so well considering that Apple's had six years to work on theirs I'd say we've got a lot of work to do I'm here alright let's get going the offer code Linus and madrenas coffee calm slash Linus [Music] just the usual reminder we are not endorsing the use of Mac OS on anything other than a Mac in any way no especially in a commercial environment if you want to run Mac at work by Mac oh yeah that in that case it is much better to buy a Mac because then you actually get support in order to build a hackintosh that can compete with the new Mac Pro we're going to need to do a few things in preparation first and foremost we need a motherboard that is comparable in terms of expansion to the one that Apple is shipping in their new cheese grater and also one that is likely to be compatible with Mac OS unfortunately that means that our a sous dominus board with its mere four PCI Express 16x slots is out we turned instead to gigabyte c6 21 horas extreme they refer to this thing as monster gaming motherboard and I think they're pretty close to the mark it's rocking seven PCI Express slots for expansion and twelve ddr4 dimm slots this should give us plenty of room to maneuver and if we decide to liquid cool our GPU setup it'll actually potentially give us even more internal expansion than Apple's big passive GPU coolers will allow one area where we will be making compromises though is external expansion our board does have a header to install a Titan Ridge Thunderbolt 3 card right around here and if we were in so inclined we could pass through a DisplayPort signal from our GPU for the full Mac experience but we're limited to just two of those right instead of what is it six or something like that yeah it was like two on the front and like four on the back another difference for us is our GPUs so we are stuck with the Radeon seven the fastest available card that is still compatible with the latest version of Mac OS Mojave we intend to install more than one of these but guys we're still kind of in the proof-of-concept phase here so we're gonna grab one or two more when the time comes is this the slot you wanted for it this one right here next up is the memory now our CPU falls well short of the up to 1.5 terabytes of memory supported on the new Mac Pro but it still does pretty well up to 512 gigs and we want to have a pretty rockin config for it but for today well we're just validating so we slot it in six sticks of ddr4 3,200 Trident Z RGB modules from g.skill that's more than enough for the tests that we're gonna throw at it while also actually being a fair bit faster than what Apple will be shipping for the final build the plan is 384 gigs of the fastest 32 gig modules that we can get our hands on yeah fully decked out finally for our cpu we've got the Xeon w30 175 X from our previous video but this time we're not allocating course to our host OS or dealing with virtualization overhead because we're going to boot Mac OS directly to cool this thing well we've got some plans for something really crazy that might take a little bit of engineering know-how from Alex but for now we've gone with the Noctua Nhu 14s on top of the motherboard box which is fine for case right I mean we didn't really have much of a choice actually it's the the board is physically too large for any of the test benches that we have here at the office okay so enough preamble are we ready to do it I think we're ready okay hopefully I didn't break off the SATA connector when I you know that around that would be bad yeah punch it Chewie theoretically this just works and it just goes right to Mac OS right yeah I think this is fine it was supposed to boot up did you hit the keyboard by any chance No okay well you you don't trust me you need Brandon to validate it okay so that's it I'm a Mac bare-metal okay so if you guys are wondering how we got this done guys this is not a tutorial but maybe walk them through some of the steps that we had to go through yeah again not a tutorial but I found that using our previous vm based clover install as a baseline gigabytes hardware and firmware here actually basically was compatible with mac OS out of the box now I did have to install using USB 2.0 and I had to grab fake SMC to get passed from ACPI ears while booting the Installer but once we got it on there everything basically just worked now everything needs a bit of an asterisk iMessage and FaceTime do not currently work on our hack Pro but we intend to solve that one way or another before the conclusion all right well you want to see this denim in the truck yeah I want to see a cinema entranc question is that let's do it I think last time we cracked ten thousand howhow do you think it'll go now I would expect it to be at least a touch higher cuz we're ditching the virtualization overhead and we got a couple more cores because we don't have to leave anything for our host OS yeah so that four extra threads okay so we got eleven thousand four hundred thirty nine yeah we're looking at results that are about five percent faster in the multi-threaded test and nearly 20% faster single-threaded so as much as we love virtualization we were actually leaving a fair bit of performance on the table yeah well why don't we fire up Geekbench next let's do it well that number looks a lot higher than last time that's nearly eighty thousand multi-core we're at about twenty three percent higher in single threaded and nearly nine percent higher in multi-core like it's a big difference overall in CPU curiously though our OpenCL and metal scores don't look like they gained quite as much so why don't we do Lux mark next see what that should looking like okay so now we've got a pattern here it looks like in our GPU bound tests our virtualization overhead wasn't hurting us nearly as much as it was in the CPU bound tests fascinating so now we want to hit it with some non synthetic CPU tests what do you want to start let's go with blender and there sounds good wow that's a lot of threads there it is so 1:16 we saved a couple of seconds on the BMW test but more impressively we save nearly half a minute on the classroom I think this is the fastest we've ever seen a Mac run these tests and I did the Mozilla Firefox compiled test off-camera and it went 40 percent faster Wow it really only took nine minutes that's crazy I think the only test left to run from last time are then Final Cut Pro and Henry yeah let's find out final cut so this looks promising did we save it sorry three minutes on our Final Cut Pro test yeah and nearly half a minute on handbrake two which is actually really impressive when you consider that it'll under six minutes to begin with Wow all right so how about them apples then now keep in mind guys that this is actually above the level of performance that we would expect out of the new Mac Pro for these workloads because while the Xeon w-30 275 that apples using on the high end has a slightly higher single core boost clock it also has a much lower base clock and a more conservative TDP with the same core and cache layout as our xeon w 3175 x oh and don't forget that these tests were all done its stock clocks to our CPU only ever got 280 degrees under blender while we boosted a 3.8 gigahertz all day long if Apple's Mac Pro stops boosting basically at all they lose on everything but memory capacity so actually this is looking like a really good start to the project it would appear that knocking on all the wood I can find yeah it would appear that nothing's gonna prevent us from seeing it through to the end with that said it's going to take some time because if we're gonna do this thing right we need to go all the way I want a custom monoblock for this board as much of the fastest RAM we can muster at least one more Radeon seven and all core overclock of 4 gigahertz minimum I expect it to be damn near silence and I want it all in a cheese grater stay tuned guys because success or failure this is going to be one hell of a ride speaking of a wild ride this link in the video description at drop comm now so thanks for watching guys if you disliked this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video description also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like the one I'm wearing it actually has oh yeah this is one of our newest designs the hard drive shirt I think it's really cool and at our community forum which is totally worth adjoining this motherboard is almost the size of this thing on its own Alex really thinks he can do this that's what he says he also said he could make a heatsink though
