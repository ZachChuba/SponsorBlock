this video is dedicated for those of you that are not elite level programmers and have no idea what a monoid is i'm going to be ruining programming memes by explaining them to you how it's going to work is i'm going to go to programming humor on reddit i'm going to go to the top post of the week and i'm going to explain each and every meme except for the ones i don't feel like until i get tired by the end of this video you're not going to be any closer to being a 10x engineer but you may be able to start laughing at some of their jokes yeah sex is great but have you ever been coding for three hours with nothing but failure and it finally runs properly this one's pretty self-explanatory and given that i'm a virgin chad programmer whose code is always right the first time i can't really give first-hand experience on either of these so we're just gonna have to trust the tweeter here i'll sometimes leave a dangling else just as a threat to the compiler that it better run that if statement or else when you write an if-else statement you'll have your if blocked there'll be some code inside then you'll have your else block and there'll be some code inside but the joke is here he didn't put any code in the else block there really isn't an else block it just says else and nothing like if else you kind of have to do the if yeah while you were out partying i studied the code while you were out engaging in pre-marital sex i studied the code while you spent months at the gym for the sake of vanity i studied the code and i still don't know what the fudge is going on i think this is referring to people that are just like learning to code and they're just having a real hard time because despite all the propaganda there is about how coding is great and that you should learn it and that is really easy and you can get job in six months it turns out coding is actually really hard and it could also be referring to how like most software engineers feel like they don't know what they're doing and they're just googling their entire job and they just feel like imposters so this works if you're not an engineer or you're an engineer and you're trying to code and they all just feel like they have no idea what they're doing i'm a software engineer with decades of experience my code is used by hundreds of thousands and i've taught software engineering in over a dozen countries i just had to ask my colleague for help in finding out why my code was not working the reason was i hadn't hit compile this probably happened to almost every programmer and i don't know exactly why my guess is just as a programmer you were trying to juggle so many things in your mind at once like the software itself making sure it's right that you forget like insignificant details stuff like this or you just make really dumb mistakes because you're like thinking really high level and it kind of just happens all the time tree is structured as best seen graphically a lot of the terminology relating to trees is borrowed from that of real-life trees computer scientists having spent their entire life in front of a computer and never gone outside have evidently forgotten that trees are supposed to grow up and not down the diagram with the circles and the lines and stuff that's how computer scientists represent a tree structure just a way to store data and pretty much every computer science student or software engineer will probably learn this at some point and then like never again use it in their life but you'll learn it and how it works is yeah it goes down and so it's it's a tree with leaves and stuff and they call the thing at the top of root but i guess it's more like a potato than a tree because it goes it does go this way not that doesn't go that way when you try googling how to do something in plane c c plus plus c sharp objective c allow us to introduce ourselves i don't code anything in c so i don't google anything and see but my guess is when you google how to do stuff all that comes up is answers and how to do it with c plus plus so rip you see programmers you're gonna have to just go and read some books or something i think php is a great language but that's just my two cents php to usd one philippine peso is two cents in the united states dollar i think holding this joke together is php is known as a terrible language and people just love php memes pretty much you put php in a meme and you're gonna get a lot of votes client expectations client budget this is not really even a programming meme it's like a consulting or freelance meme but anyway how it works is you know the client's just like i want you to build the next facebook clone and i have this twenty dollars i've been spending on weebly.com and i was hoping you could build that for me when i transfer over the 20 to your account friends how did you write this code so beautifully me proudly i stole it this is actually just the reality of being a programmer you're going to be copying say 90 of your code from either documentation stack overflow github your other code base or your co-workers code or somebody else's code you're just going to be copying code and then tweaking some things and that is what it is to be a programmer my code before refactoring my code after refactoring you know when you're like cooking something and you're like you know what i'll just have like a little bit of spice here and see what happens and then at the end it just tastes like dog poop well that sometimes happens with your code as well stay at 127.0.0.1 where a 255.255.255.0 just kidding that's not how you're actually supposed to read the meme in programmer speak you'd actually read this as stay at home wear a mask the first part the 127 thing is the address you would actually put into your browser if you were like developing a local website on your computer so that's how i knew it was home and the second one i was just guessing that was a mask i don't know anything about networking and i'm just uh yeah problems with recursion question mark please take one he takes a bit what the he looks at the bit problems with recursion question mark please take one how do i explain recursion i guess you can think of recursion kind of like going in a circle but each time it gets smaller as you go around the circle and so the idea is the comic started and ends at the same place but the whole strip gets smaller every time you you pull it yeah okay me declares a variable x my ide field x is never used me will you shut up man when programmers are coding they use this thing called an ide which is a program that you can type into it's kind of like a fancy word document and it'll give you like you know little underlines when you're doing stuff wrong kind of like when you like misspell a word in word document it does the same thing but the thing is they give you feedback really fast so before you even have a chance to finish it's already barking at you that you're doing something wrong and so yeah that's what that was about don't mess with me my boyfriend is a programmer he'll hack your world into oblivion the boyfriend how to declare variables in html you can't declare variables in html and even if her boyfriend was good at programming like 95 percent of good programmers have no idea how to hack myself included so no i can't hack your friend's facebook account all right i'm kind of done looking at these memes unsurprisingly it was kind of less fun explaining programming memes hmm who would have guessed it oh well guys i'll uh see in the next one you
