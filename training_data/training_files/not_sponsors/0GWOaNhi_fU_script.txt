hello everyone and welcome to finally another video of autopilots testing now we've been in lockdown for close to two months now and I wasn't able to drive or test any of the updates I've got a couple of them so right now we are at 20 20.12 dot 11.1 and let's see what's what now one thing I noticed in the past couple of updates is that when you are behind a car at a traffic light for example and that car in front of you accelerates then my car follows a lot more aggressively I would say even to the point where you can feel the car in front of you shift in gears now let's see what it does at the bottom here oh wow yeah that is really searching for the Centers of that Lane after the middle lane marking disappears so that has definitely gotten worse now here we are coming up as usual to that s-curve it's not looking too busy in terms of traffic it's still early morning and so-called rush hour but due to the semi log down there's still not a lot of people on the road at the moment so that's good now let's see what the core does in this update will it still go over the line yes or no it's not slowing down it is going over the line keeping it in check rather quickly but again here going to the center line beeping again because of the limitation of the stupid UN ECE rules and here again I had to intervene because that guy was cutting over the line on the inside so yeah no changes here it's it's just those stupid rules that need to change to keep the car in check or Tesla needs to slow down way before going into that turn which it has done before it was just before New Year's I believe that it actually worked that way and for some reason it doesn't anymore now let's see if we want to merge here on the highway what it will do there there's the truck on my left I'm going to accelerate a little bit I need to manually initiate so that's already good let's see if it continues to blink note that seems to be gone that seems to be gone so in the previous updates it started blinking all on its own when you were there in that first lane for some reason it was still taking you were on the on-ramp so yeah so here we have a sign no unnecessary travel what I'm actually doing right now is I'm going to pick up my tires at my parents place where they are stored for the winter and then I'm going to put the arachnids back on finally so the car will again look the part and since we need to travel to Antwerp anyway I thought that was this was a good opportunity to you once more test the update since I'm doing most of the most of the routes along my test route anyways coming back later this morning so yeah that was a nice opportunity to finally do another test now let's see how well the outer exit staking works a bit jerky but yeah I mean this that doesn't seem to be a change so far I'm going to test it later on with another exit when I'm coming back actually I need to take this exit as well so let's see if there's any difference I've never tested this one this is also a gradual one let's see how it works it seems it's waiting a little bit then going on to the exit but then it takes too long to find a road and then it shifts another time so it's kind of like in two motions that it takes these kinds of exits are in a few hundred meters I need to take the exit I'm on a highway so it's going to take the exit automatically I'm not driving the 120 kph that I'm supposed to because I'm behind this truck but it's a heart exit it's a small one another one but it goes immediately to the side so let's see how the car reacts yeah each and every time it does that I think it's going to hit the barrier so I don't have the nerve to to let it do its thing because I know it reacts too slow to certain changes but yeah that is something that still needs to improve with regards to the automatic exit taking all right we've got a bunch of trucks here so let's see if I slow down a little bit what the car will do if I go from the dirt lane to the second lane so let's see if it still detects the truck in the second lane instead of in the first lane so starting now yep it still hesitates and thinks the truck is in the second lane then stops the manoeuvre and then says oh it isn't and then continues the manoeuvre so Tesla that is still something you urgently need to fix so something else I noticed is that yeah here we go that the weaving is back again so now it's weaving a little bit to the middle going left again I really don't like that behavior I've got people complaining about getting seasick in the car so yeah it was gone in the previous updates but now it's back again unfortunately let's see for the exits taking so unfortunately I can't take it at 120 kph because of this truck in front of me but let's see if it takes it's rather well so again the slope opening exits yeah so it's again in two times it's going right stays in the middle a little bit then going right again also here that's oh that's turning way too late Wow I get a feeling that the exit taking has gotten worse let's see if it takes the second exit here still no end of navigation autopilot okay so it should take the exit yeah all right it disengaged starter pilots but before that it was taking the exit again so the ending of navigate on autopilot has been moved back to the intersection instead of what we had before was somewhere halfway around the off-ramp slight improvement there although it doesn't take the exit completely automatic because of navigate on autopilot or autopilot in general disengaging ok up ahead we have the lane shift let's hope we have a green light and we can continue and there's no car cutting me off that looks like I'll have to try and accelerate through it there's no car behind me so I'll take a little bit more distance right here we go give me autopilot okay accelerating through seventy here we go yep that's okay it's not as close to the edge as the previous update was that I tested so that's a little bit better and yeah it still is a little bit lazy in the corners which is in this case kind of like human driving so yeah for me that's good right now and now for the final test where the lane markings disappeared completely and let's see how close it gets to those cars as well that's rather close but still doing it okay let's see how quickly it goes to the side almost immediately but with little jiggle so the last update was a little bit better let me slow it down here let's see how it takes the intersection and not to bat I see if we can continue all the way up to that little divider but it has never been really able to take it so again slowing down for the intersection here foot on the brake no car coming okay let's see if we can take this at 30 kilometres an hour yeah okay it actually did that and now let's see the last time I was able to hold autopilot all the way to the end it went to the left side of the road here so let's see where it wants to go now no okay it stays on the correct side of the road so that is definitely an improvement compared to the last time I was able to test it all the way up to that point all right time for another conclusion so what can we say about this update now there's been a couple of updates in between so we make quite a big jump from the last one that I made until now unfortunately the changes that are in here are tiny still so first of all we have a little bit worse of a situation on the downhill section where it loses the center lane marking there it goes way more to the left before finding the lane again so it should be easy or fairly easy to just determine that this is just a path that is going straight on but that's been yeah like a problem for ages now and this law does not seem to be able to fix that as for the s-curve there's no change there maybe a little bit more aggressive that it slows down when it detects it is going over the line but the culprit there is still the UN ECE r79 regulations and yes far as I know the next meeting is only in September and maybe then it will be approved to get higher lateral g-forces but before that I don't expect any improvement on that level as for the out the auto exit taking there is a slight improvement there in the sense that when I took the last exit it was actually still capable of doing the secondary exit on the exit itself or on the off-ramp whereas it used to be able to do that in the first updates but then it quickly got reduced to halfway the off-ramp and then navigate an autopilot will just stop working at that point so again we're going up to the intersection which is good although it's not able to take the exit by itself an autopilot was disengaged I tried it a couple of times and each and every time it disengaged so yes some work to do there but it is a slight improvement on that level other than that we still have that section where it loses the lane marking so the last test that I do it's it's going both ways there it was a little bit more jittery when lane markings disappeared but it kept to the right side of the lane and it actually made that small s-curve there or that small lane shift with the divider in the middle although I was really scared it was going to scratch my rims because it is a really narrow section but in the end the only time I was able to test it up until there it took the left side of the road now it stayed on the right side so that is also an improvement that we can mark here yeah other than that pretty much the same stuff remember I'm still on autopilot 2.0 I've lost multiple times to get the FSD upgrade that I'm out so far it is not the only answer that they give me is your call it your car is being called based on VIN number and we are prioritizing autopilot 2.5 and MCU two cars they have no clue when autopilot 2.0 and MCU one cars are going to be upgraded if any of you guys have an autopilot 2.0 with MCU one that have been upgraded please let me know in the comments I would like to have a chat with you but also yeah so it's it's undetermined when I we'll be able to finally get the upgrade that I paid for right now over three and a half years ago but anyways as usual if you
