months for free at the link in the description this is a story about one of my favorite albums by perhaps the most beloved rapper of all time it begins in late 2013 when Kanye West sat down to write his seventh record hot off the release of his harsh industrial masterpiece Jesus the album would change immensely over the course of three years but when it was finally finished four months after release in fact we were left with one of the most powerful statements Kanye had ever made the life of Pablo let's start at the beginning it's June 2013 and Kanye is at a transitional point in his life his first daughter was born three days before the release of yeezus and intentionally off-putting album full of industrial beats hyper sexuality and humongous ego the album was effectively Kanye's bachelor party engaged and with a baby to take care of the new responsibilities and expectations thrust upon him would change his life and his music forever the first song Kanye released after Jesus called only one was a collaboration with Paul McCartney the rock star provided electronically manipulated backing vocals and keyboards to the single Kanye claims that he had no recollection of singing The Ballad and that his mother's spirit had channeled through him to address his year-old daughter north though the single never made it to an album it set the tone for the next stage of Kanye's career the first version of Kanye's seventh album to be announced was called so help me God in addition to only one the singles all day and for five seconds supported the album none of these songs actually made it onto the final record but Kanye and about 60 of his closest friends famously performed all day at the 2015 Brit Awards the album's title was changed to swish and later waves before the final title the life of Pablo was announced just days before release the album's final cover art was released in advance as well and it presented us with a microcosm of Kanye's mind the cover art depicts a wedding and a swimsuit model juxtaposed against each other while the phrases the life of Pablo and which one composed the background of the image when the art was first revealed it actually got a lot of backlash from people they compared it to Kanye's cover art from albums past and called it lazy and minimalistic but despite its a simple flat design the cover of the life of Pablo actually communicates exactly what it needs to this album finds Kanye at a crossroads for the first time in his career he's forced to face his own personality habits and desires the life of Pablo was heard by the public for the first time at Madison Square Garden On February 11th 2016 just three days before it was released to the general public Kanye brought with him to the event the Kardashians push fatigue Kid Cudi Travis Scott and thousands of attendees the event would become one of Kanye's most iconic moments to date a truly triumphant victory for a rapper turned fashion designer turned fine artist and if Jesus is Kanye's bachelor party Pablo is the hangover having a family changes people and for someone like Kanye West this transition was no easy pill to swallow on Pablo he constantly looks both back at his old ways and forward to his new life of responsibility and stability the 9th track I love Kanye addresses his new lifestyle directly reflecting on the many ways his perception has changed over the years the title of the life of Pablo tells us a lot about the album as well the name Pablo doesn't refer to any one specific right off the bat but the few Pablos that do come to mind all relate to Kanye in one way or another Kanye actually went on record to talk about the meaning of the album's title in early 2016 he said the Apostle Paul inspired and was the strongest influencer of Christianity Pablo Escobar was the biggest mover of product and Pablo Picasso was the biggest mover of art and that mix between message art and product is the life of Pablo one of the album's defining characteristics is that for once it wasn't musically experimental Kanye's first six albums were leaps and bounds ahead of their predecessors he seemed to have innovation down to a science but Pablo instead is a greatest hits of sorts it combines all the musical styles of Kanye's previous work into one big sprawling landscape at 20 tracks he explores more styles on one project than ever before ultra light beams gospel choir sounds like something straight out of late registration while wolves could have easily been cut from eases despite Pablo's less outlandish sound its format is wholly unique even six months after its release Kanye continued updating songs isolating vocals changing lines updating mixes and even finally adding an entirely new song to the album the retro actively added Saint Pablo focuses on Kanye's insecurities and inner thoughts as well as his perspective on his own public perception with the help of Sam FFA's singing on the hook Saint Pablo is an incredibly powerful and lucid moment for Kanye West but I think perhaps the most important moment on the entire album is the two-part song father stretch my hands if the four minute composition starts as a gospel song about hooking up with models turns into a deeply emotional dance track focusing on the death of Kanye's mother and then turned into a mash-up of the smash hit panda featuring humble rapper desiigner it ends with a calming vocoder passage tying the song together in a way that in my mind represents the spirit of the album as a whole us lost myself job and Fez lost control of the world jealous bro member we are was broke member the life of Pablo captures Kanye's life in writing and sound his massive ego his faith his family and friends his hyper sexuality and obsession with women even his love for his mother all of that and more is present as a result that album is often called mess innovative but if there's any larger theme behind the variety of ideas present on Pablo it's this Kanye reflects on the importance of faith family and love the album is soulful and radiant yet in many ways plagued by Kanye's past and of course his ego in a way Pablo is his road to redemption but at the same time it captures the ugliest parts of his psyche even while he domesticates himself Kanye remains deeply flawed somewhat disturbed and almost definitely a maniac but I think we all know exactly what he would say to that name one genius then a crazy the description will get two months of unlimited access for free you
