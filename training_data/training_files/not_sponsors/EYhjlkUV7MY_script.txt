gotta say goodbye to the a dream so we can start the video bye welcome to the only sub class that has a random effect table that helps [ __ ] up any situation it's added to before we even consider exploring the 50 possible events that can occur let's take a quick step back sorcerers are defined as people who magic yeah there was no variation in magic when they came up with all the names for magic users here's the two types of real world magic seems about right the clouds today say that you're going to have seven children and then be gored by a boar at the age of 35 this is 100% true because God said it in the clouds whoa dude that's crazy she got cutted in a half house it did God do that what happened but sorcerers in D&D are well okay they're magic people but unlike Wizards who learn [ __ ] from books like ugly nerds or warlocks who have magic sugar daddies sorcerers have a buttload of powerful magic and no idea where it came from sometimes it's a spectacular event sometimes your great grandpappy put his great grand peepee in a dragon and sometimes a fairy pooped within 30 feet of you when you were born and now you can cast fireball three times in a row wild magic sorcerers have the widest variety of origins maybe your mom rolled in at 20 on a pregnancy check maybe your current cut became a portal to the ever turning chaos and you drank raw magic or possibly you ignored the green sages advice went to Misty Island and smacked into a vat of dark eco whatever happened to you pumped your poop cheeks full of raw magic and now I'm making a video about you let's look at the incredible magic boons that are unique to you starting with something called the tides of chaos you get to roll advantage once a day easy roller isn't that exciting no but we stick to it because advantage is easier to track than 3.5 skill modifier tables I think this ability kind of works like Domino's superpower represented very well in Deadpool 2 where good things just happen to you like receiving an actual Domino's pizza that you didn't order it's a supreme once you've mastered that incredible skill of advantage you get another ability a pile of dog [ __ ] in your lap sorcerer's have this extra little pool of magic called sorcery points a deep churning wellspring of magic and intestinal gas that lies deep within you and you get one point per level it's like key but harder to use but this new ability allows you to throw two of those points in the trash and pick up a d4 when someone else does a thing you can add or subtract the d4 roll to that thing you know like guidance the cantrip that's free I understand that they're banking on probability manipulation but giving us a d4 is like handing you a cold hot dog to fight a lion as a wild magic sorcerer I only know one thing for certain I'm going to die now we're in high-level territory which means only NPCs can do this stuff at a certain point in power when you cause wild magic hiccups you get to pick what happens well that's that's not that's not entirely true the dice picked two options for you and you can select from that catalogue and lastly nearing the paragon of sorceress power when you roll good on spell damage you get to roll even gooder I want to give creative non-mechanical descriptions to these abilities because they're really interesting in concept but in practice this class is just like playing a dice accountant okay so the appeal of this class comes from the wild magic table when you cast a spell you roll another die because that's this whole class on the 5% chance they Rolla one unrelated to the success of the spell that you cast you get to have fun or explode but as a variant laced within your other abilities the dungeon master can either bombard you with wild magic or never let anything who will happen Dungeon Master's have more control over wild magic sorcerers than the sorcerers do themselves it kind of makes sense actually all right kids buckle your seat belts because we're gonna surge not the Mountain Dew knockoff from the 90s we're gonna Wild Magic surge knocking off effects that multiply amplify or alter the spells that you cast on purpose let's get started you can suddenly see invisible creatures for a minute I didn't ask for this a funny ma drone appears next to you dicks around and then leaves you explode seven magic missiles fly out of your bum and kill your loved ones you know when your grandma hasn't seen you for like ten months and acts like you grew 10 inches that actually happens you get stupid brain you feel better you get a bird beard and the next time you sneeze the beard explodes outward and you have to get a skin graft you get covered in grease your skin color just inverts you get a third eye you teleport over there you go to space for six seconds a d-10 shifts your age up or down a few years you summon a family of flumps and scare the [ __ ] out of them and then they leave you feel better you make that joke from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy and turn into a potted plant for a few seconds you can teleport over here and then over there and then Oh a minutes up you levitate a unicorn shows up for a minute to Gore you while spouting wisdom your words become pink bubbles for a minute the shield of faith defends you from the fiery darts of the wicked you go on a magic detox that makes alcohol not fun for a month you go bold and then grow your hair right back like in Evan Almighty you get the Midas touch but it's it's fire instead of gold you turn into morgues and can't stop screaming instead of talking like a normal person the fog Zuse does you a solid and kills three people with lightning you get a scared boom everyone around you becomes invisible guys everything hurts less for a minute you make someone sick [Music] you become a glowing one for a bit you become a sheep you unlock a cosmetic with particle effects you get a free action you do Vladimir's AOE drain you get fake clones that take hits for you [Music] somebody nearby grows wings and flies away he can find you vanish you cheat death but only if you die really soon you do the mario mushroom waha you and everyone around you become susceptible to piercing damage but shouldn't this one be at 69 you hear the first 60 seconds of holy stone by smell you get all your idiot points back and that's basically Wild Magic you guys have no idea how uncomfortable it is to film alone I'm uncomfortable easy roller dot high six even he likes yeah let's see what he rolls well [ __ ] it sucks you were supposed to get a six it's not a supreme much at Fuji Walt it's some weird what I made it no it came in the mail we're not liars a promise do you want our hot dog are you a wizard his wisdom will forever remain a secret is the dumbest [ __ ] thing I've ever done there are literally two guys on bikes they keep passing through I want to kill myself you you
