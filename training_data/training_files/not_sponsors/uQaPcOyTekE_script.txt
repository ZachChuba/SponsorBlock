so basically as soon as my update had completed I just took the car out and drove it for about 20 miles or so I just did a loop around the house I split things up in two sections the first couple clips are stop signs and then the last several of them are red lights and so this is my first stop roughly about five or six hundred feet in it's it's telling me it's gonna stop at the stop sign and it does so perfectly for me to engage or go again I tap down on the gear selector and then it picks up and goes again I noticed that it was a little slow on pickup compared to just regular autopilot following a car and so that's just one thing I noticed on this test drive around the house here so this is a second stop sign you get the new notification right in the middle of the screen there it's red it's saying that it's gonna stop for you and I tried a couple different ways I try clicking on the clear gear selector and also tapping on the gas this one the gear selector was pressed down and it starts starts back up again as you can see it does pick up kind of slow and then eventually it picks up to the proper speed this is the third stop this is kind of a weird stop it's kind of a dead in but it does have a stop sign on it and so autopilot it's on it's telling me it's gonna stop and it does stop before the line but the car kind of moves around not knowing where to go and so it moves me to the right here for some reason and for me I just bust a u-turn because I don't need to go right I'm just gonna go back home so I didn't have too many other Clips with stop sign but for me I think stop signs are easier to program for their static there they stay in the same location and they don't change color and so that's all I have for stop sign let's take a look at some lights we're approaching the first stoplight here I get to indicate a right in the middle that it's gonna stop at the red light and the light is red right now and it's slowing down there is a car in front of me showing me to slow down and so I haven't hit the lever or I haven't pressed the gas or anything like that and if you don't it won't go anywhere as you can see here like I thought it was gonna go but it doesn't go and then the light turns yellow and then turns red and so I'm basically stuck at a light now so at every intersection you have to give a confirmation for it to go if you don't give the confirmation it won't go for you even if the light is green and traffic is flowing it's gonna slow down for you so I think the way Tesla has a kind of program or the logic that they kind of use is the driver has to calm it has to confirm that hey I'm gonna make the confirmation that the car is going to go through this light whatever the whatever the light is yellow or green the driver has to confirm and so I think that's safer for them so I hit the down lever and I pick up and go so we're approaching a light here and the road kind of splits into both flat left and right turn and then it looks like it's putting me in the left turn I don't do anything I don't have a navigator on autopilot or anything on right now but it does come to the stop sign and stops at the light and again I have to click on the lever and it picks up again but it doesn't know where to go and so I have to take control and then tell it to go left or right wherever I want to go okay so a different intersection here let's see it notices that the lights coming up and it starts to slow me down and this one I'm the first car there is no lead car I do stop right before the line I'm noticing is stopping maybe about two to three feet right before the line on on several of these stop sign or red light turns or red light in general once it turns green I got a tap down for it to engage and pick up and go again but there is another light right up there I was kind of lucky I found these red light can all after one one after the other it's a red light again it stops and it comes up to line a couple feet away from the line it stops so on this one the light turns green and I was about to hit the lever but then I realized maybe I should try to tap on the gas or the go pedal and I tapped on a gas river pedal in it and it took off like I said the take off is still a little slow to me I think that's going to improve over time what one the other thing to note is whatever the speed limit is and that's what it's going to do it doesn't go any faster than what the speed limit does and so this one I hit the lever I think because this is like my day one of it hitting the lever makes a little more sense to me but as I get more comfortable with it I'm probably gonna tap the gas and that probably makes more sense later on once I feel more comfortable but just for today the lever I think I feel more comfortable with the lever today so I get the notification it's gonna slow down and the lever again or the gear selector so this was one of the very few yellow lights I ran through if you take a look at the screen the yellow comes through a lot brighter than it normally does and I think this was my only yellow light that I ran but to me that's something I notice right away instead of just a circle dot it was a big square yellow flashing on the screen and so that visual changed a little bit compared to the previous software update on this one I came to up to stop sign there's no leak our stop right in front of line and then I tapped on the gas for it to kind of pick up and go so this light here as I'm approaching it it's green but because I'm not giving that confirmation my car starts to slow down and it turns yellow and then the car finally slows down if I was coming through there pretty quickly like at 30 or 40 miles per hour if I gave it that second tap for it to confirm the girl across that green or yellow light I think it would've went but because this is still kind of new to me I didn't know what to do and so I didn't tap it to confirm and now I'm stuck at a now I'm stuck at a red light where this one I probably didn't need to be stuck here because I could a confirm it could have went so I tapped on the gas pedal and it's going again so you can see from this one I'm pretty far out but I get the notification right away five 600 feet away that it's gonna stop at this light and it does come to stop because the light is red so like in all previous example assualt stops right before the white line and when it turns green I'll give it the confirmation and then I get a take off but I'm not taking off as fast as that guy right there he's doing by pretty quickly so I got a couple more examples here this one's in 2x just because it's pretty smooth as I'm approaching this I tap on the gas pedal and I come right through the green light no issues there and there's another one coming up here I do the same thing I get the notification I tap on the gas pedal and then I go right through without any issues again there is that speed limit once it's set at 45 then it's stuck in 45 it doesn't go over the speed limit so what are my final thoughts on this new update and for me like even in small roles like this I use navigation never get on auto pilot or autopilot all the time and so even on small roads like this like my autopilot is on and I hate that I have to stop at a red light and before 12.6 or 20/20 12.6 I would have to stop by myself with this update it's doing that for me the only weird thing for me on day one is that on day one you have to tap at the intersections where when you were on when we're on 12.5 we didn't have to tap if a car was going 45 and we're following the car and we're going through the intersection we didn't have to do anything now we have to give them give it that confirmation which is probably weird day one but as we as we start to use this more often it's probably not going to be too it's not going to be weird it's kind of like doing that lane change and always having to give it the slight wiggle to show that hey I'm still here you can do that lane change and so for me in all the examples today it all stopped at the red light it all stopped at the stop sign I didn't have any issues with any of them for the most part it was pretty smooth the slowing down was I didn't have any complaints about the slowing down as well too I think my only feedback is the the picking up and going from a stop or a red light that seems slow and that could improve over time so I guess that's my only feedback or a complaint or opportunity with with this new update that they have here again that's all for today thanks for watching if it was go ahead and hit that thumbs up thanks bye
