the story of Travis Scott is brought to you by wicks [Music] Travis Scott is hip-hop's newest superstar he dropped the fifth biggest album of 2018 he has a kid with a billionaire businesswoman and his public perception is unanimously positive but where did he come from today I'm going to tell the story of Travis Scott from his humble beginnings in Houston making beats to his big break as a producer on Kanye's cruel summer in 2012 all the way to his appearance at the 2019 Superbowl halftime show let's get into it [Music] Travis Scott whose real name is Jacques Webster was born in Houston Texas in 1992 Travis and his parents and his siblings lived with his grandmother in a small house on the southeast side of the city it wasn't a great neighborhood in a rolling stone interview Travis talked about the crack dealing neighbors stealing his lawnmower among other bizarre happenings [Music] [Applause] now force aimed at stopping a decades-old problem street racing officers say in recent months they've seen rise in crashes some of them deadly here's Chris Martinez but it wasn't all bad when Travis was just three years old his father started teaching him how to play the drums and the piano one of his uncle's was involved in the making of a platinum album and his other uncle Travis plays bass Travis Scott's grandfather was a jazz musician with a PhD in philosophy it was the perfect recipe to create the superstar musician that Travis Scott would eventually become during high school Travis developed confidence and an entertaining presence by acting in plays he also has a passion for film and his favorite movie The Breakfast Club would be inspirational towards a lot of his early musical style Travis listened to a lot of Bjork Portishead Kanye and Kid Cudi Travis graduated high school a year early and he enrolled in the University of Texas at San Antonio he was a good student but he still wanted to pursue music full-time in his sophomore year at college he dropped out without telling his parents and went to New York City to make music Travis used the money that his parents gave him for textbooks and food to buy plane tickets and studio time he stayed with various producers and musicians while in New York City sleeping on floors and couches and working late nights to get recognition from any sort of industry professional but after four months Travis felt he wasn't getting anywhere in the city he went to LA with a friend who after some difficulties left him with no contacts and no money at the same time Travis's parents paid him a surprise visit in San Antonio only to find out he had dropped out months beforehand they cut him off financially turning his phone off and letting him know he wasn't welcome in their home anymore Travis was broke and alone without a cell phone thousands of miles away from anyone he knew the urgency to succeed was exactly what Travis needed he started posting more and more music online while he stayed at a friend's dorm at USC before long he got an invite to visit TI's studio where t I told him that he loved Travis's sound and to keep working hard around the same time Travis started making money off his beats selling to different publishers around la he was living in a hotel room paid for by a generous ANR and the pressure to find a stable living was increasing daily while Travis was living in the hotel room an audio engineer working with Kanye West called and asked Travis to hop on a plane and meet the rapper in New York City Travis stayed in New York for the entire recording of 2012's cruel summer and he ended up having a big part in the production of the record all without having released a single mixtape [Music] due to trouble clearing samples and a general desire to capitalize on the success of cruel summer Travis delayed the release of his debut mixtape our Pharoah until the spring of 2013 as opposed to the original release date of late 2012 thanks to the success of singles leading up to the mixtape and his production work on cruel summer Travis was named one of the 2013 XXL freshmen his mixtape came out just two months later and he was quickly recognized as a promising talent in the hip-hop scene he was seen as a protege of Kanye West and the trap seen as a whole el faro was dark inconsistent southern hip hop he was made possible by a wide range of collaborators production credits on the mixtape include Travis himself Mike Dean Kanye West and many more vocal features include boney bear 2 Chainz Meek Mill and ASAP Ferg owl Pharoah was nominated for best mixtape at the 2013 ve T Hip Hop Awards despite his success Travis was in a difficult place after the release of Aleph arrow there are lots of XXL freshmen that released one good mixtape or album and then they fall off hard I mean take a look at the 2015 list besides vince staples not a single rapper from that year is even slightly relevant in 2019 regardless of why this happens to XXL freshmen and it's probably because XXL is bad at picking rappers there's always a lot of pressure on artists to come up with something great after they're suddenly thrown into the spotlight it's hard to make sure that your second mixtape or album is more exciting and entertaining than the first after all you have 20 plus years to make your first mixtape and only one year to make your second but Travis blew everyone's expectations out of the water he dropped days before rodeo his second mixtape just a year after a loaf era the mixtape was better developed produced and engineered than his first its production was still grimy and dark but it didn't sound nearly as amateurish where alph arrow sounded somewhat tired and ragged knees which I'm sure was influenced by Travis's living situation at the time days before rodeo is stylish and smooth even some fans consider it their favorite Travis project to this day days before rodeo saw a huge jump in the quality of his music and it's at Travis up as a rapper who was just personal enough to avoid destruction by old heads despite a few laid-back and autobiographical cuts the mixtape used trap instrumentation to achieve a more broadly popular appeal I think that even this early on in his career Travis was a diverse and talented enough rapper that he could have explored a more lyrical or a more trap angle but what helped him truly grow and move into the mainstream was a powerful mixture of both days before rodeo showed that Travis was a diverse artist with a lot of ideas and a good ear for popular aesthetics Travis's next move on his rise to superstardom was his first studio album rodeo Travis had been teasing rodeo for a long time releasing days before rodeo as a prequel mixtape was a great move for building hype and the years following rodeo it became considered one of the best if not the best trap albums of all time after years of experimentation and hard work Travis finally found his sound he may lack the technical lyrical ability to stand among hip hop's all-time greatest but there's no doubt that Travis is a genius when it comes to creating moods and carrying a beat rodeo proved to fans that Travis wasn't going anywhere but up even if it failed to convince critics that he was unique pitchfork criticized rodeo harshly for being unoriginal they called Travis a middling talent who couldn't keep up with his peers but it had the opposite effect on fans rodeo created Travis Scott's cult fanbase it's full of references to his youth his hometown and most of all his newfound lifestyle of nihilistic luxury I would say that rodeo is almost like lyrical rap for someone whose lifestyle is dedicated to glorifying the excessive nature of trap music the album is massive every moment of the record twists and turns around in an acidic psychedelic landscape of sound it's entirely possible that Travis and the trap music genre as a whole we never exceed the brilliant creativity of the cinematic masterpiece that is rodeo but Travis made a few missteps after his debut he announced his third album Astroworld before his second album even came out and when his second album birds in the trap sang McKnight finally dropped a lot of critics didn't enjoy it that much the album sold well but it just didn't compare to rodeo Travis went through a heavy trap phase and while the record produced a few hits there weren't that many memorable lyrics compared to his previous record birds had a strong visual aesthetic and Travis released an awesome short film alongside it but we're rodeo and Astroworld are experimental and unique birds was kind of formulaic after the relative disappointment that was birds in the track all eyes turned towards Astroworld though the wait for it would be agonizingly long Astroworld was to be named after a Houston theme park that closed down while Travis was still in high school Travis talked about his reason for naming the album after a theme park in a 2018 interview he said that Astroworld was the real sequel to rodeo and birds in the trap was something he felt inspired to make and had to get out of the way before he could focus on his true second album the wait for astral world was dragged out even further when Travis announced a collab album with quavo in late 2016 it wouldn't come out until late 2017 and Chavez spent a lot of that year teasing both albums the quavo album turned out to be underwhelming and it was by pure strength of hype that Travis's reputation remained untarnished after two somewhat disappointing albums fans were both frustrated and relieved when it was finally revealed that Astroworld was almost finished in July 2018 Astroworld is the most Travis Scott thing that Travis Scott has ever made it's dark psychedelic and it has massive pop appeal he collaborated with came Impala Stevie Wonder Frank Ocean and many other musicians that are known for their unique styles the record has a mature expansive sound and it doesn't really play by the rules of the 2018 hip-hop zeitgeist instead it puts all of the rules together and the result is much greater than the sum of its parts even the title of the album is a statement in itself there's a never ending party in Travis Scott's head and he wants the real world to reflect that as well over the years Travis has become known for his insane and even sometimes dangerous live shows he was arrested for inciting a riot in 2017 when he told fans at a concert to rush the stage causing several injuries including that of a cop and a security guard when it comes to Travis Scott the party must go on no matter the cost during the birds in the track era Travis used a giant bird prop to float over the crowd while he and for the Astra World Tour he brings a rollercoaster to each performance Travis hosted an entire astral world themed Music Festival in Houston last November and he plans to do the same this year as well from the shoes he designs with Nike to the action figure he used throughout the rodeo era Travis is overflowing with creativity in the 2018 interview with Billboard he revealed a passion for sculptures and pop art in the future Travis wants to score movies study architecture and of course continue rapping unlike many of his peers Travis is far from a controversial figure especially now that he has a daughter and a girlfriend to think about that's what gets Travis a spot performing at the Superbowl that's what gets him on The Ellen Show to talk about Jamba Juice he's just as much a savvy businessman as he is an artist he knows that controversy won't help an artist and he avoids it unlike many clout rappers for whom controversy is the basis of their career Travis's social media is full of few pictures of him his girlfriend and their daughter stormy they paint a picture of wholesome family becoming sort of spiritual successors to jay-z Beyonce and Blue Ivy his girlfriend by the way has over 100 million followers on Instagram and I'm sure Astra worlds performance was boosted quite a bit when she promoted it on the day of release perhaps Travis's proudest accomplishment yet was when the mayor of Houston declared November 18th after a day in the city Travis looked overwhelmingly happy at the ceremony I think as a whole 2018 was the year that everything travis has been working towards finally paid off even though a lot of his hardcore fans feel like his masterpiece came out in 2015 timeless music isn't the only important aspect of the Travis Scott brand Travis gives back to the culture that made him he creates intense concert experiences unlike so many of today's rappers that have no idea how to put on a show he's been known to give tens of thousands of dollars to fans last year giving away $100,000 on Twitter as well as donating $100,000 to a nonprofit organization in Houston that gives kids access to technical and create of resources one of the terms of Travis's 2019 Super Bowl halftime performance was that the NFL donate $500,000 to a social justice charity even designed senior t-shirts for students at a high school in Houston Travis knows the value of good PR and he's used it much to his advantage developing a positive for the kids reputation over the last couple of years I can guarantee Travis wouldn't have ended up on Obama's favorite songs of 2017 list if you were running around getting arrested on petty crimes and beefing with everyone who looked at him wrong sicko mode Travis's first number one single is a psychedelic five minute journey featuring Drake the song has three beat switches and no conventional song structure and I think that's a good way to sum up what Travis stands for as a whole good PR skills bizarre psychedelic energy and a cautious fusion of current musical trends with his own grimy Southern heritage Travis's ambitions are huge his creative vision is twisted yet colorful and most importantly he has a good sense for business Travis Scott sits at the very edge of what mainstream music is capable of appreciated and because of that his art will undoubtedly outlast that of his peers good link in the description and upgrade your internet presence today [Music]
