greetings survivors and friends shadowfrax here with your weekly rust tipple and what a time to be alive it is because with only a few days to go until all servers are held down and forcibly wiped rust has received on staging branch at least the gift of tea and so we now have a new deployable item the mixing table something that's been floating around mysteriously in the commits for many weeks and has been the subject of much chin scratching but first please spank the subscribe button give the bell a hearty squeeze for me won't you also check you still subscribed as youtube has been up to its old tricks again recently anyway the table costs 200 frags and 100 stones has 500 health costs 500 scrap to research or can be bought from the bandits for 175 and requires a level 1 workbench to craft but let's talk about t because as an englishman i'm more than happy to and you'd be an idiot to throw this stuff in the harbour because it grants you buffs but more on that in a second the teas you make with this thing require berries rather than leaves and so to go along with this we've been graced with six new berry bushes which you'll find growing in the wild but which can also be grown in your own feces i mean bases there's red blue yellow green black and white and you simply swipe them like any other collectible which will give you both berries and seed because of course you've got so much empty space in your inventory and totally don't need a separate berry pouch or anything you can just nom them if you like which will give you five food and two water per berry but the real magic happens when you insert them into the bench you'll notice that it has five inventory slots and to make a tea with it you have to fill these up with specific berry combinations if you enter an invalid combo then it just won't do anything but the berries won't be consumed there are seven combos in total at the moment each one makes a tea which grants a specific buff for five minutes a pop you can make 20 at a time because that's the berry stack limit and they are as follows red red red yellow yellow makes max health tea which increases your max health surprise red in every slot makes healing tea and this restores your health over time yellow blue yellow blue yellow blue no yeah makes or tea which increases the amount of ore yield when mining red blue red blue red makes wood tea allowing you to get more wood than normal secret recipe for viagra there i think yellow white yellow white yellow i'm sure it will be a very popular one as the resulting scrap tea grants increased scrap yield red red red green green is rad removal tea for when you've taken a dose of the old glow in the dark red red green green green makes rad resistance t see if you can figure out what that does and up up down down left right left right b a and start doesn't do anything but it's good to memorize trust me now each of these t's grants a certain strength of buff which is all subject to change of course like everything here and i'll put the current details in the description however there's more because if you were to take five of a certain type of tea say scrap tea and combine these in the bench you'll refine them into the next tier up on the t scale so if normal scrap t gives you a plus ten percent yield then the next tier up advanced will give you plus 30 percent then you can repeat the process with advanced teas to produce a purity which in this case would up your scrap yield to plus 50 percent i mean usually if i want a stronger tea i just leave the bag in for longer but hey-ho just in case there's any confusion there were initially five tiers of t strength and there may still be on staging as i write this but this is being reduced to three some things to note at this juncture you can have multiple buffs active at once and if you look just here on your inventory screen you can see which ones they are but before you ask no you can't stack individual buffs by drinking multiple cups of the same brew all that will happen is that that particular buff's timer will be reset then you may get diarrhea but not even this is all because the mixing bench has yet another use let's see if you can work out what this little combination would make hmm that's right as long as you have the blueprint for it of course right here is another way to make explosives or i guess you could say gunpowder tea you still need a level 3 workbench to turn them into c4 of course but this does give an extra option with a different set of ingredients and makes compost bins much more attractive i can't emphasize this enough but i will say it again all of this is subject to change and we still have a week to go so there next a long-awaited boost to our sanity has finally been implemented on staging because now conditional roof corners are here what this means is instead of weird overlaps roofs should form nice neat angles on both exterior and interior joints there are two roof pieces now one for square foundations and a new one for triangles so make sure you use the correct piece and please note that at the moment not all shapes are supported for instance you can't do this one or a one by one square though and roofs will cost the same as floors in both build and upkeep now in other news bone arrows are having the thickness of their hitbox reduced by 30 although it's still double the size of normal arrows the horseshoe cave has received a significant nerf in that you can no longer build in the center building pocket boohoo cars received a number of tweaks this week including better hill climbing capabilities with 25 more low speed power and 7 more grip on all surfaces there were a few other fixes including one for getting dismounted from a mini copter whilst flying low over the airwolf vendor on happis supply drops flying away after getting hit with projectiles and modular cars and minicopters becoming unusable after loading from a save if it was made during engine startup oh yes and picture frame glass isn't quite as dark and dingy in works in progress the boat shop monument is receiving a lot of love with a few new props being created for that nautical fields such as anchors fishing nets oars and barrels and last week i mentioned new midi mapping convars to allow us to control cinematic effects through either hardware or software devices and as promised there's now a full write-up on how to accomplish this over on the rust wiki and i'll put the link to it in the description for you please leave a like keep calm and stay rusty cheerio blue no yeah
