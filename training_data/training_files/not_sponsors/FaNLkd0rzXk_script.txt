[Music] [Applause] um [Music] [Applause] so a lot of you probably remember dan from the youtube channel what's inside he used to live really close to me so we'd hang out and do videos and projects and stuff all the time but he moved away and uh with 2020 we haven't seen each other a whole lot and i'm sure he misses all of our adventures together so what i've decided to do is 3d print a 4 000 pound statue of myself out of concrete and plop it next to his pool at his new house so he doesn't feel so lonely let's get started so let me explain how all of this works normally a massive 3d concrete printer isn't used to do statues but we're taking some liberties with the technology usually you would see the designs being used in landscape architecture or commercial facades or even sometimes structural columns the possibilities are kind of endless structural elements or even custom furniture with a printable area of 17 feet by 13 feet by 12 feet there's a lot of space to work with let me explain how the whole printer works so we start with this massive shelf of dry mortar which gets forked lift into this machine right here which is a hopper the hopper takes that dry powder coming down through this machine and up through the screw into this massive silo the silo is what holds most of the powder until the printing starts all the powder comes down here to the bottom and then once again gets corkscrewed up into the top still dry powder up there and then comes down to this blue machine here we know we can't make concrete out of dry powder so it comes down here to the powder dosing unit where the add mixture and the water get added together to make the mortar what's interesting is that the water itself is actually chilled because when the concrete is mixed together it's an exothermic reaction which generates a lot of heat and that cooler water helps in the printing process then the mortar pump takes it along this tube here up into this machine the giant gantry where all of the action happens this long arm right here is actually called the printer head and it's where the concrete is dosed so as you can tell it's quite a bit more complicated than your average 3d printer with all of the temperature and the chemicals and the concrete being pumped into this massive machine i think it's going to turn out pretty cool to get the correct proportions and dimensions for my body we had to 3d scan myself by taking a camera and circling myself multiple times and then inputting that video file into a program that could digitally map the data points into a 3d image which turned it into a pretty decent rendering of my body we had to clean it up and polish it up for the final rendering but the final statue is going to be a pretty good representation of me it took michelangelo about two years to make the david statue we're gonna do it here in about two hours so we're gonna start by printing the legs and we're gonna print it in three separate sections we could go just from the ground all the way to the top but since this is super complex we decided to stay on the safe side and just assemble it after the fact we're in utah right now and you can actually see mister surrounding the whole printing area because it's so dry we have to keep the concrete moist as it's printing printhead is getting lined up with the palette where we'll be printing on you can see the laser right there which is keeping the track of where the printhead is going to be just making sure there's no obstructions right now before it starts printing right now the printer is just spewing out the first little bit of concrete just so that it's going to be a clean and uniform mixture as it starts with my legs and this is all moving in real time the printer is actually this fast so right here we see my left foot and my right foot and then we have a center structure in the middle to keep the whole thing supported as we are printing we're putting sand right here inside of the feet because as the feet come over the top of themselves there needs to be some kind of support inside of it to help keep it structural as it's building up so the printer right now is moving up and down the gantry as well as this shaft here can go up and down as the legs are being built we have the mortar being pumped up through the black hose coming down and then we have the activator being pumped in right at the same time next to the nozzle the activator being pumped in next to the nozzle is what makes the concrete cure or harden super fast so that each of these layers can support each other as they go up you can see the sand here doing its job supporting the layers as the top of my shoe gets created once we get about to my ankles the statue will start to support itself and the sand will no longer be needed and when we lift the whole thing up the sand will just come out the bottom and everything happening at the exact same time produces a successful print you can see the exothermic reaction happening on top of the concrete right now as the steam comes off of it and the moisture in the air from these misters is what helps keep that from cracking and allows it to dry at the correct rate so we've been going for about 10 minutes now you can see that we're almost up to my knees we can see the massive center support between my legs and the concrete is still coming out nice and neat it's going to be hollow all the way through the inside and normally you can just leave a print just like that but since we're going to transport it four hours on the freeway we are going to fill this up with concrete which makes it heavier but also makes it so that it won't break while we're traveling with it we want to surprise dan with a complete statue and not a pile of gravel still kind of blows my mind the level of detail we're able to get out of the concrete printing you can see the kind of wrinkles from where my pants were when we did the scanning the statue itself isn't even printing like directly in one straight line it's building off of itself as it goes up which is super impressive we are just about done getting up there to the belt line give or take it's kind of crazy to see how tall this is my head is only coming to the beltline of the statue dan's gonna be so excited a bunch of water should start coming out of the nozzle here in a second which should clean it up and get it ready for our next print so you can see this trail right here is the original concrete line that kind of started the whole print and we can tell that it's already hardening which is much different than normal concrete because of that activator that's being added near the nozzle normal 3d printing with you know the plastic filament takes forever but this is surprisingly fast so now we are getting ready to print the second piece we have my legs over there and that circular shape you see right there is the base of the torso which is going to end up on top of my legs the cool thing about this facility is that this print area is on these rollers right here and the whole thing can just be conveyed out to a semi truck dock over there because this thing is gonna weigh around four or five thousand pounds when we're done and uh carrying it out by hand is gonna be difficult so it's good that we have a method of unloading it down here at the end of the dock you can tell this right here is my belt line and then this is where my hands were resting on my hip since the angle of my arm here is so intense we're going to prop it up with some foam really quick it's already kind of started to harden and solidify there's just a lot of weight as the arm builds up and comes out over here and so we're gonna make sure it doesn't crack along the seam while it has time to harden the rest of the way so the concrete printer has different nozzles this one is a 30 millimeter but they can go all the way up to 50 or all the way down to 20 depending on what the project requires 30 is just a good middle ground so now it's pretty easy to tell what it is this is my back with my arms right here off to the sides these inner cavities are what we're going to be punching out later oh yeah not too shabby turned out good you can kind of see the resemblance so it's interesting inside of here is actually kind of like a sauna it's all like steamy and humid because all of the heat that's escaping while it's curing or drying if we take the laser thermometer we can see that we are at 47 degrees while this one which has had a couple hours to cure is down at 35 already and these over here which have been done for a couple days now they're down about 22. so as the prints dry or cure they finish and get colder so now it's time to print the head and it's kind of the same basic concept as the feet since the curve of my shoulders is so tight we're adding some sand and foam underneath to kind of support the 3d print as it grows and that kind of layer construction is the same with any kind of 3d printing and the bigger the statue the easier it is to print the gradual angles since there's more room for the layers to build off each other that's why we decided to go with a 12 foot tall statue for dan's surprise even if it will weigh as much as an elephant when we're done see how close we can get to the profile i think i'm looking up like this it's kind of crazy and get that level of detail with concrete you can even see where my eyes and nose are this is insane almost there let's take a look at the head oh no should i grow a ponytail like that let me know down in the comments so obviously a statue standing on its own two legs isn't going to be super balanced so we need to build a base which will be about a foot tall and about four feet wide with sufficient mass to keep the statue upright while it's standing we're going to use a weave pattern which just kind of looks cool then we'll infill the base with concrete just like we're going to do the statue later along with some rebar and some anchor points for the crane when we lifted over dan's fence into the backyard so the prints are done they are stiff right now we're going to give them a couple more days to solidify before we infill them and transport them it's a while to be a couple days for us it'll just be a couple seconds for you so it is time to put myself together the concrete has had about three days to cure so it's not as hard as it's gonna be in like a week or so but it's hard enough that we can finally assemble myself on the base which already has concrete and rebar put in it so we can crane it over to dan's pool you know the gift he never wanted i do have some clear hose since it's gonna be next to dan's pool we're going to turn it into a fountain hopefully that works out but it should be a pretty fun day we're putting some plastic wrap around the leg so that the straps when we suspend it from the forklift don't rub up against the concrete [Music] so since i'm dropping this statue off at dan and lincoln's house from you know the youtube channel what's inside they're probably going to want to see what's inside the statue and i'm going to leave them a bunch of presents that'll blow their minds so this thing is much bigger than i initially anticipated um we have rebar down in the sides as well as bent down into the arms so when the concrete solidifies around the rebar it'll give it a bit more structure as we are transporting it four hours down to st george we're using quick set concrete so it solidifies in about 30 to 40 minutes and since we're doing it in increments it's not putting a whole lot of pressure on the layers below it as it solidifies and dries if we did it all at once there might be too much pressure at the bottom and the whole thing might spill out so we're being careful [Music] so we've put silicone between the two layers of concrete and that silicone will help the concrete from spilling out between the two halves and the previous concrete was right about here the new concrete will finish right about here which will give some structural rigidity to the midsection right above the belt line it's time to drill a mouth for our statue and we know that the mouth is about halfway between the nose and the chin so we're gonna go right about here to get through concrete we know that concrete is a mohs five to seven give or take so i have a diamond drill bit here which has diamonds laced around the edges and since diamonds are level 10 we should be able to get through the cement just fine perfect the massive concrete vibrator is used to jiggle up my internals so the concrete can seep into every nook and cranny while it's still liquid once it gets hard it's game over there's no more adjusting hard concrete and now it's time we bring over the best looking part of the project my head we've put a piece of rebar up in through the shoulders to kind of keep the concrete in the head and the shoulders together and uh hopefully that holds it during our four hour jaunt down the road so every time we seem to redo the calculations on this it weighs more and more we started off thinking it would be 4 000 pounds and i think we're up to about 6 000 now and this time around instead of slinging the head we're actually going to leave it on a pallet and just kind of wiggle it into place on my shoulders right where a head should be and it is done even though we use quick set concrete inside the statue which hardens in about 30 or 40 minutes it still takes about seven days for it to get to about 70 percent of its full holding capacity but you know after about a week you can drive on it and walk on it and that's when we're gonna start transporting it as well to make sure the whole thing is structurally sound then it won't fall apart if we hit a bump while we're driving but overall i think it turned out pretty good pretty uh similar likeness to me it's pretty impressive we can get that level of detail with a 3d concrete printer like if we look at the ears you can even see my ear outline in the statue i will give him a couple more days to stand here and dry it'll be a couple days for us but just a couple seconds for you guys and there he is in all of his glory ready to transport now when i started this project i didn't quite comprehend the magnitude of transporting a six thousand pound statue of myself four hours down to st george there's just no easy way to do it we know we can't transport it upright because it would probably hit like an overpass or an electrical wire or something like that and so we have to lay the statue down and there needs to be something underneath the statue that'll support all of the pressure points equally so what we need is a mattress luckily i have friends over at purple and they're pretty confident that their mattress can support all six thousand pounds of me we're doubling it up and using two full-sized purple mattresses so purple has a few different mattresses this is one of their two inch purple grids the purple grid is designed to dynamically flex under pressure providing complete support which is exactly what we're after with our statue now we just have to get me from here to here in one piece the purple part of the purple mattress is made with a hyper elastic polymer and the purple grid is built to last under practically any pressure there's over 1800 open-air channels that let you sleep cool not that the statue will actually need to but for my personal purple mattress that i've had for about a year now during the summer it's great and during the winter we had some flannel sheets to help warm things up a bit it's definitely a cool mattress the purple grid inherently has motion isolating technology to relieve all those pressure points so the statue will be evenly supported all the way from its head down to its concrete little toes this is going to be quite the durability test for a purple mattress i don't think any mattress is specifically designed to handle six thousand pounds it'll be interesting to see what it looks like tomorrow after we lift the statue back up so we're using a long tether around the waist to keep everything balanced we're gonna set it down under the trailer and just lay it back onto the mattresses so we've added a pallet and a 4x4 to kind of conform to the cavity between my shoulder blades and then the mattresses should cushion everything else got myself strapped in tight now it's time to take the statue the mattresses the trailer and the truck all the way down to st george to keep dan company [Music] [Music] [Music] we are right behind dan's house right now so he could look over his fence that's his house right over there he could look over his fence any time and see us so it could just be go time at any point the statue did survive the trip very well we are excited about that there it is thank you pulling in behind dan's house right now it is definitely time [Music] [Applause] [Music] raising up yes finally it's happening that is six thousand pounds being raised up into the air right now [Music] yeah careful careful sponsored video we do like these guys now let's get the statue in dan's yard this crane is an 80 ton crane which means it can lift a lot of weight near the crane's base but the further you go away from the crane the less weight it can hold kind of like if you have weight down near your arm it's easy to hold but the farther away you get from your body the heavier it gets same thing with the crane that's why we had to get the 80 ton crane to carry the 6 000 pound statue and so far it's totally worth it so far so good i'm gonna run around to the front and meet him by the pool yes we tried gluing these masks down to the bottom but it didn't stick apparently rubber and concrete are hard to glue together hi leslie all right we're getting dan out of his office right now come on out buddy so you know how you want me to move down to saint george right dude i don't know what's happening right now but i'm really nervous to go out here and see what's happening so i've actually decided to make it a little less lonely down here for you and i've 3d printed a 6 000 statue of myself what out of concrete what is this look at this crane we're gonna bring that over here and put it next to your pool and just keep you company it's concrete concrete solid concrete six thousand pounds you're bringing that into my yard uh-huh permanently permanently i mean it's six thousand pounds so good luck oh my god see that pool right there oh no way okay that's kind of amazing actually yeah the closer it gets the bigger it gets it's so big oh my gosh like we really are keeping this forever yep it is now yours you are the lucky proud new owners of a jerry where should we put it so that someday if we need to see what's inside of it we can do it actually i have put inside of it no uh-huh no but my audience doesn't know that yet so i bleeped it out and so what they are going to be expecting a video on your end we put a little further away from the water then look at leslie it's a present so i have to say thank you what in the world look what's come out of his mouth yeah it's a fountain bro i'm not going to put it like yeah i didn't know it was a fountain [Laughter] remember that time when i gave you like thousands of tootsie rolls yep yeah this is quite the payback here it just one up you bro yeah i took it that's good yes that was a logistical experience trying to get this whole thing done i am so glad it is here and in one piece where did you where did you just yeah there's a place called pikas in south jordan that does 3d concrete printing you wait till you see the machine it is incredible so what it's a good thing you don't have hair right that would have made it a little more tricky it would have been way harder to print a concrete statue with hair my face hurts anxious this whole time process it and i do thank you for the gesture this is not really like the aesthetic i was going it looks so grand the kids are gonna be like what the hell oh yeah where are they that's funny uh so there's without the nozzle i like it i just uh we just need to move a little closer to the pool for as large as the statue is i thought it would have a little bit more like spray i do like the water feature though it's pretty funny seeing the six thousand pound statue flying through the air was definitely the highlight of my day dan now that you've had a couple hours to process what do you i don't know how this even came to be and i'm not sad about it like it's actually really cool i was a little nervous about what my wife was going to say about it but she kind of likes it she's like it's like modern art and the fact that there is i don't know if you've told them this inside of this hidden i'm excited to get inside of it but i'm going to keep it around for a little while i've got some plans maybe put some clothes on it maybe paint it we've got some things going on that i'm going to leave it here for a while well i'm glad you enjoy it the company we worked with for this project is called pika so if you're interested in 3d concrete printing from a engineering or industrial perspective i'll leave a link for them down in the description as well huge thanks to dan good luck with the statue it's 6 000 pounds there's no moving it from here i'm pretty curious how you're gonna get inside this thing come hang out with us on instagram and twitter and thanks again for watching i'll see you around wow
