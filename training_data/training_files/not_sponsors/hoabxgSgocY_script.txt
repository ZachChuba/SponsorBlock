if photography is writing with light then teaching ourselves to find recognize create or utilize light and shadow is really the greatest skill we can teach ourselves if we get this one right we will be able to take evocative images no matter what camera we have in hand one of the questions I get asked most often is how do you recognize good light it's a great question maybe the question but a very hard one to answer so I'm making this series to let you in on my thinking around how I compose an expose and image hoping it will inspire you to see the quality of light and shadow in your own daily wanderings and get you thinking about how to write with it [Music] one of the amazing things about living in a city like London or any big city in the world is you get lots of glass and steel which on sunny days like today cast great light reflections across streets so one of the things I do is walk around and look for those look for where lights bouncing off a building or off a reflective surface and see what it's creating and I've just set up here across the road from this amazing kind of wavy metal with holes in it and there's light being cast off from the building just next to me here into that spot so it's creating these light pools and you've got the interesting texture behind it and I'm just waiting for people to walk through and snapping as they do and what will probably happen is I'll take five ten photographs and I'll have a look at home for the best one with the person I've caught it the best moment that complements the background and they're also creating an interesting shape in their stride and that will probably be the one that I'll edit in terms of camera I'm just using my Fuji XT 20 with a 23-mile f/2 on I'm at probably about two thousandth of a second I'm probably around 2.8 at ISO 200 just to give you an idea of where my settings are sitting and that's to freeze the action but also 2.8 leaves it nice and open so I keep my shutter speed high but my ISO is also quite low so it's not going to introduce noise [Music] so I've come back home and had a look through I've got 12 images and there are really three in there that I can see as possible for what I want to do so where I'll usually begin is I'll pull them onto my phone and I'll open dark room and dark room is where I'm gonna go to work and I'm going to work out kind of what the tones I want the image to be are so let's try this one first I know the very first thing I want to do is set my angle on my crop so I'm just going to straighten this a little and I'm looking at the verticals and the lines on the wall there and then the next thing I want to do I always shoot much wider than I need just because I want the option to crop in later I don't want to think I wish I shot a little bit outside if I shoot too wide I can always crop in if I shoot too narrow I can't crop back out again so I know that in this case I probably want that this sort of lower horizontal third here on the line where that metal begins some around it and I want the horizontal third on the left there to sit on my guy then it's gonna be quite an extreme crop I don't usually crop this much but I realize I had these windows and at the top here above him and on the left and right above with the reflections I thought they were quite nice but looking at them now I think they just end up being distracting so I want to take them out which means it's gonna be quite an extreme crop but if I line up something like this I've got the nice texture of the metal and it sort of cleans the image up and I've got him kind of on that third on the Left walking into the light which I quite like and I know with this image I want a black and white the reason is and people ask me a lot why would you choose a black and white over a color and for me if something about the color makes the image I'll obviously keep it and it becomes a feature of the interest of the image but if there isn't really much to do with the color that adds to it and it's more to do with the shape and the light then I'll go black and white so the first thing I'll do because I know I'm gonna be in black and white is to kill the saturation then come back to my curves and I want to start to push in some some highlights and push my mid tones up a little bit and start to create some contrast I usually just clip my whites down a touch and then let's deepen some of these shadows a little bit just to create create that shape I want in there in the life this is just going to accentuate those lights now I'm going to come back here and something I always do is pull up the sharpness to bring out the detail of that wall in darkroom I've learned sort of between a quarter and a third is pretty good and I might just finish it slightly just for the top and bottom there and now I'm just gonna check in my colors the only thing I need to worry about here is luminance everything else Hugh doesn't exist because I pulled out all that information saturation has already turned off so just with my yellows what is that effect you can see in the metals especially above let's leave that a bit higher bring the oranges up let's try the Blues Blues at the top there's quite a nice so let's bring the Blues down and the scions down that's my whole my finger on the image and let go I can see where I've gone and I really like what that's doing so I'm gonna export that now save a copy and then let's go to Snapseed and I'll show you the reason I used Snapseed on top of darkroom is because I like especially with black and white images to be able to dodge and burn which is a very old process but you know one we could still use in the digital age and all that's doing is brightening and darkening particular aspects the image so if I hit tools at the bottom in the middle there and I got a brush and then on my brush I've got at the bottom here with these arrows I've got you know minus 10 minus 5 0 which will be your eraser plus 5 and plus 10 that's the amount you're gonna brighten or darken that image and if i zoom pinch to zoom in and i zoom in on my guy here so you can see how big my brush size is going to be 1 plus 5 and I'm just gonna paint just over him and I know you probably can't see what I'm doing here but I'm gonna show you before and after in a minute and just these vertical highlights the lines on the wall here I'm just brushing up and down those lines you're gonna see when I turn it on and off in a second exactly what that's done but I'm basically just taking light that already exists I'm just giving it a little bit of an extra punch with this +5 so just where there's a highlight already I'm doing it I'm not doing it where the sun's actually falling because that's already quite bright so now if I hit tick at the bottom here and apply that if I hold that down you can see all it's doing is it's just punched up some of those highlights a little bit especially on him now if I do the same again go to brush and I got a minus five and now I can do the opposite so we're at shadows I can just just brush in some shadows and give them a little bit more depth I'm doing it the foreground on the road they're just a bit above on the metal right at the top of the frame as well just some of these vertical lines here as well I'm just accentuating some of that shape and shadow now if i zoom back out hit tick if I hold that down you can see what that's done is just added to the contrast as I turn it on and off just to create some more shape on the light that was already there I'm not creating new light but I'm just adding a little bit of light to everything well I'm gonna do it one more time brush and I'm gonna go to +5 again and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna paint a big wedge where that light is like I'm just gonna brush my finger over a few times so from left to right from behind the guy walking through the frame to just where that light lies and just at the bottom of the frame where the light lies as well and now if I turn that on and off you can see it's just created a little bit more light coming in it's giving him a little more pop as well actually what I'm gonna do is just go think he's got a slight a little bit too much on him now as I'm gonna go to the eraser tool and just brush a little bit out on this jacket because I think it's it's just a little too strong there so that is really nice now and I like how that's looking so if I export that the final stage that I do and a lot of people ask me about this at Instagram how do you create the white borders on your Instagram this is something I just like to do to create a bit of consistency in my feed I use an app called whiter gram you just go to wider gram and once it loads up I just click on library' it's gonna open my library I'm gonna select that last image that I edited and just square in the middle at the bottom I'm going to click on that square and I'm gonna dial the slider it's set to white at the bottom you could use black or any color as a background but I want white obviously I'm just gonna dial over 2 plus 2 that's my border so it's as small as possible and I do plus 2 on every image so it gives it a consistent size across everything that hit camera roll Save and camera roll and that should save it back out and that now is ready to post so have you found that helpful if you've enjoyed this video please let me know below in the comments and I might try and do more of these and fit them in with the normal run of that I do as well and just to let you
