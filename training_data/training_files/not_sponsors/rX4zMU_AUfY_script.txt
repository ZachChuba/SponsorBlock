[Music] everyone welcome back to my channel I'm so excited for today's video because I was playing around with some mirrors I had left over from a previous project I decided to show you how you can DIY one project for different styling purposes if you're new here welcome I would love to have you part of my YouTube family so go ahead and subscribe and hit the bell button to be notified when I upload my next video [Music] this video now let's go ahead and get started with this beautiful DIY [Music] everything you see here is from Dollar Tree you will need seven frame mirrors two foam boards a square mirror coaster East six thousand glue a hot glue gun bling wrap and a box cutter starting off I'm removing these little things holding the mirror in em using scissors because they hurt my fingers and this ways faster to remove them [Music] [Music] now that all the mirrors are out of the frame I'm going to use my e6000 glue and spread it all throughout the foam board once everything is covered I'm going to put the other foam board on top [Music] next time adding more glutes to place the mirror on top I recommend only using e6000 glue because it's very strong and it will hold better than hot glue I'm going to hang this that's why I recommend only this type of glue but if you're going to use this as a centerpiece or table decor and hot glue would work just fine [Music] I went ahead and glued everything down and this is how the mirrors look the middle mirrors are vertical and then the one in the middle is horizontal I really like the look of layered mirrors so now I'm going to cover the white foam board I'm going to cut bling wrap and use my hot glue gun to glue it down you can use black foam boards instead of the white foam board if you want but I know it will come out just as nice either way [Music] I also like using my scissors to press down on the bling rap so I don't burn my fingers [Music] now I'm going to add the bling rap all around to cover the foamboard [Music] [Music] I almost forgot to mention to hang this project you will need command strips I'm using the strongest strips even though this isn't sixteen pounds the directions say to connect them until you hear a snap and then peel the paper off and stick [Music] before peeling the other part off and sticking it to the wall I'm going to clean it with my perfect glass cleaner that I used for all my mirror and glass a lot of you have been asking me what cleaning products I used for my mirror and this is the other than water in a paper towel [Music] now here we have the final results this is my clam guest bedroom and I wanted to share it with you guys I wanted to share how you can add a beautiful mirror wall decor to place above your nightstands you can do two on top of each other and that would look amazing as well I love how affordable and easy this DIY was to make because it's such a statement piece you can make this right from home and take this as an inspiration to make it more your style you can change the color of the bling wraps of gold or your favorite color [Music] I would love to see if you recreate any of my DIYs you can tag me on instagram it's LG Queen home decor [Music] the second way on how you can style the CEO is making it a centerpiece on your dining room table or your copy table I added my rhinestone runner right under it and it just made it even more glam you can place the gray white or any color runner and it would make this centerpiece stand out beautifully this concludes today's video let me know which style was your favorite don't forget to download shop tagger the link is in my description box give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed and you want to see more glam decor because I'm so excited to share with you guys what's to come I want to thank everyone for your continued love and support I'm gonna be doing my 200k giveaway in my next video so make sure you're subscribed and have the bail notification turned on so you don't miss it I'll talk to you guys soon in my next video take care [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music]
