i'm just so stressed it's gonna go away uh yes 60 of them finally you watch him have a [ __ ] anti-poison oh bees and geez 10 000 strength xp as well didn't even know that was coming oh 80 range defense 80. 358 is by the shinny pass okay um actually guys i looked into a little bit more so obviously we got this chunk here i got too excited too quickly you actually need this chunk or this chunk i can't remember it's one of the woodcutting guild chunks like if you lost this would you go back to the granite plate body to raikon for sponsoring today's video let's get into it hello bees and geez welcome back to the pvp challenges chunk progression thing if you haven't missed any of the previous episodes i will leave a playlist up here by the white eye and a playlist link in the description now last episode i got fossil island or i got this chunk here um i'm gonna be opening up one two three four five for my five unlocks now i was all like kins i'm so sorry i feel so bad that i unlocked fossil island i actually think this is really really bad i think it's horrendous there's not long left of the series the only way i can get there and kill the deranged archaeologist or whatever he's called is if i luckily get a what's it called zaya chunk and then i have to go down here i can't remember which one it is it's one of these two i have to then get down here which is one two three four maybe five so i sort of have to land on isaiah chunk or one around it that already touches to to be able to do this so honestly guys i reckon this is dead i think this is a completely dead chunk for me i don't think i'm ever gonna get there and on top of that it means that i can't go ahead and do any plans that i wanted to do because i wanted to do like one small favor if we'd you know if we'd managed to like grab one of these squares or even a mainland square we would have then been able to go do one small favor and then i could get gothic's rest which i can't now do um so yeah me and kings were talking about how [ __ ] it was and my rng and [ __ ] it's not good i can't get there it's a waste of chunks i'd rather the five chunks to use here to go and do something maybe like kins was doing the stews to boost it wouldn't be a bad idea to try and get a boost i could have literally opened this and this and then i'd be able to do the whole quest line to be able to do free evil dave that's recipe for disaster another glove unlocked um so yeah i'm actually you know i'm not complaining obviously i've had good rng this series but that was you know it seemed a lot better at the time than it was and uh it's really not hey guys welcome to episode 24 of the pvp challenges now i'm just gonna come out and say it honestly i am a little let down at some of the attitude that a lot of people have when watching this saying oh raag just give up just end the series just forfeit the win to link yada yada yada um no i'm not you know i came into the series gonna play to the very end i don't care if i end up in the final fight with bronze i'd still play my heart out and try to get the win no matter what so guys come on two thumbs up let's keep our head high especially you team rog i'm looking at you okay series isn't over till it's over we're not quitters over here on team rarg i'd rather lose and keep my dignity and try to the end than give up halfway through okay so we're gonna keep going we're gonna try to find a plan that works for us and to try to combat link in the in any fight but especially the final fights the ones that really matter so picking the unlocks were actually kind of tricky because we don't really have a crazy amount of unlocks left in the series um i unfortunately cannot get the black dehyde body this episode because of the one chunk way over here i just need this one and at the time it wasn't thinking of it i haven't had a zaya chunk in ages which honestly is a good thing mostly but um yeah long story short i still can't get the black the hide body um so i'm able to get six unlocks as long as it's touching my giant landmass of course it is and there's not too many plays left with such a short amount of time but what i wanted to go towards is actually start to unlock recipe for disaster a bit more so that is the big choppy bird hunting one and then i also unlocked this one should probably clear them out these two for the fishing contest i can actually start it right there be really annoying but it saves like two or three unlocks over there so that's three in total plus the big chompy and then i don't know if i'll ever get enough squares to do it but i had two options i was toying with one start going for regicide as well i know link just did it last episode it is a crazy shield in terms of a range defense it was between that or either start working sorry i keep clicking on dungeons it was either that or work my way towards soul wars because that is addy bolts which means diamond bolt tips um on top of that guys i'm not gonna lie i cannot do anything that i wanted to do there's no quests i can now do i looked into it a fire cape literally getting a ranging level is more dps increase than getting a fire cape and a fire cape will take at least two hours and in two hours i can get at least a level maybe a level and a half maybe two levels i don't know exactly how much xp we're going to be getting at this rate so a fire cape is literally not worth going for especially when we can passively get an obsidian cape yes there's a prayer bonus etc etc but it's it's not worth it um and if i was going for it it'd literally just be throwing it like i'd be i'd be throwing a fight or throwing dps out the window and i'm not here to do that um so guys i'm not gonna lie i don't think you're gonna see me at all for the next four hours i think i'm just gonna be training range it's it's the unfortunate truth of getting lucky at barrows because i haven't had to spend any time there it's also the unfortunate truth of unlocking this because it means i've used five unlocks this episode and it's unlocked nothing new that i can actually use so big apologies we're gonna get ourselves like 75 is a max hit so 75 range is a huge huge one to go for um hopefully get 76 maybe even close to 77 i don't know exactly what we're going to be doing um and i'll show you where we're going to be going so let me start the timer and then i will teleport to the tazar and we will send it over there boom so i'm gonna be killing undead druids the reason for this is they drop a load of money they drop a load of runes and it's a passive way of getting an obby cape uh we've already got a decent amount of money we've got the more we can sell as well for tuckle um and we've got a load of runes as well so i don't think we're actually too far off um but just the the passive runes the money that the undead druids dropped plus they dropped grabby keys plus they are good xp because you can uh just sit by that altar um and just yeah keep spamming the alter really so uh yeah there's a lot of positives for it and uh yeah i think it's the way we're gonna go we got like 45 50k xp last time i was here and i think that was with like 72 range and that was without the snakeskin boots i don't know if we had the red dead body yeah we definitely did um so hopefully we'll uh we'll be approaching that 50 50 plus k i don't know we'll see the problem with diamond bolt tips is that i'd have to get the audi bolts which probably aren't too hard but then i also need to worry about fletching i don't have the fletching level for it and i'd have to get at least one level plus a five boost i did put my xp in fletching it still is possible but i'm just not sure if that's the right move just going that extra tanky piece of gear is kind of where my head's at plus that's more guaranteed if i get the correct unlocks for it so those are my six unlocks going to this episode um in terms of what i want to do i need to do barrows guys my gear just isn't going to cut it unfortunately as much as i want to train and do other things on the account the the one major thing that's holding me back is in fact barrows let's cross our fingers for some awesome rng maybe else even stop after a tank helm i i i have to try to fine tune my plan and figure out where i'm going in the final episodes here because we are coming down close to the end so let's start the timer i'm gonna go buy some food i'm gonna go buy lots of num crunchies to sort me out for the rest of the episode and then barrows until we are satisfied with our loot just opened my 50th chest in total on the account that's the second one of this episode um a lot of people are actually asking why or actually kind of telling me to bring my stamina pots and the reason i don't is because the the ratio between my pots and food are pretty much spot on for like three trips at barrows which is about 20 minutes which is the exact time it takes to tell you back with the shades of morton teleport so that's why i don't actually use them and i'm saving my stamina pots for things like questing like last episode i used a crazy amount of stamina potion so definitely my mindset on that one i feel like even if i brought stamina pots here i don't really think it'll speed it up that much maybe ever so slightly i just think i get a much bigger benefit out of them through other things like questing all right let's see what we get nothing chest number three of the episode 51 in total i sense an item of chaos runes i totally meant to say that i'm feeling lucky this time around ready okay i mean guys i'm gonna you know what i'm gonna start a collection it's called having every plate body that barrows has to offer in fact varrics guthan's taurags and darrocks we alk the darroch one because we were fed up with that nonsense but we got it i think we have every one that's crazy dude that's actually pretty crazy since we got every plate body new challenge let's get every pair of tank legs and or every pair of tank helm please and death runes holy frig no oh okay i like oh my gosh i might have to use chaos rooms actually oh my gosh do i have a teleport i feel like i should just tilly out and just buy more yeah no no that's [ __ ] that is beyond messed up oh what i'm thinking a lot about the plan going forward step one probably not to die because my hp is pretty low let's tell you and out of here let's go to varrock let's gear up again the the rng has just been too sick to me um item-wise and stuff like there's nothing for me to go for the last thing i wanted to go for was the black d-hard body but obviously we now can't do that because i can't actually get to fossil island um so yeah it is it is really just a case of of getting range up now so i will probably see you in three hours 20 minutes or something like that and then unless i come up with a plan i am gonna have a little think and i will have a little look around um and i will and i will see if we can if we can come up with anything but um yeah this is gonna be it i just realized i've completely forgotten to say that uh i put all my xp into fletching so uh yeah we now have 61 fletching i don't know how useful it's going to be to be honest guys um i don't know if we're actually going to get too nice i don't know if we're actually going to get to dragonstone boxy at this point now so i don't know but i do want to i do want to get it at least to the point where i could maybe bring diamond bolts but i don't think they're even worth it to be honest the dps you lose throughout the whole fight i don't think is worth the uh the the proc chance of 10 but um i couldn't really think of a skill to put it into and 100k into like range or defense or whatever wouldn't have really got me that far i'd rather have the skill um so yeah that was the thought process on that and uh there you go i'm just gonna sort of talk about what i'm feeling series wise um i know i sort of touched on it at the start of the episode first of all very happy with this haul the only thing i'm not happy with is grabby keys these [ __ ] are [ __ ] for grabby keys i should have got like five six maybe i've got two um but we will open them uh and hopefully we can pull some to be honest i think i'm done on sarah bruce i think i'm pretty good on sarah breeze but um yeah hopefully we can pull some dragon bones maybe i don't really need anything from it maybe super restores would be pretty good uh but yeah we are going to get ourselves uh 76 coming in here we're not too far off a hp level as well i need to pray um so yeah i mean as i said decent money 215k and alex and just money drops really good runes not as many chaos as i thought i was gonna get they're like you can get up to 80 in one drop it's like 50 to 80. i thought we'd get a few more um so i don't think we're going to be able to afford the obby cape today i will go and check but i don't think it's going gonna happen unfortunately um but yeah just how i'm feeling on the on the series is with my gear obviously i'm not wearing all my tank gear and stuff right now um i just feel like the only upgrade i can really get is a black dehyde body and the only way to realistically get that is from the deranged archaeologist over at fossil island and as i was saying at the start of the episode there's 76 range coming in i will try and get this hp level so we will stay here and try and get that kill so something that i've been thinking about a lot lately is what am i going to do for the later fights the last fights if i'm not going to get tank legs and one of the things i've been trying to theorycraft is how to approach a hybriding situation the cool thing is is that we do have a carol's leather skirt and we also have a varex brassy now the varex brassy doesn't really have that great of defensive bonuses it's like slightly stronger than a rune plate body um but it has an amazing effect and that is that it gives very low range or i should say very low negative range attack bonus and very low and negative magic attack bonus so let's say for example i got an arum skirt here that would be an amazing setup probably just as good as tank legs at this point because it can be paired well with the carol skirt for a nice easy switch between ivan's and the room crossbow if i i mean obviously i'm not expecting to get an arum skirt as a very specific item to get and for a specific item it's like 1 in 408 or something don't quote me on that but it's pretty darn rare but even something like a mystic skirt could still do wonders i believe arums actually gives no range defense so from a range perspective it's no different just that it gives less magic attack which of course is pretty detrimental magic defense as well i'm assuming he's going to be hybriding in the fight he's not going to have pity there's no real way to get piety this season unless i shouldn't say that maybe he's gonna grind it out you know for the last episodes that could be his plan or something but um i'm thinking that that's gonna be the direction i take if i don't get these tank legs of course the tank helm won't really change anything it'll just replace the rune full helm that i have um so i don't think i'm out for the count yet i don't know how strong that build is going to be against link i'd imagine if he's just going range with no switches i i i want to say i'd have a fair shot it's when he's hybridizing back that's the issue of course that's always going to be the issue all right let's see what we get oh my god bro i mean i can't wear it of course bro bro bro bro i mean i'd rather the bottoms but you know what that's so nice that is so nice can we get those tank legs can we get those tank legs tank legs just got so much more crucial guys i don't think you understand my magic is only level 65. oh man this is tricky this is tricky okay okay we have to see how the rest of the um the episode pans out team mark don't give up on me yet man don't give up on me yet his magic defense is not that high and he can't unlock the black dehyde this episode i mean i won't be able to wear it this episode but maybe he won't even have a black d head body for the final fight who knows that is so [ __ ] hype um yeah without getting the wood cutting guild chunk i i can't actually finish bon voyage which will bone voyage even which allows you to go to fossil island so my sort of thinking right now is i don't really have much i can do until i either get that until i either get a zeo chunk which is very very unlikely um and as i said going for a fire cape is actually a waste of time it's better to go for the um obby cape passively while doing this because every attack or every uh what's called range level adds dps so i i'm really sorry i feel bad but at the end of the day i'm here to win a season you know um and as much as people are like yeah you're so far ahead and everything's been good but if kins pulls like tank legs and then goes and gets a black dehyde body because he's got everything unlocked for um fossil island he has everything unlocked so he's gonna you know he pulls tank legs tank helm black dehyde body there's there's a chance he goes and takes the season and i would kick myself if i lost this season because i took it easy and i was like i'll go for a fire cape for the flex i'll i'll do this for the flex you know so that's my thought process that's why i'm doing this 76 range um i just hope we pull as air chunk for the content content-wise i hope we pull as a chunk um and i can do it because that would be great i know team rag and everyone will be fuming if i did pull a zed chunk because of the rng and all that [ __ ] but you know at the end of the day i want the content to be decent um and it would be quite fun to hunt down the uh deranged archaeologist for a little bit um to uh to try and get that to try another amulet strength we've just been while i've been talking we've got so many amulets um yeah so it would be nice to uh it would be nice to go down that route but we'll see we will see um that's my thoughts bees and g's after this kill i think it will be uh i don't know i definitely can't afford the obby cape right now i've got a few things in the bank though i've got like 800 900 death rings in the bank we've got some chaos rooms in the bank but it's definitely not enough yet so i will just get this level and then i'll show you my setup it's going to be pretty similar i think it's going to be exactly the same actually um so yeah let's do this i'm feeling something in this chest guys ready i'm feeling lucky with this one guys feeling i thought i alked you no no no i realized my timer paused it didn't actually pause there you go i wha hi guys this plate body luck i can't get rid of i can't shake it i try to alk it i try to alk it and i can't it just pops back up in my life let's see if we can get back to back items no we cannot no you cannot 73 chests though guys so a lot of chests done this episode a lot of chests all right guys this is going to be my last chest why because i need to go on a bit of a shopping spree i want to go magic this fight and i need to sell some stuff to get some money we're actually out some stuff to get some money to buy some mystic and whatnot and um yeah i need to plan exactly what i'm doing we are 66 magic now which is nice so we can walk right in the guild without actually um boosting let's wish this guy good luck um last chest and nothing that's okay though let's telly out um and yeah probably gonna out that darroch plate body again guys just get all that money and yeah take it from there i actually decided to alk the guthins because it's the same stats as the tourag and the darrock and it's prob i mean i i'm never gonna get a set but it's like the most worthless set of the bunch actually that's probably not true torak probably is it really doesn't matter we have 192k guys let's just buy 50 death runes um per world top a bit do i need anything else let's just buy some extra fires too because it can't hurt i mean there's probably going to be more barrows on the agenda at some point so awesome all right let's hop a few worlds buy some death runes wizard sunina okay what do we want what do we want what do we want right now i'm thinking these two items so 90k for the both again i talked about that varex brassy plan probably going to be how we uh approach it of course we already have mystic gloves so no need to buy those um oh six minutes left okay i [ __ ] what am i doing for six minutes i need a bike ramble ones let me make sure i have everything i'm a bit nervous i probably do i just need crampons and ruins we already have runes yeah okay let's go get some cram blondes guys and then i'm probably just going to kill to czars for range xp while i'm there and then end the episode i was just about to start recording saying oh i've forgotten to get the uh the grubby keys there we go there's a third one so we've got three to open which is i mean i'm not gonna say it's annoying but it uh means that we might be a bit low on inventory space here if we are i'll probably drop like the thing is with the earthworms i think you can sell them for tocco as well for like two each let's open these grabby keys or the grubby chest super stores that's what i want to see boom that's not what i wanted to see at all we've got some laws a load of laws there some sharks which i will take um probably drop all of these to be honest i'm really not gonna need them uh boom come on oh okay ranging part snapdragon a lot of sharks here you know what we're just not going to uh let's take the super defense we're just not gonna open the last grubby key also someone was saying i was manipulating the grubby key chests in the comment section there you go mate i've opened 22 so whoever thought i was opening grubby keys until that there you go that one's for you big man uh yeah i guess to be honest i might as well just attack the bad boys until this is over because yeah i don't really have much to do definitely not going to be able to afford the obby cape um i'll let you know if i get a grabby key or not in the next three minutes i doubt it massively um and yeah we will see the old plan obviously was not working with the tank range the only reason why i went tank range last fight was to see how well the emerald bolts would work of course that backfired but now he knows it's a thing i cannot just go tank range anymore i have crafted up this plan that i had mentioned earlier when i was doing barrows of using this to tank with and go tank mage and do a quick range switch and keep going back between the two the really bad thing about this is that our defense is so low and we can't really pray or flick while we do it at least i can't it's very hard to switch on tick because you want to get the surprise and of course the switch on tick and have the correct prayers unless you're just camping one of the prayers and i feel like this is the only way i could really possibly get the advantage he's in a really really really good spot right now and i was actually really thinking about saving this sort of setup for the final fight but i have to see how it works i have to see how it works my magic attack really isn't that high but his magic defense granted is higher than the magic but um if i'm hitting him off prayer that's that's a lot because you know protection prayer is 40 damage reduction plus if i'm switching back and forth he's probably not flicking and he'll either a run out of prayer or b and just not have prayer up the entire time or i guess c just settle for these weaker prayers down here all of which would be a good scenario um i'm only bringing three prayer pots this time because again i don't think i'll be focused too much on offensive prayers i'm probably gonna rock steel skin and protect from range and just keep switching back and forth um and just trying to get those extra hits in any way i can um hopefully this works and honestly the reason why i'm trying this now is because if if this mage build works when i get 70 magic we have this sucker right here um an arms rope top of course it wouldn't work with this exact setup because i feel like if i had the mystic row bottom and the arms top top and bottom would be zero range defense and he would destroy me so um it wouldn't be as simple as just swapping out the uh the body here but it opens up new avenues of new strats and stuff with the arms um the arms rope top so oh and i decided to actually not bring an anti-poison um i don't think he will bring one but even if he does i should be able to get a pretty clear picture of how this setup works against his current setup and i just feel like if i do get close i'm going to need all the food i can get so yeah decided to drop it hopefully he thinks he's just so far ahead that he's not going to bring poison but yet again even if he does this is like a test build set up just to see the dps i can put out on right bees and geez this is gonna be the setup um it's actually i think exactly the same as last week except uh i'm bringing one less shark i think that i think that's it i'm not 100 sure though uh again not bringing the recoils bringing in anti-poison because i think he might go cheeky and think think i think that i'll be like oh he won't bring it again because i know that i've got the defense against it he might try and snake a win there a lot of people saying that i looked him up in the last episode and that's how i knew the anti-poison was there if you watch my reveal guys i sit there and i say he can't go magic i'll kill him bolting him in robes he will die there's no way he wins magic he could possibly have put his xp into attack which means dds possible poison he could have possibly got fletching up and then have emerald bolts there was no way he was winning without coming up with some strap and the only strat he had available to him that would make sense was trying to poison me so everyone who's like oh you looked him up his [ __ ] stats were 55 fletching and like 50 attack if i was looking him up i wouldn't have brought anti-poison like i would have been like okay no chance i didn't there's no way i would have thought that my [ __ ] was down there with a kitten getting stews the first time i ever did recipe for disaster i did it with a kitten and it is hell it took me like three hours it's it's mental so yeah a little bit fuming because if i'd been like losing every episode and my back was against the wall and i'd come out with that anti-poison play everyone be like fair play link well played but because i've been winning everyone's like he's cheating cheating anyway ran over um four brad potts super defense ranging pot food crystal shield all that good stuff as i was saying earlier the only upgrade realistically i can get is a carol's top or a black dehyde body the carols is just going to be ridiculous i can't get range xp while doing barrows or i can get a small amount of range xp but you know it's not worth it i'd rather uh go for the deranged archaeologist um for the black dehyde top so that's why i'm sticking with this um that's one of my worries and as i was saying earlier if he does pull like some tank legs if he pulls some tor egg legs they're actually tankier than than the barracks these just give a nice prayer bonus so he would have tankier legs and then i know he's gonna move on and he'll try and get that black d-hide body so he could turn up tank legs black dehydrator maybe a room full helm maybe get super lucky and he got um a helm this episode as well so it's it's very possible that kinz turns up with better gear than i do um for the final fight so i think a lot of people are writing him off very early um i've been a bit harsh on kids to be honest because yeah tank legs like the body i'd be in serious trouble uh serious trouble so uh we'll see we will see and that's why i'm focusing on getting my range up because if he does pull those things i need to be able to hit harder than him i need to be able to hit higher um and that's the plan so let's go to the fight let's see what happens and geo us skin ice hey we're back here we are again it's uh you know i in my reveal i spoke about what i was worried about you doing okay i you know i'm i'm almost certain you did barrows again and if you what i'm worried about is if you can pull like a tank legs then you're free to go get that black dehyde body and then i think you go into that fight the final fight's looking [ __ ] strong you know because i don't think i can hear this i i would because if you let's say you pull like taurag legs or one of the tank tank legs you know it's tankier than the barracks and then you could go and pull the black d black d hide top fairly easily if you if you unlock it and and you know as you say you've already done the woodcutting guild one oh no i haven't i actually misspoke i thought i had it but i didn't i was an idiot so okay all right well anyway i you know it still still goes with the whole fact of like the varrics are good obviously but they're not the tankiest you know you could pull tankier yeah but with the whole prayer situation i if if i had to pick one item right now link it'd be a varric skirt like i i would take a varric skirt over anything it's definitely not a bad item but i you know i i was saying that i was quite worried about you being tanky and having the black but yeah all right great honestly mate i don't have much to say i just trained i was just getting um as much xp as i possibly could nice so your gear is the exact same is that basically i don't know what to expect here okay he's just throwing it on i'm not gonna sit here and make the pizza g's wait yeah yeah not gonna lie my setup is completely different oh my god oh okay am i just gonna start picking slots then yeah all right let's go help just kidding [ __ ] now you say the first circle no no no i it actually is different just that's the same uh wait before you keep going i think i did uh i had like 46 or 47 uh barros chess at this episode star and now i have like 76 done or something these are guests somebody probably knows the exact amount but i was just bashing through that yeah the whole entire episode was just barrows wow okay so i'm guessing there's gonna oh [ __ ] off top top top top oh i will say i am bringing no new barrows pieces to this fight link i haven't even looked you up yet i don't even know what your stats are i mean i did barrows all episode link what could they possibly be here that's true i mean you probably you said you trained or it sounded like you trained all episode yeah yeah 76 [ __ ] oh did you just get it too yeah [ __ ] hell i also just got the hp level as well oh my god you're not kidding yeah i did zero training i mean i guess magic because barrows i'm so concerned i thought maybe you'd go down magic and go around stuff or something when you said you were going completely different that's what i thought but right well this is melee definitely not unless i got a granite hammer but even then that wouldn't [ __ ] kill you so is my guy about to put a [ __ ] carol's crossbow on oh god okay all right oh god no let's go see your kids okay carol's crossbow imagine that working that definitely wouldn't work guys i tried that in season two it actually backfired and i got so roasted for it just because i want to see how it worked and thanks never again is he just going full tank no so just quickly what's the thinking on the varex it's less range negative is that what you're thinking it'll all come full circle once you once you keep asking the thoughts man all right um boots oh he's going range mage um wow so what's the difference between the tour rags and the varricks in terms of magic attack then because that's what's going on magic attack versus negative wow yeah so i had no choice if i wanted to tank mage that is how i'd have to do it my back's against the wall guys i gotta try things because if i just went range i i had no wearable or i should say items are going to help me in the fight from from barrows for this episode so what's your magic attack in that um 23. wow i had to try something i i might as well send you this let's get this out of the way i did bring it again oh you did i don't have them i thought you'd go for the back to back and try no no dude good good good good good good imagery slot wasted did you bring a dds this fight i did not and i don't have an anti-poison wow he's making big plays i told myself i have to go all in i was like even if you had the dagger i could still see how this build works yep and get creamed from the poison on top of you just probably doing more dps but it doesn't affect me trying this method but since i'm like this might be closer than last fight to just go all in and try to counter in any way possible so right mate sounds like you've uh you've played me a little bit in terms of the anti and no dds and all that so fair play that's one inventory slot i'm not getting myself still you know it's a win already vote in terms of in terms of inventory set up i dropped a prayer pot okay i can't put up my carol skirt so that's gonna be my empty inventory slot and okay all right yeah uh i've got three sharky boys okay okay for some ticking it really comes down to how good or bad the mage hits honestly yeah yeah that would be because like if it just does not hit for anything then it kind of becomes a case of that i'm forced to just go range and it still backfires because i'm in worse gear like this is much worse than yeah yeah what i've been rocking but yeah i had to try it so in that respect how to try it all right let's get into the fight mate let's hop well oh [ __ ] all right man ready yep i'm potting up gl dude um oh zero already oh he's just keeping up protect from range not hitting i'm not hitting i'm hitting not really i'm not hitting either though you're somehow tanking it oh 25 let's go what we want to see it's not what we want to see these are geez let's go [Music] hmm it's definitely going to be a silent fight oh for sure why am i not hitting don't know why am i not hitting i'm so distracted on other things that i'm not even looking at my own hp well the hits i am but just my hp bar i'm looking at and drink some parts cool okay nice it's a little staff bash here you bash your boy there mate this ping is really [ __ ] me up right now wow wow wow wow can't believe how little i'm hitting [Music] [Music] that's way too accurate [Music] i'll do it we're both just switching meat gear and you prayers like crazy holy [ __ ] oh this is anxious this is [ __ ] anxious go ahead for the staff bash [ __ ] how why am i not hitting i don't get it i do not get it i do not understand how i'm not hitting oh [ __ ] off my prayer drop my prayer drops my bad guys i'm getting so caught up in these [ __ ] flicks and [ __ ] holy crap 25 25 25 guys i think it was a mistake it's trying to switch i think it was a mistake i should have just stayed on range ah how much food four 25 hp and that be the g's is why you don't [ __ ] give skin [ __ ] and you don't write anyone off because it's not it's it's anyone's game very happy that worked just goes to show you never really write somebody off until the end guys also never give up never give up we are going to try our hardest to the very end guys but let's generate um isaiah chunk would be the best and yeah so let's spin 300 that's not isaiah chunk unfortunately all right piece of g's hello hello kings has won the last fight before we go into the final fight so next episode is going to be eight hours long or eight hours of progress and then we'll do three fights next thursday or two it'll be best of three so if someone wins two in a row then that's you know obviously one there you go visa geez everyone's writing him off and saying that he's planned [ __ ] and there's snowballing and honestly guys you know he's like one range level behind me with the same defense he's a couple magic behind me like he's now just gonna got himself combat xp like i think everyone gave us a lot of [ __ ] about the snowballing and stuff and this proves it you know this proves that his account can still easily easily deal with mine and he had four food left so we have to hit isaiah chunk if i want to be able to do the black dehydrated body if i can't do the black dehydrator i have no idea what i'm gonna do now no idea so yeah i don't know what's gonna happen let's just roll let's see what happens boom it's not zaya i can tell you that so that's no black d head body for linky boy 300 i don't think i actually have this chunk but it's right next to the giant landmass so it definitely connects um yeah guys no black dehyde body unfortunately but it probably means we can do things like um roving elves regicide stuff like that and probably more of recipe for disaster as well i don't really know exactly how much chunks you know all that's gonna take so of course that's for next episode eight hours let's have a look four three six is thought up hills not very useful at all bees and geez i think uh i think you've you've written kins off too early everybody i really do i am i'm not confident going into this not getting a black dehyde body that's not happening yeah this is gonna be interesting but uh you know it might also be an incredibly boring eight hours for me guys of just of just training at this point but we'll see we will see who knows hey hey my mom you sound kind of happy zeus spin much i'm not happy i'll tell you that i'll tell you that unless he's already started the mind games early i don't know i don't know we're uh we're you're safe mate you're safe i'll tell you that i'm not gonna take that knowledge to the final fight i know you like i know you yeah you can watch the episode oh man how you feeling uh i mean there definitely could have been better but um i mean dude everything connects to my giant landmass these days so you know everything could have happened anything you could just be talking bollocks and you've hit isaiah so i don't even know now [ __ ] sake all right you're gonna find out you're gonna find out visa g's next episode we'll catch you then thanks for watching bye
