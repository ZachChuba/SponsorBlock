this video is about a recent rust experience i had with my good friend z chum and omed we wanted to get to endgame this wipe we really wanted to push the envelope of our gaming abilities we wanted to do some raids use those cool guns we usually don't have the attention span to acquire and we wanted to build the most technologically advanced base the game of rust has ever seen i said it was my turn on a pc as you know rust can be a very dangerous place so we needed to create a level of intimidation that would ensure our victory we referred to ourselves as the three large men of rust i was hagrid zeechum chumley three large men indeed and together we set out to dominate the server and let me tell you we did a pretty good job the only thing that stood in our way was this [ __ ] right here but more about that later let's go back to the beginning on that beach butt [ __ ] naked with nothing but a rock unless one of you have a base design you're you're kick you're dying to try i make a [ __ ]

those gunshots are i don't know is that a gamer compound i see let's get a base up first before we start poking around in any compounds oh uh it's those it's those men the same men i think we can take them i don't know as z chum bravely charges z chum wait wait we're not with you dude it's the same guys i really think we can take them then let's take them they're hopping around on their ears it sounds like they got gear on it sounds like they got something on their shoes oh i mean there's only one door i think i think you could go deep hero mead i think i should go i have a revolver too i think this door opens we just charge in okay all right you blast them and we just go straight in okay okay my finger is on the trigger right now this is going to be big loot here do we pick a hemp to bait them out is the that's everything my brain is telling me to pick up that hit the pole with your rock or something i'm dead there's three in there pick me up pick me up when you can head shot him sorry i just gotta get the double barrels okay oh oh i hit him a bunch it was a db and then we can this is fun i'm enjoying this actually me too it's been a hot minute since i've like actually played there's something about it's got a it's got a charm to it it does what a thrill sitting outside those men it's home little did they know three significantly larger men were right outside yeah i probably should looted and scooted i uh i honestly i headshot you i'm pretty sure i'll meet them so i was trying to defend you while you were reloading but you kept jumping up and down there's a rather girthy base you talking about the one in the cannon there's a theme i killed him here oh man pvp king dude this lighthouse isn't helping anybody at sea the three large men were reunited and we got to work on a base i gotta say me that was a big play back there we almost had them there was only more bullets in that shotgun you've got what it takes kid if only there was a triple barrel on that shot triple herald shotgun you could be one of the greats let us get away from this make a residence fit for three large men yeah yeah yeah oh okay uh all right i think it's a little a little a little bass just to get us this going i got so scared i thought somebody was building oh [ __ ] i'm being oh shot make a door i am chubby upgrade the outside make it faster guys [Music] look out look out look out that was a tense moment just in time for night time this week we hit this perfectly just a couple of guys hanging out in the dark against all odds we had a magnificent start so we celebrated until the morning fire that's so very generous of you don't aqua's gonna get fussy you better move i'm fussy i'm fussy things are going well actually somewhat yes that is true aqua can i go outside no look at my bag that i got cute right oh you think you got a cool bag why don't you take a little gander at that bag whoa is that a towel if he sleeps on a towel that's fine i'll just i'll just sleep on the cold do you not have a bag no i've never had one of those before i didn't make this one i took it from a man that i murdered little girl's back oh i didn't uh i didn't sure are you

man how dark is it outside is it like pitch black or is it [Music] excellent question of me maybe i could go hit a rock or something in this economy you know what i think i'll just stay home wait for the sun there's someone here run go home fight oh [Music] oh he headshot me i too wish to come how would i miss that oh he's still hurt kill him yeah he's dead he's dead okay i'm going home at the back yes that was perfect it's exactly what we needed put on all of his [ __ ] time now goodbye my friends i'm picking you up oh oh fun run home get back with a pistol he has the rage gun i opened the door for you so you can easily get inside thank you i lived omid i lived i'm going to show you and omid a whole new wave of passively killing people by by clicking buttons on your phone i like that i want to do as little as possible while acquiring goods at a rapid rate while acquiring as much as possible this isn't a trap base this is a smart base let's draw a big apple logo on a stein to the i home is that an enemy outside or is that a shack's big floppy feet it's just a fellow large man outside don't worry oh no oh christ this time it was someone else oh back here by the rock oh god he's got a gun i'm barely alive we both missed him he's dead he hit him bad meds get inside everybody large men return to the i home the council of large men they'll decide [Laughter] who's talking over here i'm talking to this guy right now what see in the basement oh no gentlemen don't kill that man don't do that tragedy you don't know who hagrid is this is a disaster yes we have a very squirrely and awkward neighbor come back come back to the window no come back to the window right now all right this my friend is a state-of-the-art rocket launcher all right we have to raid this guy i can get you a fine deal on this right he's gonna have to ask her to drop his pants now you'll give him the grenade launcher yep sure why not it's got one he in it so you gotta make a count come on hanger drop the pants uh what a mighty fine schlong you have there hagrid thanks what the [ __ ] pleasure doing business with you you too i like your [ __ ] though he had a strange fixation on my character's genitalia this lonely shopkeep would turn out to be of great importance to our future and little did we know this simple exchange would change our destiny forever aqua i brought back 200 scrap from that nice i have 69 oh yes this is really happening okay there's two guys with bows coming out get inside z jump i'm inside way ahead of you where are they right outside he's dead oh there's another one yeah probably by the rocks he's behind the base oh crap i have the key cards on me i'm going inside it's got a db i think careful that is not a db i'm dead he's one shot though i headshot him i had shot him he's dead get his smash 12. yeah grab it oh full gear coming towards us straight the same way same way behind that metal base it's this little like this little 1x2 base yeah yeah the metal one used to the right of it i think that naked is trying to bait us in i'm down i think i might have hit him with a bow hey that's the that's the shopkeep jack what was that i'm sorry i didn't know come back out here you little [ __ ] come get your kids come on we're getting rise above them excellent shot shopkeep i like shopkeep again yeah me too turns out the shopkeeper and his friend had been bothered by these door campers as well so a bit of an alliance was formed between our houses [Music] my big chumlee toes cooked vienna sausages my resources looked pretty good trying to kill me no i see that that look in your eye bloodlust it's not bloodlust it's just lust toes two people are outside of the base go away i wonder who that is do you think that worked they got guns one has the hazmat outside all right i'll help we can [ __ ] off putting putting this they're right in front of the door aren't they as soon as i open this they're gonna start oh we have an extra hazy okay okay okay it's gonna be tough here aqua i'll charge ready when you're ready killed one i shut the door but i'm down inside i killed both of them good [ __ ] can someone pick me up on the inside when you get inside yeah did you kill him with a sword yeah i sorted him that was a three-man perfect synergy of pvp excellence oh [ __ ] on the roof oh no there we go that's what i'm talking about aqua these door campers were quite persistent and they were keeping us from progressing because they were making it very difficult to leave our base should we together go up now [Music] i killed one going out eventually we managed to escape our own base which led us to discover two items that were essential for the completion of z chum's base design oh we got loot in here aqua would you like to come in here and do the honors wait i don't even know where you are i got a security camera a laptop i have a laptop and a camera [Laughter] turret time and a red key card 30 million rules yeah the whole squad in right here where i am just stop with your little rat's nests we can teach those door camping dorks a lesson they'll never forget oh are these some toes sticking up toes gamer toes you found this battery over there are we going to rig up a kevin mcallister style trap oh we're gonna do something all right we are we're three kevin mcallisters and they are a joe pesci and the other guy whatever his name was three big men home alone [Laughter] yes so large we had nearly all we needed for the ihome and the shopkeep brought over the rest oh all right guys it's my last last gift of the night oh yes oh my god you're incredible yeah i'm a different kind of uh shopkeep though right so like you're gonna owe me for that one like nothing physical like head okay like that i'm gonna owe you my kneecaps i don't think he meant that kind of head z chunk oh my phone's at three percent mine's at four oh see mine's at 69 poggers dude and then zitrum said let there be light oh i hear drums definitely hear something that unusual what is that something unusual and weird oh it's fireworks oh oh that's beautiful should we watch them how poetic it was like let there be light our lights turn on and then these started going off how how amazing is that that's a good omen for a successful wipe you guys want to hold hands i yes kind of this is beautiful oh my god this is like emotional right now that that seems scripted but it wasn't i told him i needed that thank you everything was going relatively well for the three of us we had been winning our fights finding the items we needed and we even made some friends but we soon would find out that things would change for the worse for us and we would be presented with a new obstacle that we would have to overcome sorry oh oh it's a heli what are they doing what are they doing they're landing on that roof yeah we need to steal that right now let's go yeah i need to make a ladder all right i'll uh head over there and help secure with omid no meat's already there we need to heist this yeah okay let's do it oh god okay well i am dead i headshot him once i think i downed him okay i hit the other oh ryan z trump ride no i gotta get the low grade this is the big heist gentlemen we're gonna be like oceans eight oceans three right three i think i downed him yes he is dead okay to the roof oh i'm dead i'm dead there was another torch them up light them up not yet not yet though i'm dead oh [ __ ] i was about to they've got their aks out now ak yeah [ __ ] the great heist didn't go as planned i nearly killed one just now hit

that thing there's one on the ground right here he's dead i'm dead tried to get behind a rock stupid [Music] when he goes to loot just pop him with the b db [ __ ] they're good they're they're aware individuals another frontal assault or have we no i think we've exhausted all right that's a shame it was a good effort we nearly had them yes ping is the one who killed me every time at first the three large men were on top of the world however at the hand of pain the situation had become much more dire revenge for the three large men was more than necessary peng would not get away with this [Music] you
