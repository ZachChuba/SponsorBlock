last time on Dragon Ball super Goku the Saiyan raised by the kai么 shin has saved the universe many times Frieza majin buu and the Saiyans have all faced justice now he finds himself a new challenge while training in the world of the god of destruction Goku and Vegeta are surprised by the kai么 shins sudden appearance hurt and close to death the kai么 shin only utters the name of an old enemy Frieza what is going on in the universe divinity is unleashed now the golden heaven what if Goku was raised in the kai么 shin realm part 3 Goku ran over to shin and helped him up he tried to get something out of him anything but he was losing consciousness quickly beerus whose own life was in danger thanks to the link between the chi ocean and himself grabbed onto him and brought him over to ease i don't know what's going on but I will make whoever did this pay no I will beerus looked confused that the two Saiyans insulted even but he saw the fire in their eyes for Goku this was about avenging his friends and for Vegeta it was about finally defeating his tormentor he understood plus it would mean he wouldn't have to work too hard though beerus did want to kill whoever almost killed him he was willing to see just what the Saiyans had fine but don't come running to me if you die Goku teleported over to the Chi ocean realm and Vegeta followed soon after why they found their made Goku's heart shatter though the kyshin realm was much tougher than most planets it wasn't invincible in fact there was a giant hole right through the center of the planet Goku and Vegeta approached it debido where are you there was no sign of life anywhere Goku was a little sad and nostalgic to see his home destroyed where there was no time to grieve Goku asked Vegeta if he knew anywhere else Frieza could have gone Vegeta was going to answer but then he felt a sharp pain on his shoulder he fell to his knees and Goku looked up to find a small ship hovering over the planet in a small alien on it it was obvious that it was one of friezes men and he has shot vegeta with a ring blast man attack vegeta right behind you Kakarot vegeta jumped backwards to face another set of soldiers now back to back Vegeta and Goku fought dozens of Frieza soldiers none of them could stand up against them but they seemed endless plus Vegeta's arm was a very hurt Goku and Vegeta both burst into Super Saiyan in order to fight but the aura bursts from the transformation alone was enough to blow away some of the villains there was no time to waste and the enemies wouldn't stop Goku began to fly away with Vegeta on his tail he yelled back Vegeta Namek what why just trust me the to Saiyans instantly teleported to Namak as a giant blast from the Frieza forces evaporated survey damned the Saiyans as they escaped but now on Namek Goku and Vegeta could rest for a second right no of course not though far away they saw Frieza ship hovering over the grand elders house Vegeta looked over at the person he had locked onto to teleport and it was one of his own soldiers from his band of mercenaries no wonder he locked onto him so quickly he recognized the key it had been months since he had last seen them for the sake of having some familiarity here let's say it was one of the guys from Turla squad Kakao what the hell are you doing here where's the rest it was friezes army they ended up at yard rent they said if we join them they wouldn't hurt the yard ray you know we couldn't have let them die Vegeta hated to admit it but he did end up loving the people of that planet but then he realized Kakao said they had joined Frieza Kakao explained that he would never betray Vegeta and that he was sure the rest of his squad would neither he was away from the main ship because they were tasked with looking for anime kyun yeah apparently Friesen needs him to use something called the Dragon Ball Goku and Vegeta looked at each other concerned so that's what it was they needed to stop Frieza but there was still one issue how was Frieza revived in the first place didn't have time to answer the question as a group of Frieza soldiers attacked cacao helped them escape by serving as a distraction promising to join up with them soon he had been training with Vegeta before he left to train with beerus so he was quite powerful in his own right Vegeta and Goku rushed at the granddaughters house finding some soldiers there they had to hide their key in order to not be noticed though some of the soldiers were leaving after finding a key spike caused by the fight with cacao Vegeta and Goku managed to hide their key running to the base of the grand elders place they heard a voice cackle so the Saiyans ended up at kayo shields place no matter they will end up here soon enough I have one of their friends at friezes feet late key Beto barely alive from his wounds Goku was clearly upset but Vegeta pointed at something next to key Beto was the body of Marie the grant elder they had met two years ago so that's what happened meanwhile at beerus is planet Kai ocean who was a little better than before explained the situation to the to the namekians they had been asking for our help but we didn't see it until it was too late the Frieza force they arrived and killed so many in order to revive Frieza they managed to capture a namekian and forced him to summon the dragon and wish for Frieza to return tycion coughed up some blood and the old kite took on this story they also forced him to wishful Frieza to come to Namak they had one wish left in Frieza asked for immortality but no kill me what elder no the Dragon Ball stopped working and Frieza took his anger town and the whole population using the time to train himself for months he became an incredible power torturing that immense until someone let it spill that they could make a new set of Dragon Balls with a dragon clan member but Frieza became impatient leaving his forces to look for survivors when he came to our planet he almost killed us he destroyed half the world he was looking for Kakarot kebede o helped us escape that's how we ended up like this Goku rushed in to fight Frieza landing a punch straight across the Emperor space caught off-guard Frieza was sent flying off but all the soldiers began to attack Goku Vegeta jumped out coming after Frieza wall Goku took care of the soldiers attacking him Frieza quickly recovered first thing his aura open as he transformed into a spinal form Frieza was glad to see Vegeta finally he'd be able to kill the prince Frieza I raced this finger charging up a death beam Vegeta was ready for it as he appeared behind Frieza flipping him backwards and slamming him against the ground Freesat swiped his tail tipping over Vegeta Goku kept the enemies at bay easily being able to defeat them once it was over goku vs aura into a mystic state to fight Frieza my turn Kakarot Goku stole the fight and Frieza got a huge smirk he wanted to show them his full power deny the Saiyans have gotten stronger but don't worry I have a challenge for you too inspired by your Super Saiyan this would have been more spectacular if I had gotten my wish for immortality but that damn namekian had to die no matter soon enough you'll be dead too the planet began to shake with every Scouter exploding around Frieza transformed his body into a golden one then he taunted the Saints telling them to transform into Super Saiyans it wouldn't matter Goku and Vegeta smirked at each other in an incident there was a flash of blue light and Vegeta burst into Super Saiyan blue Frieza wasn't fazed they couldn't be much stronger than him he thought Vegeta rushed in first fighting Frieza head-on but Jane's weaker than Goku in this universe and Frieza got a little more time to Train than in resurrection F this means that freezes actually pretty on par with Vegeta Goku ran over to capito but he was not responding he was breathing but he would not wake up the fight between Frieza and Vegeta continue but Goku heard a huge explosion behind him Pragya had been pushed into a volcano Goku needed to go help Vegeta but he felt multiple key blasts hit his body it seemed as if all of friezes men had arrived at the scene from all over the planet go couldn't escape the Mirage easily but slowly they ceased Goku open his eyes and so all of Aegina squadmates protecting him with cacao leading them cacao yelled back at Goku telling him to help Vegeta Goku nodded and rushed in to fight Frieza the twos fight was a lot of fun for Goku but Vegeta was a little upset Goku quickly realized just how powerful Frieza had become transforming into a Super Saiyan blue state and then it was over for Frieza Goku was too powerful for him Frieza though had something else in might as Goku got ready to fire a final blast that Frieza he whispered something but how could Frieza be so powerful he was nothing the last time I saw him he has a new form but beyond that he has a new ally Goku was shot and sent flying back onto the ship Vegeta looked back to see who shot Goku in his eyes widened a tailwhip from behind the person a man in white holding a smoking gun well if it isn't Prince Vegeta [Applause] thanks for watching guys that was one hell of a cliffhanger I know I'm planning on making the next video way sooner than you know it's taken to make the other ones I just I just have
