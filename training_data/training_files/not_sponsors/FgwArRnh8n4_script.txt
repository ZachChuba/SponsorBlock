[Music] what's going on guys welcome to another video in today's video we're gonna be answering the question of how much design do you need to know as a developer and more specifically how much design do you need to know as a front-end developer do they expect you to walk in and know Photoshop Adobe XD sketch figma balsamiq illustrator I know it's missing one but do they expect you to know that now not really not like to do the job so TLDR I also have a design file that I got from a real interview that I helped someone with yesterday converting a PSD Photoshop design file for those of you who don't know to HTML and CSS this is actually a really common interview question I was going to get it at my last job where I was a front-end developer by title and actually in the interview I said can I see the sketch that's what she was using can I see the new UI and then I opened up their laptop opened up the inspector and I started doing changes on the fly and I guess I got to skip that portion because I was like that this is totally totally doable yeah let's definitely do this anyway just a little anecdote for yet but that's where we looking at in this video I'm doing a giveaway for my resume and cover letter pack all you got to do is be a subscriber and leave a comment on the video and I'll pick somebody and announce them in the next video and if you haven't already head on over to twitch.tv slash Josh will a fluke where I'm currently streaming look at this quality content that you're missing out on have you ever hired so well that's just completely bombed like a white board test and they just somehow we're like look I know this was terrible but let me explain why you should still hire me oh and by the way I'm doing giveaways on Twitch too at the beginning and at the end of every single stream except you get to pick whatever you want from the shop so that's the twitch.tv benefit head on over to twitch TV slash Joshua fluke I will see you there featuring OCO the goodest dog alright real quick before we jump in there are two websites that I need you to go to and make accounts on the Hance and dribble where you going anyways go to dribble comm with three B's it used to be invite only where you why people could only invite other UI people but they took that away it's a place where people go to post their ui/ux portfolios mock-ups wireframe stuff like that and then you have the Hance which i think is owned by Adobe but for similar purposes even if you never post anything in it and your whole developer career go there take a look at what people are doing and maybe even ask yourself the question of could I convert these images or these wireframes to code I need you focused testing please appreciate you you're free to go okay let's talk about three important things in UI UX you got wireframes you got mock-ups and you got prototypes let's talk about wireframes first go to the websites that I mentioned previously behan sand dribble and go see if you can find some generally they're just kind of a basic layout of what the website is gonna look like are you gonna have two columns are you gonna have a header you're gonna have a footer what happens when you click this button does it take you to a new page as a modal pop-up like just basic UX basically out of the website no pictures no colors typically in a wireframe and these are important you need to know these and you're like well why do I need to know these well it sets you apart as a candidate if you can go to a UI UX person and say I don't think that this is going to work you can save the company dev time and thus save them money and I know you're supposed to get as close as possible as you can to their experience and their design but in reality sometimes when you're Devin and the design it just doesn't match up they had an idea for a modal of what they wanted to to do and then you're like actually this doesn't happen there's two separate steps due to the library that we're using or a third party API that we're using that requires XY and Z so these are gonna have to be modified and if you can go to them before that and tell them that and save them time save the money boom you just set yourself apart as a candidate so I recommend looking into wireframes definitely learn about those okay let's talk about mock-ups mock-ups are probably the most important as a friend developer if you're doing this on the job and a mock-up is just a picture just an image PNG jpg Photoshop design file it's gonna be your job as the developer to go wherever those images are stored and convert those to code HTML CSS whatever whatever it is that your stack is also mock-ups are very common interview questions they'll usually send you a Photoshop design file or sometimes not sometimes we'll just send you an image and they'll give you a time limit here's our picture you have 60 minutes as soon as you click this link the timer starts and I've had a few of those and let me show you the one that I was talking about earlier that's take a look at that so what you're looking at right here is a real code test they gave him an hour to do it this was two days ago and it came just like this with these blue lines and everything if you don't know what these blue lines are these are ruler lines and if you look up top you can see these numbers they help you space things when you go to make this into code and you can drag more down if you need so if you click up here you can drag more lines on the left from the right and so if you need help with alignment or to need to know how many pixels something is and all of that though ideally if you could make something like this responsive as well this looks like a desktop layout to me you could make it responsive that would be thumbs up if you use a library it's not indicated that you needed to but that would probably be a thumbs-up and that's that's it it seems easy at first you're like oh yeah I could make that but then you're like wait how do I do a menu with a submenu and then I got two columns here and then we have these things are kind of like breadcrumbs that would go here for navigation gotta colors right and so you got to know how to use Photoshop in this regard so you'd have to come in here with your ink dropper figure out what this is come over here to the left click this and then you can see your hex code so you know what you would need to do for CSS in that regard same thing for these like you're like well how do I make these bars well these are just horizontal horizontal rays I think it's called then you up the color and the thickness and that's that's basically how you do it and then you're like oh well I wouldn't need these icons so you can actually come in here and you can figure out things yourself this is what it looks like in terms of layers you can see the fonts that they're using and all of that and so you would have to take all this and find these fonts online or Google or get as close as you could to them and then recreate this and this is also what you do on the job doesn't have to be just for interviews we didn't have Photoshop design files like this with the rulers and the spacing and all that stuff we just had a picture and then if we need to know the color we had to use our Chrome extension to come in here and do a little eyedropper and figure out what the color was or we just have to open up slack and be like hey what font is this again what are we using or we'd have a design guide book that we could just open up like a little PDF that would tell us our basic colors that we're using our basic fonts that we're using if we got headers what size headers so you can see that this is a little bit bolder and this is a little bit thinner and this is a different font entirely or maybe this is an image you know how are you going to go about that and you can kind of debug and disregard so in terms of Photoshop you would need basic knowledge like I'm showing you now just to look up colors and fonts and stuff like that and then last but not least we have prototyping and there's a couple prototyping tools that come to mind right away which are envision and Marvel if you don't know what a prototype is it's when you just take the mock-ups and you make it look like it's a functional app but it doesn't actually it's not code it doesn't do anything and so you go to one of these apps like Marvel or envision and then you layer the pictures and you select conditions so if your image has a button on it you'll like highlight the button and then you'll select a condition that says okay on click show this image or show this little modal image and it makes it look like it's a fully functional app and this is how startups can like pitch their idea and stuff because it's like oh wow this is what would happen but again if you have some forethought about this you can be like well I don't know if this would actually work and they might even be like alright well can you do something better like show us how it would actually work and the software's pretty straightforward pretty easy to use and you can go try it yourself if you want I think Marvel has a free version anyway you can go try that yourself if you want but again I think it's important to know about these do you have to know how to use sketch not really but you might need to know how to use Epling which is an extension of sketch so Zeppelin takes sketch files or mock-ups and it exports them and you'll have like you'll have an image but when you click on it it will kind of show you the fonts and the colors and it will kind of try to kit will do the best it can to convert the image to code for you doesn't convert it to code it just converts the spacing and the padding and all that stuff it tries to convert that for you which can be helpful so that's one thing that you might need to know about but other than that that's really it you don't you're not going to be sitting in there designing but it's good to have some knowledge about it so that you can bring it to people you might be wondering how I know so much about all these applications and their extensions and all the stuff about design and well it was my job that's what I did at my last job but I didn't know it before I got that job I actually had to learn on the job like you deal with most programming related jobs they gave me a description it's it's been worth it for me so no no shell but anyways if you enjoyed the video hit that subscribe button hit that like button and I'll see you guys in the next one [Music]
