and I said you're watching Chelsea and Tony live again so nice to see you here did you lose weight it's Thursday it's 5 o'clock and tonight we're reviewing your best photo so get it ready if you haven't already submitted it you can do that SDP dot io / submit isn't that exciting I'm so excited Chelsea and this episode is brought to go to SDP dot io / link to send us the link while you're submitting your photos you want to go over one bit of cool yeah we passed one thing next week the theme is astrophotography some of you requested that and then stars stars and then in patreon I put up a little poll and you vote and you voted for Astro so congratulations it's happening thanks for supporting us on patreon we have Chris Reddy reading your comments hi Chris so you can send them your comments and he'll maybe he'll get them to us maybe he'll delete them there it's been a really slow news week but the one thing we have going on is that the people who make my favorite beer dogfish had made a beer called super 8 that is formulary for me Wow you can use it to develop super 8 fell from Kodak it's like a weird partnership between a beer company and a film company so these are the official instructions yeah you like take the beer and you heat it up and then you add some baking soda and vitamin C and you had j't ate it and then you just it's like super 8 film is like 4 video you know and you dunk the whole thing in there and then put some fixer in and I why I don't know I mean for fun honestly it sounded I it didn't like the idea of drinking something that could be used to develop film like that made me think of it as a chemical but you know what you can use coca-cola to clean your shower head oh so it doesn't seem like it's appealing are you gonna try it I mean the beer not the whole process yeah I'll try the beer are you I'm actually really curious about that kind of thing like I love darkroom stuff but we don't have a darkroom so we have a closet you want to look at some people's very best photos that they've ever taken these are your best photos speaking of astrophotography look at this photo it's gorgeous right it's gorgeous uh 70 mark 2 at 18 millimeters it's very like boom right in the middle you've got the the Milky Way leading down to the middle and then this mountain is framed by two rocks you get a pic sottano whoa whoa you okay did it yeah but the saturation is like it's hard to back it off when someone's gone there yeah I don't know why you can't turn it down I don't know once you turn it up you can't turn it down but very pretty I love the fog there it's a gorgeous photo I would even bet the average person likes with the extra saturation I don't know if that name is stephane or Stephanie sorry I would just bring up the whites in that something's going on with this maybe it's just underexposed does have a little better for you no I don't know somewhere between maybe I like the flag enos I like the mood of the photo yeah this one has a really nice moon too one thing I have to say is this lens flare in the middle I would remove that because with this framing and just the composition of the photo that's the first thing my eyes went to and then locked on and it's not a subject so I'd get rid of that what do you think Tom yeah I agree with that but otherwise nice photo but I like the natural framing meet you me more I really like these sort of very simple pictures that just isolate a single subject though the layers here are really really nice this would look this would look great in a glass print I almost want to make it more perfect thirds like Neapolitan ice cream right there's too much vanilla in this I don't know why you're talking about food you know how I get with this show like that yeah there you go that's it like shine August just gonna make me think of ice cream and move on with your life okay Caleb white whoa where did you go yeah this is gorgeous though I might have even tilted the camera back a little bit like the bottom sixth of the frame is all kind of dark and not much is going on and we definitely could have seen a little bit more of the stars so just tilt it back a little bit I think I'm just so gorgeous I can't believe you got that Milky Way so clear think that everything is really tinted green so I might just pack that off a little bit I say yeah that lighting that you get at night can be so hard I can be it always requires so it can be a challenge see I saw this one when we were loading the photos before the show and it just made me feel relaxed it's really beautiful I love the mood I love the simplicity I love the composition leaving your pick wouldn't you mind seeing a long exposure on that make the water a little classier nice use of layers here honor√© it's almost like the like the depth of field is so deep and then the subject is the mountain but there's something just a little not right to me I don't know I like it I think it's a definitely I think it's a spot worth revisiting I like the telephoto look here you know we're at 75 millimeters full-frame equivalent and that kind of makes things narrow and that's mm-hmm yeah it is really nice so revisiting that at different times a day you'll get different clouds different lighting conditions but it's a great spot I also understand it's probably isn't in your driveway you know it's probably not some place you can't readily revisit I understand that isn't always practical advice where is this I have to guess Transylvania Wow that pictures sharp 207 I like 320 like someone literally lives right in here underneath this gallon is up crazy to you yeah this place is spectacular how do you feel about that bridge to the left you I'm fine with it that's how people get too fancy world yeah I mean it's it's true it exists but it bugs me a little bit as well it's like the cars and stuff but it's it's you hate real life yeah let me - I've been hating it lately it's not great it's not as good as fake lake life right when you can just it's tough fictionalize everything it's better mm-hmm I've got that experience yeah we have 40 minutes left we're just gonna be looking at Carl's hotel Carl just told me where this place is we're gonna live there okay pick obviously pick because their compositions nice - it's not just the subject you picked a nice time the golden hour it's lit up the compositions beautiful you have this reflection and you have the leading line of the water like you put work into this but also I just want to go to this place oh that's also that little house yeah gorgeous shot great mood on it I love that little house but put a little mood on it we got to see it I think a big format would work really well for that like a big panoramic print it's just the stick I think it's so nice the business dick is driving me crazy that's how the ants cross the river how dare you I almost said you like get your feet wet and pull that stick out of the frame but then the poor ants they'd be separated from their families I'm really ruthless but I agree you should remove the stick oh you you knew about the ants and decided you'd remove the stick thing is what have they done for me I like Fatone I love the colors that you chose like you can see that you really kind of made the greens and a minty or muted color it looks really nice I think you did a nice job let me give you a peck blessed hope TV okay about those ants okay Galen gorgeous colors nice a simple subject here definitely it's about to revisit if you can like a little bit of fog here or some snow on the ground if that happens where you are we'll just be that one extra thing but it's really nice you also see like different grasses and stuff because the foreground like it's a gorgeous shot mm-hmm nothing going on in the foreground also like what if there were a moon or something like check your mama no check your moon and if the moon's rising behind it I'm just saying like this is such a good spot this picture as it is is great but definitely a spot to revisit try to find trying to make the best possible picture of this spot get the moon rising behind it get fog rolling across it revisit it 50 times we have it will be different you late house near our house and we go in fog we go and there's a moon rising we just photograph it in every different element this could be your spot if it's near your house well there's a little bit of stuff in the foreground that you don't like and then there's this over here okay let's see but I think I actually where's the best thing these grasses here right I liked them but your mistake Who am I am merely your equal and get a pic cast Chris do you have any questions like interesting ones or good comments I cannot hear you dang it that's re-manned okay-- yeah yeah dick wants to know he says he has got a D 5600 and months a telephoto longer than the D than the 72 300 is the next best thing like one of the Tamron or Sigma's 150 to 600 or is there any other options I it depends what his budget is the Nikon 200 to 500 is awesome we love that lens and then a step up from that is the 500 f56 prime which is expensive but really amazing I was never a huge fan of the Tamron and Sigma like 150 to 600 I really like the Nikon 200 500 better just me anything else Chris yep what are your thoughts on the growing prevalence of photos being viewed on smartphones and other small screens as opposed to large formats - this is Tobias he feels like it seems to encourage over saturation of the pictures when they're processing it yeah I mean you have to see where your audience is viewing your photos that's just kind of the reality of it I wish more people were going to galleries and just viewing big beautiful prints but most of the time if you're putting your photos on the internet people are looking at them on their phones and you have to consider that that's why often we say have a simple thumbnail because a photo that might like look gorgeous and a huge print may not translate on a tiny screen I can't say that you know it's what I prefer but it is what is and it's the reality and I and I go with that I don't try to fight that here's a practical example like this would look great on Instagram this would kill on Instagram monochromatic simple there's not any detail that you have to consume but this on Instagram once it's shrunk down won't look good it's a beautiful picture it would look way better than the previous picture in a big print because you have that extra detail to consume but just wouldn't look good on that stuff you just have to know your final format that's all we often in a beautiful scene will take a picture composed for insta and then we'll take another picture composed for print because you do have different audiences but yeah it's changed everything about photography let's change some things about what else Chris do you have anything else yeah the well here's a good one Tony the the whole idea behind tuning your lenses to your camera do you do that for your for your lenses or is it just being nitpicky I have definitely experimented with that and spent a lot of time trying to solve focusing problems with it and I have found it only makes things worse I've never had it actually solved it's it's just there's no way to make it consistent though here's the background on it if you have a DSLR it's possible for the phase detect focusing sensors to get out of alignment from the sensor like they bounce off a little kind of semi translucent mirror and it should be the exact same distance to the phase detector saying sister sensors as it is to the sensor itself but sometimes they can get a little misaligned and if that's the case then you could fix it with those adjustments but every other scenario like your lens misses focus sometimes it's not gonna help in fact it's gonna make it worse and most of the time focusing problems are caused by anything but that so people try to solve every focusing problem by making that adjustment it makes things worse I talked to a guy who worked at support for one of the big companies I forget which maybe it was a Nikon but he said the single biggest problem they get is people who get into that cycle of micro adjustments and screw up their focusing and then they call it mad and they like just turn it off like yeah your camera misses focus sometimes but you're not gonna fix it that way you only make things worse but there is this huge community of people just screwing up they're focusing by trying to fix it sounds fun it has no effect on mirrorless cameras no effect when using live you so I've seen people try to troubleshoot problems with live view and mirrorless cameras by doing that too but just stop just chill you're gonna miss I say keep going it sounds super fun Glenn Homer I like the color contrast look at this beautiful orange red dirt Plateau I'll call it I guess the blue sky Australia will be thrilled should we get rid of this car no it gives you a sense of scale and adventure okay just fine what do I know scale and invent you made a mistake but you know what who doesn't oh this is gorgeous I like this one it's so nice and simple I shot blame whoa this is a lot are the colors too much well just did you have to take a picture of every star Erin yeah pick one I'm just kidding no it just seems like really really intense right like it almost looks more like noise than stars what's happening no no one's yeah no I'll back you up I would definitely back off them how doing all the processing that you did I wouldn't just back it off like 30 percent so this all of the time Erin I edit it looks a little better I do a little more it looks a little better and then I go get a snack and I come back and holy cow what did I do so I developed this process where I edit and then I dial everything back like 20% even 30% because you just kind of acclimate to these gradual changes and before you know it everything's just like really intense so I'd say just back this off like 30% and it's great I like the composition I like the colors like the Milky Way is gorgeous it's just a little it's just a little bit too much pull too much of a good thing another shot with some nice movie I want to kind of import and just I want to see that bell pepper yeah I I don't know why I was flipping through and at first glance I thought this was some sort of nudity like for just a brief second I was like I can't show this you're like dang but I love this sort of gigantic I almost think I want like a little more contrast in it I don't know I want to see a little bit more of the kind of the shaded side of it but maybe I'm not oh okay a good shot that one okay I'll I'll do an import just down Chris do any questions for us Oh No you've gone silent again did you do that Justin yeah you did so that's me I'm sorry yeah there's a gear question here no boy what do you rep what do you recommend as a excellent lens for landscape photography what's what are a couple of good choices I dunno what type of camera they have a Canon issued me 780 D and a 6400 two different it's eye I'm gonna say the Sigma 18 to 35 f-18 it's very sharp the focusing is flaky but for landscapes that shouldn't be much of a problem just use live view on the ATD and you'll need an adapter obviously Tony and then you might even need more telephoto get the 50 to 100 it's fine it's from Sigma and if you need wider stitched together a panorama cuz it's easy we had a live show with Thomas Heaton and he had some good gear advice I think yeah he was talking about actually using longer lenses for landscape and it was something he was just exploring and a lot of his videos have been using that 70 to 200 for a different view of landscape yeah so maybe you pick your own whatever lens and make it your own you know like that's one thing I've noticed about photography it moves and trends so everyone was doing portraits at like 80 millimetres for and then I don't know about you guys we get so tired of it when everything looks the same or they do the same kind of like post-processing and you kind of have to keep up with the trends so that you don't look old-fashioned but if you stain it too long then everyone's tired of it but you can do your own thing you can choose your own focal length and your own style I think you should just go with it right you get bored of seeing the same thing yeah definitely it's Iowa by John Lee this is gorgeous it seems like a still life except I'm sure John didn't just casually move that huge tractor tire over but the way that rope is just draped over it it's it's just like a gorgeous thing I'm sure you stumble into this barn and it's just country living I love it awesome okay who is this adorable demon yeah this is fantastic you get a pic - Matthew that's hilarious that is how childhood is isn't it just screaming at bubbles you will obey me bah bah I think this waterfall shot is so smooth and perfect like the exposures just perfect their clip just a little bit which is kind of what I like to see though I don't know like this hole right bottom corner is just filled with rocks and I almost wish we could have pushed in to get a little bit but as you like see this like it kind of leads to the waterfall um I'm sorry can you make the sound again I like it nice shot Daniel Daniel you did it oh maybe I'll paint my room sometimes like we're in this mmm I like this is interesting this is different yeah maybe a little much with this saturation sigh you tried to fix it but you can never go back and that's something we've learned I just want to see what would happen if we made even more abstract I kind of like it yeah I like that too yeah beautiful job of the silhouette Sekai great light really nice I can tell this was a beautiful day Edie yeah I'm trying to come up with a suggestion for her but maybe we just cruise let's cruise it hmm this is definitely a beautiful scene a Kodak EasyShare I was like why is the sky so noisy yeah great scene a great shot I don't know I'm sorry I don't have any constructive criticism for you it just turned out nice my home is being such a pain Hawaii we just keep pushing next but it will just take us to a random photo can you tell me a question or a comment what is this this must be a comp this is definitely a picture directly from heaven how this happened wait no I think Chris that's a comp right Chris do you know what's happening out he tried to recover the the whites in it but they're just not there yeah but can't be a complicate cut out a bird so perfectly well I wonder cuz the feathers at the bottom right yeah they were cut out of it okay Rick what's going on what are you trying to pull here wreck yeah like the way that that castle picture was the Mont saint-michel in France no okay you should go there okay let me write that down sure and that's in Transylvania right yes if that's not true that out that would make me wrong you're no toy Transylvania is France yeah yeah something about that this is the like a beautiful couples portrait wait what is it called please no yeah we're going we I just bought a house there oh I'm so torn we got a Mustang Fastback but it's spot color like this gives me multiple feelings it's tough to photograph something when you have so many people walking around but he used spot color any deliberate and practical way and so I give him spot color points for that do you see what I'm saying yeah but I still don't like spot color but I think that he did it in a way that's understandable okay give you partial credit this is so cool Kareem yeah I'm gonna give this one a pic we definitely like I immediately noticed the fabric of the flowers but at the same time I felt like okay that's okay it's it's kind of larger than life anyway it actually seems to fit okay dang but I would have used a higher f-stop really nice really beautiful lines well oh he says it's a moon composite okay we appreciate your honesty you telling us the truth the moon can be very sneaky you've seen what happens when people don't tell us that's a composite we immediately go into like CSI moments and 12 minutes discussing it don't hurt yourself the only thing I'd say is that like all of the light around the moon is this purple color and then the moon is just BAM white so just match the color yeah I totally get the challenge I don't think it passes but I would just blend in the original photo a little bit more or something I don't know don't even know you know I don't even know who I am anymore you've given Chelsey an existential crisis Hubert wanna stay in here okay like don't you guys hate when this happens though you're just sitting around and then the fish man cuts your guts out oh I see what happened usually you cut the fishes guts out but here the fish cuts your guts out a la storytelling I think this person's a vegan thanks for explaining Wow Wow Wesley you get a pic this is awesome you get a pic book please don't drink that milk it's definitely past expiration that's great I love that shot that's gorgeous nicely done that is fun oh look at this little saw what our doesn't know tummy yep yeah like I don't I can't give you feedback because it's great I love the blue background against the golden eyes maybe yeah that's perfect maybe I would just make the yellows a little less green but it's so slight such a slight color difference yep great shot I'm gonna give you a pic Wow their photos are really great yeah these are their best shots maybe we should take a second - shots for everyone okay look at somebody's portfolio let's look at your portfolio and see what what you're offering there let me see what we got let's take a question while we look around if Chris yeah if that's possible Chris we it is possible here's a troubleshooting one that that's a good one okay says why our greens this is from Andre cuido why our greens showing up in my highlights when photographing at a sunset on his dog's fur and whiskers the Sun is at your back and using a Canon t6 with a 51 eight cringing like chromatic aberration he's talking about that I think that's what it probably is yeah I think it's probably chromatic aberration I mean it depends your lens could be causing that you could try different lenses and then also in Lightroom there's a curette chromatic aberration panel and you can take out the greens you can remove that that's pretty easy to do to will show you will show you shortly after we look at this portfolio I'm just still trying to pick a portfolio one this one there's a dog okay but wait it has one of these entry pages how do you feel about that it just feels like more work yeah for me because I just want to see it you know the internet it's like you are competing for people's attention and they have every other option in the world they could be looking at YouTube they could be looking at a movie that could be looking at TV they could be looking at anything so just make it easy for them to look at you so make sense to you photon photography your logo looks like one of the free Squarespace logos am i right it's really easy if you get a Squarespace portfolio it comes with this free logo making service and you can use different pictures and drag them around and change the colors and add text it's pretty cool okay I need to understand more about Dominic's goals in order to assess that so let's check out the prices and this is being automatically translated so if this grammar is bad you should blame Google Translate okay event photography from 40 euros marketing social medias photo shoot the home screen collection okay some kind of fine art things that's cool oh yeah for two euros okay that's that's actually pretty cool I haven't ever seen that done with me that's a great idea we should buy one okay maybe I won't do it now but I'll do it later and then a portrait photo shoot for 100 euros okay so he's trying to do events social media and portraits so with that in mind let's take a look at his portraits okay think it like we might want our portrait taken for something and so far I'm thinking like Oh picture my dog okay he can do that um could he do my senior portrait yeah I think this is all looking pretty good I that looks very wedding me I'm thinking about taking that one out and just going with this one it's the same subject and I like this black and white shot better Tim but it gives us a good idea of the different types of things that you do some have some are fun some are serious yeah those are awesome I think that's looking pretty good this one do you think that belongs in the portrait I like the toning and everything but um I don't think it's a super flattering picture of her and when you're showing a picture of someone and you want someone to want to buy it you have to ask do they want this to be them so if I look at this picture I think oh he looks really cool yeah I want to look like that I want someone to capture me looking like cool and artsy so think of that how does the person feel do they want to look like that photo and this one it's a nice photo it's just a little bit it's not about her as much one other thing I want to mention is that this layout this template the staggered format it works now because you don't have many photos and then they're the same orientation they're all vertical except for this one when you get more photos you might want to pick one that's just simpler and cleaner and if you choose one that's like a square picture you can you can change the picture so that you show what shows up you can control what shows up when people visit your webpage just makes it an easier browsing experience I think the events section looks awesome I mean they're all sort of like Club based but I think they're great examples and I think of somebody looking for somebody to get some event coverage anything that looks pretty good yeah I'm confused by the structure though because you have portfolio here and then you have three sub menus and then you go to weddings here yeah oh okay oh I'm confused but you have separate pages for wedding prices and then other prices I don't know why we wouldn't group all those together yeah so if I just looked at your first pricing page I would have thought you didn't do Eddings but now I look at this and these are gorgeous photos like whoa this looks like a magazine photo oh wait is this from Pinterest are these not your photos oh no what if we click it does it tell us I was right wait maybe it's just so you can put it on Pinterest right what's happening okay anyway we're a little bit confused which is fine but it's very hard to objectively make your own website this just means you have to organize things a little bit more every single service you offer put it in the same place yeah yeah and I'm definitely confused about the Pinterest thing I don't get what that's about how confused us and your defense were easily confused wait now you confuse this is a picture of Dominic but that was in your portfolio that means somebody else took the picture and you have your price in here too this is page number 3 with pricing yeah okay it is useful we have good feedback there Dominic consolidate this have one page with your pricing don't put a picture of you in your portfolio and give us a oh you know what get rid of this sub menu because sub menus sub menus just elevates promote these to a top level menu yes good news you have very good pictures I think a lot of people won't want to hire you you've just organised the website in a little bit of a confusing way but the website looks very clean and professional you just need to kind of consolidate and move a few things around with Squarespace that's it's called beating toning the love of my life you didn't make chitchat or anything this week did you know chitchat was crazy couple but Chris might have some comments from some reasonable folks I'm giving Nicolas a Tony here's a good one okay I'll see an Instagram this person let's see Dominic says how much of a difference is between a 24 megapixel on a forty eight megapixel camera make when you're posting to Instagram or to social media he says I see some poor portrait photographers on places like Instagram post insanely sharp pictures with an a7 r3 which I cannot replicate or even get close to within a seventy three don't they downsize everything down to a ridiculously small resolution anyhow um yeah they do but I've definitely been able to notice the difference especially because a lot of people will zoom in and sometimes I'll think I'll take like a wildlife photo which is gonna be cropped heavily and I think oh it's I wouldn't print this but it's fine for Instagram and then people call me out like why is it unsharp so I think you'd be surprised how much sharpness can actually be perceived on insta I would I would add to that we are in a if you're posting it and other photographers are commenting on it they'll probably notice more but if you're posting it for like just your own thing and people don't know anything about photography they probably aren't pinching and zooming for resolution and stuff but I notice I do notice check out this amazing photo from Mike biruta that's spectacular right yeah great shot I'm kind of skipping through here because we have a lot of some pictures how Chris do have anything else a question here and I think Tony touched on this and one of your the videos in the last couple weeks is pixel shift worth it for landscape photography and I think Chelsea you don't like it and Tony you do it's that's a lot of I'm not a fan of it but Tony you said you liked it if you're serious then yeah it's totally worth it if if like when I take landscape pictures I think I am building a portfolio over the course of my whole life and these pictures I want them to be viewed twenty years from now and a little bit of extra effort blending the pictures together processing it that's if it's visible at all and a huge print then that would be worth it to me so that's worth it to me but if you're taken up for Instagram it wouldn't make any difference so but if you want the best image quality possible yeah it's worth it this picture is amazing right what's that's such shade what do you mean I don't use pixel shift and my pictures are still worth it but I you you are such a snob for image quality I think you would love the difference between pixel shift with and without I don't know why you don't use pixel I sense a video coming on okay you're not competitive again yeah no I mean like we should do a video that we should show people the difference between pixel shift versus non pixel shift so then they can just see yeah that's a great idea but I think you have to also show the process because the process of taking a picture to use pixel shift that's not the hard part it's the post-processing it just takes some time it yeah it takes some extra time but you're right that's we'll put that on the list mm-hmm this is our friend Luis Chan and just amazing shot this is one of those rare shots that would look great on Instagram in a small format and would also look great in a large format print because you get the chance to really like zoom in and explore it a little bit got the birds in their trip but we never have time to even see our family well see our family this is great I love the person I have never seen this angle of the Taj Mahal that is fantastic you get a pic it's it's so refreshing not get that same symmetrical angle that everybody rushes to get awesome shot yeah going lighter yeah I'd like the shot I can't I like oh this is gorgeous yeah that's Hugh totally belongs in a calendar or something my calendar that's beautiful too hey are you the same person no no but similar styles Wow this makes me want to cry in a good way let me give you a pic it's high praise oh gosh what have you been through yeah well I happened he's like be right yeah he looks like he just like this is some game of Thrones stuff it's a tough day fishing right yeah assault the old fisherman great shot ash that's at 135 millimeters hang you guys got cards and look how proud he looks like I did that fish in good I love this picture so much I'm gonna give it a pic again multiple pegs that's a first I just want to see a little more the real on them oh that's awesome heck I love the colors the richness I feel like him yeah the diagonal of it it's very cinematic it's beautiful hmm um I wish I were a little less square like get up close use a little bit of a wider angle just like get a little depth to it you know but I like it reminds me of my girl Arya Stark rewatching Game of Thrones it's very it's actually way better the second time around it's because it's impossible to follow the first time one huh oh my gosh she was this derpy little dude that is so cute when they doing one a great picture sorry a great color contrast the orange that green eye contact look really beautiful I had to go back and praise it twice I like this color or just sunset Thursday Wow your Majesty's Coast guy I don't know why that cracks are you know this as an American it seems so silly and that is a spectacular picture of that brick that is incredibly sharp Oh with our favorite 400 f56 from cannon shot August pic August oh I love the colors and the processing yeah that's a good shot for instant mm-hmm give you a pic this is HDR and it's a little bit it's got that HDR grunge going maybe I'll brighten it up yeah hard to overcome that but I totally agree with the your processing choices here I would just modernize it a little bit but great shot Cindy really nice I find that processing them in Lightroom helps with that grunge what do you mean doing the HDR in Lightroom yeah doing HD of HDR photo merge oh yeah it's just a lot more subtle than like photomatix Pro or whatever yeah yeah good point oh that brightened it up a little bit yeah those HDR apps can make it too low contrast wow that makes me feel nervous oh oh that's awesome I'm such a slow drip gorgeous shot then we'll give it a Magic Mike I'd add a little color to it Wow I went a little too far I'm gonna be okay you you all are submitting such beautiful pictures today Wow pick this is so sweet I love the dew on the grass oh that's so sweet great shot good contrast okay it's saying that's beautiful yeah let's look at thumbnails I see we can jump to oh this I always like these shots kind of through the glass yeah great John whoa Harry Potter stuff you remember when I tried to get you into Harry Potter but you just mocked me and Cecily well now the joke's on you

we'll consider it we thought you didn't care so we ended it and when you were talking about that the bridge photo the panorama it made me think of I was wondering if you'd have have you tried any of the HDR pano feature in Lightroom I haven't used it yet but I have i I've shot that before and had to manually process it so I was interested in but yeah no I'm sorry I haven't heard have you tried it Chris pic Oh Chris got muted Oh Chris come muted I'm sorry Chris I can imagine what you're saying he's providing a lot of useful information at all ages yeah he's being held at absorbent as per usual

halfway through just the scrolling part of it cuz we keep stopping Wow how do you guys oh this picture on the stairs how cool is that creepy yeah that's weird right yeah I like it I like weird things

someone with a leaf blower to blow her skirt uh-huh that's a cool idea isn't that a great picture what's her name Ashley yeah but on Instagram she's like Jackie Lynn or something and I'm

whoa look at this one come on yeah you said I loved that shot and with an iPhone too Wow look at this one amazing Wow we are so lucky ticket Wow look at this one kinky as heck should we end it like this I guess so good sense let's take a question we're gonna all consider this kinky photo answer the question what is it Chris okay is it possible with the fast lens to get a focal range that's too thin freezing even basic subjects Rick Halliburton yes you know focusing on an eagle and he got his eye and the beak was out of focus yeah that's definitely I mean the case that I mean especially when once you get into macro photography and you start getting really close like it can be completely unusable but for faraway subjects I don't know I don't know I don't know what do you think tell us like 600 f4 often we're usually shooting that wide open and it's pretty fast but I never have a problem with that but I have a problem with like we have a lunge that's point nine five you know hard it is to get what you want and focus and focus when your depth of field is a slice of cheese like it's not easy yeah and often the picture will just look like it's out of focus even when you're like oh it's nailed focus it's just everything is completely blurry except this one tiny little eyelash focused look at her foremost eyelash no yeah it can be difficult yeah there's thick you can go too far this is gorgeous you guys you this was an amazing show thank you for sharing your best photos they were incredible and impressive and good night thanks Chris thanks Chris thanks Justin thanks t-carr that is all okay we need to put it on the list new intro new
