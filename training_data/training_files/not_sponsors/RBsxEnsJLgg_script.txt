Squarespace speaking of squarespace's I'm definitely not in one I'm in space mult isn't it crazy how I'm somehow floating in the void of nothingness where no one should be able to hear me because there's no air to carry sound plays across the space yet I'm somehow talking to you in this video regardless well I'm here because of that one time that Elon Musk said fuck it and decided to strap his car into the top of a fucking rocket and just shoot it into space with a dummy sitting at the driver's seat that dummy was actually just a decoy for me to green-screen myself in this space so here we are super versions and now we're back at the box because the budget for these damn things can't afford to support such high-end visual effects is not having an actual vision but in the past we've looked at several different celebrity twitter accounts there is that one time we looked at Kanye West's Twitter where and I talked a little about the I love it memes that we're making the rounds back then and I also refused to show you the one where nerd City ruined my day a couple times over in the form of Ricky Bartlett's asshole also totally unrelated but Kanye I'm just saying now that you've fallen parasitical you should also follow the vastly superior Twitter account act quite lots of banger tweets going on over there on a more wholesome note we took a quick peek at one Phil Swift's Instagram whose absolute innocence and dedication to giving us all the information he could about what goes behind the scenes at Fleck state headquarters was very hard work but today I want to take a look inside the mind of a man so complex Rick and Morty was created just to appeal specifically to his sense of humor and this man is Elon Musk now of course Elon Musk is followed by a fuck ton of people because duh he's Elon Musk sometimes called real-life Tony Stark because of how batshit off the walls he goes with the stuff he wants to make spontaneously like ah gosh I sure do hate being stuck in traffic time to dig a gigantic hole under Los Angeles so I can get to Chipotle faster or another one of my favorites I'm not allowed to ship things labeled as flamethrowers in the mail so instead I'm gonna name my flamethrowers not a flame thrower care genius but to truly get a look inside the mind of Elon Musk you must go to a place where any person who feels like saying something super off-the-cuff does and a spur-of-the-moment decision to his Twitter attacked Elon Musk has always been an interesting fellow and what he chooses to do with his various businesses but I think the strangest thing he's ever done is definitely the direction that he's recently chosen to take his Twitter in like I'm sure you heard he's dipped his toes under the land of memes and ironing all that shit that has every member of my generations parents worried about them and it eases into this let us remind ourselves that Elon Musk is always a good role model like here he's showing everybody that he voted and to do the same by making the daring move of tattooing the design of the I voted sticker onto his for honey to let everyone know that he did indeed vote it's a bit of a weird flex I gotta say but when you're Elon Musk you can probably pop off whatever you want and there's not a whole lot that people can say face tattoos or otherwise but it's just a very odd choice for a first tattoo in my opinion there's this one tweet thread where Elon is all like time and then follows it up with flies like an arrow but fruit flies like a banana I'm not entirely sure how to process this so I'm just gonna choose not to let's move on to the next tweet instead now back in like late October when all this Elon Musk falling off the deep end of ird ship was happening he made the mistake of asking the community to send in their dankest memes now before I get into the replies there are a couple things I want to show you first to start with and also Elon Musk himself had a couple choice followers one being the vehement rejection of Mothe memes another was a tweet with the caption my twitter feed right now and real quick I really do have to commend Elon for using the acronym of RN correctly millions of boomers everyday mistake it for the letter M meaning machete massacre you can help stop this epidemic by subscribing to my youtube channel it's test that tweet is the gift of cloned pickets you slap the shit out of real pic to chew from the first Pokemon movie which I can see being a pretty accurate summation of the mess that must have been Elance twitter feed at the time and lastly eelain's final response was I said day kiss not darkest oh my fucking god he didn't say the fucking part I just added it in there too bad it's not but with all that said let's dive into some of these responses that old heal on most certainly suffered because of the first one I would like to present to you was actually in reply to the dankest not darkest week and it's ELISA Simpson giving a very important presentation meme on the subject of Elin must hit posting just being a strategy to market towards teenagers in addition to the genre of presentation memes we had Bernie Sanders proposing another one of his outlandish ly radical ideas to Congress again this time it was a spoon as just a small ball I stick used to eat from a larger ball and I think I would have been perfectly happy leading a life devoid of that knowledge Bernie but that agency has been robbed them how well listen Eamon told you that this shit was Dart let's just do one more so we don't die quite yet subtitles music deaf people men whipping so hard his arm breaks come on guys that meme is kind of fucked up if you think about it yes fucked up that's fucked up all right that's enough responses to Elon Musk asking for shit post back to Elon himself shit posting and getting into potential trouble doing so little-known fun fact as well as being obsessed with getting to Mars Elon Musk is also equally obsessed with astrology as can be seen here and is how'd they know tweet horoscope you're probably breathing right now and the people just be fuckin shocked like they just found out that their colour Barnum there's a whole new ass colour they have never seen before but can you imagine being colorblind to pull Logan Paul I feel so bad Elon Musk has a meme dealer as well apparently and I'm a bit worried that Elon might be getting ripped off by whoever his meme dealer is I'm afraid whoever they are might be willing to take advantage of he Vaughn's relative newness to this whole field in Elon likely being willing to pay above necessary prices for memes that he doesn't need to pay it just wouldn't be fair to him if he's being taken advantage of like but anyways the caption reads fresh Piero from my meme dealer and the meme I'm sure was fresh at the time it got shit posted but nowadays it's age shows sometimes the caption makes all the difference listen to me Floyd you're tripping balls right now for the love of God put down the gun and we can talk this through this must be Elon relating his experience of smoking some weed with Joe Rogan to us and the only form he thinks will be able to understand or die he should know that just like him we are fluent in various Asian languages now perhaps the most dangerous declaration Elon Musk has ever made on his Twitter account bearing in mind that he also called the guy a pedo once was saying that he loved anime the world shook at these words a tweet that garnered 150,000 retweets four hundred seventy thousand likes countries the world over stopped what they were doing to stare in awe of the declaration before promptly becoming uninterested because they either didn't know what anime was or they just didn't care and then they went back to jacking off or whatever it was they were doing beforehand oh yeah Elon also says that he owns a chippy Wolverine which is a neat little fun fact and of course some ambitious chippy figure company decided to try and advertise the musk by offering to send him some free ones and were immediately roasted for doing so as proof of Yvonne's love for an Avenger although before he made the declaration official he a while ago said that he loved the movie your name which is a pretty type movie in my opinion as well also calling back to those very spur-of-the-moment decisions Elon Musk seems to like to make a lot apparently one day he decided to fuck around and decided it is time to create a mecha like how much caffeine does Yvonne take in just to decide to do shit like this like what is happening also a feature I didn't know was included in Tesla's nowadays is that when the car is not moving apparently you can play Atari games I don't know why I included that bit of information but it's there and I gotta be honest I'm not entirely sure what's happening at this point not that I ever did but you know but Elon has some helpful tips for the best way to play said Atari games where it's best if you play games full screen and use steering wheel scroller balls for control of course who could forget that one time that Elon decided to buy fortnight and delete it in order to quote save these kids from a tunnel virginity and because it quote had to be done you're welcome oh yeah and also the Twitter feed that ensued between Elon Musk and the official fortnight Twitter account where they made fun of Elon for not having a Mars base until like a decade from now just telling him to build which for your information fortnight there is a build height limit that you guys put there so it's not really an option now is it as always Elon had some brilliant commentary on society nowadays that specifically on the cultural effects of social media by making clever analogies to certain things that US Millennials and Gen Z's and teenagers are gonna understand in love Twitter is dark souls of social media reddit is blood-borne insta is Zelda oh I could not have said it better myself Elon no what I have ever said it at all probably because I wouldn't want to you have no idea what kind of doors you have opened with your words Elon oh yeah another one of those things that might have just been Elon fucking around was when he decided to just trademark Tesla Kela I'm not sure what for but if I have the guess it's for a tequila based off the Tesla but who knows maybe it does something else as well can you like poured in your Tesla and replacement of electricity and it'll run who knows Elon probably now of course eelain's Twitter shenanigans caught up to him eventually though of course only temporary this came when Twitter locked his account because of all the tweets he was making thinking that his account had gotten hacked and quite frankly I'm disgusted by this Elon Musk finally comes out of his shell to fully embrace that we've shitposting side of himself the part of him that we have thought gotten left behind when he got his fucked hairline fixed and what does Twitter do punished him for it Ilan's true form has taken shape recently in been a beautiful sight to behold I'm not sure in what way it's become beautiful but I just know it has and that's enough for me I think I'd likely regret it if I actually found out life enough for that or website it's the first link in the description but anyways I'm gonna wrap this video up here if you
