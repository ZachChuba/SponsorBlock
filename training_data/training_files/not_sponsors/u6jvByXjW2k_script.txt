hey guys welcome back to another video it is pouring down rain right now and i'm at a honda dealership i just want to park and set up my cameras but i want to see how the autopilot and the stop and go in red light and stop sign do in this rain it's really really raining bad so let's get right into the video so let's get going as you can see it's raining really bad and uh wipers are going crazy so i'm gonna leave the wipers uh at auto so it's in auto right now and the backup camera is going to be on and uh let's put it in drive and let's see how autofile it does in the rain so we are as i said we are currently at a honda dealership which is not an ideal place for a tesla but it's really really raining down um let's see so i've been wanting to test our pilot in the rain for the longest time let's get right back behind this thing with engage autopilot so we're currently engaged in autopilot the speed limit is 50 it's going 50 there's a white car that's about to come and then this is gonna turn all right so i'm just gonna let it do its thing i'm not i'm not even gonna take over so this is a problem with auto okay we're now coming up to a green light there's no follow vehicle so i need to like you know confirm it it's doing a pretty good job there's vehicles turning back and forth so i need to be extra careful again once again there's no follow vehicle so it didn't really recognize it uh i recognized that as a follow effort you need the autopilot system need another vehicle right in front of you to go through so as you can see it's raining really really bad um it's not an ideal scenario for autopilot but again autopilot is you know well fit enough to you know handle the situation hopefully we don't lose any of our cameras because when it's raining in the snow time it's notorious for autopilot system to lose the sight cameras because you know snow get clogged up but newer uh teslas they have like even the older one they have heated cameras but they're not great but the newer ones are even better so right now we are following this red forward um it's doing a wonderful job again because it's raining uh nobody's going that fast so i'm not getting uh hammered by anybody that's nice uh because the autopilot system again follows the speed limit you cannot really set uh off uh what do you call that okay i'm gonna have to let's see if autopilot stops yeah it stopped and it's like it literally slammed on the brake and it said take over immediately because that mercedes was crossing um i i knew that it's gonna stop so i'll let it do its thing we're gonna change um we're gonna go to that road right there so we're changing ready in sections bus again it's still raining um it's like coming in waves so yeah pretty bad out there is that right so we're currently waiting for that signal as you can see there's a bus and converter but there's so much yes okay that's not a semi that's a transit van uh yeah see that that's it's saying that okay now it turned into a transit man i recognized that as a semi for some reason man i gotta tell you all i love these cameras on the side that it's showing off because trust me there are blind spots in any car doesn't matter even if you have a car that's you know fully covered in glass your vision is only restricted to one area one zone so having these cameras is really really nice that you're you're not gonna you know really turn around and you know get your eyes off the road which is great i love it so let's turn now it's getting down real hard it's more likes okay now it's going to be a challenge so let's see if it allows me to put it in autopilot no i can't even see the road okay now it allows me to put it on autopilot let's see how it does that is crazy there's a signal coming i feel well okay there is a follow vehicle oh man it's bad okay it doesn't really want to drive it took off autopilot immediately okay i can't try again because it's it's like a puddle going down it's raining so bad now it's following that mercedes right in front of it i cannot see the lines it's really really it's nuts i don't know how waterfall is doing it this mercedes is going and we're gonna get a red signal anytime soon nope nothing so i'm just again gonna let the autopilot do it's giving me warnings please put your hands on the wheel be careful because it's not a good weather for autopilot it's not going that fast though it's it's keeping a good pace i love that i don't know if you can okay let me take a picture let me take a video on the side cam side uh profile i mean side view of my car because dang like it's nuts it's like water going everywhere okay now it's getting a little better oh no again it's coming in waves so you're gonna get really bad i'm gonna put my phone away i gotta focus on the road well autopilot is for the thing but still so saying that it's stopping for traffic control but it's not saying if it's red amber or green because even i couldn't see it because there's so much cars so many cars in front of me and there's a van and a truck i can't see the light and again there's cars in front of me so it's not gonna move anytime anyway and the uh i gotta say the windshield washer uh windshield uh wiper is working really good i love it um i whacked my car so it's kind of you know it's not sticking to the glass as usual but nice now we recognize the green light and turned amber it put at the red uh across line so what i've noticed is that once it turned amber once the traffic light turned amber it puts on the red uh cross line right there so now it's red stop right behind this honda and let's see how it does so i had some problem with this uh instagram because the right lane is ending so there's a bus lane right here so it's ending so it's merging into one lane so two lanes merging into one lane so i don't know how autopilot it's gonna be man you guys can hear this it's pouring down rain like it it's really really bad i lost my waist right there but uh yeah it sees that detour uh sign over there as traffic cone right there i don't know why that's weird okay now it's turned green there's a follow echo obviously so i don't need to do anything so i'm gonna keep my hand on the steering wheel let's see what it does stopping it's keeping a really good safe distance because it's raining you don't want to get really close because you never know how slippery the road conditions sorry i mean as you can see you can't even see through the windshield properly but the autofile is doing a brilliant fantastic job um it's i'm testing autopilot's limits today it's windy it's it's really really bad really really bad wow but i got to say i'm one of the lucky guy who owns a tesla because man if you don't if you don't have a tesla if you've never been in a tesla just go for a test drive it's not going to cost you anything it's free book an appointment with tesla i'm pretty i'm sure they're close by now like all the dealership areas but soon they'll be open uh once they do book an appointment and go for a test drive and the teslas are just something they're not cars they're not exactly vehicles they're they're like elon said in jordan's podcast it's a thing to maximize uh fun it's it's just crazy it's it's an it's an amazing car um so there's a truck that's going this way i don't know what what the lane is ending i don't know what he's doing now he's gonna put on the signal and then go right in there and block all the way okay people wow it's it's thunder and lightning guys heard that that's thunder right there it's crazy i was actually gonna park my car somewhere and just chill out but then i thought about you guys and i'm like hey why don't i test out autopilot in this oh wow oh wow oh wow autopilot disengaged it's really bad wow wow hopefully no water got in wow i'm speechless i am genuinely speechless damn damn okay it's raining really bad and you saw it was a it was like a little pond in there and my tesla just swam through i gotta save this footage it's crazy it's nuts wow and auto colored disengaged okay now i can pop it okay now i can i can't even see the lines so i'm not to complain man allah is doing was doing a great job until it saw that puddle it's like oh my god i can't see any i can't see anything hopefully when the full full self driving comes things you know get better and improve so like autopilot really doesn't need any uh any lines to see through probably it uses like some type of really high ai to you know navigate through the system it's crazy all those cars are just there you saw there was a scar that was stuck but tesla i mean there's nothing to get stuck on i mean there's no water in there in my cabin so it's waterproof uh so i don't know what what's what happened with the front hopefully nothing wrong with the front i just my car just swam through it's crazy that's that's nuts that's the first time i've seen pictures and videos on youtube and twitter of tesla going through puddles but that was the first time i experienced it myself and that wasn't a puddle that wasn't a small puddle that was a that was literally a a freaking pond that i went to an autopilot obviously it's not gonna work because it's raining really bad so yeah and i can't even see it it's really really bad i'm really really bad hopefully nobody hits me because just because i drive a autonomous car and it's a safest car in the world and says i have all these sensors and stuff doesn't mean that other cars and other drivers gonna be safe they're just gonna drive like maniac sometimes it's bad it's bad the weather is bad well my car is getting a wash and a dirty wash for that so it's going to be like half nice and washed and then half bottom is going to be like dirty water man it's bad i think there is a car that's stuck yep there it is there's several cars that are stuck wow okay there's a car that's stuck here there's a car that's stuck there um it's another puddle that you're going through with the small puddle down okay as you can see in the back of camera the puddle is real y'all it's a huge puddle right there you can't even see the lies it's crazy i'm laughing right now but it's really not a saving as you can see there's a lot of cars that are that put their hazards on and just chilling because i don't know what's wrong probably they're too scared to drive well they're putting on their hazards and driving it's actually a good idea to do but i'm confident enough actually it is actually a good idea to put them in the houses and drive instead wow hopefully no trees follow me wow i can't see i'm just gonna go into this apartment right here it's a random ass apartment it's really bad um okay guys it's dangerous it's really bad i'm gonna stop here for a second i'm not gonna drive man it's terrible [Music] this is the first time driving in this type of uh rain actually i've never [Music] let's go again hopefully i don't get hit by anything well i cannot engage autopilot but oh well now i can it still recognizes all the traffic light uh red light and green light and stuff recognizes cars not well but somewhat and the rain is really really bad and the wind is terrible it's bad really bad already let's get going wow oh my word all right we're back we're back wow it's it's really bad yet we're pushing through the traffic is crazy hopefully nobody get into an accident please guys if you're driving in this type of scenario put on your four ways go slow it doesn't matter what car you have safety is first but i love this this is fantastic water everywhere flashing man i love this wow this is fantastic man i love my car okay let's get all right i'm gonna take and conclude the video all right we're back to safety well sort of if one of the branches falls back on that car that's all but the glass should be strong enough to handle that hopefully fingers crossed but uh yeah i'm gonna park my car right about there and conclude the video already put in the park [Music] so how was it it was it was adrenaline pumping um scary yet fun yet dangerous don't ever try this uh never it's still i mean look at it it's pouring down rain and you can't really see anything it's crazy um i'm happy that autopilot worked for half of the leg and then the rest i had to drive because it's the road is not road anymore it's it's it's river it's a river now so it was fun um the car did just wonderful um i've been through i mean elon was jokingly saying about how the uh cyber truck will you know float i if you're not a believer you gotta believe it because this car almost floated so yeah so that's it for today's video hope you all enjoyed code and i'll see you next time
