months of Skillshare for free when a movie wants to drop you in the middle of the vietnam war we'll give you a few key indicators there's the lush jungle the black helicopters overhead the close-ups of boots in the swamp but perhaps more than any of this if a movie really wants you to be in vietnam it does so with the sale there have been few historical events as intrinsically tied to music as the vietnam war in our minds the war has a clear and distinct soundtrack and that's not just because these songs were released during the conflict it's because the vietnam war was an essential part in creating the very songs we now use to define it let's take a closer you while the United States was involved in Vietnam in an advisory role in the 1950s their presence really began to escalate in the early 1960s during these first days of escalation the seeds of protests were already growing in one New York neighborhood Greenwich Village inspired by the great folk singers of generations past the folk scene in Greenwich Village began to use their music as a means for political action one of the most important figures in the scene was Phil Ochs who would remain a constant critic throughout the duration of the Vietnam War he released Vietnam talkin blues in April 1964 is the word we use nice word to have in case we lose that song came out just a few months before August 1964 s Gulf of Tonkin incident which led to a sharp increase in American involvement in the war around this time another protest anthem was taking on a new meaning Bob Dylan's a hard rain's a-gonna fall originally written as a response to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis Bob Dylan song warns of some kind of impending doom it uses cryptic symbolic imagery to paint the mood at the times there was a feeling that something was hanging over the world that all of the symbols were pointing toward a hard rainfall that song took on all new meaning as Vietnam became more familiar to the American public and the symbol of rain in particular seemed altogether too relevant in 1965 Barry McGuire found a hit song that pushed the same message as a hard rain's a-gonna fall eve of destruction [Music] written by PPF Sloane Eve of Destruction paints the same dark message as hard rain but opts for a more literal approach musically the sound of early Vietnam protests was defined by folk defiant dark words over simple acoustic guitars but this wasn't the music that was being listened to on the ground in Vietnam one of the biggest hits for the soldiers in Vietnam drew from blues and rock and roll the animals we've got to get out of this place released in the summer of 1965 that song proved to be a fortunate choice for the animals to cover though it was originally written for the Righteous Brothers the animals take on it resonated with soldiers becoming one of the most requested songs in the US Armed Forces after its release just five months after in November 1965 one of the first major American battles of the Vietnam War took place in the AIA Drang Valley nearly 300 Americans were killed in that battle galvanizing action back in America one of the anthems of these protests came in the form of Phil Ochs defiant I ain't marching anymore [Music] but not all of the music hitting the American airwaves was against the war in December 1965 Staff Sergeant Barry Sadler decided that he'd seen enough folk music protesting the war so he recorded his own songs celebrating its heroism that songs Ballad of the Green Berets was inspired by actual events in Vietnam it was written in honor of James Gabriel Jr who had died there in 1962 just what they say the brave men it was a massive patriotic hit that topped billboards charts for five weeks straight the song that it knocked off the top was another key piece of the Vietnam soundtrack Nancy Sinatra's these boots are made for walking like what we've got to get out of this place Vietnam soldiers co-opted this song and related it to their own experiences walking through the marshes of Vietnam in heavy boots the song became even more popular with the soldiers on the ground when Sinatra went to Vietnam as part of a USO tour more and more soldiers will be listening to Sinatra's song in Vietnam with each passing year by 1966 nearly 400,000 troops were on the ground in Vietnam and the rifts in American culture were becoming more clear anti-war activism was on the rise and musically it was spilling out of the folk scene Buffalo Springfield still at a foot in folk but they were also tied to the growing psychedelic rock movement that movement would become a vocal part of American counterculture and bring on an explosive set of riots on Los Angeles's Sunset Strip in November 1966 these riots inspired Buffalo Springfield's biggest song for what it's worth and though it wasn't specifically about Vietnam for what it's worth became an essential part of the soundtrack to the era like its we stop children what's that sound what's born so it's common detached musically it painted a lyrical picture of the growing tensions at the time it vocalized a thought that many people were having at the time battle lines were being drawn between those who supported and resisted the war in Vietnam these battle lines were become even more clear as protests became larger and more frequent in 1967 by the time summer rolled around the American West Coast counterculture was having its heyday in San Francisco known as the Summer of Love the summer of 1967 was characterized by drug use free love and of course music and Vietnam protests the protest at this time was starting to take a different tilt far away from the earnest cries of eve of destruction some of 1967's most infamous protest songs used comedy and satire now this wasn't exactly new comedy was one of the best weapons in Phil Ochs his repertoire on songs like draft dodger rag or talk in Vietnam but these songs abounded during the summer of love this is evidenced in songs like Pete Seeger's waist-deep in the big money that song had a dark comic aspect to it so much that it ended up being too critical for network television CBS cut Seger's performance of that song from a 1967 episode of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour though a few months later after pressure from the public and The Smothers Brothers themselves CBS would let Seeger back on to form the song once we were knee-deep in the Big Muddy the big fools had to push on Arlo Guthrie the son of legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie took the comedy to a whole nother level with Alice's Restaurant massacree spending 18 minutes that song is a wild satirical take that protests the Vietnam draft if you wanna know if I'm moral enough to John are may burn women kids houses and villages I have to be in a litter but Country Joe and the fish also used comedy in there I feel like I'm fixing to die rag a song built around a memorable chorus while originally released in 1965 the 67 rerelease of that song helped to become one of the biggest anthems of the protest movement but not all protest music was this jovial soul music was proving to be a rich source of protest for black Americans at home and in Vietnam at home Nina Simone's backlash booze put music to a Langston Hughes poem that tied the Vietnam War to the civil rights movement among black America attackers freeze my wages and sin my son the Viet man in November 1967 Aretha Franklin released chain of fools a song about finding out your partner is having an affair and the meaning was co-opted by soldiers in Vietnam the darkness of Franklin's powerful voice gave the song a new meaning the chain of fools became the chain of command in a chaotic confusing warrior and it would be on Soul another popular song for the troops pulls this darkness into rock and roll the box talks the letter that song had lyrical themes familiar to any Vietnam soldier getting letters from your beloved back home and getting to go home and visit her these songs were able to speak to the soldiers because of advances in broadcast technology which meant that it was easier than ever for soldiers to listen to music while in the field it helped them keep a piece of home with them as they fought halfway across the world but the advent of technology also meant that it was easier than ever for the people back home to see what was happening on the ground in Vietnam and so as the war dragged on towards the late 1960s and more and more people were exposed to the brutalities of war the music of the Vietnam era would take a heavier darker turn and some of the greatest names in rock history would start to take on important roles in the cultural stage we'll take a look at that next week the description get two months free and to start learning
