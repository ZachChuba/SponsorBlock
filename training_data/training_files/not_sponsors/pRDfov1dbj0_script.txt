I swear this happens every single time as soon as you're ready to hit record something breaks and something's not working or something unexpected happens this is blind a brand strategy design consultancy based in Santa Monica California since 1995 blind has used the power of design to help diverse clients reach their customers and stand out in the marketplace in this series you'll get a rare glimpse behind closed doors and see the process of rebranding a company from start to finish this is building a brand on our last episode Matthew and Ben led the blind team through the packaging design process using the final style scape they generated three options for the Hamiltons to choose from after agreeing on a design and working with josh's vendor to produce the cans the creative directors traveled to hamiltonfamily brewery to see the finished product now blind will create a brand video for the Hamilton website this video will help site visitors understand who the Hamiltons are their passion for what they do and what to expect from their beer like a can on the shelf this video will be an important way for hamiltonfamily brewery to connect with customers that either can't make it to the tasting room or are thinking about going and are looking for more information blind will accomplish this in a couple of steps a shoot with Josh and Kristen to let them tell their story a shoot with the beer to show off Hamilton's craftsmanship and finding the right tone to set in the Edit through both shot at music selection as you guys know all this stuff is happening at the same time website packaging the it's all going on at the same time and one of the things that I want to put on the website is a brand video and I want to I want this thing to kind of play in the background until the user clicks on a play button and then the play button would open up the video in a larger screen the goal of the video is to tell the hamiltonfamily brewery's story what the experience is like what they stand for what their beer is like our goal is to capture as much of that as possible in a nice tight sixty Seconds to two minute video that will tell their story and live on their site without them fortunately I'm a video expert I've done hundreds of thousands of videos in my time I've never done this before what is the video production process producing a video breaks down into three major steps step one pre-production this is where we plan everything we start by identifying the communication goal of the video then we figure out how to do it what locations are we shooting in what crew and equipment do we need and how do we schedule and plan all the shots that we need to capture the day of the shoot step 2 production this is where we capture everything that we need from picture to sound we try to capture all the raw source material we need for the final edit typically we overshoot here because we'd normally only get one shot to capture at all step 3 post-production this is where it all comes together here we take all the raw footage and sound we edit it down into a very tight story then we layer in music to dictate how we want the viewer to feel and then we do a final color and add some graphics to make the video pop Matthew and Ben walk the production team through the creative brief for the brand video during the meeting they outline the overall vision for the video as well as specific production goals to be accomplished both on location at hamiltonfamily brewery and here on blinds production stage I mean this is pretty cool wait we get to bring our team which you guys don't normally see we get to bring Stuart and keV and Mark along the trip with us and shoot all this stuff so for us there's a lot of planning that goes into this we have a very narrow window of time that we have to coordinate with Josh in the business there that we're shooting between business hours we got to bring over tons and tons of gear both camera lighting audio c-stands just to make this happen because normally we have all this gear here in the student we're able to capture all of this very nicely now we have to bring all this gear over there on location and this is also a big challenge then when we get there we have to make sure that the plan that we have laid out is going to be executed perfectly our team ventures into the pre-production stage organizing an inventory of gear necessary for achieving the look and feel for Hamilton's brand video while also figuring out the most efficient schedule for maximizing their small window of time at the brewery [Music] it's almost 7 o'clock and obviously the reason why we're going so early is because we're trying to find some quiet time this is a working brewery we need every day every morning they have a crew there that shows up and they're cleaning they're brewing there they're doing stuff that's always a tricky thing if you're going into a space where there's activity going on to make sure the business is functioning that day we have the tippy-toe around that because we don't want to disrupt it and then and have such a big footprint where it disrupts the flow of the business we don't want to do that even if we give ourselves time and padding to set up and do all the things that we need to I swear this happens every single time as soon as you're ready to hit record something breaks and something that's not working or something unexpected happens and hopefully that doesn't happen the team gets to work at hamiltonfamily brewery rearranging the space to capture the most picturesque qualities of the tasting room while lighting for a polished cinematic image and when you're lighting a scene you want to control light as much as possible before you start setting up lights we started lighting with this kind of light sun's gonna come up everything's gonna change we're going to be moving our lights on the fly so we're just trying to we're really just locking ourselves in so that we can swim inside those tubs back and those forensic gearbest gives you a good defuse so all the light bounces all around here it was very challenging working in that space because it's an industrial space we have a lot of hard surfaces and the thing is with hard surfaces like this you have a lot of sound reflections and when you have sound reflections you get a lot of echo and that doesn't sound great for audio capture so I have to do is we have to treat the space and the way we did that is we brought a bunch of C stands and sound blankets to help dampen the sound because when you put a soft material or sound absorbing material all of a sudden it makes the voice sound rich makes it sound nice and quiet and tight so you could focus on what somebody's saying versus all the ambient atmospheric sounds so we had to treat this base so that we can capture Josh and Kristen's audio properly something I noticed you guys were doing was using multiple mics right yeah what was that well for us it's like we only have one shot to do this and especially with our time running out now we had to make sure that we get it in the can so we had a boom mic which is this long mite that we have pointed in the direction of the talent and we had a LOF on them which you see on my lapel right here so we have two sources of recording audio at slightly different levels just in case one goes bad one start speaking and it sounds really gross we're just trying to get coverage for safety so if you look at this framing you'll see that we're gonna be shooting at the shadows because that light is gonna be hitting that right right there yeah you'll see that a lot of movies with a kick light so that little tie together see where we're gonna do if we need that to help shape the back of the head so that's known as like a kick or a hair light we're gonna use that to or an edge light we're gonna use that to probably create more separation between the silhouette of Josh in the background there so this is without it right you can see it's pretty flat we just have all this ambient lighting coming in so now we're turning that on and you can see there's a nice key light right here and then we're shooting into the shadow so we're gonna have a little bit more shape and definition of the face the top tip that I have for you guys when making videos is hire great people who know that what they're doing what's lid right now as soon as we were ready to green light and and start hitting record on that camera there was some construction crew right across the parking lot who started turning on their equipment oh no it wasn't construction crew it was a car washing crew that brought a generator and a pressure washer at this moment the pressure is on so this is one of the challenges there's a lot of sound outside there's some people power washing some cars out sorry luckily we have this door but we do hear a little bit of it I think we're gonna be good yeah I want to close those glass doors and then we're gonna shut the walk-in down and then a little kind of mini cooler over there shut that off to hopefully not ruin the entire inventory of beer yeah do not do that I was just looking at the clock like dude we're running out of time are we gonna be able to do our job with lighting camera and sound all ready to go Matthew prompts Josh and Kristen before the interview Kristin has a great perspective on what it meant for them as a family what the feelings and emotions were like going through this endeavor of becoming entrepreneurs giving up everything and starting the brewery while Josh I wanted to focus on the educational aspect of it like what makes their beer so special what makes that experience so special and what does hamiltonfamily brewery all about what does it mean to him Josh is more business and product Kristin's heart and home [Music] all right now it's Josh's turn we're interviewing him as you guys can see so he's now in the hot seat our talent that's right we got the crew here we got everything framed up oh wait red lights are red I think we're shooting up I'm Josh Hamilton and I'm the co-owner of Hamilton family brewery along with the interviews the team captures extra footage on essential beer ingredients emphasizing its textural elements through sounded picture Hamilton provides the team with more of their products to bring back to blind where they can have a controlled environment to work on capturing the beauty of the beer the blind crew will shoot the beer at a high frame rate allowing them to capture a smooth slow motion version of the perfect pour and it's like just a beer Wonderland they have cans and bottles and glasses all over the place and there they're pouring under these hot lights and you can see the beer glasses like glistening with condensation and I'm just like and of course after every take it's like all right beer dumb just pouring it out all that beautiful golden beard we set up a bunch of Lights a high speed camera and we were just doing a bunch of beer pours all day so one can after the other different angles just so that we could capture the beauty that is the Hamilton family brewery beer [Music] damn that that is beautiful oh great where's the dry ice for the added effect yeah well later that this thing is like sweating right there like that juicy oh my gosh it's looking really good yeah I'm thirsty very thirsty but the footage is looking great I think we just need a couple more key shots in there to capture for our shot lists Alicia's yeah serious about that for the first time I heard in C and the client anymore taste the film is like totally literally what does that mean it means just making food or beverage more visually appealing but not like our direction we were like it makes you sound right or makes you thirsty right buddy see all these beer shots and food chocolate kind of look the same as a sweating glass uh-huh because there's something in your mind right that makes you go oh man I want to drink that you can kind of like taste it through the screen right up until this point we've been focused on the visuals how do we capture their story how do we show off the brewery how do we show off the beer but that's only half of the total effect the other half of this brand video is the sound and the music music tells you how to feel if you think about any movie that you watch or any show that you watch when you feel something take note of what's being played in the background sometimes my three-year-old and I will sit down to watch a movie and one thing I've noticed is that she responds emotionally to the music that's in the movie so we could be watching something really kind of scary for a three-year-old but if the music doesn't communicate that this is scary she's fine but as soon as those ominous tones creep in she's like Oh daddy I'm scared you know hmm so you're totally right music creates emotion when we're going into the edit we're using a library from epidemic sound who's sponsoring this video thank you so much when we're creating this brand video John and I the editor we were listening to multiple tracks we were listening to different genres we're listening to different moods different tempos so that we're trying to find the right music that's going to set the right tone for the brand video Matthew will work separately with the editor of the brand video John Pham auditioning a variety of tracks until they have their Goldilocks moment a song that perfectly sets the tone for the brand video [Music] it's already too heavy yeah I got very Spanish I listen it's not it's not bad we get up let's if we've it's like we like it we should just say them so if you add that to a flavorless yep click that and then [Music] there's a cool feature in here where you can find similar tracks and you could open that in a new window find similar so yeah okay so now it will bring up anything that has similar parameters in terms of the mood or the genre if you thought picking the right color for our brand is difficult music is even more difficult but because it's hard to talk about and I feel like that's language that I don't necessarily have like I could talk about typefaces and colors and point sizes and design all day but when it comes to music that's where it I'm a novice and then even working with editors we just got to make sure on the same page when we're using language because we have to get that aspect right after exploring a variety of genres and moods Matthew and John have narrowed it down to one track that they hope is a perfect fit Matthew will now pull in Ben to get his feedback before they lock the edit and put the finishing touches on so they can present to Josh having put aside a lot of great choices Matthew is hoping Ben will love the final mix of music and images that have been created so you know I've been working with John now and you haven't seen any of the edits until disputant I haven't seen anything since we went to the Hamiltons a shot right yes it's been in my lap for a while so what I'd like to do actually is to get your reaction to the video yes let's do it I want to see your take because I feel like you're the closest to Josh and know what he likes and I need you to tell me honestly if you feel like this is something he's gonna go for and represents the brand because you're super objective you you haven't seen any of this at all all right fingers crossed Ben could love it he could hate it or the worst thing is he could be lukewarm on it and I don't want that at home been love people love beer oh oh oh you guys killed that yeah that is crazy good yeah yes yeah oh my god I love that that's not just for camera right no no I forgot they were there no so I mean you guys found some amazing b-roll and and I was like blown away by that and I love the kind of like back and forth between Josh and Kristen because it really was like two sides of the same story the heart and a home and then the business of product and it was just great there's pictures in there that I've never seen which was also really cool cuz it almost took me on the journey with them which I really really liked good job with the picture locked sound mixed footage colored and the right piece of music selected Matthew will present the new brand video to Josh and Kristen for final approval hey you know we shot a couple weeks ago at the brewery and our intent and goal with this video was to create something that captures you guys who what your story is all about what the experience is like at the brewery and what makes your beer so special and magical so like that was our big goal with this that captured this all in one video and do it in a concise way that will tell your guys's story without you being there so we're recording this obviously so share it with you just want to get your reaction to all of this stuff and then we can talk about it love people love beer beer is better when you're drinking it with the people you love and the best way to serve the people you love is with great beer that had heart and passion brewed into it [Music] hi I'm Kristen Hamilton and I'm co-owner of Hamilton family brewery with my husband Josh I'm Josh Hamilton and I'm the co-owner of Rancho Cucamonga Hamilton family brewery Hamilton family brewery is a small brewery my wife and I started originated in our backyard just for me falling in love with the process of brewing beer and creating new stuff double mangles our most popular beer here and I think the reason why is it appeals to a large group of people you have people who are hotbeds and all they want is really hoppy bitter beer so we have as double IPA loaded with hops and they're the type of hops that have tropical notes and what the mango serves to do is bring out these juicy notes from hops so people who just wanted hops have those accentuated people who wanted fruit are getting those flavors from the hops so they're both in agreement we love like having people in our backyard for beer we wanted to bring that sense to the brewery you can't from work and he was like hey BAE what if we sell our house and started for you wait what's like sell our house we have two kids in three days our house sold for over asking price takes a year to open a brewery or longer we did in seven months we like to think of it as ours originally but now it's definitely it's the city's everybody comes here and drinks we just serve the beer if you're looking for a brewery that's gonna welcome you in treat you like family place where you can relax and enjoy a great beer come on down to Hamilton family brewery we'd love to have you I want to go to that brewery Wow that was gorgeous like all the close up beer
