that's no moon! Hey guys on the last episode of make it
real I challenged myself to a one-day build to make Han Solo's DL-44 blaster
and I think it turned out pretty good plus it works too! Now a lot of people
asked why I didn't just start with a Mauser broomstick pistol which is what
the original prop was actually based off of Well, there were a few reasons the
first one is it wouldn't be much of a make it real project if I just used a
pistol and made it look like a blaster besides where's the fun in that and
secondly those are actually pretty valuable antiques it would have taken a while
to even find one kind of makes it hard to do a one-day build when you have to
order all the parts you need and finally I'm Canadian, handguns are
actually restricted weapons here so I'd literally be breaking the law just to do
the project and you know I kind of like making videos and not being in jail but
anyway enough talking about it it's time to see what this can do against some of
our shield projects oh and the Death Star! that's no moon before we get to
that I'd like to tell you guys about our your website today now let's see what
this thing can do Okay we're shooting the flare gun That's forceful wow those are really
force steel again do it again That cracked the glass even more dude! should have seen that coming *From background* You shoot like a stormtrooper! James: What are you talking about? I hit him! oh this one's empty so glad you're proud of your ward That's no moon
it's a space station let's do this valve Let's film this can't actually stick it in that far you
can Alright everyone, cameras get the cameras going this station is now the ultimate power
in the universe that's no moon yes right through the laser hole! and
then watch nothing happening nothing but ready ready Christ I'm in ready
that's no moon That's no moon! I am successful well we hope you guys
