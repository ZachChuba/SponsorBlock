coming oh hey landlord wait a minute what are you doing here you know I moved right yeah I'm still your landlord and I suppose you're gonna ask me to pay rent uh-huh and at first I'm a little upset but then I remember that I can just do a brand deal so I transition to that leave you hanging for 15 minutes before coming back for a comical resolution at the end of the video is that what you were expecting uh yeah pretty much word for word huh and becoming too predictable oh wow today's video is sponsored by audible and audible.com such drew gooden or text drew gooden to 500 500 get a free 30-day trial and a free audiobook why do you look so mad did I do something wrong oh I'm not mad at you I I just wrote a really dumb Facebook post this morning and I'm still thinking about it that's funny that's what my videos about huh what are the odds of that like one in 12 sounds about right All Right see you in a few minutes yeah I know the drill everybody's mad about everything all the time now and it pisses me off did we used to be this mad about stuff and like nobody knew because people weren't constantly sharing their anger with each other or are people just angry or now because it's so much easier to find something to be mad about I don't know but here's how I spend every morning and let me know if you can relate to this I wake up at a time I'm too embarrassed to say already feeling like a human turd and so I grab my phone and start scrolling it doesn't matter what app on which I am scrolling they're all the same Twitter Facebook Instagram you just scroll and you continue to scroll until all of a sudden you see it the worst opinion you've ever read in your life and you're already few me now would probably be a good time to set your phone down and start your day but you don't do that you keep on scrolling cuz you want more and then you see a headline that makes you so disappointed in humanity that you're forced to go down to the comment section in search of even the slightest amount of respite only to be let down by the new worst opinion you've ever read in your life and now you're pissed and that's how every morning starts I do it you do it every does it and it sucks why why don't we do it it's a hundred percent avoidable but why do we go out of our way to find things that will make us mad well for one I feel like a lot of it has to do with the sense of entitlement that we all have is a byproduct of the time that we live in we're so used to getting what we want when we wanted and seeing what we want to see when we want to see it but I think even more than that people feel entitled to their emotions because let's be honest it feels pretty good to be angry our little caveman brains loved to be angry it's a need that we have sometimes and so when you feel those urges coming on it takes a lot of self-control to ignore them and so we usually don't sometimes though there isn't anything valid to be angry about but we're so accustomed to being angry that what do we do we find the most trivial things to be mad about because if we're not angry at something or someone else that anger inside of us has nowhere to go and we're just gonna be angry at ourselves I don't know about you guys but I [ __ ] hate myself somedays I think a lot of people can relate to that but if you find something to temporarily redirect your anger towards it will distract you from how much you hate yourself that type of anger is a defense mechanism and often is disguised as this like false sense of moral superiority that's what you see on Twitter a lot it's people getting mad or offended at something so inconsequential and they more or less are using that to say look at how bad this person is or how dumb this thing was I never do something like that I never say something like that and it makes you know better about yourself but right now I'm ranting about nothing in particular so let me get more specific because there were a few things that happened this week that sort of inspired this whole tirade here that would actually be wrong a lot of people are mad about right now is Shane Dawson if you're not aware Shane is in the middle of releasing his 57 part documentary series about Jake Paul and - everybody's pissed did two big complaints that people have are one it's too long it seems like he's milking it especially the first few parts seemed kind of unnecessary and they just wanted to get to the point and then two people have said that it seems he's trying to diagnose someone he doesn't know with a mental illness and also editing the videos in a way that sort of paid the people with that mental illness as some sort of a motionless monster both valid complaints sure the second one I think is a little bit more valid but he put a disclaimer in the video he added his claim at the beginning of the next video he went on Twitter and apologized multiple times and to the first point yeah of course he's milking it of course the series is longer than it needs to be but like people are so angry and so genuinely upset guys its YouTube have you ever watched a video on YouTube that wasn't too long I think this complaint just kind of bothers me personally a little bit as a fellow creator people are so entitled to having their free content be exactly the way they want it I paid zero dollars for this video and I had to fast-forward briefly my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined speaking of me I also was the cause of some anger past couple weeks because my last video as some of you saw was about Vin Diesel and as I expected a lot of people who don't know me but our fans of Vin Diesel found the video and weren't very happy about it why does this [ __ ] show up on my list god damned pretentious critics on YouTube critique yourself with your whiny nasal voice serious lack of humor slow boring video [ __ ] derp essence we Diaz childlike frame I can't believe you spent 20 minutes on analyzing a guy and [ __ ] on him you must be jealous or hate him can't you act in a movie or do interviewer I don't know some [ __ ] instead of analyzing other people's flaw you have absolutely no right to talk about Vin Diesel like that when you look like the sloth from Ice Age if he were malnourished and three feet tall I actually can't argue at that one that's like a top tier roast don't diss on then you won't be half the person he is head you have no place to diss him here's the thing I probably wouldn't have felt justified in making a twenty-minute Vin Diesel cringe video if it wasn't for the first clip I reacted to wear and a lot of people want to gloss over this for some reason he sexually harassed a woman on TV he did it on camera - a woman who's stuck in that situation because she has to stay there and finish the interview no matter how uncomfortable she is and the fact that he's relentlessly hitting on her in that situation unable to read the fact that she's not interested in oh also by the way he's married I feel like once you do something like that you open the door to criticism a little bit and if you're one of the people who commented something like no drew that's not cringy he's just spitting games what is there in the beautiful world he's just flirting when did this turn into I love you you wouldn't understand because you're a virgin first of all so what if I'm a virgin sex is scary and gross and I don't want to do it second of all no everything you said was wrong he's not just spitting game and if you think that's how you should flirt with the woman you're part of the problem is because your hero Vin Diesel does that doesn't mean it's justified that means he needs to learn not to do that and you shouldn't emulate him just because you like his movies the last thing I want to talk about that everyone was getting mad at this week was the presidential alert that went out on Wednesday afternoon to basically everybody in America it seemed like everybody on Twitter was either mad about the alert or mad at the people who were mad about the alert because they were mad about the alert the weird thing about this though is I felt like there was a disproportionate amount of the latter where there were a lot of people mad at the idea of someone being mad about this but there weren't actually that many people mad about the alert most of the tweets I saw talking about it on Wednesday were just people making jokes 90% of it was just photoshopping the alert to say something else the joke I tweeted was and I'm only going to explain this because I'm sure some of you didn't see it I'm not explaining it because I think it's a joke that needs an explanation it's a very simple chip but what I tweeted was I was pretending to be upset about the alert but then you click on the screenshot and you see a text from my asking me to stop leaving my shoes in the fridge that's the joke and even though I got a lot of replies to this tweet they were all basically the same two things over and over again it was either someone thinking they were some detective uncovering information they weren't supposed to see oh yeah but what about that second text no one wants to talk about the text from his wife you can take off your detective hat that was the point of the tweet I put it there deliberately but it's funny how many people tweeted at me something like that as if that wasn't intentional they thought that I accidentally put that there but then the other responses were people who didn't actually click on it and find the joke they just assumed I was actually mad about it so then they were mad at me like this guy who's verified for some reason and follows 200,000 people on Twitter said does it make you angry he seems really excited at the idea of me being angry about this I feel like this tweet and the responses I got are the perfect example of how so much anger exhibited online is predetermined it doesn't matter that all it takes is about three seconds of looking at this tweet to realize it's a joke if you're already wanting to be mad about it you're gonna be mad about it it doesn't matter that in my Vin Diesel video I've met Vin Diesel at the end and it's clearly a wax figure but people still called me out on the fact that I'm an idiot for not realizing it's a wax figure like I didn't realize it wasn't actually been diesel are you [ __ ] kidding me but anyway that's pretty much the end of my rant that I'm now realizing is a little bit hypocritical because you could probably say I was overreacting to some of these things and I've spent the beginning complaining about how people overreact to things oh well I don't know about you guys but I'm spent and in the need for a little emotional detox after such a long winded rant and so I think the perfect thing to do would be to open my wolf ring finally if you're not sure what I'm talking about a couple videos ago I was reacting to this channel called luxury pranks and I found their merch website where they sell a free merch you just pay like six or seven dollars for shipping and I thought that's interesting but it reeks of something fishy obviously they're not gonna be losing money on this they have to be profiting on this so I ordered something myself it took about six or seven weeks to get here but it's finally here and I'm ready to open it if you're curious it was shipped to me from Vietnam which is why it took so had to go through customs apparently they waited out they estimated the value at about 93 cents that was the monetary evaluation done by the US government good thing I spent $7 on it and it took two months to get here but enough talking let's open this bad boy up I do like bubble wrap ASMR you guys like that well it's pretty much exactly what I expected it's a wall I've never bought a ring before so I didn't know what size to get so I got a size 10 and I'm now realizing that's way too big it doesn't fit on any of my fingers you know I've waited so long for this moment and now that it's finally here I don't even know what to do I guess I just have to wear this in all my videos now it is pretty dope I think people are gonna start taking me seriously no more Vin Diesel fans calling me a dweeb I got a wolf ring now Oh things are looking up it's time for an ad read hi and all of your dreams will come true Oh guys now that that's done I've got some bills to pay so I'll be right back looks like you're exactly 93 cents short what damn it that's all I have well I'm sorry to break it to you but unless you have a pile of change in your pocket your ass is grass I mean your your ass will be on the grass I don't understand what you're saying I'm gonna evict you but you can't I just did a house tour that would be so embarrassing well there is one more option anything I mean if you I don't know had something in your possession that was recently evaluated by a government agency is having an approximate value of 0.93 u.s. dollars maybe I'd be willing to let you stay for another month it's a wall I think people are gonna start taking me seriously Oh fine you can have it but don't expect it to fit it fits perfectly what how is that possible see you next month
