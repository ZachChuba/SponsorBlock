[Music] today i made the intelligent decision to go deep wilderness rushing with 180 mil risk and i'm going to be doing this in the total level worlds to see how much gp i can make this is gonna be a very high risk method but if i catch somebody who's risking bank off guard in tank gear i have a decent chance at pking them and a decent chance at good bank loot so if you liked today's video then make sure you subscribe [Music] oh my god yes i killed this guy now i was trying to kill that guy before gotham sears ring full carols nice beautiful i got this guy this time that's gonna be a couple

look at this guy not risking much yeah well i'll be the judge of that would be pain for you to try get me plus i can call clan and call clinton i should probably do that then yeah it would be a pain for you to call your clan huh all right let's see if he was bluffing my guess is that he was and that he doesn't actually have a clan i'm gonna give them a chance though give them a chance for them to actually come here you guys coming either way two mill he's did he say he said not risking much yeah sure [Music] oh come on don't tell me no oh yeah you really just can't do anything at this spot without tbs that's why i freaking geared up in tb's for it there we go beautiful nice there we go finally this is like the hardest spot to pk you either splash your tbs or everybody just runs into dragons so that was good that was worth it oh same with him [Music] nice oh my god he scold dang it dude the other guy sculled that could have been bank if i actually uh got a tb on him oh 500k this
