what's up Greg I hope you're all having a great day welcome back to my channel this of course is another episode of I got a Curtin I got a Curtin it's in the background of my videos now just when you thought you knew what this room was gonna look like I went and got a [ __ ] curtain for the window so don't ever try to guess what I'm gonna do with this room okay because you're gonna be wrong so anyone who subscribed because I didn't have a curtain in the background of my videos yeah I guess you can unsubscribe the weird side of Amazon part 2 baby this time with more than just talking about two things I realized in the last video I called it like the weird side of Amazon like I had these like I had a ton of products I was gonna talk about but I really only talked about the Jeremy Renner store and a saddle and that was the entire weird side of Amazon don't worry we got more [ __ ] this time ok I'm not just gonna talk about two things but real quick speaking of the daddy saddle the daddle if you will pony up daddy still hasn't reached out to me and regards to my idea for the daddy drawn carriage so pony up daddy if you're watching this I just wanted to remind you again of my brilliant idea once again if you've forgotten it's a carriage for kids to sit in that's pulled by daddies I just wanted to remind you of that idea if you don't use it I'm gonna have to build it myself and I really don't want to do that so I'd really like for you to start producing the daddy John carriage again if not I will have to build it myself so this is a warning please make the Daddy drawn carriage or I'm gonna have to do it and again I really don't want to have to do that so in my quest to find more weird [ __ ] on Amazon to talk about actually tweeted hey if you have any weird things I'm Amazon that you know about feel free to send them to me which a lot of people did by the way if you don't follow me on Twitter you totally missed out and you look like an idiot right now so maybe follow me on Twitter and that won't happen next time but you guys really came in the clutch there you guys really send me a bunch of weird [ __ ] on Amazon and I feel like some of it is even weirder than the daddy saddle in different ways so without further ado let's complain it's time to complain now it's complaining time you guys ready to complain cuz I am while monkeys senior woman with asthma inhaler wall decal peel-and-stick graphic this is 48 inches by 41 inches that's like four feet wide this is a four foot tall image of an elderly woman using an inhaler you can stick it on your wall and look at it I cannot imagine why you'd want to do that only possible application I can think of for this product as if you are an elderly woman who uses an inhaler and you want to know what you look like but you can't afford a mirror but you can't afford this $60 wall decal of an old woman with an inhaler holy [ __ ] this is $60 that's a hefty chunk of change to spend on an old woman with an inhaler easy and fun to apply ok fun fun seems like a little bit of an over exaggeration I don't know how much joy anyone would get out of just putting a picture of an old woman up on their walls yes I wish I could do this every day of my life just just stick pictures of all the women on my wall compared with similar items okay there's this section on the page where you can compare the old woman with an inhaler decal to products that you might want to buy instead of that so something that would fill the same void in your heart that this old woman with an inhaler would fill one of the products is just the same image of an old woman with an inhaler one of them is an old woman leaning on her hands which is very sweet and then the third product is just a picture of a bologna sandwich with one bite taken out of it that you can put on the wall I guess that makes sense I feel pretty much the same way about an old woman with an inhaler as I do about a bologna sandwich with one bite taken out of it they occupy the same space in my brain that space in my brain being things I would want to hang pictures of on my wall I truthfully do not know why anyone would want this product and the reviews do not help at all with figuring that out this person gave it five stars and said I was looking for a large wall decal of a stock photo of a woman using an inhaler and this fit the bill perfectly thank you so it's not just that someone found this on Amazon and thought oh that would be funny to put on my wall they were actively looking for a picture of a woman with an inhaler to put on their wall and then luckily found this item I'm so confused okay this is actually kind of comforting this person writing the review is just as confused as I am my son needed this I don't know why but it shipped quick and he was thrilled poster very vibrant in color what a weird conversation that must have been hey mom can you buy me something on Amazon well sure what is it dude is that something you need for school no it's something I need for personal use oh is it okay is everything okay what is it yeah everything's fine it's just I just need a picture of an old woman using an inhaler that I can hang on my bedroom wall huh if you just give me your credit card I can type it in and do it myself you know what son I I could ask you why the [ __ ] you would want this picture hanging on your bedroom wall but I'm proud of you for taking this initiative so here take my credit card and buy whatever you want as long as it ships quickly and is vibrant in color thanks mom you're the best mom ever yes son I am the best mom ever what the hell they just have my merch on Amazon someone else is selling my merch on Amazon well it's actually my old merch I don't sell this hoodie anymore but still I didn't put that there I was about to say I think this is illegal but technically I don't think it is because this hoodie was literally just Greg typed out in a totally free to use font so it's not like it's a copyrightable logo I don't think you can just copyright a word written in a free-to-use fine otherwise I could just copy write the word tha in like Times New Roman and become probably the richest person ever so if someone who knows about the law could tell me if that's legal or not that would be great and also if it is legal please don't steal my idea it was my idea I had at first shannon kapoor danny gonzalez teenager hipster hoodie fitness pullover black 100% cotton material 100% cotton these hoodies are made of breathable cotton okay I get it if you like they're really cramming the whole cotton thing down my throat like I'd believe them at first but it's almost to the point where I feel like they're trying to cover up something like they're not really made out of cotton these hoodies are 100% cotton and they're made of cotton and we use cotton to make them and there was cotton in the room while they were being made and I have heard of cotton before know what cotton is and I used them and put him into this hoodie it's made of cotton all right and not my own hair I did not use my own hair to make these hoodies made of breathable cotton fashion trend these hoodies are perfect endings to any sport or casual look does that mean it's the perfect finishing touch to any sport outfit I don't think so oh yeah dude you'll look totally normal just hopping on the bball court in a giant ass black hoodie you'll look totally normal and awesome competing in a swimming and diving tournament in your big black Greg hoodie perfect for partying with friends running dating school etc it's only good for casual dating okay this is not good for any serious relationships this hoodie is great for getting to know each other you know go on a couple dates find out if they're the right person for you and then you got a [ __ ] ditch the hoodie fast if it starts to get serious at all get rid of the hoodie do not wear this hoodie around anyone that you're serious about do not wear this hoodie around anyone that you care about okay it's great for casual fun dating but once you get to know someone and you truly care about them this hoodie will ruin everything okay it does make me feel better that this hoodie has zero reviews so hopefully that means that no one has actually bought a Greg hoodie from this counterfeit Amazon store so thank you for that thank you Greg's for getting your hoodies straight from the source you know straight from the horse's mouth straight from the pony's mouth they even have the Greg family crest on a hoodie I don't even sell those on hoodies I only sell them on t-shirts shaking my head okay now this one is not my merch but it is a hoodie with a picture of a cat that has me as a face and also the hoodie has cat ears so you're a cat while you're wearing an red coffee Danny Gonzales Greg human face funny cat young lady hoodie sweatshirt I feel like they were trying to cram as many words into that description as possible like an essay where you have a set number of words you have to use but you ran out like three hours ago so you're just throwing random words in there and I feel like there's a point we're adding more words stops making something more descriptive and actually starts making it more confusing and vague like there's so many words in this description I would not be able to guess what this hoodie looks like based on this description I do appreciate that they called my face a human face though that was nice of them all right let's check out the description of this product Greg's face is very cute in the face of a white cat oh thank you okay I would be mad that they called me Greg instead of Danny which is my name but technically I am Greg so I'll have to let this one slide and they called my face cute so I can't stay mad soft and comfortable cotton makes your skin easier easier to do what to what gets easier about your skin this hoodie will make your skin way easier to peel off don't worry dude make your skin easier what does that mean less difficult oh I think god I finally found it shirt that's gonna make my skin easier my skin was way too difficult before dude my skin is on expert settings and I am but a noob I was having a really tough time figuring out my skin you know till I found this hoodie and it made it way easier at first I was like okay maybe this is like a translation error maybe they mean it'll make your skin smoother or something that would make sense but then I was like okay wait no a hoodie should not be making your skin smoother a good hoodie should not be changing your skin at all clothes should not alter the composition of your skin good hoodie I would say the best hoodies keep your skin how it is in the first place it should not alter your skin and that's why every single Gregg hoodie that we make in our store will keep your skin exactly how it is Archie McPhee handy squirrel looks like it's just a bunch of little finger puppets to turn your little grabbers into a squirrel set of five finger puppets includes four paws in one head that's a good ratio transforms your hand into a squirrel that seems like a bit of an overstatement I looking at the picture and I'm not convinced that that hand has been transformed into a squirrel and I mean it's not gonna just like oh [ __ ] and then your hand is a squirrel now this product just makes your hand look kind of like a squirrel that has no joint mobility transforms your hand into a squirrel with no knees that's what happens your hand will climb trees and forage for nuts yeah okay what else is new oh wait no damn the reviews for this thing are glowing 4.8 out of 5 stars dentists are my sister's house for no reason I like to mail her weird things with no context one time I put a bunch of stamps on a potato and mailed it to her this guy seems like a loose cannon I don't know about him he doesn't play by the rules there I say he might even be a mad lad I don't knows this also I just realized his name is fat daddy fly sock sole anyway she had a party last night and a handy squirrel was a huge hit people love this thing buy one and get stupid have fun I love the thought of his sister just going around the party with this little squirrel thing on her hand and everyone being like believe it I won and get stupid he does sell it very well though I would be lying if I said there wasn't part of me that's like I think I'm gonna buy this [ __ ] squirrel thing because of that review okay here's a pretty perplexing shirt that someone tweeted to me with absolutely no context it's a shirt that says i'm caleb doing caleb thing and at first i was like i don't understand is this a reference to something am i missing something here is this a quote from a movie or what why is this on a t-shirt but then i googled it and nope no one has ever said this before no one has ever said i'm caleb doing caleb things it's never been recorded in human history anyone saying that and yet here is a shirt with this saying on it as if anyone would ever buy this it's just a generic shirt for people in named Caleb who want everyone to know that their name is Caleb and they do the things they do because their name is Caleb wait what the [ __ ] I just searched I'm Caleb doing Caleb things and there's like a million different variations of this shirt why are there so many different versions of the shirt who is buying this shirt has anyone ever bought this shirt none of them have any reviews so I can't imagine anyone has I mean there's multiple t-shirts but with the saying designed in different ways like this one's got a lot of pizzazz to it like it's a Mardi Gras Caleb doing Caleb things I feel like whoever is making these shirts really overestimated the market for people named Caleb who do Caleb things and want everyone to know about it oh my god the company that makes this hoodie is called shocking styles Caleb clothes someone started an entire clothing company for Caleb based apparel and yet if you click on it it's just it's just item after item for people named Kayla there's even women's clothing with I'm Caleb doing Caleb things on it which not to say there can't be women with the name Caleb but it seems like a pretty ballsy business move to well one in the first place just assume anyone would want this on a men's shirt but then on a woman shirt seems like a whole other League oh [ __ ] I just searched I'm Danny doing Danny things and apparently that's a thing too you can get a t-shirt that says I'm Danny doing Danny things [ __ ] I'm gonna have to cop I mean I am Danny and I'm pretty sure I do Danny thing so I feel like this shirt really speaks to me looking for a cool adult toddler or boy present for him this sarcastic quote saying is a cute gift for any holiday sarcastic so would this be for someone who's not named Danny like get this for a dude named Dennis or something it's it'll be like sarcastic some dude named Travis walking around in this shirt oh yeah I'm Danny and I do Danny things idiot it's perfect for any holidays such as retirement graduation Christmas Memorial Day wedding we Father's Day birthday fourth of July or Independence Day yep it's perfect for fourth of July and Independence Day it would be perfect for either of those two separate holidays except no it wouldn't because who the [ __ ] gets people gifts for fourth of July that's so weird and even if you did get someone a gift for the 4th of July it should probably be related to like America or something right not just a shirt with their name on it a dude a happy fourth of July oh thanks dude you too I know you said no gifts but you're always talking about how much you love America so I really wanted to get you something for your big day I never said no gifts although it was kind of implied because it's fourth of July so I went out and I got you a little something from Amazon also did you say my big day you know the fourth of July isn't about me right there you go oh wow a shirt that says I'm Lance doing Lance things for your big day you just have to do with America pretty funny right my name is not Lance hey can I eat this firework oh this is like that video Curtis did about the weirdly specific t-shirts that are targeted to people on Facebook I guess on Amazon just every t-shirt exists just literally any combination of words exists on a t-shirt on Amazon okay I think this might be the weirdest one yet in fact I know it's the weirdest one yet so this person tweeted me there's a ton of blank white mugs that say got and then blank question for example this mug that says got cholera excuse you got cholera who has ever said that who has ever said got cholera in such a casual way cholera is an infectious disease that causes severe watery diarrhea which can lead to dehydration and even death if untreated so you got it it's just a little something I like to say while I'm sipping my morning cup of joe oh that's that's not your catchphrase don't worry they have plenty of other options like God or got y'all oh I got bro right dude I got so much breath this whole mug is full of brown that chug a big mug of bread before I go to work everyday I chug a mega brown please don't talk to me until I've had my bruh God where this one just sounds confused and I think it is confused huh I got where oh who's got water did we get it who lose that latte mugs are cool we swear dude people are gonna think you're so dope when you pull up with that guts kink mo scrolling through this company's Amazon store I'm convinced that their whole system is just automated they just automatically generate thousands of mugs with just random combinations of words every day they just take random words and phrases and slap them on a mug with the word got in front of it cuz none of these make any sense got shirt mask that's just three random words that they threw together that have no business being in a sentence together actually on their store they've got more than just mugs like this flask that says hashtags shirt for people who want to drink on the go but also want to show their appreciation not just for shirts but for the hashtag shirt they really appreciate the social media conversation around shirts and they're also drunk or a beer stein that says hashtag eight pour this little shot glass that says hashtag anklet I'm so confused about how this store even exists who runs this I have so many questions why does this exist but guys I honestly feel like my questions never will get answered because it's time to hear from our sponsor oh man I was working out and I got all tangled up in my headphone cable that happens to me all the time I want to get some wireless earbuds but good ones are so expensive exactly if only there was another way dang well maybe you shouldn't has this ever happen to you hey it's a common truly Greg I'll see you guys next time with a really interesting video where I get just a little bit closer into building the daddy drawn carriage right this video is over now you'll find something else to watch for just watch this video I know we had a lot of fun but you can't stay on this entry forever this video is over now so why are you still watching this a unity
