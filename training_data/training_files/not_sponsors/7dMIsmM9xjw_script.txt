Incredible. 495 points,

(Round 2 MC CHAEYOUNG) Oh, MC CHAENGCHAENG! (Go, baby CHAEYOUNG!) The game for this round is "Tray Karaoke." Do you guys know? (#1 Draw lots to pick a song) Each person memorizes
the verses for their seats and complete a song. Complete the song
within ten tries, and mission clear. To mics have voice modulators. We start with 100 points,
and lost ten points each time. (Reminded of their past) Can we look forward to
JEONGYEON's mistakes? You guys will love this.
(That's not all!) Each time a team makes mistakes,
the other team members... See this?
