transgender what does it mean to be transgender well simply enough it's identifying as a gender that you weren't assigned us at birth but it's more complicated for that for some people today I'd like to quickly examine the cause of some friction between different groups of trans people and perhaps trans people and society in general I think I'm pretty qualified to talk about this because I'm transgender at least I think so however because these topics can so often become angry and bitter I think it's best that maybe all of us snuggle up in bed and take a while to breathe and take it easy today I invite you to relax while I discuss show some social identity there are no heartaches there's no drama there's no anger just breathe [Music] looking at ongoing trans anger there seems to be a lot of conflict between those that conform to gendered expectations and those who don't and while typically some trans people are simply classed as gender non-conforming I think that there are more layers to this then one might realize it's not just about gender per se what does it even mean to be gender non-conforming what does gender even mean in the first place no one can properly answer these questions but we can observe society around us and what society looks like is that people exist in social roles assigned to them by the world around us and the circumstances of our lives I am a white person so in society I am treated as such and AM for example not a victim of racism but I am also a woman and a trans person and I get treated as those things as well and these layers all affect and define who I am and what social role I have in society but that is not all I am there are many aspects of my life that I choose to do that aren't inherent in any role assigned to me from outside I can choose my fashion style my hobbies I express myself these things form what I want to call myself constructed social expression and while many focus on gender expression I don't believe that this is all that is relevant there are some ideas of womanhood that feel fairly unique to trans woman hood as in cat girl striped thigh-highs in the game developer Communists there are six women that do this too obviously but there is no denying that this idea is sometimes prevalent in certain trans communities and while it's not inherently a negative there are cases of backlash against their self constructed social identity when people mistake it for the unchosen role that we are all stuck with and backlash can be angry well there's a difference between social role and social identity we can choose how we express ourselves but we can't really choose our social role we can choose to not be trans and so the social role that we have in society is trans obviously can depend a little bit's depend on your flavor of trans but in general we can however choose our own social identity sis people didn't choose these aspects of ourselves some will choose to adopt the social identity of a 1950s housewife while others will adopt something more akin to cat girl communists but these social identities have nothing to do with our gender similar frictions exist within sis communities as well and despite the nuances the people within them still have their gender respected however patriarchal expectations have always favored one type over another the ideal similarly I've seen trans women fights over what it means to be the ideal trans person but the thing is despite having these subject we are all still trans and it doesn't really matter how we express that and I'll try to explain why unfortunately no matter your expression the social role of trans people will remain more or less the same if a trans woman conforms or not she is still trans and subject to all of the societal expectations and consequences that that entails only the expression changes and most often that expression is almost entirely aesthetic have you ever heard someone complained about trans trenders with their rainbow hair I think this is an example of confusing gender identity a part of social role with social expression hair color in saying it like that it sounds obviously unreliable and yet there are many in the trans community who believe that it properly be trans you need to make an effort to pass to conform I've talked about Y in the past but I think it's worth reexamining a lot of people will misinterpret gender identity with social identity obviously some people are just asses but some people genuinely see no difference between the inherent unchosen parts of who we are with our expressions that are unconnected to that identity this is why some people are really angry at some trans people for not wanting to pass for having blue hair for not conforming to the expectations of that under and it's important to note that these expectations exist within the trans community as well and are sometimes reinforced by other trans people but it doesn't really make sense clothes have no inherent gender neither does hair or makeup hobbies or language for that matter but Society has ideals and it's often easy to map your chosen social identity on to that ideal and subcultures have their own ideals early in my transition I did the stripe thigh-highs the short skirt and the choker because in the circles where I was spending my time that was the trans woman ideal of passion but society as a whole doesn't always care because what most people see first is not the core identity it is the social expression but the thing is while we can choose a social identity for ourselves our social roles always come with assumptions that aren't always correct and so society also creates a social identity for us based on prejudice jokes and general culture it's like really annoying the same thing can happen with labels such as sis and straight as well while society doesn't labels these categories as much because they are part of the default LGBT spaces subcultures certainty can leading to jokes about sis people and straight culture hashtag the sis are at it again which is why some people who belong to the mainstream associate various trans identities with things like blue hair cat girls and similar things just like sis people can be associated with violent gender reveals the difference is obviously structural beyond the created social identity exists structural power that sis people have that trans people don't and while this is typically exemplified in terms of political power or economic power I want to keep talking about identity the thing about social identities these created ideas of what trans identity is is that they can also work as a type of branding people can publicly align themselves with a certain expression of transness for the purposes of profit famous trans people are placed in positions that are related to trans issues that they don't really know anything about trans people are taking US authorities on transness which can benefit all sorts of people for example on YouTube including me and other youtubers such as Blair White but as always we live in a society and branding becomes universal when some people claim that non-binary people aren't trans their reasoning hinges partly on public perception on optics on transness about the trans brand and this concept doesn't just apply to transplanting Blair herself have talked about how some conservative thinkers fake their opinions for the benefit of views online as in they are branding themselves for the purposes of profits or personal gain the same thing can happen to any grouping of people that exist at all there is the inherent component of the group and then there is the much wider brand and what the trans brand looks like has changed in 2012 the only knowledge I had about trans people was that they look like poorly shaven drag queens in quarterback bodies that was the brand that I knew about and some people could avoid being labeled as that because it benefited them but recently the idea of what trans is has changed and that means that people also align their own identities in different ways before the typical trans woman might not have been the ideal but now thanks to famous people and supermodels being trans there is an incentive for some already privileged people to further themselves as part of the translate under the trans brand albeit under their brand of transness but again the brand has changed and it will likely change again and while this can be beneficial in many ways it always focuses us on being tried and I've noticed that some people refer to my content as trans YouTube similarly subcultures exist everywhere from your local trans community to trans Twitter where the brand is uniquely created in each space so while branding can be beneficial to highlight specific issues about within a community it can also make normalization harder as a trans person it'll be hard for me to ever be seen as part of the mainstream I'm always going to be part of trans YouTube and I'm always going to be a token for people that really want a trans youtuber the cultural brand label of trans will always apply to me even though my trans identity is almost always irrelevant to everything that I do [Music] this is not necessarily a bad thing but it's strange to me that my friends are assists and straight will be able to do content and live their lives however they wish while me and every trans person will always be categorized as trans first and foremost and will always be subjects to the perceptions of what trans is a branded ass and that can be very frustrating when trans people do something that has nothing to do with me because I am still part of the same brand I will sometimes also get the blame or when people are critical of trans people in general and will judge all trans people based on the actions of a few or Strama but it all depends on branding which is why some trans people will be targeted and some will not and even with trans means then is some combination of our personal social role our chosen social identity and the identity that is thrust upon us by society at large this exists for all minority groupings but I mention it because it doesn't just come from outside it's not imposed on us alone it sometimes comes from within the group itself we created and reinforced it which helps society when they reinforce it upon us none of this is inherently good or bad it is simply how the world works but I think it's important to know about this when we have discussions about trans topics are we talking about chosen identity are we talking about inherent factors of our social role or are we talking about an identity that is rust upon us by society I think that these are some things that you should think about as you go on in your lively adventure in life but before that it's time to do some professional branding as well because this video is sponsored by audible if you wanna listen more about how gender and identity works in the society that we live in I can definitely mu L ter or Mia Mulder - 500 500 how's that for branding [Music] this video was a bit different than what I usually do I'm trying something a little bit different and I'm making some changes in preparation for 2020 I'm still making my normal longer content but I'm taking some time to try to expand what it is that I do and I would not be able to do what I do without the support of my patrons and I want to especially thank I need salminen Alexandre to it Amalia Amelia Fletcher ami 7 Anna equation
