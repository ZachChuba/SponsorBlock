boy animals are you kidding me these and geez of super satisfied hey guys and welcome to this week's pvp challenge in this episode we actually are doing an idea that we've already done but there's so many different outcomes that can possibly be done you guys have said many times that you want us to start repeating some ideas that have very different or it could have very different outcomes and this is gonna be one of those videos what it is is we're gonna have three locations and 30 minutes in each location there's going to be a wheel that we spin so we're going to spin the wheel get a location spend 30 minutes there and then we'll spin the wheel again get another 30 minutes in a new location but we're allowed to use all the gear and items we got from the previous location into the next location and then we do that a third time to another location for a total of three locations an hour and a half in total and the best part about this is you don't know your next location until after you finished your previous one so there's no way to really long-term plan you're going to just be thrown into it see what location you have again 30 minutes in each location our starting gear is going to be room pickaxe runex 250 coins and yeah very hard to plan we're gonna have a wheel so i'm gonna spin my first one and we're gonna see where we're gonna be starting in this pvp challenge you know looking at these locations they're like some of them are obviously much better than others right but some just work so well wow interesting interesting interesting first one okay um yeah let's do it let's do it let's do it let's do it so when i first got this location i didn't sound very excited but thinking about it i think it's gonna be an okay one i think it's gonna be okay one let's start the timer and let's start running the first thing i'm gonna do is chop a u tree oh well i'm gonna essentially just make a u short bow so pick up some flax spin the flax uh the magic trees in this area actually aren't in the designated area that we've set for this so it's not the best but we can get in all the regions the best bow is a magic short bow from the tree gnome strongholds but uh the best thing about this location is probably catherby with the sharks so oh that was really quick i just like one tick that tree i need a knife i need a knife i think i can buy that uh from this general store so let's go check that out but yeah essentially i'm gonna make a u short bow and fish a lot also there's an archery shop here so i might have to make some sort of money to buy some sort of arrows as well but i think the biggest takeaway i can get here is definitely the food um so let me trade here argen i might be saying that wrong buy a knife beautiful beautiful beautiful short bow hell yeah hello bees and geez three different locations 30 minutes in each and we find out each one after we find the next location so we're gonna go ahead and spin this wheel and see where we're off to first let's go ahead and where's it gonna be falador that's not a bad one that's not a bad one at all we could definitely make a decent amount of money there by mining okay 30 minutes on the clock and let's go ahead and start it and what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to go ahead and bank all of that stuff because i am only going to mine here to be honest with smith as well but uh mining is going to be the priority i think falador isn't that great for anything else other than making money so i'm going to treat this first half an hour as my way to make money so i can spend it in the rest of the other areas now i don't know what's completely quicker but i think this is better than motherlode mine because i do get the seven invisible boost whereas it mother like mine it's more like i just get a chance that some of the paid dirt will turn into adior so i think i'm gonna mine adior i'm gonna probably make plate bodies or at least make bars and then make plate bodies hopefully in one of the next areas because there's no anvil here in uh falador so uh yeah hopefully get ourselves a decent amount of all together smashing it so far which is great to see um and then get a load of bars and then next area hopefully be able to uh make the bars into something and get ourselves some cash together okay first four bars done in about five minutes well just just over five minutes which is really really nice to see i thought it'd be a little bit slower than that but we're looking very very good i think i've done the maths properly here and we should be able to make four bars per inventory otherwise i'm very [ __ ] at maths nope we're good beautiful smashed it um and yeah we're just going to rinse and repeat this to be honest guys throughout the next 24 minutes so nothing too interesting to report on here but i think it's gonna set me up really nicely for the rest of the challenge got a um random event here so i might as well go ahead and do it we might get something useful unlock 125 gp okay to give you an update i have 12 bars so it looks like we're gonna make 16 maybe 17 total uh not 100 sure how i'm going to go ahead and do this i don't know if i am going to sell them or if i will just make full adi from this um i'll have to work that out in a minute um when we find out the next new location and a few people might be thinking why am i not mind rune i don't have the level and neither does raag so we both know that roon is off limits okay we want to make a bow string and connect it to the u short bow again not the best weapon we can get but in this region it certainly is um and of course we got to do a play-by-play with every region we get we can't just expect to get a certain region because if you're just holding out for it and don't get it then that's your whole plan gone so again i need some coins we'd also buy some studded and stuff as well so i think i'm gonna do a little bit of wood cutting before i start fishing and just maybe get a few k because we actually can take your stuff transfer to new locations as well so i was hoping to have 15 minutes by the time i start fishing so it looks like we're on schedule we have 24 you longbows that we just made again this is just for cash to buy arrows armor and hope we have some left over for that next location but we want to come over here i'll probably yeah how much do we want to sell per worlds how much does it go down that's actually quite a lot we're going to sell three per world we'll try to hop as fast as we can um shouldn't take too long and hopefully we still have a solid 15 minutes to fish and cooker sharks all right coming up on our last inventory i just saw that last two i messed up somewhere in my math with selling three for world but let's come over here let's see we can get from the ranging shop hickton um okay definitely want to get a studded body even though of course that might be replaced but i gotta always go with what i have iron arrows are the best arrow here see that's my downfall should i oh maybe i should buy adamant dart tips because feathers feathers feathers feathers um oh this is tough this is tough this is tough you know what i'm gonna fish and then do some research to see how hard feathers are gonna be to get so let's just buy the harpoon and start fishing we can use a bank by the way i just haven't banked yet um so let's start harpooning some sharks which again this is what i really want to make sure i get away from this area a nice full inventory of sharks so the remaining two areas i can just focus on my gear and not have to worry at all about food right so three and a half minutes left we have 23 raw sharks banked i probably won't even worry about cooking them to be honest because there is there's i mean there's just so many ranges to cook on and i could do that in so many other locations and you could easily burn you know three four or five well five would be pushing it but my point is even with 99 cooking you could still burn sharks um and just since cooking is so easy i'd rather just you know get as many raw sharks as i can right that is gonna be my lot we're gonna end up with 18 bars i think as long as i can actually get to the furnace in this uh in this short amount of time one minute 13 we should be fine we should be good uh yeah i've got enough run as well um so i think we're going to end up with 18 4 8 12 16 yeah two plus yeah 18 i think bars which is really nice means i'll be able to make a full addy set um along with an adi scimitar and then have some addy bars left over as well to uh to use for money in the next area but obviously without knowing what my next area is going to be i have no idea what's going to be good and what's not going to be good i need to get an anvil if i don't get an anvil next zone then i'm really really really going to struggle if i don't get one on the third zone so uh let's go ahead and make this a little bit of time left over but there's not going to be anything that i can really do in that time i don't think um so that is going to be me done 30 seconds i might try and cut some oak logs am i going to be able to do that i mean i could sell them to a jenny store or something so it's worth trying to give it a go come on go go go go six seconds nah it's not gonna happen not gonna happen no way okay oh well there we go that is the first one done and let's get ourselves our second location he's anvil anvil anvil anvil please camelot have to be in sears village i think there's vlanville in sears village isn't there there was definitely one in varrock i was like oh no we got varrock what am i talking about we've got varrock um okay there's definitely one in varrock and it's super close to the uh to the bank you guys can't see it cause it's so but that ticker looked like it hit the catherby one but it's hit varrock uh which means i do definitely have an anvil so let's go ahead and do our varrock plan okay 30 minutes back on the clock let's start this and let's bank this now i need a hammer but i think there might be one for free up here i know i probably should just buy one but i think there's one free there's definitely a knife up here it's a knife i'll take the knife just in case we need it for any reason could be useful spade i don't think i'm gonna need and then we will just go ahead and buy ourselves a hammer from the general store here though first of all we will make the scimitar okay cool and then with the leftover bars i have gone ahead and made a sword a long sword and a short sword with the three bars we had left over i'll go ahead and sell them to the sword shot but first we're going to go ahead trade with the cilia and she is going to give us a few extra slots here one red cape one boots one leather gloves i think that's everything just to fill three more slots up and make us just that little bit more tanky and then if we trade with this bloke we can sell the addy long sword and we can sell the little sword there as well for 3.4 k nice when it comes to the feathers it looks like there's only two locations we can get feathers at falador and then relicate and yatizo which are actually the same uh spin on the wheel so there's two official locations on the wheel that can give feathers um and i don't know if that's the smartest move to just dump my money and buy the um the what's it called the addy arrows there's a lot of mining spots so even if i do get feathers possibly i could mine for addy arrow tips it's there's just you know there's no way of officially planning this without knowing what you're gonna get of course it's all about playing the odds but they weren't that much money 40 gp each does the price go up a lot maybe i should just buy like 80. all right let's take a look let's take a look let's take a look i'm thinking about just risking it that's only 16 each but addie ours is so much better screw it i think i'm gonna do it doesn't go up too much i might just buy 20 a world and buy like okay that's that's not too bad that's not too bad we're gonna buy i was gonna say 70 if it kind of seems like a lot um let's just buy oh people buying them out this is bad this is bad this is bad this is bad okay 70. actually that wasn't bad at all i i over gas that completely let me just pause the timer so you don't get that annoying buzzing noise but let's see how many sharks we have uh 70 adi arrow tips 7.6 k still and 33 sharks and that should be plenty our next location should you know 100 percent have a cooking spot if not i could probably get a tinder box and still cook it so it won't be that bad you know let's just fling out the uh the wheel right now and just give it a nice cheeky little spin and see what we get so oh let's see oh my gosh and that is feathers guys that's awesome okay um i know there's a lot of mining in spitting we could actually mine addie i think they can buy coal too relatively cheap yeah let's go check it out we got 30 minutes in yutizo and relica and let's see what we can conjure up okay so i've come down to the rat pits because i can buy stew down here just underneath varrock um and i think i'm just going to get stewed just in case i don't get a location where i'm not going to get any food or maybe even i just don't have enough like slots for food and i'm like five food short or something at the end this would just mean i could just you know swap in a little bit of stews if i need them or if i don't get any food at all we at least have students to go into the fight with so that is why we're down here just watching all of this gonna cost us like i know 600 to 800 gp to get it all i'll probably drop the hammer and the knife i can get more of those um if i want them so yeah that's the plan okay so in my varrock area i have the sewers here which go leads all the way to like under edgeville and as long as the entrance to wherever dungeon was was in your area you're able to access the whole thing so i'm gonna go ahead and kill chaos druids over somewhere here i can't remember exactly where they are they're in the uh they're in the wilderness bit i can't even work out where the [ __ ] this is so confusing there so we're gonna run on over there and get ourselves over to the chaos druids and that way i'll probably in 22 minutes be able to like make a prayer potion up or maybe something along those lines which would be really really useful just got the snake grass which is a one in one two eight that was going to be the issue with getting ourselves the prayer potion together radars aren't that rare and a vial of water is one in 12 so we should be fine here there we go there is a completed prayer potion after we get this kill let's go ahead put that in there i don't think we can actually make it while we're getting attacked but i do actually have another snake drops we've got two so i'm gonna try and get a second pot uh if i do get a second rainer i might go and kill the black demons just next to me um and try and get like a roommate home or a roon chain body that would be pretty awesome oh there we go beautiful okay so let's uh let's go and start doing that just gonna flick them um just so they don't do any damage to me because i don't want to use any of the um prayer pods not the prayer parts the stews we will make the prayer pots in a minute we've got all the ingredients to make two three doses and uh let me set up the quick prayers and we will see if this is going to be possible or not but i don't know okay it's not super slow first kill about to come in here hopefully we can get it here nope there we go come on bring chain body room chain body first kill coins so yeah i think i'm just gonna do this for the next nine minutes guys and we are officially off in relica now where are those chickens they're like over here somewhere yes perfect perfect oh a rooster i want to kill a rooster never killed a rooster before in runescape 7hp i don't know why i'm so fascinated by that but yeah let's get 70 feathers quick guys then we're going to focus on cooking the sharks and then we're going to mine and smith or could we even smith here yes we can oh it's quite a hike all the way from utiso but uh i guess we gotta work with what we got be horrible to do a bunch of mining and then going to a new location and there's no furnace um so i might have to do all my smithing and mining or i should say mining smithing and smelting all right here while i know i have everything all together so today i learned a pretty interesting fact guys as it turns out vikings hate trees there's no trees on relica i don't think there's any trees on yachts so there there's definitely trees on nate is not but unfortunately i can't go over to nate is not so looks like i have to wait to make my arrows in the next area which sucks but let's be honest this is probably the only location without a single damn tree to cut but we're gonna take a look at this shop real quick see what we're working with okay so we could actually buy some stuff here wow that's pretty cool that's pretty cool um we could buy coal relatively cheap as well so we got to keep that in mind if we can't mine coal fast enough we could definitely swing on over here and just buy some coal um where are there any trees over here no of course not i don't even know why i asked that question um cool so we're gonna go down in the mines over here of course dungeons are allowed as long as the entrance map is in the correct location so here we go lots of addi ore that we can mine and i'll just be doing this until i think of a nice plan in order to uh you know piece all this together but i'm thinking just addie full helm addie plate legs maybe even addie chain body the defense on it is pretty sick like how much does this even give for a plus attack plus eight range or plus zero range and much better defensive stats you know 20 adam and i ore's mind also banked everything else i wrote down everything i put in the bank so uh don't worry about the correct amounts and whatnot but we also have to buy a hundred and twenty coal that was the wrong shop there uh they just you know it's so cheap so i don't think it's gonna take too long if as as long as there's like i guess eight plus in every world i know when i first looked it was 10 so i don't even know what the stock is um it's ring ring if i'm even saying that right i know i'm not someone's going to roast me for getting that name wrong this isn't working too badly though and i think because of how little time we have left i don't think it will really matter but i don't think we'll get the kill anyway if you even absolutely human let's get out of here okay so i actually had to go and film another video and don't worry i put myself back to zero prayer i can't remember how my inventory was but i've got zero prayer and i will go into the next area with zero prayer don't worry um anyway let's go ahead and fire this up and let's spin and see where we are gonna go here oh your teaser and relica that's not a bad one that's not a bad one at all okay so i've had a little look and actually this is a lot lot better than i thought it was so there's actually fish shops here and there's the uh the merchant guy i think i can't remember exactly what he's called but a merchant who sells like harpoons and stuff and on the dock here we can fish shark slash lobsters so we can definitely get shark together but what i can also do is kill the trolls you guys know how much i love the trolls and i know how much you guys hate the trolls um so i can kill the trolls and they drop raw sharks as well so i think that's what i'm gonna do is like 20 minutes of killing these hopefully get a room kite shield um and if we don't have enough sharks then i'll just fish them and i'll just cook them that way so really really nice let me start the timer here and we will get this up i'll reset that here we go so we are going to start and i think i will just fire on straight over to yatizo and start killing the the trolls now we've got all these stews which i can now use because obviously we're going to be going for sharks i'll definitely have a full inventory of sharks so uh yeah we don't need to worry about these which means we have some food to uh to play with as well so yetizo let's do this now as i was saying earlier i still have that zero prayer unfortunately which i really should have thought about i could have refilled it um so that's a little bit annoying that i haven't done that but i do have a decent amount of money um and it means that i can go ahead and i can grab myself uh a little bit of food from the shop they sell like lobsters and stuff there so that would be quite nice uh the fact that we can just sort of buy food i think i've got like three plus k uh i'll have a check of that later in a minute but yeah they are gonna do me a bit of damage here which is annoying and we are lagging 120 coal bought and we're just at a run too that was actually extremely quick so there is an anvil and a furnace right next to each other over in relica i sure as i've gotta buy a hammer which really sucks uh 120 cold though which is super awesome still um over 1k cash let me just write that down real quick so i know how much money i have i'm actually a bit nervous about this hammer i'm going to assume sigmund might sell one i can't buy one right now but oh very reassuring very very reassuring um so yeah we're gonna make all 20 adi bars right now we have 10 minutes to do so i know there's an anvil actually right next to the furnace but i can't do four bars then so what i'm gonna do is just do five trips to this buy a hammer and then probably smith it right here because or rights uh right in right in there smith handful yeah perfect so let's just finish making our 20 we should have plenty of time so unfortunately with just a really long walking back and forth i wasn't actually able to make the last inventory of bars i also had to make sure i got the hammer um so what we're going to do is make a chain body still uncertain if i'm going to use that a full helm just going to make anything that i could potentially use in the final fight because i don't know the last area yet um i guess we can make a kite shield as well i know i have a bow and i could make an adamant plate body as my last gear piece and then anything i don't use i could always sell it that is the timer guys so let's pause it and spin our next location and see what we can do with our last 30 minutes tree gnome strongholds right off the bat i'm thinking yeah we can upgrade to a magic short bow um we could probably make a lot of money chopping magics as well there's a slayer shop from the slayer master so yeah let's go let's go spend 30 minutes there i'm excited let's do it that's actually a really really good one i think my spins were honestly pretty solid this time around all right guys here we are in the gnome stronghold now let's just start the timer because what i have to do is relatively straightforward um actually first what i'll do is just make these arrows i'll just use oak logs i don't even know how much i get per it should be pretty quick though 30 yeah that's totally fine all i need is 70 wow come on you stupid oaks man i'm just one tick in every tree i cut today you know then throw the arrow shafts on the arrow tips and there we go there is all of our addy arrows and it also frees up some inventory spaces so that's pretty cool so i'm going to try to conjure up some sort of game plan that i can do firstly of course i need to get the magic short bow there is flax here as well there's the spinning wheel so we could easily get that we have the addy arrows of course so i'm just gonna do damage to all of them and hope that the uh hope the soldiers really help me out and get me some kills here oh my god this without protection is really really bad oh there we go but we are going through this food so so quickly i'm actually having to lure one and sort of fight them on my own because i'm just getting destroyed so we're actually having to do this very differently to what i normally do and just sort of let the soldiers get on with it it just doesn't work unfortunately so we just have to sort of lure one down here and keep going that way but yeah as you can see we are really getting through the food quickly luckily they are dropping coins a lot so i will be able to buy back a lot of food which is nice and obviously they're also dropping you know materials like the steel med helm and the the myth warhammer which we can go and sell as well this shop here buys mithril warhammers for like 1.1 k so i'm just getting so much more money back which is awesome i'm going to check the other guys as well just to see what else i can sell so some mithril stuff i could sell here as well and here we could sell ores if we want to get them okay so we can get a decent amount of money together here actually got a couple more sharks um and this sort of stuff is pretty useless to be honest because i don't think i can get hold of fire runes i think we might have all the sharks we need let's have a look at the bank okay not quite 24 sharks so we need another four but it's going incredibly well like incredibly well 14 minutes left and we are absolutely smashing it oh my god guys we got a granite shield we got a granite shield let's go no [ __ ] way uh let's drop that they're pointless oh my god that's huge that is absolutely massive that [ __ ] on the addie kite that absolutely shits on it minus 36th range defense so if rod's planning on going range this granite shield is huge for it up here now this is also probably the best money making method to spin flax and cut magic long bows not short bows and just sell them to the general store but i gotta figure out if i really even need money and exactly what i'm gonna do i'm gonna head out over to the slayer shop right now just to see if there's anything i could use um or if there's anything i can just buy to fill in some spots like boots gloves stuff you know just things like that so let me trade real quick boots of stone we can afford that uh slayer gloves we can definitely afford um is that it that's looking like it's it over there so that's pretty cool filling up some spots so i'm gonna just start cutting some trees as i think of something that i can do that's a little bit more exciting and beneficial because i'm not sure if i need money i'm sure a magic short bow is better dps than like a leaf-bladed spear so i was chopping some trees to just get some money and realize there isn't even a general store anywhere or at least none that i know of there's not a general store in the gnome stronghold which is really really odd um but we still have to cook our sharks so we're gonna focus on that right now we don't even need a full inventory um empty to do this because it's gonna take two trips anyway so but yeah 15 minutes left and honestly guys i i really don't know what i'm gonna do truthfully other than cook this because simply i'm i'm already pretty maxed out i think i'm gonna rock the fight probably you know with the addy chain body um get six more range with the studded but just so much more defense it's ridiculous with the audi chain so it might be the move it might be the move i'm glad i made it this is exactly why i fished extra food i burnt one the first inventory and three this one with literally five less food as well the burn rate is still so high at 99 cooking it's nuts but we're fine on food guys i genuinely have nothing i can do i was looking at drop rates on like the tortoises and getting mahogany logs and maybe making a crossbow but there's no anvil here so i can't use those four bars in my bank regardless there's no general store for me to make money to maybe get like a leaf-bladed spear um so a bit of a predicament so i'm just walking around looking at the shops and technically these stone boots are a little better because they have the plus one stab defense but look at this fashion scape hell yeah i'm going into the fight like this this will be my final gear setup guys i know this episode was a little anti-climactic but that's part of how this episode was just being thrown in random areas this did do heaps for us though we did finish off the arrows in this location let me put those on um and we upgraded our bow so i'm still very happy i got it it's just that i did everything i can do i don't need to use the food shop because we of course just cooked our food um i'm ready for that fight i am so ready for that fight and i am not bringing this i'm just going straight tank so i'll see you guys there i've just got a [ __ ] room kite as well what the hell i've got the choice between the two now i think the granite granite is way better in pretty much all respects so it was the fish merchant that sold the harpoon i knew it was someone there um i don't think i'm gonna end up with a full image of food here i burnt a few which is really really annoying um so i don't think we're quite gonna have 28 sharks which is very annoying i think i'm gonna only get one or two more sharks in this time this is crazy oh i'm fuming with myself so i've been that off i'm not even gonna bother trying to get the uh the sharks are just gonna buy lobsters here uh let's drop one here and that is going to be our food for the final fight because there was no way absolutely no chance i was going to be getting at the sharks and then going and cooking them so there we go 55 seconds left i'll show you my setup because there's not much more i can do so here we go this is what we're ending up with let's just get rid of the link cam and the timer so you guys can see everything um yeah so ending up with a pretty strong range defense you know 180 i think if he goes range we shouldn't have too many issues if he goes magic then we've got a lot of [ __ ] issues but to be honest we were sort of pushed down roots i mean if he got yanil he probably went mage i didn't i sort of wanted to go mage i thought it was a good challenge to go mage because it was very hard to get like d hyde etc so mage was pretty pretty good in this challenge i think but uh i think i've done pretty well melee wise um obviously not the most crazy of weapon but the ali scimitar hopefully will hit consistently um and obviously being four tick is nice as well we're gonna have party on for the whole whole fight which would be nice um and then pretty much everything sharks and then a few lobsters at the bottom as well let's see if this is going to be enough to beat keno's how did you feel about your three locations that you got man the thing is mate and you know it was definitely the way for both of us but you you come up with a plan for your first location then you're like is the second location or third location actually gonna facilitate this plan or is it just gonna be totally ruined because i just don't i can't use what i do so that was racing through my mind but i would say i got pretty nice pretty nice areas i'd say um in terms of how they came one after the other so i'm quite happy with that but um it's hard to know what's big well your confidence level is quite high that's what i'm hearing right now um i wouldn't say it's high i'd say it's i'd say it's middle of the road mate you know i'm not i don't think i'm gonna lose i don't think i'm gonna win i think it could be pretty even right okay i mean i feel very similar to that as well um right looking through the cities there's definitely you know magic was possible range was possible melee seemed to get the short end of the stick on this challenge just based on all the locations and of course even if it was the best things would have to go in your favor but uh i think the best weapon was an adamant scimitar but there you go or maybe msb was possible no for me or youtube uh lately would have been probably uh rune warhammer maybe i don't think that's better than that i don't think it's rather naughty sim though but yeah but you know what hey chain body first plate body maybe it would be better against the player yeah there you go sure yeah that was good it was good mixing up the meta like that i like that i'm gonna let you pick the first item and we can just start throwing that gear on okay okay final fight uh i'm gonna go kate for mate of course he killed a [ __ ] island man no i didn't actually oh no he wasn't gonna have a lobby okay i mean what other keep [ __ ] is there um sicilia mate she she sold me while in varrock my man had vadak yes yes i had morock which wasn't that great to be honest there wasn't much to do with maroc ah i mean i i guess if you had a big cash stack and you had a plan um you could buy addie arrows you could buy death runes and ks runes i think i think there was some stuff i looked at the runes in there and i was like that is expensive as [ __ ] yeah yeah and it was just the [ __ ] version of your neil broons you know yeah that it like it for magic that would have been what you wanted to get and it would have been like the last item the last location that you would have gotten yeah definitely no but no cape man no cape okay all right cool i'm gonna go gloves i got these are those layer gloves by any chance yeah no they're not they're not oh they're just leather i um i didn't have the money to go for the slayer did you pick up leather gloves where we're standing right now behind edgeville bank no i didn't actually did you make them i can't remember where i got did you buy them from the shop with the kids am i expecting a priest gown next as well and like a blue skirt because if you do link i swear to god silly or only then uh right okay uh okay boots then kids i'm a bit faster uh no because i was feeling a bit colorful nice where'd you get them from from the gnome shop that's not good to hear he doesn't like it he doesn't like that at all he's sillier as well oh dude what she sought out like just 40 percent of my gear set up yeah dude i'm actually scared you're going magic and you will bring out a priest gown and a blue skirt i will actually yell if that happens like link did you go anywhere else in this pvp challenge oh as soon as i saw varrock i was like i only want one location that's fine i ended it after you're like 30 minutes done okay oh man okay um let's go legs okay so this is where this is where things get get given away well i guess they don't i guess they don't actually uh here we go what if i matched you okay thanks all right no all right all right he sees he's very confident here you know he doesn't see you dumbs i'm beating you sillier mate sorted me out with the uh with the cape didn't she so well i'm gonna go i'm gonna go shield kids i don't have a shield okay ah it's gonna be a nice thing i think that gives away what he's going for he's gone gnome he doesn't have a shield i mean i could have a leafleted spear that is two-handed right who's who's getting a leaf blaze fear over a [ __ ] msb kid all right all right i hope i hope you have got msp because i got this bad boy oh my god you killed trump i asked you your confidence level link you [ __ ] lied to me that's a 10 out of 10 confidence move right there if you went magic it was horrible so i that that's the thing i also got a rune kite i got both i got both kins what's concerning about that is it's actually much stronger against range for its level oh by like 20 something like it's ridiculous it's 65 range defense and the rest are like 40s okay spill the beans what was the thought process when killing trolls man like what did you use how did you do it because i thought about it angelica oh did you yeah i'll i'll i'll tell you when i've showed you everything because i'll give away things otherwise um the chance of going because i actually looked at you neil before and i was like if if i get it what can i do and the cost to get blood runes and death runes like one blood rune is 400 gp is it actually that much money yeah so 10 blood runes which is like three casts cost you 4k without the death road so i was like magic is not viable unless you go varrock so i was like he's gonna go either melee or rage and when i saw this granite play this the shield come up i was like lovely well you talk about magic not being viable i mean that's the kind of drop you need to get to sell or out to be yeah runes right but i personally if i got that i would also stick with the shield and say [ __ ] it because that thing's entertaining was also my last location well but that was my middle location but right okay so so you had like your food sorted and everything then because then other sharks on yatizo so my god i was sorted i actually had 28 stews from rat catchers in varrock and turned up and just went [ __ ] it i'll attack trolls and hope they drop raw sharks right wow power my guy's playing the rng game and it paid they dropped me they dropped me some i'll tell you that mate but uh anyway okay um i'm gonna go i'm gonna go plate body slots okay yep i mean i figured that much yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay you probably figured that much as well yeah i mean you know it's there yeah you know the chain body definitely gave it away that i have it yeah for sure i'm guessing both have this yup yup yup and uh i'm rocking the addie you're a [ __ ] tank dude yeah a beast absolute bass and i'm over the moon about 180 range defense wait what was it a hundred and eighty right that's actually wrong dude i have 60 range attack right now oh my god oh man do you have anything else wait i should show you my arrows because you're on the msb top oh okay yeah yeah yeah um adam and arrows which i am very happy with yeah yeah multiple locations to get because i bought the arrow tips from catherby which is my first location and then i cut a tree well there's trees everywhere so it doesn't really matter actually no there's no trees and relica and yates or at least i didn't find it i was so angry but isn't that um there's also they they there's chickens in relica but there's also feathers from the shop in yatizo uh imitry i'm expecting full of sharks you'd be wrong mate oh really yeah you would be wrong i didn't have enough time i didn't have enough time unfortunately so i actually made this oh i'm quite proud of um chaos druids in the bottom of the varrock silvers which is quite nice wow um yeah so very happy with that and then i mean you know i've got sharks but i've only got that many and i'm guessing the rest might be oh oh is that from yutizo as well the shop yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah where'd you get your sharks from cavity first thing i did um because like so i i made a u-short bow first because i was like this might be my best in slot i bought the arrows i also bought a studded body which got replaced but um i had 15 minutes and i made sure i had 15 minutes for sharks and i fished like 33 to save time for burn or not save time but to compensate for any burning i don't like that prayer pot though i don't like the prayer pot because we know what that means he just camps [ __ ] pity the entire time and guys before we get into this fight first i want to talk about the video that went live the exact same moment this one did over on link's channel link and i put ourselves in a pvp world and of course we can attack each other anywhere throughout karamjo we were area restricted in karamja actually one of our first pvp challenges ever but let's just say there's a lot of drama that unfolds as we're running through those worlds a lot of hecticness and [ __ ] up each other's plans and deaths have a huge consequence if you were to die in that episode so go check it out it's a whole different dynamic than a lot of the other ones that we've done link bit nervous with that gear set up prayer pot but i i'm glad i got the shark advantage on you it's about yeah right nice but i don't know how well this is gonna hit i think we'll know pretty quick on how i'm gonna hold up against it if you're hitting well i'm in trouble but 180 range defense though bro that i would be very fuming if you are hitting through that yeah but we'll see mate are you ready i got speed are you ready i am right oh [ __ ] surely he's not hitting surely dude [ __ ] off [ __ ] off game well okay oh he's getting so nervous come on why about it hey i don't know this is gonna be close i can [ __ ] tell it is i gotta eat to pick up my arrows [ __ ] dude i'm actually stressed you have that prayer part though coming in clutch yeah and again you're hitting a lot more than i thought you would a lot more come on i hope 70 hours is enough it should be but i like i i got to spend time picking up my arrows and [ __ ] though wow i am hitting oh oh i was gonna spec but you got me a little too low for comfort there i forgot i even had specs to be completely honest with you i did as well i had [ __ ] it all right team rock take it easy on me please come on go go go yes that's what you want to see okay come on you've got to tank this you've got zeros for the speck dude never speck in a pvp challenge though i swear to god your dragon battle expect [ __ ] you up dds specs never hit dragon mace spec is the shittiest [ __ ] thing in the world for these challenges come on this is ridiculous this is actually i can't believe this are [ __ ] hit [ __ ] come on oh [ __ ] oh my god it's a train wreck this thing man what yes [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] definitely want to eat up there yeah definitely want to eat up there hey you're hitting zeros too so i don't feel as bad see it's moments like this where one of us starts to take over because we hit a lot oh like that i'm scared i gotta make sure i don't lose these arrows [ __ ] i'm burning through it if i could outlast your arrows i'll take it i think that would be rough i think i think that that the disadvantage there is that it's been a lot of time picking them up when i get low mm-hmm come on now you should probably come on [ __ ] it i i do i love safing in these challenges yeah you're a big safer i really am completely the opposite way i know things i'm a dumbass and forget to eat sometimes so you know sometimes it's best to just like not risk it man sometimes you just don't need the biscuit man i'm fuming about the biscuit right now mate why am i not hitting oh [ __ ] dude you're not hitting let's pick that up oh [ __ ] god i i i can't believe it i can't believe it not again please oh man oh man hey dude how are you not i like iron i know it's an addie sim but man's in nothing [ __ ] sake [ __ ] off game a [ __ ] done right oh my god oh [ __ ] off oh my gosh oh [ __ ] no dude i am going through the [ __ ] ammo quick come on oh man yes yeah the thing is when like you have like five arrows they last for [ __ ] ages it's constant picking up though isn't it yeah true true come on we need a little comeback wow i thought about making only 52 because i was i was tight on come cash would that been enough or not um [Music] it would have but i would have been happy to pick up super commonly now but then again the fight's not over but it probably would have been enough just more stressful come on hit higher why am i just hitting twos and [ __ ] yes that's better hopefully not risking that this is a long fight yeah dude it's a quite it's a pretty quiet one too yeah that means we're concentrating i always have the prayers like so [ __ ] common and you're just chilling with your [ __ ] prayer potion that's human come on yeah big hit big hit big hit [ __ ] off man it's hitting so much more than i am dude i have 60 ranged attack 180 range defense yeah i broken broken what i i did i mean i think i hit back to back maybe the addie sim is just that bad come on hit hit hit oh is he out i can't believe this i can't i can't believe it oh no oh no how much food i had 10 food left with 43 hp link to be completely honest with you man with my 60 range attack and your 180 range defense and prayer pot i was i was very scared going into that fight i've got no words mate i've got no words genuinely i don't even know how to commentate on that i really don't i really don't i had parties on the whole fight the whole fight kittens wow yeah sorry [ __ ] said we're gonna end the video there guys but we have a banger of an episode over on link's channel where we're in karamja and it's open world pvp in a pvp world we can attack each other throughout the entire hour and a half progression go check it out you definitely don't want to miss it it's very different from all the other pvps and we don't say bye so we'll see you you guys are absolute legends and thank you for your continued support
