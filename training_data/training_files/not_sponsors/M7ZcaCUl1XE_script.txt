make your next move with Squarespace when I was a young child I was taught not to complain yeah I'm bored oh you're bored huh yeah I'm bored do you know how good you have it white kids are starving in other countries and you're bored because you don't have any more gameboy games oh boy here we go again don't you sass me stop complaining oh so now you're complaining about my complaining nice to see where I got it from hey and while it was a tough lesson at the time I think my parents were right what do I have to complain about I'm part of the global 1% I enjoy a standard of living that is better than any other point in history and things just keep getting better so yeah sometimes things don't go my way but all in all I'm very grateful unfortunately when I turn on the news it does not appear that others share in my same enthusiasm we March hopes are closer to apocalypse I have 24 hours to build and advertisers that demand ratings what that means for your weekend or or when I get on the internet and see all of the anger all the arguing everyone is so mad you don't care about jobs oh yeah well you don't care about health care oh yeah well you guys don't care about this other issue that I just learned about yesterday there are now a huge advocate for using a device that wasn't even fathomable thirty years ago to complain about how bad things are huh lovely I have to ask have adults all become complainers look I know there are so bad things going on in the world okay I'm not an idiot I'm not discounting anyone's grievances even though I probably could I will grant your grievances which ironically enough is the name of my hardcore band I know there are in Justices I know there are awful things that happen but you know what overall things are going great life has never been better and it continues to get better and if you don't recognize that then you're dumb I mean just think about all the modern conveniences we take for granted every single day Oh instead of bucks and our buns getting all this would would it be nice if we could just press a button in our houses would be warm boy that's some witchcraft you're talking about right there well we don't need to make America great again we need to make it great full again there are too many complainers and I think I know why see as our quality of life continues to improve over time because of new technologies and innovations people have more and more time to just sit around doing nothing because you know they don't have to you don't worry that much about you know trying to actually stay alive but you see the problem here is most people have this horrible void in their life that they used to not have to deal with because they were just trying to survive but now that they have all this time to just sit around they can't not think about it and it makes them mad my life didn't turn out the way I wish it had that must be someone else's fault they hate their brains okay but perhaps that's not very generous it could be that the fact that we don't have to claw and scrape as much to stay alive anymore makes the struggle for purpose in life a little more difficult and maybe we're just in a transitional time right now but even if that's all true I can't help but feel like we're all just so ungrateful like we've been given this amazing gift of being born now instead of at a time when no one had invented glasses yet you know for the last year or so my vision has been awfully fuzzy you mean like you can't see it just keeps getting worse and worse oh I guess your life is just over I reckon so all right turn around I'll make it as quick and painless hurt we've been given this amazing gift of being alive at a time when when you can sit back and enjoy a youtube video like you have the time to do that for most of recorded history the idea sitting around doing nothing was impossible you couldn't do that you would die I just feel like we should all constantly be applauding together United as one thank you God thank you great job thank you that the internet exists and we live in that time yes thank you very much you're making me blush but instead we're divided and we complain about what we don't have we complain about others we make up things to be upset about because we're bored and look again I get it okay there's bad stuff that happens I understand but at the end of the day you are owed nothing in this life and yet you have so much just by virtue of being alive so maybe life isn't perfect but it could be worse a lot worse I mean seriously can you believe people used to not have cars that's a deal-breaker for me oh boy imagine if we didn't have to walk clean to the next town to get supplies well what if there was a magic box on wheels that we just step in and it would take us to the next town then we would finally have time to argue about politics oh my goodness I would give anything for just one day off to argue politics with you buddy that would be amazing stay tuned for a scene from our next to squarespace.com slash cow at squarespace.com slash cow next week on messy one day the news just gets worse and worse tonight we found two of the
