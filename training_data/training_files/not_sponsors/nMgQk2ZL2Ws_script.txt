the throne had a wide range of complex motivations but thanks to centuries of storytelling they were each be to slow down to a digestible essence of human nature some were cruel and tyrannical some brave and arrogant and others cold and calculating in our story today we will be covering the tale of Liu Bei whom legends would remember as the upright and benevolent hero of the people Liu Bei was born in 161 in the jaw commandery of northeastern China his family had once been of some repute and could supposedly trace their lineage back to Emperor Jing the sixth ruler of the Western Han Dynasty however some three centuries later the family had fallen on hard times having lost their royal titles and wealth Lopes father was a provincial official but died early on leaving his wife and young son in a state of poverty to make ends meet they wove straw sandals and mats to sell in their small village this humble upbringing would prove quite formative for the future leader who would be hailed as a hero of the common people thanks to his modesty empathy and benevolence luckily Liu Bei was rescued from a life of total destitution and obscurity by an uncle who was able to provide financial support this boon along with some lingering familial connections allow the youth to launch his career at the age of 15 Liu Bei left his home behind to take up studies under prominent court official sued this apprenticeship he learned much about politics and was able to forge lasting connections that would help him throughout his life in 184 new base relatively peaceful life was abandoned by the outbreak of the Yellow Turban rebellion this uprising against the Han Empire saw many peasant armies sweep across the land with instability and violence following in their wake Liu Bei was just in his 20s at a time but felt a deep calling to protect his home and its people according to legend the obey would take up arms with two other men Guan Yu and Zhang Fei the three would become inseparable and swore an oath to join in brotherhood to protect the rim vowing to die on the same day Liu Bei and his oath brothers than leather militia to join local efforts against a rebellion here small war bands clashed in minor skirmishes or coalesced into larger armies to fight more dramatic battles in these efforts the base band would prove quite effective the upstart warlord was rewarded for his service with a low-level government post overseeing a small town but after a combative interaction with an imperial inspector he was forced to abandon the position shortly thereafter though he obey once again LED militia forces into battle against new rebel threats and these actions earned him another government post while the rebellion raged on things back in the Han capital had quickly deteriorated the Emperor died leaving his young heirs and a throne vulnerable to the influences of nefarious forces ultimately the power vacuum was filled by dong Zhuo and ambitious warlord from the northwestern provinces who swept in with his army in response warlords from across the Empire rose up to oppose this usurper the young Liu Bei and his oath brothers set off to join the coalition according to legend the three would make quite the name for themselves battling in heroic duels before the armies historically however their contributions were of relatively little note at this time when the coalition against dong zhuo failed to end a tyrants reign it fizzled out due to infighting the ones unified lands of the Han now fractured as the many warlords fought to claim their piece of the crumbling Empire for the next decade Leo Bay would play the role of a minor warlord sometimes managing to gain control of as much as a province but never being able to hold on to power for long as he found himself constantly bullied about by larger powers these wandering years would begin with his service under an old friend to the north the general gongsun zan whom he served over the course of several campaigns next Liu Bei came to the defense of Tao Chen when the Warlord's house Hall made a move on the stream province in 193 when the invasion faltered a dying cow Chen would gift the province to me obey trusting in his ability to protect the people meanwhile South Hall had managed to rebuff an invasion by Li Bou into his own province of yin the defeated warlord fled into the arms of the obey however Li boo would ultimately betray his host and usurp control of the province to make matters worse Liu Bei would be dealt a defeat by Hugh and Chou these dual blows forced Liu Bei to seek shelter with total operating under this new master the obey would assist in the campaigns against his former opponents the generals boo boo and you and Xiao Bai the Year 199 both would be dead this puts also in extremely powerful position many including the Emperor feared his ambition and a conspiracy was formed to assassinate all they would join the conspirators however in 200 the plot would be discovered most of the other conspirators who were executed while the Obey was once again forced to flee nube would make his way south to Jing province where he would be given command of an outpost by his relative Lu Bo the region had largely avoided the revolts and battles of the northeast and was a haven for many war refugees thanks to his prosperity in these more peaceful lands the 42 year old nube was feel lost falling into a deep melancholy he admitted quote the days and months passed like a stream an old age will come but I have achieved nothing however fortunes soon changed over the next decade the obey would experience a late-blooming career that would catapult him to greatness this would all begin in 207 when he was introduced to the talented juga Liang who became his chief military strategist and proposed an ambitious plan the long-term strategy would be to secure a base in the south by taking Jing and Yi provinces then forming a coalition with the forces to the east in order to oppose the powerful total to the north yet as this planning took place Liu Bei will once again find himself forced to react to the moves of the others in 208 South Hall had consolidated his northern possessions and was now launching a campaign into the south just at this moment Leo Bo died unexpectedly of illness and his son yielded the Jing province to the invader without bloodshed the Obey fled with a great refugee caravan of civilians and soldiers seeking safety in the territories of Wu controlled by the swin family house house forces were hot on their tail according to the romance of the three kingdoms the obey was urged by his advisors to abandon the slow moving group and flea alone but he refused saying quote to accomplish a grand enterprise you must make the people your foundation right now the people have pledged themselves to me so how can I bear to abandon them ultimately however southouse men did catch up facing certain capture the obey was forced to make an escape thanks to his rear guard and oath brothers he would evade total and make it to the lands of sunshine here he took residence in a garrison at fan Cheung where he was joined by a growing number of levees Lee obeyed and sent his advisor juga Liang to form an alliance with son Trent together they would take on South all the southern coalition famously engaged the northern army at the Battle of Red Cliff though badly outnumbered the forces of Liu Bei and Sun Chen proved victorious following a surprise attack by fire boats across the river and a devastatingly effective follow-up strike that sent the forces of total into a bloody retreat in the aftermath southern armies would conduct operations against the remaining northern troops along the Yangtze River in this way Liu Bei managed to gain control of four commentaries ruling Changsha Ling Ling and Quayle young and even retook the strategic Jing province by now Liu Bei had become quite powerful Swinton continued to see him as a necessary ally against house halt and even married his sister to Liu Bei shortly after establishing himself in Jing province the Obey returned to the strategy originally proposed by Jugal young and his eyes turned to the neighboring lands when the ruler of the Yi province invited the Obey to station troops in his territory to deter a possible invasion by South all Liu Bei simply took the opportunity to invade the territory himself fighting went on for several years but by 2:14 the obey was in control of Yi province next he launched an attack into the strategic regions of Han Jung finally taking it from South Hall into 19 this would mark the peak of his territorial control now just over a decade after despairing of his ignominious fate Liu Bei declared himself the king of Han Jung selling himself up as an equal rival to toss out who by this point had been named the king of Wei Swinton regarded these aggressive actions with growing concern his relationship with Liu Bei was already fraying due to territorial disputes and long simmering tensions these affairs will reach a breaking point when Tao Tao opportunistically entered into a secret alliance with son Chen urging him to deal with blow to Liu Bei in exchange for conferring legitimacy to swim trance rule an attack was launched on jing province in 2:19 at the time when g1 of Li Bais oath sworn brothers had been left in control of the territory and was waging war on South house forces at fan Chun sunshine capitalized on this by launching a rapid surprise assault - when use rear swing gent disso by stealthily taking out guard posts and watch positions before swooping in suddenly to capture the civilian population and specifically the families of Gwen you soldiers this brilliant move cut off when use retreat and shattered a fighting spirit of his army which began to desert or surrender in mass when you attempted to flee but was captured in an ambush and executed thus Liu Bei lost both his closest friend and Jing province he was furious and made ready for a war of vengeance against Sun Tran meanwhile in 220 total died and was succeeded by his son tau P this new ruler of the north was encouraged by the brewing war between his two greatest southern rivals and now formally declared an end to the Han Dynasty proclaiming himself the Emperor of way in response Liu Bei declared himself the Emperor of Shu and a true continuation of the Han tau P launched several attacks against Shu lands as Liu Bei remained focused on his war with Sun Tran in 222 Liu Bei personally led his armies to retake Jing province and avenge Guan Yu the campaign found initial success in pushing back the enemy but would meet disaster in the summer of - 23 when Lu Bey's army was routed by a surprise fire attack on their camp the defeat crippled shoes military strength and Liu Bei was forced to retreat - by D Chung a broken man he fell into rapid decline and died shortly thereafter on his deathbed Liu Bei appointed his longtime advisor juga Liang as regent to look over his young heir Lucian the new emperor had his father brought back to Chengdu and entombed in the years that follow strength with once again returned to Shu peace was declared with sunshine and their former alliance restored as a counterbalance to the Northern Wei thus the partition of the three kingdoms was in place history would treat Liu Bei kindly this was especially true in the oral traditions of the common folk who lionized him as a champion of their calls such framing of his character would be immortalized in the famous novel the romance of the three kingdoms written about a thousand years later in it Liu Bei was glorified as the hero of the book an embodiment of Confucian virtues and a sage compassionate Lord who love the people and value the advice of wise men in short he came to represent the good of righteous politics in opposition to the Machiavellian scheming of the villain Southall we should however be careful with such black-and-white characterizations after all while Leo Bey's career was certainly worthy of admiration at the end of the day it was achieved through much of the same ugly process employed by his rival warlords if you would like to learn more a huge thanks is Oh to our supporters on patreon and the many talented researchers writers and artists who made this video possible please consider
