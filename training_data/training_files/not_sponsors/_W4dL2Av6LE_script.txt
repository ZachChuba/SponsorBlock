This morning to say what The sky greets me
And the world is beautiful Whatever you say
It’ll become my happiness I want to fall into your heart
Wide like the ocean A-ing My day ends listening to her story
My head if full of thoughts My memories are bare mountain Once twice, three and four times
I’ve said it are you suddenly mad at me you know what I'm saying Because of you stories in my head
Are all mixed up What’s the problem

Has something happened No I’m a little down since
I didn’t get to see him yesterday The sky greets me
And the world is beautiful Whatever you say
It’ll become my happiness I want to fall into your heart
Wide like the ocean A-ing We are going to go off
to somewhere there is no one The white ocean is calling us The sky greets me
And the world is beautiful Whatever you say
It’ll become my happiness I want to fall into your heart
Wide like the ocean A-ing I want to believe that you
Looking at me by my side Will last forever I think everyone is envying us
I think they are jealous of our love A-ing I just want to fall in Hold me in your arms
