hi everyone today I am going to do another art style challenge I like to do this because I feel like I learn a lot from looking at and stealing I mean making other art styles and you guys have requested that I do more art style challenges and so once again here we are get started with the art style challenge in this video I've chosen eight other artists on YouTube who style and I'm going to try to recreate with my own character the first drawing here is in my own style obviously the character is Ellen the same card I recently drew as part of a draw the second challenge she is one of my oldest Oh sees that I still draw and her key features were always her white hair her yellow eyes and the pointy ears I want to immediately admit that this austell challenge was so much more challenging than the previous one I did where I redrew my character Diablos are into iconic art styles some of the assets that I chose for this video are most known for their traditional art and even though they also do digital art they're most recognizable features shines through in their traditional pieces since I'm primarily a digital artist I wanted to do this digitally so what I've tried to do to the best of my abilities is to create their digital art style but also taking into account what makes their traditional style so unique boy another thing that made this challenge so much harder was the fact that these artists are not following a strict design sheet as you would expect from iconic art styles shown in TV shows and the like these artists experiment and develop their style over time so there are always some slight inconsistencies in their work where I have just done my best to try and guess which features to include and which not to and as an extra little piece of info I want to add that I've chosen to still I mean to borrow these artists our Styles out of respect for their work the way I'm going to talk about their Styles in the remainder of this video is with the intentions to break it down into pieces that I can interpret and put into my own drawing I'm not at any point stating something about their Styles meant in a critical way or with a critical perspective all I do is to try to make it easier for me to recreate their features and give you an insight into my fault process of doing so and if you're interested in seeing the real-time drawing of my style of lol it will be available as part of the in November rewards on my patreon you just gotta sign up before November 1st to get the rewards that this video will be included in anyway I am getting finished with my own style error so it's time to move on to the first youtuber who is 11 to town lever the town has a really unique and cutesy style I don't think I have seen anything that like anywhere else and I thought it was so recognizable that I simply had to include it in this challenge I am NOT going to spend time considering how my character Ellen would fit into these artists universes because all I'm trying to do is try to insert her into their visual style it makes more sense this way compared to the last channels I did because not all of these artists has an overall story like for instance laminate town has a comic with Tara Tess and a story some of the key features I noticed from lavender town style was the black outline the big eyes and the often odd pupils I mean these are just some of the aspects I mean obviously it has a lot more I think she uses some really cute color schemes and have some relatively simple shading she often shaped some of her highlights as little hearts on her character from her comic unfamiliar and I also decided to include little parts of line shading that she does on her character's hair as well I think Ellen looks pretty cute in love with the town style the next use of artist is Jacqueline to Leon this is definitely an artist who is really known for their traditional pieces and really no wonder because her techniques are amazing her traditional features almost transfers directly to her digital pieces with the exception being the lineup I think some of the key features and notice were the often very visible cheekbones the head shape which is very much shaped like an egg and the other parts of the eyes and of course the tattoos that occur too often has I went for a shading from some of her digital pieces that really adopts her traditional style well the reference drawing with the pink hair that you see once in awhile is actually undone unlike her other digital pieces but it really show how gorgeous her digital hair is drawn on Jacqueline's digital pieces I feel like I see a lot of black line art and I did see color line not as well but in general I think she used more clean like right so I decided to stick with that look and not color the lines of elements hair the shading I think was really tricky because it's very different from my own style but I feel like I got a really nice insight into Jacqueline's process drawing this one next up is Rea I actually discovered this artist quite recently but I really adore the style it looks pretty similar but they are especially some inking shading techniques hair that really requires some attention to recreate Rhys coloring also looks simple but put together with the way that the line art and the black shading frames the character it gives a very traditional look to reach digital pieces re also does traditional pieces but manages to streamline the traditional entity to the style so well that there's practically no difference which i think is really hard to pull off besides the iconic faces I think reshape language is one of the key features to the style so I decided to go for the rectangular soft head shape for Ellen which reuses a lot and all use simple shapes for the rest of the design the colors are kept with flats leaving the shading to the linework itself and with a little rough spray of red on her cheeks I am done with Reece style next artist is Danica sills I actually think that tanika's channel is one of the first a channels that I started following it's the only time ago she has a very unique style which seems to be very inspired by themes like dark fantasy vampires zombies and all of this mixed with bright colors together with clean black areas I found that her style was really hard to recreate probably the hardest because Danica is also an evolving artist whose style evolved over time she is mostly known for her traditional watercolor art and she also somehow manages to transfer the general look of her traditional pieces onto her digital pieces which isn't it lucky for me right now however I still had a really hard time I must admit Danica has a way of drawing her female characters pretty masculine but you're still never really in doubt about their gender I felt like my LAN looked a bit too masculine at times but hopefully when you see the final result you can easily see that she's indeed a female character Danika relies a lot on her line work and it always looks incredibly detailed and refined she adds a lot of details using the line art especially to the hair it took me so long to draw out the hair and I still think Danny can he'll look way better another key feature of her art is her washes in our watercolor pieces she does a lot of color washes she is transfer that into her digital pieces by using gradients and I'm doing the same for Ellen's hair I think maybe my character alone should have had blue purple or even pink skin - even better reflect Danica style because these are skin colors that she very often works with but I also want to stay true to my character so I hope you still like this entry despite of this little deviation the next youtuber Zastava going to recreate is drove with Jessa this might be the one interim I am most conflicted about either I did good and actually created something that reflects his style or I completely missed that's what I feel like I can't really tell yes it doesn't really draw a lot of female characters but I did manage to find some references from someone his older videos some things I realized about Jessa style is that it / tastes very Adam it portrays very anatomical I can't say the word it portrays very anatomical correct characters at least when he doesn't draw this very stylish cartoon characters like his avatar but even then I think it also takes correct Anatomy into account I think it shows Jessa's female characters remind me of classic Marvel and DC women somehow and they're also pretty masculine with wide shoulders and sharp edged faces his shading is also very different depending on the medium he uses but I decided to try and shade after one of his digital characters I think I thought the colors too much though so on the final version in the end of the video I have added huama turned to my drawing I don't know guys is this a hit or miss or maybe something in between maybe I should have just thrown that one as his avatar okay so next up is Bailey J my I was actually in doubt whether I should include Bailey or not because she is one of those artists I feel like trying out new things and styles all the time so I was unsure if I can find consistency enough to recreate her style but in her most recent pieces I actually see a lot of consistency in her work so I thought why the heck not I decided to try to fuse her digital coloring of her past set piece with the line art and overall look of her recent traditional pieces she has a really cute face is going on and I really take that what I gather from her colouring technique in the past that piece was a mix of gradients and cell shading these two often go really well together because the gradients are soft well Associated areas appear sharp so that's a good contrast there I feel like I missed a bit of the style in the line work were in Bailey's piece the lines look more uniform whereas in mine I may have varied them just a bit too much anyway the next artist is Amy right now also challenge that I actually found quite recently but that I really enjoy I think amy has a really fun way to tell stories and her illustrations to go with the tales are just super charming for the line I went looking for an ink brush with a lot of texture in it because it looks like Amy's line art was created with traditional pen and ink I ended up using a brush from cows manga brush sets which is free just have to google it and it's called basic rough the colors she used for characters are pretty muted and shaded with a little bit of gradient in some of Amy's illustrations are herself there's actually a double gradient in her hair which I tried to mimic on Ellen I don't think I nailed the hits shape entirely but all I really enjoyed portraying Ellen in the style and lastly we have Jayden animations I just wanted to finish what something'll is terrifying but very iconic and recognizable I decided to add a bit of shading as portrayed in Jaden's profile picture on the channel I feel like I couldn't really portray Ellen's uniqueness onto this style because Jaden's style is so unified and half of her style is actually how she uses these illustrations to tell a story and not the characters I don't at least that's my personal opinion so take this last one for what it is it's probably more a tribute than a challenge anyway that was it for this challenge here is my style with the other eight youtubers ah styles that I stole I mean borrow I hope you like the outcome and I definitely challenge you guys to try to do the same it's so much fun first of all and you'll learn so much from breaking down styles like this remember to use the link below to claim your two three months of
