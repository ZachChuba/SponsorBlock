hello welcome to video game animation
study today we're continuing a miniseries looking at the five
fundamentals of video game animation as proposed by Jonathan Cooper in his book
game on him video game animation explained this episode is sponsored by
Squarespace a place to build your online presence in the last episode we covered
the five fundamentals in a general overview and lightly inspected their
relation to the existing 12 principles of animation as complementary offering a
new light onto current emotion skills in the video game industry today we're
going to look deeper at the fundamental of feel I could lead the most important
of the five fundamentals of game animation feel is how a character
handles during gameplay and can mean the difference between sluggish unresponsive
gameplay and unrealistic detached gameplay feel directly links to the
function over form philosophy that games I think should adhere to you want to
feel in control of your character and animation that doesn't align with this
will ultimately ruin your experience the player is going to be making different
choices on the fly so if you're having to wait for an action to finish this is
going to lock you out of that decision-making until it's done for
instance a bigger or stronger attack may take longer to perform than a smaller
weaker attack while if you're looking to make everything as responsive as
possible you'll want to avoid sacrificing the weight of a character or
the force of an action you'll want your character to read well and feel good to
play fighting games are a classic example of where responsiveness is
important the feel of your game let's compare my favorite fighting game
skullgirls to that of something like Soul Calibur one is sprite based and one
is 3d model based one has smaller and weaker moves that can play on Twitch
faster and one has slightly slower modes that must be tactically planned
one isn't better than the other but they both feel different to play because of
the responsiveness of the characters another example could be when
controlling Sonic the Hedgehog or Megaman one of them takes ages to build
up to a top speed and one of them has a constant running speed from the second
you touch your control one of the jewelry's when controlling these
characters is the different skill involved from knowing the inertia and
momentum of a character you know that you can control Megaman down to the
exact pixel and change his direction midair multiple times
whereas with Sonic you know you can do a little run up to gain some extra height
to get to a new platform let's take a look at Batman from Arkham Knight now
Batman is a tough brute his large frame he wears armor has got lots of gadgets
readily at his disposal but he's still relatively responsive and fast moving
the responsiveness of his moves are probably most apparent when you're in
the middle of a brawl the Arkham series free flow combat system is something
that feels subjectively satisfying to take part in you can tap a variety of
buttons for a variety of attacks and dodges and you'll generally punch the
nearest enemy no matter how far away they are or which direction you're
facing there's a complex system of rigs and rules that decides which animation
pose Batman or a part of Batman will need to be in depending on if near an
enemy which direction they're in and what attack is going to do this can feel
great to play you might occasionally get this little
sliding around happening but it's debatable whether it's detrimental to
your enjoyment of the gameplay because Batman is still in your control you
could complement this with Marvel spider-man which uses that same free
flow combat system spider-man is very light in slender when
compared to Batman but he still fits this style of combat
you've got more opportunities for a bit of a meanness to allowing moves such as
zipping across with enemy with your web shot and staying up in the air while you
pull up a thug to smack him around a bit free flow combat works well in both
these games and only slight adjustment is needed to alter the feel of the
character but what's important is that you build up a kind of trust of that
character you know that if you make a mistake it's generally because you
haven't controlled that character well enough it feels good to be able to
control a character with all these varying possibilities to a fine
precision that's some good animation think about this though in Batman you
can control the Dark Knight himself and you can control his banner bill but you
can control it in car form or in tank form with both having different controls
and different feeling when playing some games have many variants of what you'd
feel good to play the bat tank should feel heavier and more precise because it
needs to move around and 360 degrees and be able to dodge and shoot whereas the
car should feel like it can escape quickly and be able to turn corners in
the way you'd expect a car to in other games like GTA and the fact you can
switch from car to tank in a second is something they'll need careful
consideration when designing how responsive these elements will feel
let's look at this transformation in Yoshi's Island there isn't a run button
but you do often take while to build up to running speaking however when you
turn into a helicopter your controls were much more drawn-out turning and
even staying up requires an extended press for button for the desired action
to finally come to pass this feels massively sluggish compared
to when you control Yoshi but this isn't necessarily bad because this is adding
an element of challenge to a stage you'll probably need to get to grips
with how this feels to control but once you've got it then you just need to
perfect it it'd be a different issue if the entire game controlled like this but
because it's a minor gameplay gimmick it's being designed with challenge in
mind additional animation tricks can be used to aid the feel of a character such
as follow-through and multiples for a big action if a big or slow action is
taking place it might help the player still feel in control of a character if
there's some visual feedback before the action takes place perhaps if your
character is turning and it will feel weird and unrealistic if they're able to
turn around from a fast movement really quickly then you can add in a bit which
shows them looking to where they need to go just so it doesn't feel that the
action itself is sluggish or unresponsive other feedback tricks
include camera shakes and frame holds on impact or actions such as landing a
heavy hit or taking damage there's no right or wrong way of applying field
into your character the game will feel how you want it to it's very much like
the traditional animation principle of appeal in that it's a difficult thing to
measure and teach the feel is an important thing to nail down first
because how your game feels to play will be how much your audience enjoys playing
it and likely how much they'll remember it I've mentioned in my HoloNet video
that team cherry wanted to nail down how it felt to jump before anything else and
based the rest of the movement around that perfected action
and Halle Knight is a game that's often remembered for feeling good to play
here's a nice story just to tie this fundamental up as fancy as the
animations are the developers of Streets of Rage 4 are trying to match the feel
of the gameplay to that of the original Mega Drive games and they achieve this
by literally playing the two games side-by-side and until they fill the
same something as nostalgic a Streets of Rage is right for scrutiny and as such
nailing that feeling is important for fans of the series and animation will
come second to gameplay because of that of course that doesn't mean you can't
add some fantastic visual flair to the animations around that gameplay feel now
I look forward to playing you and that is the fundamental of feel thanks to
