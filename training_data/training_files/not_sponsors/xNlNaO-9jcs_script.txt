[Music] plan plus one month with a huge discount [Music] i would say early morning is the quietest and the safest time of the day to move weight especially when you're trying to get all the way across the map i'm talking early early morning no cracks at gunfire large furnaces are off no mini copters in the sky you need it to be quiet and if you do it at the right time it'll be the easiest ride home of your life unless the weight that you're moving isn't yours so yeah we [ __ ] up and when you [ __ ] up as hard as we did sometimes you just gotta bite the bullet that is kai and we took his [ __ ] [Music] so that's me right there definitely not the main character of this story but i do play a key role into how this all unfolds so pay attention because i know i sure as hell didn't when this all went down now keep in mind i wasn't committed to this server which means i didn't really want to farm up a base i just wanted to test the waters really quick and see whether or not it was a place i'd like to stay so i'd make a quick compound bow at the nearest workbench i could find and try to go see if there was any early morning roamers to pick off that's the thing about joining servers early in the morning you always get that easy fresh start while everyone's asleep and everyone thinks they could farm or finish up their offline raids before the mass majority gets on two c4 raid on the coast oh that's an oil that's an oil base probably getting hit and it seemed i was right an offline raid was on the menu for today you can't pass up such a tempting opportunity i put my loot in some nearby stashes and i went to go take a look maybe just poke a little bit of fun on them with my compound stir things up a [Music] little oh [ __ ] oh this is perfect oh no no no so oh my god what the [ __ ] there's more people coming now i'm going to use solid and tell you the connection that i failed to understand when this was all going down originally that right there is kai and his buddy counter rating and this was my first encounter with them oh [ __ ] just wait [Music] if you watch the back side of his base the garage door and kill him when he comes outside i can give you the space when we're done yeah yeah i got you bro thank you man i'll watch sorry for shooting at you i was just trying to make a play as a naked [Music] just happened respawn uh boat kit outside the door's three three two one the door is three three two one if you come in here and watch the door don't come in there there's a shotgun trap if you watch the door and if i stand he just done what he's dead okay so while that empties let me do my best to explain what i think just happened a raid was in progress and the raiders killed the base owners and kai and his buddy counter radar they had a big shootout but ultimately kai was the only one left the guy with the db was the base owner and he spawned back and talked [ __ ] kai's dumbass placed a shotgun trap that blocked him in because he didn't have tc dumbass the base owner opens the door kills kai dies through a shotgun trap and kai not wanting to let the base owner get his [ __ ] back he tells the naked outside what code he used and now i'm left with all of the [ __ ] no [ __ ] way [Music] what just happened now let's not get too excited because something this good doesn't happen without some repercussions i was now sitting on the gold mine fought over between three different groups the base owners the raiders and the counter raiders the only question was who was gonna come back first i need to break that as the night grew closer so did my inevitable dune now the best thing i could have done in this situation was get the [ __ ] out of there with a good boot or at least stash the explosives but i guess i was just too sidetracked and taken off guard by everything that was happening so quickly it started with the base owner coming back to see if he could possibly get back into his base oh [ __ ] oh i blocked that he's trying to get back in unlucky dude i can make more than that [Music] [ __ ] dude they're back they're [ __ ] back [Music] [ __ ] [Music] so [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] dude there's too much good [ __ ] in here [Music] oh [ __ ] what the [ __ ] [Music] i really hope this is an incentive my god dude [Music] i should have just used just a g well that was rough but that's rust and that was a very good introduction to a few of the main characters in this story so now let's get forward three days by this time i had switched many servers played solo played with friends and i wasn't getting any more lucky than i did that day the christmas update just hit which didn't wipe any servers but it brought in a whole new wave of winter fun and everyone was flooding in trying to enjoy the update i was one of them and i didn't even know at the time that i had joined the same server three days later so without further ado i gathered all the christmas presents around the map and unboxed them for a shitload of iokas that i used on everybody i could find [Music] what [Music] [Music] there was so many people on this map and there was so much [ __ ] going on with so many big bases that it seemed really promising granted my luck wasn't always there i was able to eventually get a base set up that dude is dooming [Music] all right now enough of that boring [ __ ] let's get back to business so you know that compound you know the big [ __ ] one you couldn't miss it it was massive so fat and juicy i just couldn't take my eyes off it so i had to go investigate word on the street was this compound was impossible to infiltrate but i thought i'd give it a shot i'm just kidding no one said that [Music] oh i just got flat so and just like that i was in like tom cruise and mission [ __ ] impossible there was no compound that was going to keep me out of their base except this one this one actually kept me out because there was no way i could get in their second wall so i decided to wait in the inner compound walls and hope that maybe i would see them and i did they had just left and this would be my only chance to hope that they don't die and come back in the same entrance [Music] i waited there for a long time and this this is when things started to get very very interesting [Music] what the [ __ ] bro seal team six is coming in how many is it [Music] so i'm with you man i'm just trying to get these kids please please pick me up dude i'm just camping these kids i'm trying to make a play dude no no no i'm just trying to make a play please pick me back up okay i'm i'm picking you up we're leaving but if you killed one of these guys bring a school to us you know 11 okay and we'll trade you something here okay okay okay okay euros thank you die die die oh he took my flashlight son of a [ __ ] do i have a torch no where did my shells go wait i have my shells you drop my yokas [ __ ] dude i got robbed inside a compound that wasn't even [ __ ] theirs that was that thing what happened to my yokes dude what the [ __ ] i can't find no [ __ ] away now what did that man say exactly we're leaving but if you killed one of these guys bring your school to us you know eleven okay and we'll trade you something here okay oh here they are what the [ __ ] bring us his skulls in 011 and we'll trade you something for it i mean i've never been a hired hitman in russ before but it shouldn't be too hard right kill them bring a school they'll trade me [ __ ] i don't even need to get loot this would be light work i don't even need to do anything like bring a gear set just their skulls okay [Music] just one skull frost that's all we need [Music] what is that okay this was turning out to be a little more difficult than i expected [ __ ] dude [Music] i just got fly kicked [Music] [Music] okay that's it i was done there would be no more [ __ ] around i had lost too many easy opportunities it was time to make an investment you can't go wrong with a double barrel shotgun [Music] what do you know it worked i also got lucky with there only being one out at a time but either way i got a hatchet and i made some small stashes gathered the skulls and headed back to base [Music] so [Music] upon my arrival to 011 i quickly realized why this group wanted these skulls and don't think that i went down there with the only two gear sets that i just got i had to play this safe also pardon my high pitched squeaker voice i try to make sure that no one recognizes who i am hello [Music] hello santa brings kiss ho ho ho ho ho ho santa hat now let's finally make some connections to some characters in this story hello hi yo man now what you doing i have gifts i have schools can you please stop shooting okay so let's introduce the first clan member i never actually got his name so we're just going to call him useless now he goes under the smaller yet still massively large [ __ ] compound list you said i wasn't talking to you but i was talking to someone else and they said they would give me [ __ ] for them please just ask your group or something all right man back up back i never did catch the name of the guy who offered me the trade but i could recognize his voice if i heard it hello hello oh hey were you the one i talked to and that was him we're leaving but if you kill one of these guys bring his school doors no 11 his name was max also under the same list what's up man i talked to you about that girl yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i never got your name what's your name we're talking about like a now these guys were superstitious they didn't want to come even one foot out of their compound but you know who did come from outside of their compound hello kai now we both never paid attention to who we were during that short encounter three days ago so we had no clue our relation obviously the same list swamp boys on the other hand we had thick tim two dads and gluck we also had a few unknowns on both teams but that could have been kai or anybody else so there you go the main characters so far i mean obviously these groups were bigger and there were some more important characters that play some roles that you've already met so anyway back to our trade at hand they ended up going through with it and they gave me some weapons but that wasn't all they also had an interesting proposition for me all right i appreciate it dude um thank you have a nice day okay hey now that voice i recognized hey yo boat kid you watch the back side of his base the garage door and kill him when he comes outside i can give you the space when we're done with it how'd you like doing that little little side mission man [Music] listen i can i can get you on on a main mission you feel it's boring as [ __ ] okay but listen the amount of [ __ ] we can give you i mean like the amount of [ __ ] we can get actually wait wait [Music] [Music] are you sure yes yes yes um okay if you meet me on the east side of the compound i'll show you what the face first so i know i don't lose it yeah yeah yeah a boring yet super rewarding task a job that they wanted me to do okay i mean was it was this [ __ ] christmas i mean yeah yeah it was this was an opportunity i could not pass up damn [ __ ] right i was gonna take them up on that offer i've ever had i deepened my stuff and i headed straight back to the east side entrance as requested now there is a lot of dialogue that takes place in this next sequence but kai does a pretty good job at explaining it on a ride over my initial impressions kai was kind of a role player i mean at least he had a nice garage i like your base dude i i emptied the shotgun [Music] oh [ __ ] i didn't yeah that would have killed me we met in kai's garage for some quick small talk but then he urged that i get in the vehicle and he talked about the rest of the situation right over i don't want you pulling no [ __ ] on me i mean he was a smart player too shotgun traps peacekeeper auto turrets and he kept the taxi cab locked and me in the back at all times this is when i'd finally get the run rundown and i'd understand a little bit more about my new job yeah and uh turn your sound down so you can actually hear me [Music] okay let's start with the compound on your right we're pulling out of here like this don't ever take a right that takes you straight to tfr's compound they will roof camp the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of you man said tfr's compound i'm assuming that was the swamp boys the driver doesn't leave vehicle you can it doesn't really matter but just don't have our [ __ ] on you what it seemed to me was i was gonna be the gunner for some sort of transport once we're up here at bandit you can take a left and go around there's probably gonna be trees and [ __ ] in the way you'll just have to farm those after that you turn down the dirt road and this takes you to the main road this is like the hot spot of the map literally [ __ ] compound boat kids every place yeah we don't really know what it stands for but we just call them total [ __ ] retards so yeah after this curve you're kind of safe this is just a long part but also the easiest part not many bases up north here uh the real only reason we're up this far north is because of oil rig this was a long [ __ ] drive and i still didn't really have an idea on what i was doing okay so you're about to see the best hemp farm in the entire server by the way so yeah you're gonna be taking the hemp from this space back to our base using the root i just showed you it was beautiful the perfect hemp base uh that's brothers in there actually you can see him through the shop front he's literally just a farm bot that's all he does he puts him at the bottom and chris comes and picks it up you probably won't talk to him ever but who's chris chris is your driver he lives right here he's probably the nicest guy he'll ever [ __ ] meet so andy solo so you know be nice [Music] i don't think he's here man nah i i think he's here the camera's off oh yeah he's here what the [ __ ] dude i'm kind of scared i got you a gift my guy hello i'm personal assistant man said boys it's your gift you said you needed help when uh your runs because you kept [ __ ] up so chris me dry eye cry me chris nice to meet you hello again uh hello oh [ __ ] man no no no like say something like full sentence uh hi how's it going man my name is try like is it a joke or something like you send me a [ __ ] kid with the voice changer okay okay listen man listen he's the only one that offered to help so oh my god dude i thought he recognized me so you guys have fun i will i gotta go i got a blast okay boys uh hi so uh what are we doing okay so after that interesting meetup we got straight to work every run started with a phone call to chris sometimes he wouldn't even pick it up because we just knew it was our cue to get moving he invited me into his team and brought me into his garage where he showed me his transport vehicle and all of his high quality checking inside we have some good crazy pieces for how unexcited this man sounded you knew he was proud of those high qual parts the first stop was right next door he always went around the side to get the weight which i thought was interesting but i guess they must have had a designated room for him to loot he got in and then it was straight to the run back to kai's compound when we got there there was always one or two guys waiting to let us in chris made it clear to not get out of the vehicle or else i'd be killed by the traps in the garage and the two guys would empty the truck and put some guns or supplies for us as rewards in the back and then we'd be back on our way home these runs were non-stop at least two runs an hour the server was quiet that night and i was told i could log off but he would definitely be down to do some runs tomorrow and that's exactly what we did [Music] over the next few days actually chris and i worked non-stop and he also allowed me access to his front airlock and the garage so it would be easier for us we then took some time to make an investment and pick up a new vehicle maybe that could now hold four parts this new modification made it much more fun for us because it made it easier to shoot at nakeds on our drives over granted it was hard as [ __ ] to hit anything it still made it more fun and also increased your field of view for call outs not only that it was so much fun that chris even wanted to try so i took on driving for a few of the runs and on our second day we had our first run-in with tfr [Music] hello oh my god what the [ __ ] holy [ __ ] they rolled up [Music] i was even able to snake a full metal kit for my base i convinced chris to let me drive there really quick before we headed back to his base so i could depot some stuff which would be the full metal set just come inside for now thanks man what the [ __ ] dude what what chris is stealing the more i thought about it the more i realized that chris may have actually been stealing their cloth i mean we just dropped off the whole load at their base after that fight so why would he still have a whole row on it when i arrived chris wasn't there at the time it seemed like he was farming or something in the desert so i waited for him in his base this was going to be an interesting talk because i liked kai and i liked him and i didn't want to make it seem like i was going to snitch so i had to break the ice with him oh what's up dude yo yo what's up man did it go no no one called hello oh [ __ ] yeah i was cause man all right this is serious we need to have a talk no listen we need to have a talk chris okay here's your [ __ ] back yeah here what is this chris what is this chris yeah chris yeah you have some explaining to do buddy yeah yeah come on confess what's going on man you know that's saying sometimes looking for answers only no no no no you are not gonna [ __ ] what the chris actually did not want to tell me what was up so i guess i was gonna go have to snitch to kai no obviously not but things started to escalate very quickly after this what you're about to see is only about two hours after chris and i just had that conversation chris had just got a call from kai to start up another run just like any other run we got in the vehicle we headed straight over but we were still in tfr's vehicle from the fight initially so we didn't have the bed on the back of our truck which meant our field of view was limited [Music] the [ __ ] is that light what the [ __ ] [Music] hello what is happening oh my god it's [ __ ] white uh the storage was full so he just had to keep some extra on him i had this feeling in my gut that everything was about to come toppling down and the only thing that pissed me off was i honestly had nothing to do with it [Music] oh my god dude do i try to talk to him i don't know what to do man i feel like i shouldn't go up with a gun [Music] yep i was [ __ ] oh [ __ ] me dude [Music] oh my god they're right [ __ ] there they know where they know where i've lived the whole time bro oh my god i'm so [ __ ] you first and chris uh i don't know what you're talking about man i'm just a solo player i saw you guys coming up the hill so i'm hiding in my base i don't cry we've seen you come up here so many [ __ ] times you ran into space what are you talking about we know it's you [ __ ] dude what do i do oh my god come to the shop right or you're getting ready chris and i may have become friends but i wasn't about to take the fall for him okay listen listen listen listen listen for one second no fake voice this is serious okay i did not take any of your [ __ ] i swear dude i'm not even kidding i found out at the same exact [ __ ] time okay i'm sorry i didn't mean to do that listen i befriended chris so i have his base codes and i could get you what you want back so you don't have to raid us okay because he's just a [ __ ] role player and i promise you i literally have like 130 cloth in my [ __ ] base it would be completely pointless this gear set i got from the fight against tfr after that they left and they didn't say anything so i mean i guess i assumed that the plan that i just offered was a green light now what i had to do after this was something i was not proud of but it would possibly save chris and my [Music] base [Music] when i arrived to chris's base i had seen that he had already started prepping for the worst yo [Music] nice wall dude apparently we were closer than i thought because he let me all the way into his base into his tc room and use loot um [Music] when chris made a run to the gas station that night i took what wasn't his i guess [Music] i got in the car and i drove off i didn't say anything to him i took the claw i took the sulphur and i went to go return to kai [Music] [Music] yep russ is here this is all he had so we good um you want to come with us here in a minute yeah where i knew exactly where this was going uh we're gonna go hit chris [Music] uh hello i'm sorry did i not just bring you the claw i knew he's in the [ __ ] pulley yeah you did that you know we won't rate you but we're still gonna hit him but that's what we agreed upon i bring you the cloth and you don't rate us both of us i thought i was literally just in his base he doesn't have [ __ ] that was just that was just for you yeah no it doesn't matter man but like it's the fact that he stole from us you know what i mean we don't give two shits about the cloth it's like the purpose that that he had them intentions so they're going to raid him right now we're not yeah here in a minute here's the team at this point i wasn't starting to like kai but at the same time this was their business i was just gonna tag along for the ride i left chris that one last message so he could do what he could to prepare before what was about to come but there wasn't going to be much i could do there was five of these guys and they were far more geared than both of us i half expected this though i mean kai was a good clan leader and he wasn't gonna let chris run a muck behind his back [Music] [Music] [Music] dry open the gate real quick i don't have code idiom no code they thought they had me dude bro this is so [ __ ] they weren't wasting any time guy had a pretty strong bunker base but they were gonna slice through it like butter [Music] happy i'm happy like a peach in the tree there i am [Music] i'm happy hypocrisy [Music] hey come to the shopper man [Music] [Music] right [Music] all right man you're lost at least they take the blues away yeah yeah [Music] you guys ready yeah yeah we're here go go go i'm happy you're happy lord [Music] are you guys alive yeah yeah we're good yeah we're good they're dead they're [Music] so remember this moment let's go back right before that you know chris is [ __ ] some things are better left unanswered you know that saying sometimes looking for answers only here tomorrow no no no no you are not gonna [ __ ] what the that's [ __ ] bro i talking my normal voice to break the ice to you now you tell me what the [ __ ] is going on dude we're friends we've been through too much dude you gotta tell me man i'm obviously not gonna snitch no chris didn't just tell me the feud he had with kai he gave me the whole story white day that right there is kai space alive and well with the swamp providing a perfect water source by outpost he was about to build the foundation for the best cloth base on the server until later that night tfr and the boys showed up and took everything from him kai and his group lost their perfect start that night and swore for revenge against tfr but tfr had numbers and their base had grew too big during the days to come so instead kai and his group decided to dominate the pvp scene and collect tfr skulls as revenge kai still dreamed of a large hemp base and to do that they needed a place with a lot of water the next best spot in front of oil rig where chris was already living kai raided chris and all the others in that area that night and offered them all an ultimatum he wouldn't grief their base if they wanted to work for him takaya was nothing personal but to chris it was so what the [ __ ] happened after that conversation well you saw after kai spared my base and i went to chris to steal his cloth back i told him everything i told him we needed to prep because he was gonna get raided we hooked up a door switch to the front door that chris would be able to flick on and off we made sure to turn the turret on full hostile mode and we put his best weapon in it now here comes the best part in kai's biggest mistake you may have noticed when i got out of the scrap heli i already had building privilege [Music] now how tcu was in the hemp base and chris only had access to the side loot room so how did we get the codes well when we fought tfr i finally recognized kai's voice it only took me two days respawn uh boat get outside the doors three three the door is 3321. now what were the chances that the code that kai used to spam into that counter raid and told that unsuspecting naked who he thought he'd never meet again was the same code that he used for his main base i went back in my recordings to get the code and i tried them on the base later that night and they worked now i couldn't do much because they had turrets everywhere and i couldn't change the gate codes because that would just be a dead giveaway and was pointless but you know what place didn't have turrets their hemp base so later that night chris and i snuck over there and we entered in all the codes we destroyed all their bags and replaced them with not only bags for him and i but for kira and sergeant major deal as well when i knew the raid was finally going down i called them both on discord and they were ready to go all they had to do was wait for the green light chris hello [Music] yo lulu it worked it [ __ ] worked dude it [ __ ] worked now we had a row of rockets and a [ __ ] ton of loot it wasn't enough to raid kai's compound but we had an idea we took the scrap heli in the rockets and we flew to outpost right by tfr's compound we knocked on their door and we made them a very simple deal we'll give you a row of rockets if you make sure to use it on kai's base they agreed but they seemed hesitant and we wondered if they'd even use the rockets on their base they said it would take time for them to prep for the raid and it was already so late that i decided i'd go to bed when i got on the next day chris was working happily in his base his new hemp base i had to make a run to kai's base first to see if tfr had followed through with the plan and their base was completely obliterated it was pummeled by rockets this was a huge victory for not me but chris he was a solo player at heart and he would have taken on kai with or without me so on that final note i got in my car and i drove off but this time it was for good [Music] am hoping there'd be someone like you to pick me
