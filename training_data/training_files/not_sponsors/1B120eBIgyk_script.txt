hey guys so today we are going to be reacting to I use latest comeback eights I have never actually done anything even a relatively are you related on my channel before just mad because I did with your massive face and still am in massive face I'm loving her music like her last comeback blooming but she just kills it every time she's an absolute icon and I've always hoped I music which is why I find it mad that I've never done a reaction on my channel before so when I found out that she was anything you come back I was gasps for that when it's bone but then when it found that to be a collaboration with sugar from BTS but you know I spat out my granola so I'm super super excited has come back and I watch the teaser the other day and this has seemed to go in a direction that like I don't think I use ever taken before it's got a very Taylor Swift that blood vibe and I'm ready for ru to be of that like I'm ready for it even if something probably gonna be like a ballad I'm still here for it anything she does I'm here for Odyssey Queen step on me but yes I'm super excited so he's gonna go straight and my bias in IU is um are you sorry let's get okay so are you Thanks future the sugar this deep hmm that's aggressively go eat eat there's some HSE figured it comes up like this why would say tears like oh oh my god that dress that's what Shakespeare for her voice is literal honey chapstick this is a key code like Coplay vibes and if you don't mean you know they'll cook while she's so pretty I love coke but it's got mad carpet lips [Music] why it's kind of like a big country cheerier light I would add lyrics she's so beautiful now I told you she'd screw this seems like a bad comes up and come through with like a power ballad she's so come on what dad is so cool the animation though so that should be the first thing I said Wow I look at me even imagine how long never the same Easter as well sugar killed it his voice suit I used so so well [Music] well this is storyline that's so cool and it's different types of animation - that's so sick I really like this so it's like feel good cuz I would even call it a ballad it's just like this is so sick there's so many different things going on I'm gonna have to train your jaggon three for your that's so sorry I couldn't get over the creative mastermind but directed this [Music] Wow oh my God look at her Jesus Christ Wow a real enumerable a storyline because I never get to some of the heck went on but yes appreciate that look all those credits oh my god oh my god you making me feel nervous stop it Mike hard was she being so pretty for oh my god okay so I really like that obviously this song II's musicans to be a bit slower so I was reading those about reacting so I was like there's hardly gonna be a base job or anything am I gonna be like here but that was still so much that so we'll start with the song first of all that opening gaping bad Coldplay fires and copay oh one of my favorite bands so I was like yes it had this really beautiful chill missed algae glad I used voice is probably one of the most beautiful things on earth so she could let you sing a telephone book to me and I still be like number one of the chances get but yeah I really like the song it's just nice and chill they still went somewhere I had voice sounded amazing also sugars feature I'm just in shock at how good his voice like slid inside and I may seem like I was talking over it but I was listening I promise he sounded so good I wish so I knew he was saying but like their voices to know that it's just a match made in heaven I need more then for the music video I'm so in shock at this music video because it was just so beautiful like obviously first all the shots are you in real life was stunning she's just a beautiful girl anyway but that kind of orange II was they called gold an hour vibe that was very nostalgic and then that first animation that was stunning the family had two different types of animation and that just well any man effort work that's got into that but it just just see those little background videos beautiful first it would be kind of cartoony animation but then also the three-dimensional graphics animation side of it just ah so so interesting and I appreciated it and I ain't even in last shooting so I don't know what Olivia feels about that but all in all it's beautiful I didn't understand the storyline I think it maybe I'm reading into it too much to expect him too much of a backstory about still it was beautiful she did beautiful this song it's beautiful sugar you're beautiful even I didn't see you just everything about it was beautiful and just Stan are you for clear skin good grades and 50/50 vision thank you for coming to my TED talk but yeah that was my reaction to I media will be in the below barkis come to follow and I will see you in my next video [Music]
