so it's time for another crazy cooling experiment with Linus and alex this time our victim is going to be the Delian where area 51 M so this is notable for having a desktop 9900 k-8 core processor in it that runs at a hundred degrees at all times so we are going to be trying to tame the beast but there's going to be a couple of key differences today DIF number one they kicked us out of the boardroom so we're in the kitchen and DIF number two we have hello Stephen Burke from gamers Nexus so let's see what we can do with this thing with Linus and get 25 percent off glass wire at the link below this is a lot of gear why is there a calculator he never goes anywhere without his ti-84 a serious phone yeah okay so we're not gonna know what or how we can mount an alternative cooling solution to this thing until we've opened it up and figured out exactly what kind of mounting holes Gelles using we require mounting holes that are quite close to the socket we don't know if we're gonna find that inside yeah we're not going to I'm trying to put some suspense in the video Alice I know that so is this CPU and GPU are they exposed on this side yeah they are okay does your plan to leave the motherboard mounted in the laptop yeah the other option is you sit up for curiously on its side and we just look at the screen like this while the coolers hooked up like that yeah do you know the story of my chiller I bought this for the sole purpose of hooking it up to my daily driver East 6600 and you can tell that it's very did it ever hurt anybody 17 year old me engineered it has not hurt anyone yet but the possibility of being hurt is definitely real so I would ask that while it's plugged in you refrain from touching this is this a ground terminal any of the bare leads here yeah yeah that's just hanging there okay you don't need ground we don't see ourselves as being grounded type people okay neither of us wants to use our liability insurance yes what I think is going to have to happen is we're going to take these really really cheap blocks okay and the machine a new piece of acrylic that'll fit the mounting holes does this this doesn't have any micro fins does it no it's just a flower oh no it's like four dollars on Aliexpress what do you want man maybe six dollars on Aliexpress I don't know I fix it's gonna hate this I couldn't find the Marlin so this is their old precision perspective you go I'm assuming there's no IHS on the cpu right so it's literally a desktop okay I know right is it socketed yeah Oh interesting I didn't know that so it's it's 210 millimeter heat pipes on the CPU and then GPU is here yep what is the GPU full-blown you saw the CPU is 100 degrees was that only what the overclock and I'm assuming okay one of the things that we're probably gonna have to figure out because having a look at the cooling solution here Stephan identified that there's actually a fair amount of erm cooling going on so they're not just cooling with CPU but this aluminum plate right here is actually making thermal pad contact with the MOSFETs and the inductors all of this interesting so Alex this is gonna be a little bit tricky we're gonna have to get air flow onto this heatsink somehow even if we do just go with the stock solution is that this back in here is the GPU gonna be under a chiller also yeah such other like what is like zero degrees it's whatever you want it to be maybe okay so it's been a couple hours ah where are you at we're good to cut things so it looks kind of stupid this is the GPU one it does look kind of stupid it's it looks like you screwed it out and because we just moved our router yeah I don't know how accurate is at the moment and until we test that I'm just making all the holes way bigger so hopefully it fits anyway you have the o-ring groove and everything sort of oh right there's no groove yes no groove just flat so we're just gonna reuse the stock o-ring that came with our Chinese block yeah how does this compare to how organized and professional you thought we were Steve that way I deserve that hey I get to be the coolest-looking 1:200 know what up there you go so that's our cpu mount right yep cool sorry Steve it's not as bad if you're making the noise which is why I always volunteer for tap duty that's right this one's a bit off but I think we can just drill through it and it'll be fine the PCB or the filler top isn't it gonna be beautiful when you have the mill and it'll actually just be like warm how much was it again 5k oh god no I don't know good enough heck yeah woah it's not perfect but that's not what we're going for the label on this bin really does not bode well for the water cooling process sorry Steve I promise we'll get to the part where we really need your expertise the overclocking very soon just got a you know fabricate some crap to up like a vise to secure the block no I had that would you like to use it no no I'm good thank you just making sure I'm gonna go back to writing my scripts for your next video yeah wow I wonder if this is how like ek waterboxx makes theirs yeah hey definitely do use the drill by hand right through the top oh that was gnarly why is Alex not wearing gloves bed- has to protect his little baby hands that's why we're getting close then aren't we yeah hell yeah actually we have a lot of crap on the floor Steve around the thing there there's a Dyson I know that you're really good at vacuuming I saw you did a review once of a vacuum cleaner is the money still in it it is vacuum it's not sucking up the dirt we have to cut a new one Alex that's not gonna hold well alex is recutting our GPU acrylic top we're gonna mount our CPU block as best we can so in order to make our lives a little one of those are you throwing paste is gonna be better thermally those are just good for their endurance because you can use it a long time actually lying down the middle you know it just for you wait what this is the sky like X technique sir I've read that smiley faces improve the thermals a bit okay how much are you putting on here just gonna squish out exactly who's gonna clean it no I won't be here - one of my longest standing sponsors is thermal grizzly dough needs to be worth their whole face does he spend more work it back I'm all about the legal technique so what do you think looks really ghetto but like any good way so our expectation right now turn on if this will turn on yes okay I want to throw that heat sink back on there yep three two one wait oh I saw flash on the keyboard oh no it's powering up battery that sounds like it wants a battery man okay sure let's try putting a battery in okay you can screw that down no it's fine like at least one you gotta hold the heat sink do you want to hold the heat sink Alex oh it's the heat sink no one's holding it okay are weary I'm er weary assembling it at this point like no saw flicker yeah fans do like one rotation and stop so basically here's what happened the problem was that the memory slots are actually labeled one two three four which is pretty difficult what's a little less typical is that it wasn't booting with memory in slots one and I guess it would have been four apparently the system is firing up so all that's left now is to retighten up our CPU block mount our GPU block and then finally one day late leverage the talents of Stephen Burke here and might actually do something now how about we start with just a little below ambient stay about the dew point okay yeah I'm gonna lift this up and we are going to put this in there okay you can see this well-crafted cutout right here yep that's for this right here okay all right perfect thank you don't cut yourself that's some very rusty metal okay tubing here's some scrap tubing we had lying around with a fitting in it's not a race Alex well if it is I'm winning it seemed fun well let's maybe give it one minute I mean remember these our line is tapped holes also one of the first fittings that you put on just didn't have an o-ring really so are you sure it didn't come off or something no I really did check it's just drawing the cables into the fans so they're shredding the cables leaving which is creating strands of cable sleeving that get into them more easily wait what what's going on it's good solution there Wow only if it works we've got our water cooling working our temperatures are great at idle we're what like 15 degrees 15 and 13 on the GPU and we're at 6 Celsius on the chiller wonderful except for one small thing no matter what we do in the extreme tuning utility I'm using air quotes here it's not applying we're getting lower scores in the CPU testing 3dmark so we've got core ratio overrides for one to eight cores do you want to just set those in here no we'll do that next to you if we can okay alright so after painstakingly applying they're in BIOS overclocking settings we are supposedly at 5.2 gigahertz on any load up to six cores and then four point nine four seven and eight core loads but we're pretty sure that this is nonsense so ideally with overclocking the biggest limits you run into are thermal and potentially voltage which triggers thermal and then power limits and so we're running out of power which I know for two reasons one is because hardware in 464 tells us we're hitting power limits and the other one is because you can see the cores throttling but we're well under TJ Matt the issue then is that when I try to increase the power limits here and it doesn't look like they've really changed from that BIOS change when I increase the power limits next to you it just says you can't do that or it increases them in such a small way that doesn't do anything useful for us alright well see what happens yeah I was gonna tell you this clearly isn't working because we're at 246 Lots we got higher than that before alien where's P overclock here is actually doing nothing so they're pretty overclocks actually it is 52 on six cores but it's she doing 4.8 on all course so let's just manually tell it to do 49 X and then I want to change these but I don't think it does anything based on what we've seen so let's just run this as a baseline and see what the cores are doing so amusingly enough turning our clock speed target down to 4.9 but on all course actually yields slightly higher power consumption and and a higher score a higher score yeah and so the reason this happens for anyone doesn't know is because when you you set the the configuration to aggressive but your power throttling it's throttling harder to try and account for that so you might actually drop your multiplier from something like 49 X down to all the way into the 20s or 30s right I'm gonna increase the cash ratio now a general rule of thumb is I like to keep cash ratio like maybe 4 ticks below all core but we're gonna push for maybe 47 acts and see if that holds and this is also known it's a reboot required annex to you on this laptop it seems like reboot required basically means it's not gonna work no wonder you prefer working with desktops at least they're designed for this sort of thing I think this is designed for it I think so too I think Alienware had this in mind so after beating our heads against the wall turns out there's a new bios for this laptop apparently enhanced the performance of the system perfect Thank You BIOS engineers hopefully this gives us a bit more control oh hold on a second no this is good power limit one is 210 watts now oh yeah that's the change okay I have some hope now cuz if we can get another 60 watts that should be substantial yeah I doubt you're gonna be able to actually change it it's a two hundred and thirty or whatever yeah I don't think that's happening then I guess I should know it as well I did drop the chiller a bit more so I forget where we're at about 10 degrees Fahrenheit I don't really use Fahrenheit despite being American so I'm not sure what that is but our load temps were around 50 to 55 degrees across all course we're below zero Celsius is what really matters so so we're expecting a better result this time because we got up to almost 250 watts here okay good for the full system CPU temps are also a touch higher in the mid-60s so it's definitely working harder so we're changing power management for the GPO to performance instead of optimal power we're changing texture filtering from quality to high-performance kingpin OGS all those real overclockers do this it's permissible so we've got that done it is actually at what was it 290 yeah okay well that's very promise this is better than the first BIOS for sure yeah and we haven't touched voltage yet so if we have 2 over volt we might be able to it's just gonna get power limitation issue you know what right when you said that it peaked at 300 so 300 is gonna be our new maximum power it looks like used to throttle stop to bypass these throttling schemes is at your own risk and can result in permanent damage to your power adapter or computer perfect I'm applying the setting it's saying reboot required I hit this card I apply the setting and then it worries and if I reboot it doesn't work it gives an error message it's helped with 295 it's holding up there longer our frequency was actually like 50 the whole time and I technically applied 51 but I don't know if it actually worked 10 6 79 so this is the error that we get every time we try to actually listen to the software and reboot and then it just doesn't apply anything that was changed yep in fact it reset everything else so after playing around with all the dials and XTU it turns out that the only thing that really changed with the BIOS update was that the default power limit is higher the good news though is now we can start pushing our GPU which we should be able to get a pretty good overclock on right yes so GPUs and video GPS especially are really temperature dependent and for about every maybe 5 degrees Celsius you drop you'll keep getting frequency increases without even doing any work we do not have a lot of time we're starting to sweat yes air will create condensation so I would limit their access to components worst case scenario Alienware gets back a laptop that doesn't work so 11 to 36 we are up on graphic significantly some success so we are up from 10,000 201 211 236 about 10% and 7 degrees on the GPS after running so then let's get this back towards the BRM perfect how how does that it's getting warm yeah memory was getting a little bit toasty too and our memory has shoved under there I think so that's I would like to get a fan kind of this direction oh we need to do we need yeah slate the CPU a bit well that's the best I think we can really hope for right now I'm gonna put some more towel around the fittings up here at the top yeah if the compressor still running are we still bringing this down yeah you know I'm good I think we're gonna call this the limit cuz we're starting to sweat more than I'm really comfortable with we're gonna start getting drops running down the tubes onto the motherboard here pretty soon so you crank did you crank it all the way so this is basically it this is what we're going for plus 180 on the GPU core plus 1120 on the GPU memory and 5 gigahertz on the CPU now to be clear there are other things that Steve could do if you had more time tuning the clock speeds for individual cores because I mean 3dmark especially when you're running a GPU test actually doesn't hit all the course so you could avoid a power limit by not running all of them at 5 gigahertz so we have well over a 10% improvement yeah not not bad what are our GPU and CPU temps look like I see is that 9 on the GPU I see over here CPU so max was about 74 degrees Celsius so and then the GPU we don't have it logged actually we do the max was 28 degrees degrees really not bad that's awesome so anyway I think we can be happy with this knowing that within the the time and the software parameters we unfortunately have we're at eleven thousand four oh six versus ten thousand hundred eighty-six so that is way outside of margin of error we've actually improved it yep the graphics cores eleven thousand six fourteen that's the CP it wasn't really that great it was ten 360 so we it could improve there there's a throttling issue so settings GPU core offset was 160 megahertz memory we did 1120 megahertz I tried 1180 I tried 1220 both of is really heavily artifact sedan crashed maximum performance mode in the power management for nvidia drivers we changed texture filtration the high performance from quality which is allowed so that's it massive thank you to Alienware for permitting us to do this to their mission they didn't permit any of this but thanks to Steve for coming out and having some fun with us there was a lot of fun time laptop extreme overclocking yes very fun and very impressed with Alex's CNC turnaround on the blocks extremely quick water cooling solution for a you know laptop that's it's gonna be a new business opportunity for us I think create custom laptop water blocks all the money in that speaking of lots have that linked below so thanks for watching guys if you just liked hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed especially to Steve you can find him over at gamers Nexus there is no apostrophe even though it seems like maybe there should be the don't stress about it also what else oh yeah you can check out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video description I wouldn't recommend using it like this also down there is our merch store and what the hey why don't we put Steve's merch store down there as well you have these mod mattes again yet they will be here pretty soon yeah okay well and we have the medium ones now so these things are fantastic whatever your tech project is whether you're working on a computer like him or a mobile phone or whatever just call me a computer
