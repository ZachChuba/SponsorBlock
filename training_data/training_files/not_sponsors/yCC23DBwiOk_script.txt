hey everybody I'm peanutbutter gamer how old it's Halloween and even though Zelda month is just around the corner I'm still getting into the spooky spirit so today I'm gonna do a list that I've always wanted to do amber places slash levels etc so let's get on with it first I have the hallway from PT before I mention anything else I need to say this PT is one of the most cryptic games I have ever played absolutely nothing is spelled out for you never before have I spent minutes at a time staring at random garbage on the ground or a crack on the wall thinking that legitimately might be what I'm supposed to be doing but back to the hallway it's just that a normal hallway in a normal house and the whole game takes place inside of that hallway looped over and over repeatedly and all the puzzles are solved simply by closely observing every little part of this hallway and noticing what's different or missing the next time you walk through it that alone makes this particular area memorable and there's just something about it taking place in a simple hallway there's something relatable about it and that's what makes it scary nearly everyone has walked around their house late at night feeling as if there was something or someone watching them and then freakin coathanger I swear it scares me every time oh yeah and the ghost lady's pretty spooky too I guess Pokemon is not a very scary game I mean most of what you do in Pokemon is walk around to happy music punch birds in the face and beat up little children's pets and take their money it's not even that hard most of the time I mean in this playthrough I basically just used my squirtle grandpa the whole time and he completely stopped everyone he came across with little to no problems but every now and then they add a really creepy area or Easter egg and the most prominent of them all you saw it coming before you even clicked on this video is lavender town lavender town is home to the largest Pokemon graveyard in the game it's also home to one of the most notorious and creepy theme songs ever made the song alone makes walking around in lavender town pretty spooky but some of the inhabitants certainly add to the scary atmosphere as well especially the channelers you shall join us give me blood Booga erv ah okay it's probably my favorite zombies just zombies and and Zomba but one of the freakiest things about lavender town has nothing to do with the actual game itself but some of the stories and creepypastas made up by fans one of the freakiest being a lavender town syndrome the idea of the story is that the original Japanese version of the song had excessively high frequencies that only young people could hear and these frequencies affected their brain in some way and caused depression and even suicide in many cases but you guys know me I'm not one to fall for such nonsense such gobbledygook there's absolutely no proof that anything like that could ever happen oh no No yeah nice job low tire part disclaimer don't put guns up to your head and shoot guns and have guns and kill people got you now you can't sue me up next I have a combination of two consecutive levels in Silent Hill - toluca prison and the labyrinth to enter toluca prison the main character James Sunderland has to take a leap of faith down a giant hole and what is he rewarded with for his bravery Eddy dombrowski killing a person ain't no big deal just put the gun to their head Eddy come on we just went over this don't put guns up to your head and shoot guns and have guns and kill people I'm gonna get a bunch of angry emails now yeah I was just joking James oh you were just kidding huh I guess it's fine then dear every email it was all a joke and that makes it okay love Eddie he's a super trustworthy guy and you totally probably don't even get into the clumsiest looking gun fight in the world with them later I bet everything's good Eddie Eddie are you okay man I mean I know I shot you with a shocker and a bunch of times but you're you're good right the prison is full of scary enemies atmosphere banging and even some creepy chanting from some unseen enemies known as the prisoners but the prison serves as more of a build-up to the next area the labyrinth you begin to come across even more holes you need to jump down and eventually even a giant elevator you ride the elevator down for a very long time it's an almost excessive amount of symbolism is it you're descending further and further into madness or perhaps even Hell itself however you want to look at it but perhaps the scariest part of these areas are all the other people that you come across in cutscenes the other characters are always pretty weird but in these chapters they begin to act even more bizarre and occasionally even violent towards you after all Silent Hill is more of a psychological horror game than anything else it's not so much the kind of game that's so scary you feel like you can't continue playing but rather the kind of game you play for a few hours then find yourself feeling either even paranoid for the rest of the day in fact after I got all the footage for this video I went out to get some food and couldn't help but look at everything in a different way places and buildings I had seen hundreds of times without a second thought almost seemed warped and disturbing almost as if I was in a completely different world that only mirrored the world I was used to I don't even know if that makes any sense but it's just the kind of thing that playing Silent Hill does to you it messes with your mind in the best sort of ways up next we have the prison from amnesia this area shares some similarities from the last topic not just because it's also a prison but because it starts out with a long descent in an elevator a very nice and lovely descent that will leave you feeling peaceful as if nothing bad could ever happen amnesia is one of the scariest games I've ever played and one of the few games that scared me so much that I had a hard time pressing forward at many points during my first playthrough most of the early sections simply build up tension this plenty of frightening set-piece is an incredibly disturbing atmosphere but not too many things that can actually reach out and kill you that is until you get to the prison if you can't already tell from the footage of this video the dungeons are very dark there's plenty of torches you can light but while they will help you see and help you keep as much of your sanity as possible they're also a double-edged sword because of the mini grunts that patrol the area the more torches lit the easier it is for them to see you the easier it is for them to see you the more likely it is for you to be trapped and have dead happen to you and that brings up one of the other scary things about the prison all of the dead ends not only is there a lot of danger there's very few places to run if / when you get spotted and it only gets creepier when the realization of exactly what this prison was used for slowly starts to sink it of course you'll probably be too busy to think much about that considering you'll be running away from these guys hiding behind dead pigs holding a plate for some reason I don't even know why I picked this thing up in the first place so just gonna set it down here whoops ah depth perception my worst enemy you know except for that guy I guess I've talked about this before but aliens have always scared me since I was a kid so it's probably not a huge surprise that my number one scariest area in video games is Sevastopol station from alien isolation I'm normally more afraid of the classic gray alien with big heads eyes and a uniform look but I can't think of too many examples of that in video games at least not ones that are actually scary but other than the greys the aliens that scare me the most are definitely the Xenomorphs from the Alien franchise well there are some good alien games out there you'd be hard-pressed to find one that matches the uneasy agonizing as well as occasionally intense fear that the movies depict as well as alien isolation the biggest contributing factor to this is the actual alien the whole game you feel as if you're being hunted because well you are very few games have caused me to feel this much dread for such a long period of time the alien is out there you can't always see it but you can hear it and when you do see it you'll really wish that you weren't seeing it oh no no no no no no no no no no thank you but getting back to the actual area of sevastopol well you don't always get a whole lot of very types of settings the actual station obviously had a lot of effort put into it and a lot of scenes feel as if they came straight out of the movies it's the ideal setting to be spooked and haunted by a perfectly evolved killing machine Sevastopol station enjoy your stay but I guess it is kind of cheating to pick what is basically the entirety of alien isolation as one area so I'll narrow it down to just the nest one of the first things you see when you walk into the nest is a guy hung on the wall with a giant hole on his chest so you know that everything's gonna be fine and you don't need to worry about anything except for maybe this now I'm not an expert on beeps but I'm pretty sure those beeps are not good beeps to be beeping so you should probably get them out of there as fast as you can yes that's right it's at this point that you realize there's not just one alien there's a lot of them and they are all around you and could be basically anywhere and everywhere you turn so yeah if you will excuse me I think I found my new home right here in this box I'm not leaving I'm serious this episode of peanutbutter
