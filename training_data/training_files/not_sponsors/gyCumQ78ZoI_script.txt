if I had to pick one photographer to declare as my all-time favorite photographer this would be a very difficult question but there's a large chance it would be nan goldin and this is largely a personal thing I'm not declaring her as the world's greatest photographer it's just that when I go to an exhibition of hers I find out has a profound effect on me I feel so much emotion connection and understanding when looking at her work and while this is just my personal experience I'm not the only one who feels it but why is this what is it about her work that connects with me so profoundly and so deeply [Music] Nan Goldin most famous photographic projects The Ballad of sexual dependency was recently exhibited at the Tate Modern so I went down to have a look and there it takes the fall of a slideshow to music which golden describes as its original and intended format and it's when Goulding's images are shown in this slideshow format that I fill her work really comes alive I found myself sat transfixed for the full 45 minutes of his runtime as it took me through all 687 slides the pieces of documentation of the lives of her and her friends whom she refers to as her tribe it follows them through celebration and sadness love and violence life and death and in doing so highlights the struggles in their relationships between intimacy and autonomy but as I watched it something struck me lots of the shots were what many would describe as badly taken they were slightly out of focus or they broke basic rules of composition or they contain motion blur because the shutter speed just likely to slow but not only did this not matter it actually added something there was an unpolished intimacy to these shots they felt more real the camera was like an extension of my hand and I just shot all day I never moved at anything for me it was a sin to move a beer bottle out of the way because it had to be exactly what it was if all these images have been well lit in crisp focus with well-balanced composition they would have delivered a clear view of a literal representation of a scene but they would have lost their emotional resonance and their sense of spontaneity unblemished technical flawlessness would have distanced the viewer the way they were shot triggered feelings which helps bring the viewer into the subjects world in this installation imperfection added value and I think is this understanding of how abandoning a technically flawless approach can add emotion connection that makes her work stand out for me and resonate with me so deeply I came away from her slideshow feeling like I had felt her work and not just seen it every time a new camera is released these days we're bombarded with all the latest and greatest technological advances designed to help us achieve that perfect picture we get excited about features like I focus tracking more intelligent exposure compensation sharper lenses now I don't think anyone could argue that these things aren't wanted for professional fashion photographers for sports photographers product photographers these are all features that help enormous Lee to get that perfect exposure but with so much emphasis on these elements in the photographic community it's easy to fall into contemporary Western cultures pervasive obsession with perfection ideal proportions symmetry sharp focus perfectly level angles balance perfect exposure and there's nothing inherently wrong with these ideals as a philosophy for creating imagery but it's important to understand that is not the only value system out there why be subby is a philosophy that originated in ancient japan and it's a worldview centered around the acceptance of transience and the purity of imperfection it seeks to find authenticity by acknowledging three simple truths one nothing is permanent two nothing is finished and three nothing is perfect and these three truths combine to form a belief that imperfection creates individuality and individuality adds value I see a fair bit of discourse promoting the notion that not getting a technically perfect image doesn't really matter that much if you've caused a good moment and this is certainly true but as I read more about the worldview of wabi-sabi I started to realize that this was something different it wasn't so much about not worrying about getting a technically flawless shot as actually seeking out imperfection in order to add something the flawless shot wouldn't communicate on its own I started seeing instances where imperfection in photography was adding an emotional narrative or challenging the way we saw things I started to take note of the work of several photographers Todd Hyde Oh takes photographs of landscapes through the misty windows of his car during winter the condensation blurs the bleak and windswept landscape outside creating a paint'll image recognition of a JMW Turner painting in turn was a pioneer of painting who's been cited as a major influence for the subsequent Impressionists movement and his later work he used translucent oils to create canvases of emotive light and shimmering color objects became barely recognizable the emphasis of work shifts from providing the viewer with a literal visual representation of a place to communicating an evocative feeling and this is what I get from hide a series of winter landscapes shot through his car window they evoke a sense of familiarity with me but it's not a familiarity with the location is not that literal it's a familiarity of feeling a mood the emphasis has moved from what a place looks like to how a situation feels in london-based photographer beau Postma's series in praise of shadows Costner deliberately under exposes a series of softly focused photographs to create a collection of images there are less a representation of clear detail a more of a device to trigger a visual and visceral sense of atmosphere when I look at these images I again feel a sense of familiarity but this familiarity is with a cold sense of isolation and trepidation a sense of the unknown and while these examples use imperfect images to drive atmosphere and emotion Japanese photographer and architect hero Xu Sugimoto uses imperfect photography in a very different way he photographs famous architecture with a large format camera but with no stops on the bellows rail he pushes the focus out to twice infinity creating a series of blurred abstractions he said I discovered the superlative architecture survives the onslaught of blurred photography thus I began the erosion testing architecture for durability completely melting away many of the buildings in the and there is not a case of an emotional narrative but nonetheless another example of how breaking photographic convention can have a clear purpose it's important to remember that photography is not reality it's an interpretation of reality and a lot of the values and techniques were used to seeing and not any more representative of reality than any other approaches human beings don't see frozen moments in time with sharp focus we don't see lens bokeh we don't see the long light trails of passing cars or the serenely smooth water that comes from long exposures these are all learned photographic conventions I'm not saying that we should have Bandhan these rules or aesthetic principles I encourage you to practice and aspire to them in your photographic work but don't let your creative thinking be constrained by them experiment with imperfection every now and then try abandoning traditional rules of exposure and Composition in favor of being led by your gut feelings it's not always about what an image looks like as much as how an image makes you feel so what do you think do you often break photographic convention in order to bring emotional resonance into your work do you know photographers who use this technique for other purposes do you disagree with everything I said let me know in the comments we'll have a bit of a discussion and thank you very much to everyone who buys my lighting presets I've got a new pack coming out soon a Kodachrome pack a lot of people have been asking for that take me quite a while to develop because it was quite difficult but with the aid of profiles that you can now do in lightroom I've managed to get a pack together that I'm quite happy with so watch this space for that and thank you very much to everyone who supports me on patreon because you helped fund this channel and keep me making videos and also thank you to below this video and check it out I'll see you next time and I just want to say that if you have got to this bit of the video it means you've watched right to the end so thank you very much for doing that because that helps the YouTube algorithm and yeah you're my favorite ones [Music]
