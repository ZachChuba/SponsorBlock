so there's a hush that falls over the crowd as the champion steps into the ring to duel you for the hand of the princess how do you proceed with this fight sir yeah all right so I gave this some thought I was up all night last night what I want to do is like pretend that I don't really know what I'm doing here and then I'm kind of buffoonish not as strong as I am you know so when they throws a punch at me or makes a strike at me I'm gonna like try to block but but be real bad at it you know and maybe maybe that'll leave them open for something and I can just like mmm really take them out all right yeah that's good what are you gonna roll oh that would be strength deception you know strength instead of trying to trick them you know I mean to me that could be a way because you still wanting to try to do the thing it seems to me like that's more of a charisma athletics chick trying to throw off I didn't take you that let expression see come on I got the strength I got the deception like I'm really trying to trying to trick him you know and at the same time trying to show the princess that I'm tough and strong yeah oh okay well that is a pretty strong deception then at least it would be yeah yeah yeah okay so that's it's a good subject you know that's that's a really good topic I wonder if we should do a video on this sometime well why do it then when we can do it now yeah alternate skills alternate skill proficiencies a web DM subscribe and go and ring that bell to get those notifications the web DM free interview loop Gygax about all things deep alright Jim since Travis won't let me use my dexterity to do intros he give me the tools to combat him in an argument so let's talk about using different skills for a different ability checks yeah one of the coolest things about the the way that fifth edition handles skills is the interchangeability between skill proficiencies and abilities and so could cause some confusion though right because in the PHP it's presented as a variant you know like you might be allowed to do this kind of thing whereas in the DM G it's sort of like sometimes a player will suggest a different proficiency for their ability yeah yeah you can see how at least the way the rules are written it might cause some confusion I guess in terms of what should you know what you should do how the DM should adjudicate an action something like that but I find that the mixing up skill you know skill proficiencies and ability checks it's one of those things that you know I always add something to a moment it really highlights what's unique about that one situation and okay some like characters that have sort of skill proficiencies that don't get used a lot maybe it's an opportunity for them to use those and sort of highlight that portion of their character or that facet of them or it's something where it's like alright well it's gonna be this is a little different you're not just gonna make a regular dexterity check like you would the situation calls for something a bit different like you said it offers a lot of variability and offers uniqueness to players so even though they might be good like two different players might be good at the same proficiency they come in two different ways you know one person gives us their mind where the other person uses their body more for certain things I really like it and I to me it's not a variant it's just how do you you know how do you really want to handle this sometimes when it's brought up it's like well you know that's usually associated with disability and it's like what does it mean can't be used if you like here the player out maybe they have a good pitch you know so I just think that you know I hope everybody comes away from this video like with the freedom to to to know that like hey sometimes you might make a constitution acrobatics check if you're doing something that's acrobatic overall law if you're walking a tightrope across you know hundreds and hundreds of yards well that's gonna it's gonna wear on you a little bit you gotta make sure you keep that up right yeah and I find like thinking of situations like that is how you can arrive at different combinations like if you don't if you don't start from mechanics if you start from what's happening in the game world and then seek an answer in the rules for that situation instead of the other way around where you're like I'm gonna use a mechanic and then force it into this you know the game situation if you start from the fiction first then a lot of these combinations start becoming very natural and like oh yeah this really should be a different ability and skill combination not to mention that there's just some weird combos with the base skills and abilities to begin with you mean the fact that all clerics have religion or usually should have yeah yeah or medicine is wisdom that's another one that crops up for being medicine being wisdom like I think it says something about the world but it's also like why wouldn't it be intelligence in this case medicine I really feel that this is the right answer didn't you study for years yeah but then oh no but I feel so strength Jim what is that what does a strength stealth check look like to you strengths dose check is one of those where it's a very particular type of situation I am above you you you know like wedged myself in somewhere and you don't see me right I'm in a hallway I'm trying to hang from something you know it's not a matter of like being nimble or quiet so much as it is keeping the position of unseen that you have in a precarious perch yeah you know you're trying to hold on to a tree limb perched up in a tree somewhere and it's less about like you know whether you're not here you're balanced or whether you're you know you're nimble in that situation it's like do you fall out you know because you just can't hang on that long the one I was really thinking of those like you're hanging above the ceiling you know pressing your limbs against the sides of a wall and you know your enemies walking beneath you and when do you drop down and strike you're sneaking up and you're doing the or on the edge of like a cliff or something and you're edging along while people are walking just above you I could see how you could argue for strength or Constitution if you're having to do it for a really long time maybe it's more about your your endurance you know maybe you're just really strong so hey you can just hang on because of your strength yeah yeah but that's again that's again different ways to kind of arrive at the same conclusion another one I think that is used a lot is the the strength intimidate yo somebody back there is just flexing right just flexing yeah show us how much you're gonna hurt us if we don't do what you want but there's a lot of different ways intimidate can be used and I find it is like just limiting it to charisma is is unfortunate but yeah strength intimidate is is kind of a classic one especially because like half works or something get this proficiency and we don't often think of half works it's being very charismatic thankfully there's not a lot of ability score penalties in fifth edition but it does it creates sort of an incongruously really that guy whereas you know it's like oh yeah that guy cuz he's tough and looks like he's gonna break the [ __ ] out your bones you know that's the part comes up and just yeah that moment exactly especially if there's like a demonstration of it or a display of it you know it's not just an empty threat it's it's know it's real you're gonna get messed up another one I'm thinking of is like animal handling and strength breaking an amount or or even just like maintaining control of a very willful and strong mount you know where it's like all right you've got to wrestle this thing to do what you want it to do well yeah when you're out there adventuring in your mule or your donkey pulling your cart gets a seasoned snake or something you know you might have the the fighter of the bar pair and go over there and do an animal handling chick where you just hold them still and hold them like calm until they can just call the hell down oh yeah yeah or you've jumped on the back of some Griffon or wyvern or something and the idea is that if you can hang on long enough if you can just break them you know just get them to like have a tire on yeah yes just to accept that you're there and that's something else that that's useful for this especially something like animal handling how often has that been rolled in anybody's game there are moments where the kind of characters who would be in those situations are not the sort of characters who might have the ability scores to back that up or situations where you want to use it that's gonna come up more often if you're willing to use different ability scores with it how would you do a strength survival check I might replace that for athletics for like overcoming an obstacle of some kind free like a natural hazard something like anywhere where you are familiarity with the wilderness and how to traverse it and how to overcome its obstacles would be appropriate I think that's where you would use it so you know maybe it's like crossing a river like I like crossing a Swift River dealing with like really rocky terrain or rough terrain that doesn't necessarily require you to climb a lot but does require you to have some kind of strength to just navigate the place because it's difficult right in the same for instance this one like a failure for that might might be like a level of an exhaustion or something yeah where it's just like yeah you just wore yourself out climb it all over these rocks and performance strength shrinks performance is one of those that I also can imagine a situation where I want to put on you want to put on a display of strength to impress someone to convey some sort of you know message or something like that then I think strength performance is appropriate and I'm specifically thinking in the real world of those people who'd come into your high school rip phone books in half tell you not to do drugs and in the laughs you know there you're supposed to be impressed by their feats of strength and and by the in you know suitably impressed therefore you're more likely to listen to what they have to say and that's kind of one of those moments where that combination I can see a player going like alright hear me out you know I want to do this I want to impress someone with a feat of strength I want to like display that my prowess my you know my virility you know potency is is enough to you know convince them maybe it's like now that I'm talking through it a strength persuasion check might also be appropriate here especially if you're dealing with you know NPCs or creatures in your world that are less like moved by argument and more moved by display you know dude show me don't tell me all they're concerned about is their own well-being and you show them exactly how much you can twist their well-being into pieces yes again it's kind of a fine line between intimidate and persuasion but I'm gonna persuade you that going along with this is going to be the best course of action in the long run I can also see strength performance used for situations where like skill with weapons and like precision with weapons and and showing you know how you handle them but also in a performative sense right like this isn't this is sort of like a formalized you know ritual combat or something like that it might be appropriate in this case you say like all right let's see this is not real combat this is not about like you doing whatever it takes to win this is about showing how precise and how much you quite conform to this idealized version of what combat looks like for this particular people like a strength strength performance might be appropriate in that situation sounds like the joust something like that yeah or Gallagher you know water metal is never stands Gallagher so that's one thing our viewers are gonna recognize is that like the physical type abilities they can all sort of there's a way to justify it changing them with a lot of the skills they're associated with vice versa with the more mental abilities also the phone book ripping guys could also be considered it's a good argument for strength religion because they're you they're usually you know pushing the pushing a god agenda so Piney Woods of East Texas we grew up in yes so let's move on to the skill that already has it all but let's see if we build it a little bit more which is dexterity excuse me the abyss Terry yeah dexterity I mean the skills associated with it are pretty accurate I mean you can still make an argument for some other ones yeah like I would say if you're making a really insane jump then not to backtrack but strength acrobatics to me dexterity athletics is one that can that should be used all the time right in fact I to me a grapple check should be opposed athletics checks it's just the recipient of the grapple can use strength or decks especially given the way that the two skill proficiencies are described in the players like you know for instance it lists squeezing through or forcing your way through tight spaces as a strength check and I feel like that that's more appropriate for escaping a grapple than being able to tumble which is what acrobatics represents and I get why that there's a game mechanic reason for it but it also really gets under my skin the dexterity has two horn its way and on everything that strength does as and then some you know it's like geez stay in your lane dexterity like for real yeah there should be some area where strength characters have an advantage over Dex characters right where it's just like yeah don't let that guy get his hands on you yes I do it I do agree but dexterity checks again for like animal handling it's neat to me that's that's a good one especially when you're dealing with tame and a cope or something you need to be pretty dexterous you want to be a you know a Cobra whatever they're called Wrangler or pathologist yeah controlling your mount through an obstacle course could be dexterity animal handling where your reflexes and how well you can control your mount how quickly you can how in tune you are with it seems to be a real case where like that's gonna be really good really appropriate for that and I can see imagine all sorts of things where that's either it's a contest or a race or something or you're trying to outrun an enemy or something like dodge their attacks while you just like get through get through this cloud of enemies dodging around them with your mount to me a dexterity animal handling is appropriate for for those types of situations similar with Dex survival riot like in the same way that strength survival can represent sort of your physical abilities combined with your knowledge of how to traverse terrain and what the wilderness is like dexterity survival can be similar like I don't escape income absolutely like quicksand or drowning or a lot of different ways in which all right this isn't so much about how good I am at moving my body it's a combination of that plus the knowledge that I have represented by survival so while that one might be a bit more narrow than say strength survival I can't see it there is there some cases where it might be appropriate going back to like say crossing a river maybe it's not about the speed of it but you know the riverbed is very slick so it's about not falling over and understanding that so you're looking for the proper place to put your foot that's the that's the survival part that's the knowledge and then the actual execution so you don't fall and slip twist your ankle whatever yeah you know I know dexterity and performance are usually put together but I can't help but think of aliens with a knife thing yeah and kids don't try this if you watch oh but that is I have put a knife through someone's finger yeah I cut myself once or twice a lie that's a way of doing like a dexterity you know performance a little bit different Dex performance acrobatic stunts right like I know there's an acrobatic skill but the point of performance is to entertain whereas acrobatics is more like you know the actual execution of a thing the dexterity + performance is the combination of like I have physical skill with tumbling basically but I can do it in such a way that it entertains others pratfalls physical comedy things like that I can see being dexterity plus performance now the kind of game where that's appropriate in like in a matte like royalty for instance or or something like that getting a bunch of Pixies to laugh at you that might be the way you can do that as opposed to them putting you to sleep for a thousand years and I mean yeah if you can get a good pratfall in that also kind of bleeds in the Constitution you can fall that's a good point though because it's like once you accept that these ability scores and skill proficiencies aren't necessarily tied to each other like absolutely the lines really start to get fuzzy Dex athletics but you could easily go strengths acrobatics right can I make this jump and land on my feet and similarly Constitution performance could be do you impress someone with your feats of endurance are you like those Street magicians who can like I don't know I'm gonna live inside this ice cube for a month or you know it's just suspend myself by hooks lay on a bed of nails and have someone run across me you know yeah yeah walk across hot coals there's all kinds of things where your toughness your inability to endure pain is an advantage especially with constitution because it doesn't otherwise have any skill proficiencies associated with it make some love you got to give it some love finding ways to use it it can be really interesting because it doesn't have anything normally associated with it it's an opportunity for the player to show something like I said different about themselves of course athletics constitutions I was literally about to go to Khan athletics which is to me this is that or performance that's what wrestlers do right like you're doing a choreographed thing but they still have to be able to like take hits and do it right and do it well yeah I mean I could still get hurt there still chunking each other around a [ __ ] ring just because it has a spring below it and like a small mat underneath it they still get to hurt quite a bit I mean apart from cutting themselves pawn purposes and things like that but that is a good like Constitution deception might be something where you like don't break kayfabe keep up the illusion of what this is I can really really see something like that being used for like oh we're gonna pretend like we're fighting but we want to make it look real you know who has to be yeah this needs a little real light level cut over the I believe like a stuck hog Oh constitution's stealth was another one I was thinking of this would be like a sniper right someone that has to like be very slow and deliberate and like you know you could argue maybe strength for that but I think constitutions more appropriate here because it's about how long you can stay in one position like how long can you just sit here lay here without moving without giving yourself away and it's not like strength to sort of like I'm pinning myself against the ceiling or hanging from a Ledge or something but it's like can you post up in this brush for a day without ever giving yourself away that's a constitution stealth check to me that's that's a perfect example of it like say oh you're honest just on a stakeout like you're just watching a building for yes well yeah I've been here for three days now water jars are on the right don't touch the dough just you know similarly like survival is one of those where cons survival is like how long can you go without food and water how long can you really to represent you're rationing maybe of what you do yeah exactly and I know that there's some things for that in in The Player's Handbook like how much do you need to eat how much do you need to drink and it seems like it's one of those rules were there some cons survival check you're missing this would be a great opportunity to see how far you can push yourself in terms of depriving your body of what it needs with the outliner background they just took care of that's how they took care of that's fine Constitution intimidate could be another one of those where it's like don't don't mess with this guy you know these are crazy you know and then it's someone over there shoving great big daggers through their skin or like burning themselves anything where it's like enduring pain walking on hot coals walking on hot coals self-immolation you know severing your own limbs you can walk away from that yeah where anything where your physical endurance your your ability to impress or like coerce someone through just how tough you are and so it might be one of those or it's like you're gonna face off with some you know humanoids or something like that and you know you're not gonna get through with or your you know your face of the party just like botched it like just a face in the dirt then it could just be like alright well that's one thing words didn't persuade you we got this cow and she's tough right like do not mess with her and then you know let's make a roll to see how well that is conveyed yeah and she she puts her cigar out on her tongue and that's your yeah I'm gonna go with one that might seem weird but I'm gonna say Constitution plus any intelligence roll their intelligence related skill proficiency and this someone who has done a ton of research your ability to just sit and read your ability to stay focused on instead stay awake stay sharp it's not so much a mental thing at that point because you've passed beyond the can I put together clever ideas and synthesize this information is just can I get through this can I keep myself from falling asleep from you know just becoming so numb that no matter what I read I'm not gonna take in any of that information the connection between mind and body is one of those things where like we like to think of them as two separate things and of course the stats of D and D break them down and that I think in the real world there's a lot more ambiguity between mind and body and I think this is one of those areas where you can justify like this is it so much about my analytical ability the ability to remember or you know synthesize information it's just about how long I can keep up something that's kind of physically uncomfortable you know and sitting in a chair and reading for days on end eventually gets old ears on you how would you do a Kong sleight-of-hand [Laughter] think of different skills that are like trying to smuggle something in a body cavity that's the the most I don't know YouTube appropriate way I think I can probably describe that no but that that tracks that tracks Wow well that's right give yourself just a minute to let that sink in no I don't want to I don't have the Constitution for it how about we move on to intelligence - and you were saying this before this might be the most like this is the dexterity of skill proficiencies I really think so yeah I do think so yeah I I think that there's a case for any of the skill proficiencies being justified for intelligence because intelligence stealth where is the best place in this room to hide something where is the place that is going to be and not just like where is it in terms of like my perception of the room because that may be more wisdom stealth given what I know about hiding about concealing things where is the best place here it's less about like a feel for it and more you're relying on your you know what you know about it your intelligence how well you think about it your it's the architecture of the building and the time of day and the angles from the light coming through the windows like actually processing all that like Sherlock Holmes like I said almost nearly any of the skills being appropriate for intelligence if only because intelligence plus another proficiency represents what you know about that proficiency you know not just like how to apply it which would be more of the you know standard ability that that applies to that skill but like what can you recall about this who do you know that that was also good at this is there any lore you can recall about this particular skill oh yeah this person was known for their stealth were known for their feats of strength those are sorts of things where it might not be obvious in the beginning but there's a way that you can use that information to say impress NPCs recall lore about something identify something about a monster it really is a matter of in this case the DM relaxing a bit and letting the player justify why this might be intelligence as opposed to another ability and given how how far intelligence has fallen in fifth edition in terms of its usefulness in terms of how many classes you know use it and and whether or not if you're not a wizard or an artificer you care at all about intelligence I think it's appropriate to say like yeah well we're gonna at least entertain the idea you I'll hear your argument for why intelligence should be used with this animal handling is another one of those you know what do you know about these kinds of animals you really shouldn't feed you know a horse that thing or Griffin's really don't that's not good for them this is what you should offer and like your ability to understand how an animal behaves or how a particular creature will behave because of your experience because what you learned about it and then the application of that knowledge is I think just a real no natural pairing for the two most of the skills associated with wisdom could probably be applied that way medicine insight whether it's a matter of your perception of your surroundings and how in tune you are with them or whether you're taking a critical analytical approach to it would determine whether it's intelligence or wisdom yeah definitely medicine I mean you know can't really feel your way through a lot of Medicine you should really know the difference I like the idea of wisdom medicine because of what it does say about the world which is like medicine is intuitive it's about how in touch you are with the natural rhythms of the world but that's not appropriate for every game and there are games where it's like no I studied Anatomy and I'm you know I'm skilled with you know with various medicines and producing them maybe you come to couples with like an herbal ISM kit proficiency or an alchemist kit proficiency something like that but moving away I think from from the wisdom ones intelligence deception you know how clever are you can you construct a lie that it doesn't matter how well you deliver it it's just you've constructed such a an elaborate deception that it doesn't matter how you deliver it the person's gonna be like wait a minute you're right you know I can get I can't deny what it is the gipset intelligence intimidate is one of those where you can just like well you know let's just lay all this out this is a classic Pruitt move viewers to be like to get frustrated at MPC and be like alright MPC here are the facts you know here's what's going on here's what you have to face and then like using that approach you didn't know that much I know I usually like yes I did know that I've never really thought about doing intelligence intimidate you know yeah and the same for like performance or non-performance persuasion you know depending on your goal just laying out the facts and working through the logical steps of what it is you know intelligence Intimidator intelligence persuasion could be could be used so yeah it's also the it's also the mob boss the mob way of doing things like we all know that you live at 228 Beeker Street and that your wife goes to work every morning at the same time at the floral shop we'd like her to get to work tomorrow morning if you know what I'm saying like you know like finding the facts out about someone and knowing the routine is much more intimidating to me than a guy cracking their knuckles like I can take a beating now but you know if you know things that I can't control yeah to me intelligence performance is the teaching skill that's the oh that's the skill you use when you need to lecture you need to teach when you need to present information to someone in a way that doesn't bore them to tears and therefore they stop listening to you this is this where you combine your you know your presentation ability your ability to speak to or eight etc along with what you know and it's the coupling of those two things that that really drives the use of that skill for again like a lot of these the kinds of games where this would work the sorts of situations less important than the fact that it's possible you know if you're a player or a DM that wants to try some of these weird oneself then it's up to you to engineer situations where it is then useful but possibilities are literally well not literally because there's a finite amount of abilities and skill proficiencies mini infinite they abound yeah right all right so let's move on to wisdom the other mental stat that's like yes/no to me there's a lot of like what why is it religion wisdom instead of intelligence like to me that's just that's really right up front and that's one of the biggest glaring examples I think there's all kinds of weird things when it comes to intelligence wisdom and then the sort of classes that are good at these skills because like yeah rogue can be better at Arcana than a wizard depending on what expertise they pick or a or you know an artificer can be better at religion than a cleric based on the sorts of proficiencies they pick like for some people that that's really weird there are sort of knowledge skills associated with every class or at least the sort of the core classes and when those things don't line up when that particular class is not particularly good at those sorts of tasks it creates this weird jarring one what do you mean I'm not the best at Arcana or the best at religion there's a lot of overlap I think between those two and allowing say religion wisdom religion seem to appropriate if you're say trying to divine the will of the gods right this is not this is less about what I know about the history of the religion and its practices and more about I saw an omen this morning a flock of birds crossed my path and made a strange shape in the sky what does that mean what is my God trying to tell me that's a wisdom knowledge in check how would you characterize a wisdom athletics check wisdom athletics is sizing up a competitor yeah to me that's that's what that is well you know your athletics is playing in there because you have you know sort of the techniques what it looks like when someone who's competent and trained in a particular athletic activity is preparing themselves for it and then the wisdom is for reading body language and to itting motivations and intent things like that now is this a strength insight role maybe but it could easily be a wisdom athletics role again there's a lot of wiggle room here in terms of what it is that we're doing and sort of the you know how your DM and player navigate these sorts of tasks but I think like wisdom athletics is appropriate for like let's take a look at the competition well is that we're about to do a chariot race all right who's the best one at this or a foot race or something like that like who here is really the you know the person to beat once you like open that up really wisdom plus any other skill can be used for that who here seems like they're the stealthiest or who here seems like they're the most persuasive the person who gets things done and sort of coordinates and gets everybody together know how many times that's come up I know I've tried to do it and it usually stumps dm's where I'm like I'd like to read this person what is it and it usually it's just like wisdom insight but it's like I don't know that insight is appropriate here because I'm not trying to gain insight into their motivations I'm trying to gain an insight into what they're good at and and what they might you know use to their advantage it sounds to me you want to be a battle master so well for one right or a mastermind rogue like those are some sweet abilities by getting them behind class features it sort of cuts off what could otherwise be something available to everybody yeah I mean anyone with skill can Intuit from someone what their skill level is yeah yeah right and it's so use it so this is a good thing you brought that up because you can use those class features as a baseline like to me the class features aren't they always work they they tell you a bunch of information and so like from there you start deep you either decrease the amount of information or you you know make it uncertain but they're like the upper limit of what's possible and so in order to like avoid stepping on Battlemaster you know their toes maybe it's like alright well you got to make you know it was a particularly high DC check to get all this information or a moderate DC check to just get one of these pieces of information whereas the battle master should they just know it their experience their training everything they just know this they don't have to roll yeah I know your hit points I know your AC I know all that stuff let's rounded out with with charisma Chris was one of those things that whatever you do you do it with a flair right yes like I think of like Muhammad Ali fighting like getting ready to fight like he's doing these things he's doing intimidate checks charismatic label to get in the head of his opponents and even in the ring like he would he would play out certain things like he would just sit there and let him hit him push him off and then that's one way you can do it whether you want to consider that a charisma athletics check or like a constitution performance check or you know I mean like the Constitution deception yeah there's again lots of different ways you can pro it I think that charisma plus the The Associated skill proficiency is appropriate because your charisma is just represents your natural talent and and sort of whatever the ability you have for deception persuasion etc whereas the skill proficiency represents this specialized knowledge so in the case you're mentioning of like trying to go to it into overexerting themselves while you just turtle up and conserve your strength for a knockout blow to me that is say charisma athletics because using what you know about this particular physical activity to fuel your deception all right and that is to me that's the crux of it right there and the same for like say acrobatics you know if it's something where you're maybe you're in a tumble contest with somebody you're trying to impress the the king of all to backseat of course we have to navigate the the yarn ball obstacle course the you know the walking on a high shelf and knock as much off as you can you know those the towering toast that you have to climb the towering post oh man the competition looks really tough alright well I'm gonna make them think I'm a bumbling idiot so maybe they won't go as hard and then when they slip up I'm on it I'm gonna I'm gonna really just give it my all so the one that I use a lot is charisma investigation it's about talking to people it's about convincing them to give you information so that's charisma it's about following the right leads asking the right questions that kind of thing so people skills plus the specialized knowledge of getting the exact information you're looking for gather information and I missed that skill you know it's a it was a handy way of sort of abstracting sort of like alright I'm gonna spend two hours trying to gather some rumors all right make it gather info check you know this is how oh you know oh yeah also the charisma insight check when you want to try to use your wiles to figure out what what they're thinking without maybe let them know to keep them off guard and sure way of kind of yeah pillow talk you're trying to flirt your way into I'm knowing some info right as opposed to just straight wits right right right yeah especially if it's like you're not trying to Intuit their their motives or what it is they're doing through like body language and subtle tells you're trying to intuit it through a conversation where you are sort of like all right I'm gonna they said something but they didn't know what they revealed to me yeah you're trying to get him to say passport if it's the sneakers yes this is also has a flip side because you could easily justify that as say wisdom deception right yeah I could say yeah I'm trying to get information from them surreptitiously without them knowing it by reading them by asking leading questions pull one over on them without them knowing it and to me this is this is why these alternate ability scores skill combos relies so much on how the player describes their approach to the task that they want to do that's where the the mix-and-match of these comes from and and this is also why I recommend for players to think about what your character is doing and imagine it as a real thing and not a game construct and so saying things like all right well I'm here's what I intend to do here's how I do it those are the two things that are really important for finding alternate ability score and and skill proficiency combos is like conveying to the dungeon master this is this is how I do this and this is what I want to get out of it and once you've given that information to the DM which is you know not always done you know sometimes it is but you know it's more just the approach of it then then what the intent is you're giving the DM the information they need to then go all right well that's this kind of check yeah it doesn't make sense that this is charisma persuasion it does make sense this is intelligence persuasion and in that sense I think that make you know making sure that you're you're having that conversation about what's going on in the game world opens the door for these kinds of possibilities because you need DM who's willing to to be flexible about that but I think like you can show them why they would want to be flexible by describing your actions in a way that makes it obvious you're not trying to use the standard ability score proficiency combo yeah I mean DM needs to be flexible with that kind of stuff sounds like an intelligence acrobatics check to me mental gymnastics [Laughter] [Music] our Constitution deception yeah there's again lots of different ways you can I don't know good I was gonna say go ahead the wonders of doing these over the internet like Lang is fine
