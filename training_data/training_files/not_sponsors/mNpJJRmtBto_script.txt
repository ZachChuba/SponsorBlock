[Music] hello indigo children I am Pruitt and this is brother Jim and today we align our chakras trance in the mortal coil and enter the astral plane on web DM [Music] today's show is brought to you by audible.com slash web DM or text web DM to 500 500 all right Jim let's let's elevate this plainer knowledge let's talk about the astral plane yes already done our little intro we've talked about the planes you know is in general but let's let's dig in on the space beyond into the meta the metaphysical realm of the astral plane because I mean this isn't just space first off it literally is no space it's not yeah it's not just like it's not like outer space I think you can sort of look at it like that a little bit it's one of the transitive planes right and in sort of Great Wheel cosmology D&D which is you know every version of DNA changes and alters the cosmologists a little bit but in in sort of like high Planescape Ian you know cosmology the astral plane is one of two transitive planes that is that they're mostly exists as connections between the prime material and another cluster of planes in this case the outer planes and it is the realm of the purely mental yeah it is a it is a place well that's miss notice it's gonna happen a lot because it literally has no physicality to it it is a non spatial non plane according to the second edition guide to the astral plane so not to give Dave Matthews any more than their due but it is the space between I ran em off I don't know if the cosmology is like a ziploc container and the planes are all a bunch of things in there it's just kind of the thing that's in between it like not necessarily like you know like the phlogiston or anything yeah but like just those those little gaps in between where planes brush up against each other yeah yeah and to me I think like it really forces the issue of what does it mean for the outer planes to be considered a place you can go to yeah if they are connected to the Material Plane which I think we should take the fact that it's called the material plane very seriously yeah right and if belief fuels the outer planes if if belief is enough to change the reality of those places and they are connected by this purely mental realm then can we even say that it's possible to go to those places physically like maybe the the only way that you can is through the process of say death and a soul being transferred from the material to whatever mode that their God lives in and or clicking your house three times and saying there's no place like just like willing maybe you knows were willing it into existence yeah I think it raises those kind of questions I know D&E sort of side steps that by saying that the magic of the place or the magic of how you get there sort of creates a body for you and and the fact that it is a mental place with the traits of physicality is part of what makes it a fantastical location but I you know I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to any of this but I do think it is something that as diems you want to consider because D&D has had very wildly kind of vacillating approaches to how you portray these these planes that are really mental states they're their states of mind and States being not like a place you go to and yet you still want to be able to have them accessible for adventures and the like and personally I find fourth editions take on the astral seem to be the best of both worlds for this ask you about your favorite version I really like second editions you know the Planescape version and I think the second edition book the guide to the astral plane by Monte cook is it's filled with amazing ideas for just how to adventure in the location we'll go over some of those guys do I need to be on a mind-altering substance to understand it I mean might there are it's in that it's in that second edition style of mixing in universe prose with game mechanics like hey Burke you know in the dead box or something like that a dead book you know Edgar's like alright I'll highlight the game mechanic out of this paragraph okay so it's a different style of rule book but it's also like just oozes and drips and whatever grotesque metaphor you want to use flavor and and and ideas and you just sort of like reading something about how say you know the devil's inhale keep track of all the conduits that come through the astral plane immediately is just like oh my god you would have a whole bureaucracies devoted to it oh my god anyway all the different roads of how you get there you know the astral plane is this place that depending on how you present it it's a either a barren sort of location that you just pass through on the way through to other places or it is the source of you know sort of adventure itself and I think like considering what it means what does it mean for there to be a place that you can adventure in that is purely mental like what kind of changes do you need to make for the game that's worth thinking about and considering because like you were mentioning it part of the appeal of the astral plane is that it does kind of have that outerspace kind of vibe and there's a lot of things and a lot of adventures that you can have there that very strongly resemble sci-fi science fantasy type space adventures and if you're not looking for a full-on say spell jammer campaign or something like that then a quick jaunt to the Astroland a you know riding around on an astral drummond or a skiff for something and fighting geeky on a dead god asteroid can be a fun one shot or something yeah I'm besides in the astral plane no one can hear you dream god yeah they all can cuz it's the whole point yeah it's a deep one today Julius I'm in a mood yeah but can you answer the question though alright let's try what is it what is it I think and this is this is taken from the second edition a book that the the interpretation I like the best is it's the backstage to reality yes that's a good one I really like that that that it implies a kind of intelligent design to the cosmos to the Great Wheel which I suppose literally is true because it's the product of real actual human beings imaginations whatever that's the real question they three of their kook ISM this hora for planes gave you a and so it's like it's it's a place where for instance the rules support you getting out faster and easier than you can finding locations within it it's a place that you're supposed to fly over to pass through it there's not really anything there it's the silver void or something like that and the interpretation of it being kind of the the backstage to reality I really like because it number one it does imply that that someone or some force or some power created this cosmos and this is the connective tissue that joins the homes of the gods with the with the domain of their mortal followers and it allows the passage of spirits from the material plane to the outer Plains the passage of prayers and spells and knowledge it allows you know servants and and the like from the gods to travel to the Material Plane it's this thing that has clearly like a higher purpose or a place that has a higher purpose that it seems just like mortals just found a way to break into it like they're not supposed to be here yeah yeah you know there's an first up there's nothing here there's no native inhabitants to the astral plane the only thing that's there is stuff that gets sucked in from the Material Plane or dead gods yeah like that's it it's the graveyard of gods and so in that sense I really I like that second edition sort approach but what kind of combine it with that astral see from fourth edition where it's like it's not just that this is the backstage of reality or like this is how you get to the homes of the gods but like this is where the homes of the gods are located you know they they are formed on these you know whatever you want to call them earth birds or no gets pockets of reality right yeah yeah and they have realms here that you can travel to and seek admittance into and say for instance hell is a planet in the astral sea and and you know it's not like a pit in some sort of vague place on the Great Wheel its you've got to fly there and it looks like a giant planet and you gotta like dig down into the core of it to get to the bottom you know as for what it is I think embracing the fact that it's this weird non place that it doesn't have time that it doesn't have space that it exists purely in your mind and that because of that it behaves a lot like how you would expect it to behave this isn't mage the Ascension where you can you know like just think of something and have it be reality it's it's a place where it's like well why does why does the sword work the way it does in a realm where everything's purely mental I was like because you expect it to yeah and it doesn't work exactly the way a sword does but it will hurt you because you expect it to know you know what a sword does and the outcome of interacting with it right you know but it's also presents unique challenges because it's just the idea of a sword which means it doesn't have mass inertia you know all of these things are lines every basically except everybody has them and everybody is Navi we're all that Jedi went after order 66 exactly they well I suppose that technically would be like a lot of force ghosts yeah like a psychic projection from the astral plane onto the Ontario yeah so they were whole show or now it's a it's very alien no gravity no physical forces no things like that but it's also very accessible because you don't need to breathe that you don't need you need to sleep because that's a mental need but if you're traveling there buy something like say astral projection then the only thing you really need to worry about is keeping your silver cords safe and really you know it's less you're fighting like a national dreadnought or gif junkie pretty safe because only a few things can sever the cord and it's totally sweet because you don't have to worry about your body getting hurt or injured or anything like that you just sort of create a mental construct for yourself that you can explore the plane in and so as a place where a Dungeon Master can set like really weird adventures that break the rules of the game and have you know different interpretations for what your stats mean and and and the kind of creatures that live there or just even weirder than some of the other things it's much more accessible than say the inner planes which it might not be habitable at all or even some of the outer planes you know just after a projection there you get your spiritual body and go have some adventures and and then come back to the real world and literally wake up from a dream yeah and maybe it's just because I got done just gone yeah just got done listening to Snow Crash my favorite book uh but it's like a magical virtual reality room right yeah you form an avatar out of pure thought and you go adventuring around as you wait back in reality yeah and even if you travel there physically right like you pass through a portal to the astral plane the plane converts your physical mass into pure mental into a pure mental construct and exactly right you know but you'd have to be careful there because you're not traveling via an astral projection yeah if you if you die there you die you're yeah you're actually putting yourself in harm's way yeah maybe needlessly maybe needlessly yeah certainly and so in second edition basically you replaced anything that your strengths the score gave you with intelligence that it that counts for combat your intelligence is how you base your movement it really governs almost everything you make intelligence checks to perform complicated maneuvers to stop whenever you want to stop because one of the other qualities of the plain is that because you move at the speed of thought you can move very fast and yet visibility is very limited they recommend about I think like 200 yards or something like that but I might even cut it down even more just to sort of simulate the fact that there's nothing out there you know you have to get within proximity to something to kind of see it and perceive it and it makes things like you know at those who are used to the astral likes a gift Yankee extra dangerous because they know that they can say do hit and run attacks and draw part members of a party away so they get out of visual distance of the rest of their companions and yet you know the gif y'all get kind of used to that and can divide and conquer a foe more easily it's a weird place but I think it's a bit more accessible maybe than DMS first give it thought because it doesn't have a physical Nestico there and and it's relatively easy to justify like a ritualized version of a ninth level spell that lets you have that or like yeah go find a Blue Lotus and chew its flowers until you know until you fall into a deep sleep and from there you will enter the realm of dreams or something like that whatever you want to call it oh well I mean what you're describing is basically like Black Panther sure yeah it's the you know a purple flower and you wake up in the frickin very spirit world something whatever it is yeah but yeah I love that so let's yeah let's talk about some different methods conduits portals yes like that I like to think of that if you were really good at lucid dreaming you could probably wake up in the astral plane and actually retain your mental form for at least a bit yeah just to kind of look around yeah might overwhelm you and you wake up but still yeah like a very very low-grade astral projection sure yeah I could certainly see that and I think that like connecting it with dreams is also really interesting because like otherwise Dini doesn't have a plane or place of Dreams and yet there's this there are several spells that kind of interact with it and it's like classic fantasy dream dream prophecies or premonitions that coming yeah where's Cooper Gooding where's he coming from exactly yeah it's treating it as this otherworldly place a realm of magic of Dreams it's fun and like offering mundane ways of getting there I think is also really interesting because then it is a more accessible place you know it's like yeah I remember this place I was here in my dreams you know all right well we've got to go like find that place now where you've been going every night in your mind like we've been we're gonna have to join you and like you know you're gonna be asleep and we're gonna like inception our way and our inception like you're gonna go right and slip through a color bowl so yeah like just getting around the place I say is think about it in terms of this is a mental place where you think that you know I'm thinking about moving in this direction that's all it takes takes no effort to move and so everyone in there moves very fluidly very gracefully in in that sense it's it's it's something different than maybe the characters have perceived before yeah it's gonna be sound very weird but I'm imagining new everybody moving like they're doing Tai Chi yes I took that one of the things they tell you it's like the whole point of Tai Chi is the it's the internal the mental side it's not the physical so when you're doing 24 or whatever the whole idea is you're moving your arms with your mind not your muscles and it sounds like well that's just dumb but like maybe you think about it for a hot second but move everything with your mind is the whole point of you're not putting forth effort yeah the the effort of moving your arms with your muscles is not what you're doing it's the mental connection to the movement and trust me once you actually do it enough and start meditating you actually go oh I get what you mean yeah and it's it's very hard to explain sure how you move something with your mind and not your muscles but hey yeah once you like hit that zone man you start filling your frickin chakras okay I mean I can imagine that you know what are some of the things you might find just as you're walking around the astral plane you might find the psychic projections of a bunch of monks practicing their Coty's and forms and things like that and they're just it creates a resonance yeah on the plane even if they're not aware that that they've manifested there and and one of the one of the more interesting tidbits within the second edition book is but the explicitly calls out that psychics Saiyans and sionis since sion assists and the like when they do psychic battle it creates manifestations on the astral of their psychic warrior selves doing battle because it takes place in both realms simultaneously and if they go to the astral plane and engage in psychic combat then it's just bonkers because all of those subtle psychic effects have manifestations visually the use of ego whip produces a whip you know Tower of iron will yeah it's think you're gonna shields up like the Batmobile kind of fun yeah that's your pay-per-view Vince in the actual place early and you know honestly if I'm going on a jaunt to the astral then I want to bring a psychic warrior with me because they are trained in this kind of combat this is why I don't see psychic and magic stuff and dandy as separate because it's already there it's already baked into the sort of the setting assumptions so consider how it looks like when you move you think and just move you don't actually need to produce movements it takes no effort no coordination in the in a game term sense you replace you know your strength is replaced by intelligence and your dexterity is replaced by wisdom and then you reframe your Constitution to be not physical resilience and kind of hardiness and and willingness to fight but mental fortitude your ability to fight off stress and worry and things like that that is what it represents think charisma is relatively unchanged although I think if you were going to update it to more like say fifth edition mechanics you would bring in charisma and maybe have charisma replace con yeah it's your persona is your force of will engines of cell yeah info because like charisma just didn't have that sort of connotations and second edition it really was still for a dumpster the dumps a door it was you know you needed to be hard or paladin yeah just you know you want to get a discount at the store right yeah yeah yeah or maybe your Dean was using the Comal eNOS stats up stats instead or so heinous and holiness yeah so I you know it having taken on some of those traits that wisdom had I think justifies having it be be there and then you just run combat in such a way that you know it's in that description if there's movement it's a 3d environment as well so you would want to keep track of both the positions on the horizontal axis as well as vertical and you know maybe you have like a vertical tracker or you use like combat risers or something if you've got minis but just thinking about it in terms of the fact that this that action on the plane takes place in this fluid in fluid environment with effortless motion that takes place at the speed of thought that changes so much about how you run combat encounters or just go about exploring the place in second edition there had something called speed factors for initiative and these were modifiers that you that were applied to individual actions sometimes it mattered what weapon you were using what spell you were trying to cast it created a very gritty sort of detailed initiative system at the cost of sort of speed of play and in the astral sea all weapons have the same speed factor unless they're magic in which case they're faster and it sort of reinforces the fact that this is all mental you don't you know your brain doesn't need to you know send a signal anywhere it just has a thought and and it happens it's another one of those things where because there's no natural healing there's no time there's nothing like that's the aftermath of a battle on the astral plane is often a weird place wounds you know the globules of blood and like are floating through the old battlefield there's maybe slings and arrows and bolts that are flying out from it that are that don't stop no there's nothing there to stop them and as long as a thinking creature or thinking being acted upon an unthinking object it'll just keep doing what it's doing until another thinking creature acts on it yeah and so you've got you know these things which you might know that there's a battle nearby because you just occasionally you get pelted with cold bullets you know sling bullets or arrows or something they don't lose any of their force either because there's no nothing to stop their slowed down and so drifting out of sight during melee is is worried you might want to introduce something where it's like every turn we've got to roll your wisdom to stay within a certain range of everybody so that you can still see them in second edition there was an actual non weapon proficiency of Astral combat that was meant to cover things like maneuvering and sticking close together and sort of like dealing with this weird environment in combat situations the third thing to worry about is that because this is a mental realm it's also the realm of emotions and combat brings out violent emotions and trauma and the like and that attracts creatures yeah that exists on the astral plane specifically it attracts things known as astral stalkers and national searchers which are stray thoughts taken out of a beings that are given life from a thinking beings mind that then become their own things and they desperately want to get back into a mind and so they will you know they will hijack illusions that's one of the fun things though we get to talk about magic is these astral searchers can take over your illusion spells but they can also possess you and they are drawn to combat and so it's this it is kind of a dangerous place in that sense it also presents a unique place to have some action while we're touching on magic like what do you think how would you do the the astral plane is a realm of magic right magic is usually presented as a at least a mental judging by the three stats so like how would you deal with magic in a place that like this is where magic kind of originates or certainly like it's easier to do yeah well I mean when you're in the warm glow of the the weave of magic yeah just the astral plane I think is yeah right first off if you have to roll and like if there is ever a crit I mean like everybody needs to watch out like this is one of the things where it could be a bad thing right you if you make something so perfect as a spell rock you could give life to a spell if you like I'm gonna roll fire bolt I rolled a 20 yeah yeah now this little motive fire like looks around us it's flying through the air and goes maybe I don't want it maybe I want to live gaming sentience oh yeah yeah but I mean like things like that we're like when you really think about everything being so fused and magic I mean even hell maybe even your fighters if they do well enough and and think you know hard enough maybe they could even do magic on 11 oh yeah yeah and I was kind of like thinking about that because in you know the the divide between sort of classes and everything was much stronger in second you know but the more I sort of was thinking about it's like well you know how is it the fighter yeah and it just relates what you're talking I would Taichi the fighter has their mind is already trained to act and behave in this way and even though their muscles you know there's sort of physicalness it gives you is a tune to the Material Plane they still have the instincts yeah of a fighter so I might like for those classes you know yeah your strength is replaced by your intelligence but maybe you get to add your level or something some kind of compensation to recognize that yeah it's a mental construct but mentally you're still a fighter you're still a trained warrior you still you know have this capacity within you and maybe if they're not you know like a monk or a psychic warrior it takes me a while to climatized to the place but eventually it'd be like well your your reflexes are just as you're just not used to thinking about them in this term or something so yeah instead of making it in second edition I think there was even a house rule where you would flip the hit dye so like fighters got d-10 and magic users got like d4 but on the astral you flip it and so fighters have d4 and magic users have d-10 but I don't know if that was just something I did back in the day or I couldn't find it the rule looks now yeah I mean that seems like a thing that you would want to do though just because your magic user you are more mentally adept yeah at things yeah on on average on average usually up in so that this is this is where like expanding your definitions of like what are the mental stats and I really do think like Dani works nicely when you think of it in terms of there's three physical and three mental and an intelligence wisdom and charisma all as a whole represent your character's mind which is a another great sort of just thought experiment to kind of think of is what is the relationship between your character's mind and their soul you know souls exist in in dungeons dragons and and you know there's got to be something in the translation from physical to mental that involves the soul and I just you know like like thinking about those kind of things because somewhere in there is a villainous plot to to do some nefarious deed or something but getting back to magic could go off-topic there I think like one of the things that strikes me is that all the magic that deals with a physical space would be useless in the astral like extra dimensional spaces probably or nothing oh it doesn't matter and I can't remember off the top of my head which of the like if you're late if you bring a bag of holding or haversack or something into the astral if it has the same effect as it does if you put two extra dimensional in spaces inside each other or something really I don't know if it does or not I know that like if you bring an extra dimensional space inside of another one it has a possibility to rip a hole to the astral plane which is how you get things like vacuum rifts that could be potentially hazardous but way to get out there it might be a way to get out yeah I'm I now I think there was something one of them DD books or something like that happens but I don't know that sounds like a ruling that the DD that your Dungeon Master have to make and I might just because it sounds clever and any kind of cosmic collateral damage I'm in favor of so that would be things like disintegrate or you know growth or anything that like deals with probably most of the transmutation school there's really just not gonna have any power but you know the other thing to kind of consider is the lack of a ground the fact that there's sort of 360 degree movement you would want to look at individual spells and sort of see like what does it mean if I create a wall of fire here you know where is it anchor or if I'm trying to do like a web can I even create a web right you want to try to try to say well I want to anchor it to people yeah and let then be the anchors and the this this is where it's worth pointing out that dead God's break a lot of these rules of the Asheville's so you dead God might be big enough to have its own gravity or it might be big enough that it imparts the rules of reality on this pocket of the astral so that you can't have more traditional adventures in like after Ecco yeah these these you know cosmic beings of power who lie dormant in the backstage of reality just yeah they're weird you find all kinds of weird stuff in them any theater major will tell you so the other thing is that mind magic and illusion magic are more powerful on the astral mind magic in particular enchantments one like I was gonna say enchantment finally gets its do yes yeah I might rule as a DM if you cast him in chairman on the astral plane all those subsequent rounds of re rolling yeah no I really to fail that first one guess what yeah you're hooked by that entrainment you're hooked by that enchantment I'd say that in second edition it was you know you you took a penalty to your saving throw to resist certain mind magic I might impose like disadvantage like that on the saves but it's also that the the durations of these spells tend to be longer mostly though one of the things you can do if you if you do want to get past the limitations of it is to train your mind to cast spells a certain way and second issue in those were spell keys that would allow you to you know say all right well I can't disintegrate unless I do this you know with my mind and that might be like think of those is like rewards for for your spell casters and they're like not quite feats but they sort of function in the same way would take most of these things on a case-by-case basis and look at what the spell does look at what the intent of it is and if it creates something physical and probably not but if it's mental or just pure energy then you probably exist on the plane the other there's so much you know because I mean older editions like spells and items wherever they were created they were better or worse depending on how far away they were yeah so but what about magic items on the astral plane yeah what it like and can you create a magic item in the astral plane to take taking create something purely mental and then bring it in and then does go bring it into the real world my I mean that would be like the perfect weapon for a psychic warrior certainly you might have thought that they created yeah in their journey to the astral plane to seek enlightenment and then they come into the prime material and that is how they can form a blade out of their hand yeah yeah yeah it was a four-for-one like yes you absolutely can like that's bat first uh that's badass that's totally in line with the way the magic works here and and particularly the the plane itself seems to be kind of not sentient but aware of when it is converting things from physical to mental that having a place where you can forge things of pure mental energy and then bring them back with you obviously offers some interesting thoughts maybe that's real like psychic crystals and the light come from but in second edition and then the Great Wheel cosmology your weapon decreased in power the further away you were from the plane that it was forged on yeah so if you had a weapon forged on the Material Plane and you're going on to like the seventh layer of Hell or something like that well then you've got like alright it's got to go through the astral and then the Outlands and then the first and second and third and whatever many layers until eventually it's like you don't even have a magic sword anymore yeah plus ten weapons you can take to another plane and actually still be worth the [ __ ] yeah especially really I'm not sure of layers actually I might be wrong about the the layers within a plane doing it but certainly like if you had a sword or something forged on Mount Celestia and you're going to be abyss it's not gonna help you out there yeah and so having weapons forged on the astral because it touches all of these planes means that you have a weapon that's more useful in other realms that was a second engine thing I have no idea how many diems kept up with that the changes to spells priestly magic wizardly magic there was a lot a lot of things keep track of depending on what plane you were on and so having a weapon fort from the astral just lets you bypass a lot of that and similarly if I say worshiping a god that resides on the astral which there's not many because their spells don't have to travel that far to get to you their power does it so that's that's kind of one way of thinking about the magic there but okay curious like the hazards the just adventuring there in general yeah you know you you're got these dead gods right even these sort of like islands that float and sometimes they look like humanoids or something and other times they're just big chunky rocks and you know maybe they've got strange plants growing on them in defiance of the fact that there's no time orb or you know their air or air or nutrients so yeah yeah but that's sort of the nature of the fact that you're these are gods they're the corpses of them in hibernation suspended animation they if you land on one of them you might start experiencing the memories of that deity you might relive holy days or something or moments from the mythology that that that sort of like was created or came out of their actions you could end up being changed by that you know mentally it certainly um kind of like seamounts in the in the open ocean these dead gods attract what few things live in the astral plane to begin with right yeah like so you're more you're in more danger there it's where get yong-ki set up there Ashville fortresses or you know worse things that you know hang out then we found there but they're also these locations where it's like you're gonna have to go to that dead God and collect a piece of its heart or you're gonna have to go there and collect these rare herbs or minerals or you know someone is in exile on one of these places they've given up their bodily functions and now exist in a pure mental exile on a floating dead God somewhere you'll find them bring them back bring them back home and then give them a burger right away yes that's the other thing is it interesting another interesting tidbit the fact that you don't spit experience time but it catches up with you on your way back means that you're often very ravenous after spending a lot of time in the astral and so that's often a very good place to set up a restaurant because astral travelers will be hungry when they exit the portal everybody else you have at our last airbender labor towns located yeah oh good god so some other things to keep keep an eye out for our psychic winds these these could range everything from sort of like the stray thoughts that are looking for a new mind to call home or it could be a sort of like mental effects for individual PCs but it could also be everybody on the on the Material Plane is suffering like a nightmare and so this sort of it manifests on the astral planes like maybe a dark cloud or sort of like purple lightning or something and as it moves through the space where everybody else is they experience something like that maybe take psychic damage or have some sort of debilitating condition imposed on them you could have it be that it's just sort of a light breeze of psychic wind and they realize that they just start thinking thoughts that aren't theirs and it's just a bit of color that you throw in as they're thinking their way across this non-spatial place the one of the ones that I really liked our emotional tempest which will change the emotions of people that are caught in them and either like draining them completely of emotion for a number of days or like causing them to experience a particularly intense emotion or something all of those are are consequence of the traveling and adventuring in this place and if you're taking more of the fourth edition sort of view of it that this is this is already the home of the Gods not just the road to get to them then you have all kinds of things like angelic lanterns which is a fourth edition sort of like oh yeah a remnant of divine spark that's just sort of left there maybe it heals or blesses you or something - like geysers of Asheville flame which are just these sort of radiant fires that manifests throughout the place vacuum riffs where someone's punched a hole in reality to get out of here to escape and now there's like a pinprick hole leading to the material world and it's just like sucking everything into it or opposite it's from the other side and it's just like blowing trees and dirt and rocks into this place causing a ruckus and I think my favorite one from fourth edition is the time wrinkle which basically forces you to recalculate your initiative as it constantly reorders time around you and so it's it's sort of a neat thing to kind of throw a wrinkle in the the combat sequence and you know you mentioned it a few times the the the silver cord yeah yeah yeah cuz that can be that can be a big problem for you yes so if the silver cord severed your your debt you're kaput for the most part it manifests you know depending on the addition either from your abdomen or between your shoulder blades and you can about a foot of it is visible if you can see in visibility or have truesight or something then you can see silver cords and conduits and things like that which will loop back around to but it is your lifeline between your astral body and your physical self it's sort of the the conduits a miniature conduit through which your magic flows through your life force those flows through actual dreadnoughts can separate those with a gift yonke silver sword can separate so it's something you want to keep safe and you know in typical second-division fashion there's a bunch of spells that interface with it and like but you would imagine that it's a part of you so anything that protects you would also protect the silver cord you know so that's probably how I would extend it and you know unless we're dealing with like a full campaign set on the astral then I'm probably not going to like threaten that silver cord very much you know if they're supposed to be using astral projection to get around just says I don't want to the whole point of being here the whole point of using this thing is to be here to adventure it should be at jeopardy because it's element of the game world but like I'm not gonna specifically be like all right we're out to get your cords people they've taken right right good I mean like that there certainly be something like that but that's not necessarily the point and it is it's you know it's also like well what happens if you get stabbed in the heart or your brain bashed in or something like that like I think why it stands out is because you're otherwise safe from harm it's really the one way you can be permanently harmed unless you get like a debilitating madness or some sort of psychic poison or something like that then you bring it back with you yeah as you're kind of thinking about using this place one of the handier items from the second edition book was a list of travel times for how to get around this place and I think if you're sort of running these down it will show you why you know for instance why it's easier to get out than it is to find something so a color pool is from the most common feature on the plane it is a two-dimensional pool of color and the fifth edition' dmg has the chart for this as well as some rules for psychic wind they take you to different places different planes you step through them like warm gooey molasses and now you're back on the physical world that kind of thing so it takes you six plus D six hours to reach a known colour pool you entered the astral at best you're twelve hours away from a color pool and if you traveling to an unknown color pool it takes six times D four hours to get there and it only gets ramps up from there to visit a previously visited location it would take you ten times D four hours to get there and then to visit a location that you know by description only would be twenty times D six hours and then to visit a location that you just really have a rumor of or something would take you fifty times D ten hours to get there and that is moving at your fastest mental speed that would get you there there are a variety of proficiencies that they introduced that I think would make interesting ways of using your skill proficiencies in new ways on the plane and so like the ones that they introduced are things like astral kombat astral running astral navigation project thoughts I look at these more as like new things you can do with your ability scores and proficiencies so maybe if you're trained or proficient in Arcana then you're very good at say using projecting your thoughts onto another person to slow them down because that's how you prevent someone from catching up with you when you move at the speed of thought is to throw intrusive and unhelpful thoughts their way so that they have to mentally deal with them instead of concentrating on moving and so it's a skill to be able to project your thoughts outward to create kind of like a psychic screed in your opponent's mind so that you race them you just sing that a ratio song and get it stuck in their hair right yes exactly exactly so the new answer would be astral combat this is the skill of maneuvering and maintaining orientation in combat I see that as an intelligence proficiency there's actual running which is moving at increased speeds over long distances and I would throw Khan come on guys Khan needs its own skill proficiency why not give it a school running both well what about all of its other oh right no right yes astral navigation and tracking I think wisdom maps on to this perfectly and this is like how to follow someone say emotional signature through the realm to find them again project thoughts we mentioned as being one and then the last would be sense emotion like you you you know are you able to like read people more you know this would be like a use of an intuition or wisdom something like that in my opinion those are really kind of all you would need to structure an adventure around there how you move around that kind of thing in terms of what's there not much get yonke and pretty much anything capable of traveling through inter planar distances is you'll probably find there there's not really a lot of like native things other than those astral searchers that are stray thoughts and I treat those like ghosts or something like that you know that's probably how I treat those so this was one of those videos where as like you know what in the world do you do yeah like it's it's not a place that I you know it's place that I tend overlooked and and or don't really like interface with or include as game elements but looking at doing some investigation into a like man you could have so much fun just like sailing the astral sea and and and traversing dead God dungeons yes you know everything like that it also is like it's a good baseline to like come up with your own sort of cosmology floors so for me like land between two rivers I it's the astral plane PLA I am and it's it is a it's sort of a grassy start you know you know flat expanse of sort of pale grass and a starry sky above and it's where culture right yeah it's where yeah exactly right and it's the place where especially for those that in the setting that are from like the steppe or something like that it's the place where you go to ride a turtle shiny in chrome you know yeah that's where you do that and then at the same time there are those that are interpreted is more of the astral sea and it's like yeah at night on certain nights depending on what the moon's lie or if the stars are right you could just find that you the Sun never Rises and that you sail forever on this mirror glass ocean that reflects the stars above you and it's this sort of silvery void that you sail through and one day as you're looking down and you you realize that the reflection of your ship in the water isn't a reflection and that your ship is now twice as big it extends out from the bottom as well you know there's all kinds of astral whales and other things that just swim there and sort of exist and I know though that like mixing the traditional Deen deal or but just taking in a different direction and offering something different is is always a fun way to present the plains yeah yeah Doctor Strange
