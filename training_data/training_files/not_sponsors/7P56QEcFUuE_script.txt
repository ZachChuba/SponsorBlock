in the year 2012 the world didn't actually end but there were some things that sucked the average 55 inch 4k TV cost about a hundred and fifty five US dollars per diagonal inch here's a little visual representation for you per diagonal inch but thankfully prices have fallen precipitously in the intervening years bringing us to today's episode of why the actual fat pitocin friendly content are all of you buying this the best-selling TV on Amazon what exactly is it that you are getting for a mere seven dollars there's only five James five dollars whatever seven I have other dollars here $7.25 per inch well I'm gonna tell you after I tell you uses a safe protected IP you can check it out today at the link below [Music] the TCL 55s 405 is the best-selling TV on amazon with over 2,500 reviews and an average rating of 4.3 out of 5 stars now you might be thinking gee I've never heard of the creative life before these TVs must be cheap Chinese crap but you would only be 66.6 repeating of course percent it is cheap it is Chinese but it's actually surprisingly decent as it turns out Chinese companies have been climbing the largest TV manufacturers lists dethroning the more familiar Japanese and Korean brands that you might be used to in fact look creative life nah I can't do that anymore TCL occupies the first six spots on Amazon's bestsellers list all with sets that cost under $400 and this was actually really surprising unlike most value brands TCL didn't just buy a panel that was made by LG or Samsung and put their own casing around it they are a completely integrated company that makes their own panels cases and stands in fact TCL is now the world's third largest producer of TVs and they claim to be the fastest growing TV brand in America they were even the first Chinese TV manufacturer to nab lucky eight percent market share and the picture quality is really good for the price like we can see why so it's a 3840 by 2160 v-- a panel which gives it nice deep blacks it uses a direct backlight instead of edge backlighting and it's got entry-level HDR 10 support thanks to its 8-bit plus FRC bit-depth panel something that both movie watchers and gamers are likely to appreciate and on that subject the gaming experience is actually surprisingly good as well the delay from mouse-click to muzzle flash using our makey makey and csgo was only 1 2 3 frames that's a really strong result one disappointing tidbit though is that while the 55 s 405 is advertised as having a 120 Hertz refresh rate it's actually just a 60 Hertz panel with a combination of advanced signal processing and backlight scanning to present an effective refresh rate of 120 Hertz whatever that means and strangely you can't even toggle clear motion completely off like you can on most TVs that I've seen though with that said as someone who loads the soap-opera effect i didn't notice and he's moving anyway so it just doesn't seem to really work very well but your mileage may vary there IO wise it's pretty generous including three HDMI 2.0 ports a headphone jack awesome for a PC setup and an Ethernet port which is fantastic since many people think that they're watching 4k Netflix or they've got a 4k chromecast Ultra but they aren't actually getting 4k streaming because their Wi-Fi isn't fast enough and you'll want to be doing a lot of 4k streaming on this thing because not only is it a smart TV but it actually basically has a Roku streaming stick plus built right into it that's a dongle that usually costs out that's a dongle that usually costs at least 50 bucks on its own and it lets you use your phone as a remote cast media from your phone and switch to your game consoles without flipping through inputs allowing them to appear as tiles just like your other apps for bonus points they even made all the menus loops so if you want to go all the way to the bottom all you have to do is hit up thank you but surely they had to cut some corners to get the price this low right and yes yes they did the most obvious one is brightness your 55s 405 will do you just fine in a dark or moderately lit room but if you're gonna deploy it in your living room and you've got a lot of natural light there you are going to struggle to see through the shiny AF glare and then there's the speakers so the problem with them is that they suck a pair of eight watt speakers sounds bad even on paper considering that we've reviewed monitors with 10 watt stereo setups and in real life they're even worse now you'll be okay watching the news or reruns of the Big Bang but if you're breaking out the popcorn for a base bang and movie we would suggest some kind of audio upgrade like maybe this entry level sound bar from the Amazon bestsellers list we haven't actually tried that one yet but should we maybe let us know in the comments below bringing us finally to the not so premium look the case is three inches thick made of plastic with a sheet of aluminum at the back and it rocks quarter-inch bezels oh and I mean while no one's likely to ridicule you for them unless your friends and family are all gigantic butt heads if you want a more modern look you might consider shelling out the extra hundred and fifty bucks for the sexier 2018 version so then should you buy this TV if you're not the type to scrutinize the nitty gritties of display technology like banding and the dirty screen effect then honestly definitely as long as you don't have to deal with customer service you will be happy and if you are more picky with your displays honestly the answer is probably yeah you should still buy it throw it in your bedroom Chuck one in the ensuite bathroom or gift it bathroom or gift it to your leg or grandparents just make sure that they've got a big enough table to support its wide stance how did you hear about us section so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it was awesome get subscribed hit that like button
