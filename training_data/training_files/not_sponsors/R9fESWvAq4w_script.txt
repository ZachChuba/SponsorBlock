is known in the business as evergreen content you can enjoy it any time of the year and it's not on accident that we do this we want people to be able to enjoy all of our old videos without seeming especially dated but this week we thought what if we did a video that wasn't better what if for one week we just talked about things that we are currently really annoyed with like right now this very month February 2015 let's talk about three things that we are all really sick of hearing them and then put them to bed once and for all never be talked about again Kanye West at the Grammys Kanye West is a very innovative artist and a man with many haters haters who wonder why so many people pay attention to Kanye West well gee I wonder did you hear what Kanye West said about back what a jerk seriously Kanye West is horrible I mean really why didn't anyone pay any attention to this guy it just drives me crazy how much attention Kanye wasted getting you want people to stop talking about Kanye West stop talking about Kanye West but somehow I think people like hating Kanye West he's just so so simple yeah and you're playing right into his hand you're giving him what he wants okay so why don't word on Kanye West and then we will speak no more of this manner look at the end of the day people want the Grammys to be interesting people want a lively show and he gave them something to talk about he doesn't think that Beck should have won albums a year great air do I for the record it should have been Ryan Adams but he wasn't even nominated a Brian Williams controversy so this news anchor guy that no one under the age of 40 even recognizes lied about being in a plane that got shot down over a decade ago and for some reason we're supposed to care I don't get it I guess the older generation still buys into this idea that news people are supposed to be respectable honest individuals without an agenda but we younger folks knows that that ship sailed long ago and there really is no place for us to get honest news tonight Brian Williams under fire for lies he told years ago we reaction from an old person and a young person but we'll start with you old person can you tell us what the reaction has been within the old community oh it's been paid ammonium in the streets we're all heartbroken bill heart broken the old people of America are very distraught that the illusion has been shattered it's just a low load day for old people everywhere who still watch Network News Wow and how about you young person how are the youth of America reacting to this deception from a news anchor I mean aren't you all lawyers don't like six corporations on all the media I just don't see why people are surprised by this oh hold on now you act as though you don't even care I mean not really typical young person more interested in their beanie babies and cellular telephones than to know what's actually going on in the world wait old person where are you going are you kidding me family feud is about to come on that Steve Ari is hilarious I know word on Brian Williams who cares that people who run the news will just replace it with another liar and the cycle continues anyways on to 50 shades of grey 50 shades of grey I am sick of everything that has to do with this stupid movie I'm sick of people who are excited about this movie and I'm sick of all the anti Fifty Shades of Grey post I've seen all over Facebook with headlines like why you shouldn't see Fifty Shades of Grey I'm really sorry to break it to you people but those who have purposed in their heart to see Fifty Shades of Grey will indeed see Fifty Shades of Grey or they've already seen it you're not going to convince them otherwise oh hey so you know how you're the kind of person who's gonna go see Fifty Shades of Grey oh yeah totally I am well I don't think that you should support a film like that Wow super convicting talk thanks bro it's just a lost cause it and feel like if someone walked up to you and said they were going to go down the street and dump garbage on their head it's like well there are probably better uses of your time and and I'm not sure how I feel about the fact that you're so open about this matter but I can't stop you I mean I could try but maybe you shouldn't go dump garbage on your head but garbage is awesome I love garbage you know what just go knock yourself out thanks for a final word people are attracted to controversy so the more controversial you make something sound the more interested people are going to be tell the child not to eat the cookie and they're gonna want to eat the cookie the entire media campaign surrounding this movie has been about how controversial it is it's unfortunately kind of genius because people are stupid enough to fall for it and that's what we're sick of in February of 2015 what are you sick of hearing about you hate when you can't trial and 10% off that squarespace.com slash cow stop stop talking on your project
