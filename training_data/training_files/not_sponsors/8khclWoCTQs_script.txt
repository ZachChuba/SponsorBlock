and I think we should be live hello everybody welcome to another episode of the brain food show broadcast live on YouTube also available as a podcast go download us as a podcast that's the way well I'm sure you've got your preferred ways of listening and we've got your preferred way of listening as well and that's why I podcasts if you'd like to iTunes our Apple podcasts whatever its course and off rambling I'm here with Damon how's it going it's going great Monday morning Brighton Ali Oh Sunday night where you are yeah yeah I mean kind of Monday morning but like 1:40 a.m. I don't know why you like these crazy early hours since it's pretty perfect for me but you're like well it gets there you know the girls are asleep so not making noise it's good it's good quiet Oh what's up today wonder what's on the agenda we're looking at the fascinating origin of everyday things and we're gonna do two episodes today for people who want a lengthy ly listening experience we're gonna face them in the right yeah yeah so we're gonna covering like the shopping cart the paperclip I don't remember it's like 30 pages long well there's that one dude I I read through the night oh yeah yeah does that guy that's it like I swear everything this yeah but the safety pin is the thing but we're gonna talk a lot about him because he's he was a pretty cool guy that no one's ever heard of um and didn't really make any money off his many many inventions even though even though I'm not just the safety pin but like many people will have multiple of his inventions in their house it's very cool this was the video was selling all his patents right yeah he just sold him and then would just move on to the next thing and stayed for most of his life ya know it was awesome good ending alright I don't want to spoil the ending because well I know I'll brief you guys back and then they all died and no one remembers them and this guy's yeah sort of yeah yeah well legacy wise anyway before we get into the quick facts which i think is our start today's show i will mention if you do choose our preferred way if you're listening to the show I grab it as a podcast and leave us a review on whatever major platform when we get to a thousand reviews we're gonna give away a $1,000 Amazon gift card which you can get like a laptop or something for that all I could yeah I feel like you probably can get like a 940 inch TV these days TVs got cheap yeah not a guarantee you probably can't I don't think that exists it would be the size of the house uh yeah so go do that if you fancy it as an Amazon voucher it's just a little contest we're running it should be fun enough promo uh quick fact we doing impact we're gonna start with the paperclip so for people who don't know that's actually the you know the the common like when you think of a paperclip when everybody thinks of a paperclip it's called the gem paperclip some people don't know that and so gem it's like no we get to why it's called that in a bit but for just for starters we're going to dispel a myth because almost everyone including if you look up encyclopedias and stuff unless you know like the modern you know digital ones where people can edit but you know look up Encyclopedia Britannica and whatnot will say Johan Balor he was a Norwegian guy invented the paperclip and this has been a thing since I think it was around the 1950s when everyone was giving this guy credit and to the point hilariously there is a 23 foot tall paperclip in sand vika Norway dedicated in honor of valor that was put there in 1989 and this guy again had nothing to do with the Jim paperclip and then on top of that he has a commemorative stamp that was made also in his honor what yeah this guy's giving all the credit so why how did he get the credit I wait I want to know because I'm just gonna start taking credit for stuff be like yeah yeah the car you know if you make that position with this statue like eventually you know like thousands of years you know there'll be this statue that's a dig up archaeologist Balak the guy who invented the paperclip you know but yes so so he was eat valor was granted a patent for a paperclip in Germany and in the US as well anyway it's kinda like vay like if you look it up it's so you got the the normal gem style paperclip has like the multiple loops and ballets just had one loop it was just like a bent lyre like in a little little square and so his not really not very well so here's you can see this renews if we use the one with a weird complicated yes idly yeah so and and and the the point of this too you might think oh well maybe he developed this one and then someone inspired created the better one in the Jim paperclip and no the jam paperclip was already popular when he came up with this one so he just came out with an inferior one after the fact so his is that you think the principal problem is just with the one loop what happens is it ends up you just like it's just the the strength of the metal itself for bending is what's gonna hold it together but also it doesn't really lay flat because it is just that so it just kind of like it'll stick out like the thicker this is saying it'll kind of stick out whereas a gym paperclip unless you go like super thick like way oversized will just kind of lay flat you know when it's holding the papers together and so wait if the first that if the crap ones like it's just working on the tension of the metal generally once you've done you know oh no I put ten pieces of papers ago yeah and then you would exactly nine that's not gonna work yeah this was inferior in so many ways and so they're so that's so the gem pile because of the multiple loops actually has like helps that twisting of it kind of creates like a torsion that actually kind of holds the thing to want to stay flat against the papers unless you like overload it like it like it like way to like torsion is that where it pushes cousin I hope it's like we're the twist but like a twisting torque that makes it want to go back against itself in a way right yeah exactly and so so that and so the gem style fit works really well and it you know it's just superior in many ways and so his does that not only that so now let's go back to Valerie's design you might you might not be surprised to learn that his was never manufactured nor ever sold he literally just had a patent for it like did even make one I don't know in the end but he gets all the credit so why why is a picture of it now just it's like a a rectangle just yeah all the way around with one end slightly longer and looping back in itself but not yeah no yeah how do you passin that it's just a piece of wire that's been wrapped into a square shape well he was a patent Clerk so you know he knows he knows ways but yeah so so he does this and so why why is he giving credit so um so he where am i last my place one moment live show problems I've lost you places well I was looking at pictures of the crime okay all right back to it this is there was a patent agency worker who actually visited Germany to register some Norwegian patents in the 1920s and he notices this this Norwegian patent this is this guy who is Norwegian who patented this in Germany and so he goes and he assumed that Valliere must have been the original designer of the paperclip not bothering to actually look up who who actually invented the you know like the dates of the fact that the other paperclip that's more commonly known design had already been around yeah yeah and so this guy actually writes an article on it and so this at this point and at this point it's not like a popular article but what happened was in the 1950s so after world war ii so if for people who don't know in World War two the paperclip the JEM paperclip was actually a symbol of like of the resistance groups in Norway and in France as well and so they would actually wear this this paperclip on their clothing cuz it clipped really easily it wasn't banned and it was kind of that you know like we're all together in this you know if you wore the paperclip it was like a thing like you know that person was a member of the resistance or whatever and eventually the Germans did catch on to this and then they did banned wearing wearing paperclips but up until that point it was like a symbol of the resistance and so this as you command this was a similar of the resistance in Norway so after the war it made a great story to say a Norwegian had designed the gym paperclip in the first place even though he hadn't and again no one bothered to do their research but you know granted they didn't exactly of Google or whatever so it was a little harder to dig out patents and what whatnot so yeah no one bothered to look and it just kind of caught on from there everyone everyone went back to this article that supposedly said this guy invented it everyone as they do it got into all the encyclopedias everywhere and for quite a long time he was given credit even though he had nothing to do with it so now who invented the actual Jim paperclip and this actually it's not known the exact person who did it but we do know kind of the rough dates it seems like it was a gem manufacturing company in Britain um not surprisingly and around the 1870s and so we have the first reference to it that we have comes from 1883 the first written reference and it actually is a book called the home library by one Arthur Penn of New York actually and thankfully this was digitized by Google so we actually have a quote from it here on page 122 and 123 it states every library table or desk should be supplied with the title with the four chief aides to the ready writer sheaths paper pasted pins and rubber bands pyramid of pins is the most convenient shape in which do you have pins on any desk or in a drawer for binding to get the papers on the same subject a bundle of letters or pages of manuscripts the gem paper fasteners a better than ordinary pins yeah so people actually did used to use those like pins you just like poke it through the through the paper and whatnot to hold it together maybe a better option yeah and rubber bands of course but so yeah and then there it wasn't clear though in this one while he's calling up the gem fastener everything there's still some question is it is it the one we're thinking of it or was the gem manufacturing company making a different one at this point but shortly thereafter we do have an actual picture from a Cushman and Denison in New York which is a company that made these things that they had an advertisement that actually shows the picture of the paperclip and the advertisement reads I'm sorry I'm lost Jen paperclip only satisfactory device for temporary attachment of all kinds of paper better than pins or clamps no mutilation of papers quickly applied and removed price 25 cents a box and that's about seven dollars and five cents in today's money um so yeah so it's not really known who exactly because nobody the gem manufacturing company they didn't actually patent it which is also why so many companies so quickly were making it but it is thought it was that that British company of the Jim Jim company that did it and their popularize it and then later that later would get all the credit for it and that is our quick back today I don't so known as a in red suit this guy's like essentially you know like you say people are gonna be digging up that weird statue yeah thousand yet and and to be clear the valet or himself was dead by the time he got credit for it so he didn't even know he would get credit for it you know at some point he had already died that's so bizarre yeah that's a quick fact that is our quick fact guys support the show and let's get back to it our main facts similar about there cuz I know the title of this episode is all about the origins of things yes yes they're all they're all gonna be the origin we're gonna move on to the to Walter hunt and we're gonna talk about many things he invented but also the safety pin is is kind of one of the main ones but it's a Walter hence everything this is the guy that invents everything so we only actually put I only put like a subset and just like general of what he invented cuz he's like you think like some inventors you know it's like oh they invented like in this field you know like if they had meant steam engines and they have all these patents on improvements to the steam engine and this guy was not like that this guy was just like whatever show like anything anything you can think of he was had it he dabbled in it you know and and he also he didn't seem to I mean he never got wealthy from it he was pretty poor all his life so but like he didn't really seem to focus on things that would be marketable necessarily like he just invented so much stuff that like a lot of it was marketable and so he was able to sell the patents and make money on it but then he would just move on to the next thing and he didn't seem to really focus on you know he didn't really seem to have that mind to be like okay this thing will make me a lot of money like he just whatever this this is kind of a cool new thing I came up with I feel like this is a fairly epic job like what do you do oh I kind of just got to the shed and invent things what sort of things anything I like and play around exactly when we get to the story of the safety pin this was exactly what happened like he just sat down played around for a few minutes like yeah here we go and it was just to solve a debt like he had a debt he needed to pay it off and so he just went out to his workshop you know a few minutes later he's come up with this revolutionary new thing and goes off and sells the bat and pays off his debt all good what's this what how long this is the this is the 19th century this is very cool and we still yes so yeah so and like the exact same design like people haven't modified the design at all it's it's exactly his so so Walter hunt no one no one's ever heard of this but he is considered to be one of the finest inventive minds of in American history at least so just to give like a little little smattering of the types of you know the range he was going with so he created the most efficient oil lamp of his age he also attachment to boats that allowed them to break through ice various improvements on bullet and casing designs a rope making machine and machine the big nails and improve an improved fountain pen portable knife sharpener Skye you just like some he invented a time machine yeah back from the future and he's inventing all these things yeah a new knife sharpener I said that was a new new type of saw coal heated convection oven early repeating rifle which was another this was actually significant to the development of the repeating rifle which we'll get to shortly this mid wolf asked what one of my favorite one of my favorite was the boots that allowed you to walk on the ceiling which he called antipodean apparatus which he sold the circuses and so in this this worked he actually had these suction cups that were strong enough to hold like a full-grown adult guy and and they were they were designed such that if you just moved your feet a certain way they would detach kind of like a fly you know that's actually helpful eyes stick to things as they they're actually super sticky but if they move their foot just write this the adhesive doesn't stick well at a certain you know angle of pulling and so this is kind of the exact same type of thing he did here and so it unstick and they actually had I read one I didn't put the quote but from one Richard sands and a performance in London he gave with these boots wearing walking around on the ceiling kind of cool but yeah so just like all over the place he was all over the map and its invention this would be awesome I wasn't into erectus that would be cool but also probably like lawsuits waiting to happen as soon as you know pretty dangerous ceiling a broke his neck yeah pretty much so yeah so going to the repeating rifle which he actually called the volitional repeating rifle so he sold that patent to one George Arrowsmith who then sold it to Smith and Smith & Wesson the founders of Smith & Wesson I should say Benjamin Tyler Henry Horace Smith and Daniel B Wesson and so they took they took his design and they basically just made some small improvements to it and then they came out with the Henry repeating rifle which was famous for it's pretty much ubiquitous use in the American Civil War and then later that was also the basis for they improved upon it's more to make the Winchester repeatable which is Peter yeah that's like one of the most famous guns of all time and so yeah it was all kind of based the initial just improvements on his design and then hunt of course is he's not given really any credit for any of that I'm more just smitten with him so yeah he was all over the place so money's more amusing yes yeah he was also born another New Yorker 1796 and he actually had almost no formal education he just he had some like in his earliest years you know learn to read write math and all that and then as soon as he got into his teens he quit and then I went and was a farmer basically for a little while and so he was you know he was good at tinkering and whatnot so he got hired by one Willie Hoskins and ziba Knox to help them improve they wanted to make some improvement on a flax spinning machine they were they were using and so he helped them and he was actually left off the patent even though he was he was an integral part of the the design of it but at the same time after he did this he started thinking about it and he came up with an even better like a whole new design for a flax spinning machine which he patented in 1826 and so at this point he did have a wife he married his childhood sweetheart he married when they were teens and they at a certain point they had four children I'm not sure how many children yet at this point but so he's like alright I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it go at this I'm gonna take this my new brand new awesome flag spinning machine I go to New York I'm gonna get some investors or get some alone or something from the bank I'm gonna manufacture this it's gonna be great so he goes to New York but of course he's just like a hick you know like a farmer with no education you know no nobody was really adding stuff by this point doesn't he know like this was kind of his first his first go of things yeah so he's just going to the big city you know country bumpkin go and they're gonna get something so yeah no no investors were interested in of course banks at this time we're like not I mean banks up until the Bank of Italy which was actually that would become Bank of America that's what's known as actually was rich people right yeah always you had to be rich already or yeah the bank didn't want to deal with you at all and so this had actually changed this an interesting side which we're gonna cover in Christmas because it's one of my favorite this guy George Bailey you know you know George Bailey from It's a Wonderful Life right never seen it but sure oh come on what do you expect yeah well George Bailey us any enforcement he's an awesome character a super awesome character and you think it's rich or something yeah surely he spends his life basically helping others instead of you know helping himself when he could have helped himself over and over again so he does this and and and this guy the founder of Bank of Italy which became Bank of America he founded it in the u.s. actually he is the basis for George Bailey and if you read up on this guy he is George Bailey basically like and except for George Bailey never really got um you know like he there was a no point really got wealthy I'm kind of at the end he got some money but but this guy could have gotten wealthy because he did found Bank of America but he continually like when the board would try to give him money he would just like nope I don't want it he would just donate it to charity he'd minimal salary for himself I guess all career anything just went back into helping people basically this guy was a great guy so we're going to cover a hot woman Christmas story it is it is so well cover him later and in a later episode but anyways so hunt he goes banks don't want to deal with him he's just a country hick no but no one cares and so he decides well I can invent new stuff so I'll just sell this patent which he had no trouble selling the patent people wanted it just no one wanted to invest in him and hit you know him you know manufacturing it up so he did get enough money to relocate is his family to New York with him and then he's like I'm gonna just I'm gonna create something new so about a year later in 1827 he filed his second patent this one for a foot-operated gong to be fitted to carriages because he actually saw this is kind of a common problem people getting hit by carriages on the road cuz people were sharing and so he actually saw a little girl get killed hit and killed by horse-drawn carriage and so he thought how about a foot operated Gong because at the time they did some carriages did have like an air horn but you had to actually like reach and use your hand or like you know use it to you know doing something dangerous yeah so you had to take your hands off the reins basically to release one hand to make this work and so he thought well this isn't good how about a foot-operated Gong you know it's just you just hit it it's really loud and then people get out of the way and so especially like kids and stuff um so but this nobody again wanted to invest in his idea or anything like that but once again someone was we're perfectly willing to give him money for the patent so they could develop it themselves and so he just sold it again and then moved on to his next invention and he just continued doing this over and over again it's not really clear why he never like tried how about just sell part you know just give a little bit money now but then ask for royalties in future and so the other people can develop it on the side I mean he never he never tried this seems strange enough to be like can I just have like 10% just yeah yeah just like me and still have some interest in it yeah to do that I'm sure he would have to you know accept less and he was always kind of scraping by like just kind of barely getting by most of the time so it's not maybe that was his reason for he just needed as much as possible now or it could just be he's like I can invent something new like no problem I'll just come up with something new so I don't need that you know yeah it's not really known nobody knows why he never tried something like that maybe he just wasn't a good businessman coming for some yeah I yes just like the situation demanded like he needed money then and there to feed his family and stuff and whatever in this what 19th century I'm sure it's not the best of times yes yeah yeah short-term sacrificing the long-term but if you don't have a choice you don't have a choice yeah so this one will bring his first world-changing a patent in it this was the first he did of course had the more like the repeating rifle and one other that we'll get to shortly so in 18-49 he owes draftsman JR Chapman he owes him $15 which is about four hundred and twenty two dollars today and so he needs he doesn't really have the money to pay this back so he did what he does but he does as mentioned he goes to his little his workshop he sits down and and just like whips out a spool of wire and starts playing with it and eventually comes out with the safety pin and now a pin these sort of like pins for like clothing and stuff like that they'd have been around since I mean all the way to the 14th century BC there there's you know reference of some but the problem was none of them had the clasp on the end so they could poke you like if you move in and they could fall out because they didn't have you know and so they're not they're not awesome at this point so he just kind of I do it you you must have had like clothes adjusted or whatever or had safety pins put in when you you know yeah your mum would like so your trousers up at the bottoms you know at the hems or whatever because they were too long for you and it's like don't move and your move and then you get stuck with a pence yeah this is this is like the state of you know technology at the diamond so he comes up with the clasp at the end and not only that but he also the the spring action so that it'll actually stay you know locked in place to even when you're moving around my stuff so it's not gonna fall out like it's gonna be secure it's not exist with that don't have the spring action and I've used them like I don't know when I'm wearing them you know Anna muster I've come across it at some point in my life and it's kind of got this weird thing and then you push it yeah yeah loop this thing around you know what I mean yeah I do I have seen that's what why would those exist yeah I have no idea but yeah he's way way better no one no one had thought of it before he comes up with it and like literally the span of like an hour or two so he's just playing around and so then he you know doesn't he goes off sells the patent and he gets a reported $400 for it for the patent was about eleven thousand dollars today and so yeah pays off as little debt and this is ultimately ends up in the hands of the company called the WR grace and company who would go on they paid him $400 for it very quickly make millions of dollars off this product you know he sold for $400 and asked for more royalties for again he might just bit him like a really bad businessman you know like he's an inventor he needed like he needed his Steve Jobs you know like Wozniak he's he's like the Wozniak and he had no Steve Jobs basically I don't think you see a lot of big companies making really genius products where there's not some guy who's you know not really a technical genius or whatever or inventing yes but he's really good at business yeah he's like the idea man like the Paul Allen to Bill Gates I mean Bill Gates actually did a lot more work than like a Steve Jobs but like you know Paul Allen was the idea man you know like and Bill Gates was the you know put but it to work but yeah so he just said he needed a partner is what he needed but so yeah he does that and then um so then he also hasn't mentioned the repeater iPhone but also be like dude what are you doing yeah you could be so wealthy right now so so the thing he actually did kind of make a lot of money off this next one but interestingly it's the one thing like he didn't bother patenting and so it was kind of after the fact so the first commercially viable sewing machine that uses the two threaded lock stick match lock stitch mechanism which is like you know like revolutionize the industry he invented it you can go i we can we put a link up for people is that possible oh is that the link right that that's the link right there and they can just go look at it to see how it works because it's really it's kind of mesmerizing you can gonna watch it like it's kind of something you really see clever then yeah it's like there's a little animated gif that showed you how it works get that guy's awesome so yeah that's it's still commonly used today so he actually invented this was one of his earlier ones that he actually 1833 but again he didn't patent it so this one there was legend has it that he didn't patent it because he didn't want to put seamstresses out of work because he would have put a lot of seamstresses that'll work but this doesn't seem to actually be the case because he did while he didn't patent it he did sell it to one to george Aerosmith but when ariseth tried to manufacture it and everything he had trouble raising the capital because at the time there was like a huge number of seamstresses and they were all working for basically nothing I really cheaply so no one wanted to make this sewing machine too you know it just seemed pointless to spend all that money when you have all this cheap labor so no one bothered and Aerosmith didn't bother to patent it either but then dude his name's Aerosmith every time it's like Aerosmith the electric guitar but know about a decade later Elias we do a video about the guy who made the electric guitar oh did we do a we have done a video fender actually for people yeah the guy leo fender he never learned how to play guitar he was he was actually an out-of-work accountant from the from the Great Depression hit and he was out of work and so he kind of had a hobby like he no formal training of doing electronic stuff and so he thought I can just tinker around with these I'll do open a repair shop basically Amy started fixing amplifiers and stuff that around and he thought I could I can build a better one you know and so he did and so he came out with a Fender amp and then so it was just a natural extension to start making instruments and so he started with the guitar and it was the obviously the electric guitar the Stratocaster that he made and then and he just used you as he was building and designing these things he just used you know musicians would come in and play and give him feedback and stuff but what he was really trying to do was the pickups on his lecture tour were really the innovation there to make like a really clear sound and everything um anyways that's it that's a sorry inventions yeah so so Elias Howe jr. comes along about a decade after after hunted already come up with this but not patented and he invents it's the exact same thing like you just look at the way it works it works exactly it seemed independently he didn't know about Hunt's thing he came up with it on his own but so has happened especially back then but it still happens now just lots of companies just started using his house patent anyway like without paying him they just did it anyway so you know force him to sue so the one notable one was singer sewing machines which is still around today so they started yeah they're probably I don't know the best one known one today so house design they just started using it didn't didn't bother paying him so how naturally all these companies are using his design his patents so he goes and starts suing them but in the process of the of the litigation these companies come up with Hunt's previous invention they it comes to light and they say hey he invented this exact same thing a decade before you he didn't patent it so we can use it and you can't do anything about it so it works well I don't think it's like I think a little bit but I'm probably not a hundred because these lawsuits still continued so they said we don't have to pay you so hunt at this point he's like wait a minute all these companies are using this thing that I kind of invented you know I mean they're copying someone else but I was the first to and so maybe I can get some money out of this he this jumps in and starts trying to get these companies to pay him and on the side just in case this doesn't work out you know now there's money in the sewing machine this is super popular this is yeah really go mess yeah he decides to come up with a brand new design because one problem that they did have with this is when you're feeding it by hand if you don't feed it a really even rate it can jam and so he just thought I'll just make it so it feeds itself like you just put the fabric in it's just all automatic it just goes perfect great it pulls the fabric through so that's a great improvement to this thing and so he may he invents that and he patents is it and then he course as he does sells the patent and you think at this point well I saw that one you know this is super popular and you just made it better why why not just license it out lots of companies would have taken it but he sells it and then but he is he is still trying to get some money from his initial thing and so in in 1850 he finally singer sewing machines did say alright and I assume they wanted to do this just so they could show the courts hey the original inventor actually give us gave us permission here so now you can how you can go away I'm assuming that's why they did it but they did offer hunt $50,000 settle it out of court $50,000 just about 1.4 million dollars today for copying his original design and then they subsequently made a fortune out of it and so he accepted and you think okay Hun's finally made his fortune right he's like he's done it he's made it and except for now he died of pneumonia shortly after they made that agreement and before the money was paid out so his family his family got it so yeah his you know wife and kids that's good it's like because at least he made us million or you know yeah with him dying like his family no longer has his awesome inventions coming out every two seconds to support them so now he supported them from beyond the grave with this deal seems like yeah this lasso is like quite an accidental stumbling upon it's out of money yeah and it's kind of funny that it was like one of the things he didn't bother patenting you know all these other like had he patent did he would have just sold the patent and you know because they're sold yeah fifteen dollars and then it is kind of funny if you go look at Hunt's grave marker he's actually buried in the same so how is usually given credit a lot of times for who invented this sewing machine but it was actually hunt and so if you leave to go to the if you go look at findagrave.com you can see they're both their graves hunting how they're both in the same cemetery how has this how many monument grave yeah yeah it's like a monument to himself and then hunt I mean hunt a lot of people over let go it's like a simple little stone grace don't know he I mean it's like a little Slayer but it's yeah it's just little and then you got right right you right there nearby in the same cemeteries house mini monument to his his awesomeness but how page like you put the the find-a-grave links in the notes and I went to hit the things and it says like how inventor of the sewing machine I had also invented something to do sewing machine but it really sounds like how was the dude yeah it's like hunt just some random dude yeah so the new york times at least are not the passion buying business yeah new york jaeyoon did mention him at least when he died but not like a lot like they just said there's a little code i put in for more than 40 years he has been known as an experiment in the arts whether in mechanical movements chemistry electricity or metallic compositions it was always at home and probably in all he has tried more experiments than any other inventor now yeah I guess you know you just go out to your shed your tinker tinker - yeah and you come away with something I read that book about work or something about James Dyson the guy who made those Dyson back you know yes and his like experiments and innovation interesting stuff we are gonna do who invented the vacuum cleaner at some went on in this series of interesting words in him everyday things we almost did when we're on that trip going down the coast in the US the West Coast we almost stopped that vacuum cleaner Museum but we didn't have a time I think was important or something like that yeah we're gonna cover that then but yeah but in any event that is the end of the the safety pin in Hunt's but numb next up next up we're gonna go to the ballpoint pen which you'd think you'd think the ballpoint pen you know you probably got like 50 of them around you right now even though you can't find one ever you know like they're just everywhere I can see - yeah and they don't cost anything like if you just get a cheap pick one I mean what do they cost like a dime maybe I don't have them a free one of them's gonna fill it yes you've written on the side the other one has I can't see it but I definitely didn't pay for it so you think this thing surely it must be easy to make or something like that and it turns out the the craftsmanship that goes into these things is incredible which we're gonna get invade I mean they used to be super expensive for this reason until BIC came along and figured out how to do it if you ignore the price it's good I mean what was I don't know what the alternative was before like fountain pens or like quills or for people were writing with yeah used to have to write with fountain pens at school really yeah they'd force you you know you you couldn't use a biro or a what do you call them virus um yeah we'll get into why you call them that but yes they or some people call them back or just a pen you know yeah we'd have to write with in pens at school and you could use like the replaceable plastic cartridges so you didn't have to like dip it like you know and draw out the ink by using in the olden days we'd have to write with them and it's you know it's an ongoing saga of like oh my phone's have been exploded in my bag or like the inks leaking everywhere yeah it's just not working I ran out of ink and all of this crap the ballpoint pen is just incredible it's and it's just I mean it doesn't look as nice no I ever I have like I don't know there's a couple hundred dollar fountain pen I bought like ages ago Justin I love the way it looks yeah yeah I love the way it looks and I love the way it writes like it's like when you're writing it just like flows the ink like flows but then it does flow on the page and then it smears everywhere and like we'd like you say you put it in your pocket and there's ink everywhere in your after every time you write with your there's ink all over your fingers and hands and even whatnot University when only see you could write in by her if he wants it I'd still use a fountain pen for exams because you can write faster with the hounds a pen yeah and it is it's so smooth and yeah but anyway so going back to this Vulcan sorry I like that you have a fancy fountain pen fancy fountain pen that's cool it is and yeah like one time actually ordered off Amazon like one like just one it was it said like six-pack but they sent me like six of the six-packs and I was like you know I'll return or whatever yeah and they were like nah just keep it all right supply of the ink yeah yes the ink which is yeah I have a lifetime supply basically this one order but yeah you can just swap out the ink I love I love that thing anyways going back to the to the ballpoint pen so this thing this thing so the little balls in them are made of tungsten carbide which is the same thing as like armor-piercing bullets and they are so highly polished they're polished with pace made from diamonds is how they polish these things up and they're so highly polished that you need an electron microscope to see the defects in them whoever's doing the mock say for buyers or whatever nice top their game made with diamonds yeah bullets its problem of the price you think it's so cheap they're so ubiquitous everywhere you think it's like this cheap easy to easy to make thing and it's just you know it's a little bit like like the videos when you do like daily videos of many channels there was out there you probably just throw-in that together it's taking you two seconds is like no that's not how we put just as much effort and we just have a lot more people working on it doesn't others of this that I can't remember where it's what water is and diamonds and water are often given and be examples like water is has a huge utility to us water is really useful we really need that but it's really where as diamonds other than industrial uses funnily enough I like yeah they're not there's pretty much zero utility of a diamonds like equity of diamonds but it's incredibly expensive like this thing has a name yeah well yeah so they do polish these things up Simon so the the space in between the so they put it in that little socket you know like the little pen things so they put a little the bearing in there and it has to be within one one thousandth of a centimeter to get it to work right to it so it basically makes like a basically airtight seal so the so the ink doesn't dry out and doesn't just leak out and so the space has to be so small the thing doesn't leak and all that but if there is any flaws it will know the seal won't work and it'll leak and it won't write correctly and so they if they find a flying one so i'm i'm guessing they don't actually look at every single bearing coming through the line but if they do because if they do find a flaw in one they end up throwing out the whole batch and then they just you know just to get rid of that just in case there is any flaws in any of the others so they do this and yeah so any imperfections it's out and so that's so how does it how does actually the pen work and it's actually pretty simple so it's just it's just gravity and as its rolling and it's got that airtight seal it just kind of pulls the ink drags it along pulls it out and so it's nice but it doesn't leak it's it's just real nice except for you do need gravity so we did cover this part a little bit so you do have the space pens and you've seen this like we have a so does that epic space series part force base pen at some point like yeah just space back yeah it is nice because you can write upside down and all that business was so useful I mean because I'm often using my antipodean boots so yeah having the space pens incredibly useful for those situations yeah and it also works in like I can't remember it was crazy like up to like 400 degrees Fahrenheit and negative 50 degrees they're like right in oil as well which is often you know something I'm in you know in situations like that yeah often my six months on the oil rig but I do like it it is and there's a great-looking pants it is they look nice and they're not super expensive so there is I just wanted to briefly mention we did like the full on like how this Space Pen came to be in epic space series part 4 but so there's that rumor that NASA spent like millions of dollars to develop a pen instead of you know the Soviets used a pencil and it's like haha how stupid is NASA but now the NASA used a pencil to Soviets used a pencil they didn't like using the pencil like there is problems with this in space with the wood shavings and the graphite and stuff is electrically conductive and you got wood shavings going into panels from NASA like yeah when you break off a bit of a pencil in a spacecraft it's just floating around again jams on the electronics not great yeah or like in your eyes it's not it's not awesome and so so the rumor is of course that they spent millions of dollars and they did not spend hardly any money so it was actually policy fisher who had already come out with this pen and there's he called it the AG 7 at the time and he went to nasa and said hey i got this pen i think it could be useful for you in space because it doesn't need gravity it's a ballpoint pen that doesn't meet gravity could write in space it's got the special ink that works in extreme you know circumstances environments that he formulated and so NASA they tested it out really thoroughly and they're like yeah we want it but they didn't want to pay the full price of three dollars and 98 cents per pen so they wanted they wanted a discount if they bought I think the classic newer Sochi yeah yeah I think yeah 400 of them and so he ended up giving them to two dollars and 39 cents and honestly had they pushed it that was about 17 dollars and 42 cents today but had he pushed it I mean I'm sure you would have given them to him for free because it's NASA using your pen in the space program this is this is like free marketing is like the best marketing of all time especially at this point they're you know I know like people weren't so keen on NASA at some point right because they were staying yeah yeah and this was during the space racer is that sort of perception that everyone is like yeah we're doing this you know Greatest Generation and all that sort of a No the public actually were quite against it and it was really just kind of the government pushing it anyway just as a you know we're gonna one-up the Soviets thing but actually the public was quite against the spending thought it was outlandish and no but there was no reason to go to moon and all that sort of business which is why when I get it like if you've got a contract from NASA and they've come and they're like hey we want to buy your pants really sweet and then you don't want to give it up yeah yeah so they did buy 400 of them and so it was a nice little thing but of course it the real money and it was the UM was after the fact we worth the advertising because it's literally called the Space Pen now like that's what they call it Fisher company so yeah great advertising and the Soviets of course picked it up by 1969 they were also using the Space Pen instead of pencils because it was just way better but yeah so if you want more details on the whole story in the development of that you can go listen to the epic space series part four on the brain Fujio podcast which you can find that the russian pencil one and the Space Pen is it's one of those examples of why people don't like me anymore like you know when ever since just doing so many videos about facts and stuff you'll be in the pub yeah you know and someone will be like oh you know about the Russia and it's not not this one but anything like this maybe Ike well actually the the Russians they up you know using pencils was a terrible idea and then people like whatever so much made a video about that just work so much that you never go out and do anything with anyone and then yells me to shut up so so so yes going back to this the other thing about this space pen getting it for the 239 or even the $3.00 and what was a 98 cents that it was a retail price at the time yeah so it turns out just about I was two decades before this to buy a ballpoint pen because I mean they are like this just a regular ballpoint pen you know this to gravity time they cost when adjusted for inflation about $100 so that was about five or ten times with the Fisher Space Pen cost in the 1960s so about $100 per ball point pen at this point so they this is a pricey purse purchase so things all changed starting with one Marcel kick in the mid 1950s but before we get him in the possible you have something that's completely ordinary sight yeah by right yes like microwaves rich man yes so that's we're gonna instead of BIC we'll start with lászló bíró so biro wears layer is an epic name it is you think that's how it's pronounced with all those accents pretty sure Oh Hungarian Hungarian so that would that be a little bit like check with you know it's different it's now a different Hungarians kind of a unique language it doesn't really share any other but less weird languages that's we're done you know they fun fact often when they make movies and they have you know aliens speak you know because you know they don't speak English or whatever they'll use Hungarian as the language that the aliens speak because they don't want to invent a whole alien language and snowing outside of Hungary speaks Hungarian to do like where the if we wanted a video that got no view the Hungarian language come from congratulation for this video when you log into that YouTube - border that tells you how your latest video is performing so all your other videos these days just to make you feel sad like this video is poor performing very poorly compared to your recent videos for YouTube poor Larry Doby who everyone knows Jackie Robinson like it you'd probably at least heard of Decker you don't even know baseball but you probably heard of Jackie really really okay well everybody spool at all I would think even he would be cos you know he'd like transcended baseball in a lot of ways but if I told you about some cricketer he broke boundaries would you I mean I don't know yeah but everyone's heard a groans and therefore Larry Dobby same season he's there he's doing it on the other circuit the other leaving Dobby as I've spent the whole video pronouncing it Dobby it could have been Dobby I always thought is Larry this would be funny because even we don't even this was the second black guy to play pro baseball and he put up with all the same stuff Jackie Robinson at the same time like the same year so he was the two of them and they were you know they were calling each other supporting each other and everything you know like every night like hey you know we're doing this and they're in but you know he was a great player he was a great player in his own right as well like super awesome not sure if he went into the Hall of Fame I think he might have but either way we did this video on him even the video covering like the Forgotten heroes Larry and that where did it get like is probably one of our lowest video of us performing poorly get back to you this is like a video from like when we first launched the channel level of views and it was like poor guy even and we try to feature him and even then no one cares you just don't want to be saying it's like it's like who is the who who are the people in Apollo 12 does anyone remember no dude third guy Apollo 11 two people really know the name Michael Collins yeah even anyway even then yeah I think if you ask people on the street what's Buzz Aldrin famous for yeah I would be surprised at the number of people who would go he's an astronaut right yeah yeah yeah the cool guy Buzz Aldrin's Oh Legends yeah you look up some of his stories with him and he's still around we should let that just go vase yeah we should just go back to the interview format for like one episode just to see if we could get him on because he would be fun to children would be able to get I don't know he seems to do a lot like he I mean he showed up to that one guy for the the thing just make it a charity thing you know buzzing do rate that the guy the guy who he punched you know that was supposed to be like a thing for kids so he just showed up like he literally in person and then then it turned out to be fake which is also another reason why he was so angry in the first place because you know he taking he taking his day off to go do this thing set up I still hit just bump into him know they're in this guy at this guy and also has been harassed him before and everything so it wasn't and the guy does it go watch the video of that on it yeah if you're gonna punch someone that's the guy you watch the video of the actual interaction and it's like I think like everyone would have punched that guy I don't care if you're like a normally filing dieter or not like you know seemed like a right back yeah exactly but either way we should go back to pens did we get there from the weird name last is that tangent yes hungry 19:31 yes Spira observes he's works at a newspaper and so he's this ink right it dries almost instantly that they used in the printing presses and so he's like why can't we get this ink for like a fountain pen so he can get rid of this problem of you know ink smudging everywhere so you write and then just dries instantly is not smudging on your hand and everything which is particularly fair like a lefty I mean that must have been like I mean fountain pens would have been a nightmare for a left-handed writer at that time um so unless I guess you're something all over the page yeah I guess maybe if you're Jewish or something it's okay but then for the right-handers but yes alright so he's thinking so can we do this he tries it doesn't work out it's not working so then he enlists in 1938 his chemist brother I don't know Yuri maybe sure its GUI Oh rgi why so in this endless and George yeah yeah maybe so they try to come up with this and they do end up coming up with an ink that sorry they don't and so then they they end up coming up with something that does work though in a ballpoint pen which he patents in June 15 1938 so it is this is the first commercially viable ballpoint pen so there had been some ballpoint pens before that but for instance 1888 there was one John J loud he his his idea he wanted something that could write on leather because fountain pens were wouldn't write on leather well and so he he came up with this but his didn't work well lack of interest it wasn't commercially successful it you know it wasn't a good design because as we discussed well boy pins kind of hard to get to work so and there was others that came along and all of them had problems with ink flow clogging leaking all that so it was um it was Bureau there by Rho mu by Rho right we say Badri okay yeah biro he ends up you know him and his brother come up with with the first if I have a one that works you know reasonably well so now in like Europe and stuff he's probably the one given credit but in in mostly for them for the invention but in the u.s. most people think of like BIC right this guy who actually came along Oh second yeah we could we might say BIC as well oh yeah or like I'm yeah he's with the brand they also make razors right yes yes they do those cheap those cheap razors which is a face up pretty much all the shape you can buy them for almost nothing just like their ballpoint pens so the problem with with pyros pens where they were ludicrously expensive at the time even though you know they worked pretty good and so along came lost my place one moment yes so they were actually used his pins were used if you were wealthy you could buy them and like the British Air Force also was used them a ton so because they had trouble with fountain pens apparently at high altitude like a jet they apparently don't work well at high altitude so this ballpoint pen and everything so bic comes along though BIC and he buys the patent from from biro and he starts his own factory he buys a rundown Factory in France actually and and buys a patent from big her biro and then he goes long and he does you know proprietary so I'm not quite sure how his system worked but he came up with basically a means to mass-produce these things to extremely high quality to just completely put everyone else at a business who is making ballpoint pens at the time because he could do it what was it one three hundredth of the cost is what he could sell his pens for from all the other ballpoint and they were and it wasn't normally you know you if you're gonna go cheap it's gonna be crappy quality but no his were actually better quality than a lot of the manufacturing at the time using whatever wizardry he did with his mass producing engineering production yeah he just waved his hands like I'll just we'll just make it you know way cheaper and better somehow so yeah they were now you know eventually you get to the point where they're selling for pennies instead of like many dollars and yeah and or like $100 adjusted for inflation so yes he dominates the industry from then on and it's pretty much been the same ever since is so why do we still call them BIOS yeah it's because both of these guys were European so I don't know yeah I just this guy came along later and just seems to absolutely dominate yeah I just put everyone else out of business basically what you call verdicts right primarily well I think I just call it a pen like I wouldn't really even yeah but some people do some people someone hands you a bit can you're like I meant to fountain pen yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't look funny at someone if they were like hey can you hand me the Baker whatever like okay yeah although people do say for it like you're speaking of the razor I've heard people will say like you're baking it when you're you know shaving this the cheap razor I've heard that's as an expression so that one yeah yeah I remember I had a big beard and I shaved it off with a big razor kind of rough you know that's funny is there's this picture of you so a couple of years back and on your air B&B page it's not there anymore right your profile you had this picture yeah where your full head of hair and it was just so hilarious because it's like you had like long hair and it's like flowing and the wind you were like ah I think you're like someplace tropical on a boat or something and it's like slow and you're so happy anymore yeah I really think you should put that as your profile picture like everywhere because it's just like you kept this flowing long hair I grew I griddle and then I ran out yeah long hair is awesome yes that is episode one today and we are gonna go on momentarily to episode two but yeah same stream or are we gonna just yeah we might as well no reason to cut it there is a reason I'd like another cup of coffee we people have been complaining in the chat about our video quality I apologize for that everyone who's listening I'm not sure what's going on and you look really clear sorry you look really clear here well this is the thing I'm looking at you are not built chat window and you look yes door clear but then I look at the meeting YouTube oh yeah hardcore janky on there like that is yeah you look clear to me as well either way grands I'll have a look at that get some coffee and we'll be back in a few moments I'll wrap up this episode so when we have a podcast version we have something to work with thank you very for listening there's been an episode of the brain food show part 1 of our fascinating origins of everyday things part 2 coming up real soon if like every 10 minutes yeah if you're if you're watching like 5 or 10 minutes if you're listening on podcast probably next week yeah most likely yeah thank you for really for listening please do leave us a review wherever you are listen to your podcasts that would be great and what's you seen
