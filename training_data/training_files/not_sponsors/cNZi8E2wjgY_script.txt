hey what is going on you guys it is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new video for you all today so today I bring you I or no sleep road to max episode number seven the last Ironman wrote to max video that I did for you guys was about four months ago and in that video we did get the mining pet we opened 30 brimstone keys and we did get a few total levels not too many it was kind of a short one but for this video though it's much longer are you mainly gonna be seeing a lot more total levels gain particularly in construction because I had so many logs that I wanted to make into planks and then eventually get the construction XP and also a lot of GP saved for the butler and yeah the main goal of course was to get that ornament pool level which we ended up doing and you'll just see a ton of construction levels gained kind of just in a few days most of these levels I did get a few months ago you know the last upload was like I said four months so a lot of these levels are pretty old clips actually done back when I lived in Florida and there's also still some relatively new clips that you will see at the end of the video that are pretty recent also did kind of a bank recap because my bank value has gone up and a pretty good amount since last video mainly because of all of the mining that I've been doing and I made sure to throw in some clue scroll clips later on as well see if we can't get lucky there I would say the highlight for this video other than the ornament pool is that as I mentioned and they loot from a five thousand neck real video I did get my second 99 on this account which was strength and I might actually be getting a third 99 which you guys will see in the next progress video as well he'll know when that'll be but that 99 will be range and that is because I am considering doing loot from three thousand two's are monsters now if I did this video and I did use the door Gish and crossbow method which I think I would then I'll definitely be getting 99 range and a decent amount of HP XP as well not too sure about how the drops are gonna be but I do intend on using this account for the loot series because a lot of people seem to enjoy the iron man style loot videos alongside the main I always prioritize the main but I'm always on the iron man you know I do put in a lot of hours these days compared to in the past and I'm always making sure to be doing something productive on this iron man account i've been still focusing so much on am at this mining should be getting 98 mining wrapping up that goal finally after a long long half-year just spent on mining because of just how inefficient and how inactive i was throughout that time and luckily for me that will also finish up 99 fletching and also get me 90 crafting so shout out to amethyst for kind of making multiple skills easier over a long period of time using a rune pickaxe was pretty rough but you know we dealt with that I did actually knock out all the free to play quests you know there were a few quests that I did I guess just not complete and yeah I did decide to kind of do that on this account obviously having a quest cave is much more useful on an Ironman than it is on a main so I will be focusing a little bit towards that goal I'm sure I'll get one in 2020 but I still have yet to even get one on my main yet so I'll keep you guys posted on that so yeah overall we did go from 62 to 85 construction which was a huge accomplishment and after that I did visit blast furnace got a few smithing levels did some afk gold bars as well just in Port phasmatis and thanks to all the amethyst we did actually get 97 fletching as well so one more level until my goal for that is done as most of you guys know I am trying to get as many 99s as I can at the same time no no particular reason just don't want to get all the 99s individually so yeah I do usually stop with like a hundred K away from 99 as most of my 98 skills are right now but as those 96 and 97 slowly inched their way towards 98 they're pretty much crossed off the list and very few skills remain obviously the number one skill I am looking forward to for this account especially getting 99 will be slayer do you think you know once I start doing Slayer I will happily livestream that and just make it kind of my main focus maybe even take a little bit of a break from the loot series and yeah that should be some pretty good Ironman related videos as soon as we start that Slayer grind I'm not much of a PV Emer but I do think I will go for a few band those pieces before I start Slayer because I think that would just be kind of fun on stream and also I have so much food in so many potions and also tons of stockpiled herbs to make more potion that I just don't see why I should have all that stuff if I'm not gonna use it I will try to put it to good use and you guys will see some interesting ppm in content in the future I really just always prioritize skilling on this account since the first day I made it because I've just really enjoyed skilling on an Iron Man it's a much different feel and it's much nicer to know that all the supplies in your bank all the time that you invested is much more useful on an Iron Man account you know you can't sell anything you can't stake anything and yeah it's just a good feeling overall I wish more people would try out Iron Man you know 2019 we've seen quite a lot of staking definitely becoming more popular these days and definitely brings a lot of stress to the table so if you ever want to try something new for all my stagers out there you know maybe try out an Iron Man maybe a hardcore you know you like living on the edge hardcore is definitely something for you to try myself don't think I'll ever do a hardcore Ironman you know I just love this account too much but at the end of the day it is definitely nice to try new things well that was a lot of rambling so getting back into the video here we are at blast furnace getting a few total levels I did have about 11,000 gold ore in the banks so I just figured I would use it all at blast furnace get a lot of XP and luckily it doesn't cost too much GP to do this minigame and the XP rates are insane so yeah shout out to this I did go from 79 to I think 81 smithing or maybe 82 and I think the next time I'll be doing smithing will be quite a while from now I do imagine it'll be my second-to-last 99 only because of the way that I chose to do 99 mining and people did warn me that if I did 99 mining the amethyst way that I would not have enough for 99 smithing and they were right so I'm not too sure how I'm gonna finish 99 smithing just yet but like I said I think I'll actually be doing Slayer next and you know that'll take a few months in general plus after that we have the Zeya runecrafting which i'm sure it will take another few months so you have smithing can definitely wait I'm not really in a rush for that was nice to get a few levels though and we'd also use some bones that I had in the bank got a few prayer levels really just trying to get to 20 100 total and then eventually 2200 it's insane to have an Ironman account this far I really did not imagine this was going to happen but here we are many years later and as you may have seen an ax loot from a 10,000 a bur inspector videos I did get 98 strength in that and the neck real video was what got me 99 so I figured I would throw in at the clips even though they are pretty old and you might have seen them before but I did get a few attack in defense levels since I was on shared XP and yeah in return we did get to 121 combat at the very end so shout out to these loot series really progressing this Ironman not just by getting me levels but also making the bank look more and more awesome every video that we do yeah 99 strength was achieved by that neck reel so we went and bought the cape and I've been flexing it ever since usually any time that I do my am at this mining did have some random loop and tooth keys both from these loot videos that I did save and luckily for me that was actually receiving over 25 new dragon stones for my bank which we will be converting into glories and if I ever decide to do abbis runecrafting those glories will come in handy so those are really nice you know not many people talk too much about crystal keys these days now that there's enhanced crystal keys so shout out to the og keys they do still serve a purpose also kind of a side note speaking of jewelry you know a lot of people were wondering if I'm ever going to be getting a zenite jewelry from demonic guerrillas and I will be doing that I think in the next video you will see monkey madness - completed may be Dragon Slayer - as well I do have most all of the requirements it's just kind of my laziness that's been putting those two quests off and the number one question that I also get is if I'm ever going to be getting a dragon Warhammer and the answer to that is not anytime soon I just don't have any plans on killing them but if I ever do make a loop video at shamans or shamans whatever you call them then I certainly will be making it on the Ironman I'd be a fool not to so maybe one day but yes to the question about Z Knights in the next video you guys will hopefully see that it's a promise that I'll at least get the quest on I'm not too sure if I'll be lucky enough to get all the ones that I want ya wrapping this video up before we get into a little bit of a bank you know just update we did check the Kingdom after about a month and a half out a lot of herbs and did run out of money I had 10 mil in there and it lasted a few months maybe two to four months I honestly don't remember but thanks to all the neck real GP that we did get I did invest six more mil into my kingdom and I am hoping that that lasts a long time I do have everything set on herbs so we will see the outcome of that most likely in the next video but yeah as promised here we are at the end of the video just time to show you guys the updated Bank a little bit of things have changed there's the amethyst right there about 5400 currently mind I should be getting about 8,000 more and then after that a lot of crafting so yeah that'll increase the arrow count and of course we have the melee tab still have the same amount of whips and of course all the barrows said so yeah currently we do have over 10 mil cache that's a huge change since last video and that doesn't even include the six mill that we did put into the kingdom can't forget about the hundred and forty five K amethyst arrows as well as the fancy Robin Hood hat in the new strength cape so yeah those are some nice uniques moving on though to the potions we are now at 4000 super attacks in almost 2000 super strength as well as close to 3000 stamina x' decent amount of super stores in sera Bruges and also a lot more seeds than last time thanks to all of the neck reels to 5000 of those and of course the 10000 specters so yeah a lot of farming and herb-lore XP bank probably about 2 herb-lore levels and as it goes for farming I really haven't done any runs recently so not even gonna bother to calculate that moving on to the skilling tab though here is all of our pure essence which we will use for runecrafting maybe one day and also all the you Long's and the ulong bows we have two out we'll start that when I do agility all those gold ore as promised we're used in the making of this video to get some smithing levels and currently we do have about 17,000 coals so we'll see if we can't use that for something in the future not too many runes you know not much to talk about there a decent amount of cut gems and still got my mm recoils as well as my 1000 dueling rings should probably build that ornament pool and jewelry box in my house but just really haven't had a reason to yet although I do have the levels the only thing that's different in this skilling tab was that we did get these expert mining gloves was kind of a new update a couple weeks ago which does really help with amethyst mining so yeah shout out to the mining guild really nice to actually get some updates before I get 99 so it's happy to speed the XP up this tab here is pretty much what we have left of the Slayer tab still got the obsidian pieces and over 200 ruined full Helms couple sets of mystic down below and just some clue scroll items the next tab is pretty much the same just extra clue items no alcohols and he just some level ones twos and threes and of course the remaining tab is the big money tab all the fish the angler fish all the sharks the Karim Juan said before in the video that you know I should start PD aiming cuz why have all this food if you're not gonna ever PVM with it even though the meta these days is like the ornament pool all the time still think that food can come in handy one of these days so yeah the overall price check all of these valuable stackable items just in the inventories 137 mil and in the rest of the bank with everything combined probably looking at another 250 mil used to be worth a lot more but a lot of the main items actually did go down quite a bit the economy's been up and down through the past couple of years in this game but yeah just from a value standpoint may not be that much but again there's not much PV aiming that goes on this account and this video was really just to show you guys all the levels that I have gotten when I wasn't afk II am at this mining throughout the past few months so yeah I was pretty simple pretty to the point and sure was a lot of rambling so hope you guys didn't mind too much and with that being said I guess that's it for this video I will see you guys in a couple months when at the total levels closer to 2200 and hopefully have a lot more to show for it hopefully a lot more important quests completed in the next video as well as a fuse a Knights obtained I think that's really the only PBM and goal for next video should just see a lot more skilling and kind of the final touches of the total levels all before we start the long 99 Slayer grind so with that being said guys thanks for all your continued support I will see you in a few days with the loot video this time and until next time mister no sleep ow
