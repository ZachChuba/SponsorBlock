have you looked at the back of a graphics card lately the outputs are all pretty much the same you got your DisplayPort you got your HDMI in some cases you'll still find a DVI kicking around and then nvidia in particular has this little VR link connector a USB type-c that they use for VR which is kind of cool AMD much of the same no DVI no VR link no big deal well that's boring what if there was something totally different this is a graphics card from a company I had never heard before called bully and the Advani ta6 is a video card unlike any gotcha PCI Express 16 X it's got your power connector it's got your bow six ethernet jacks [Music] use offer code lightness to save 40% at the link below so this thing can support six displays running at 4k 30 Hertz at the same time how the bloody hell are they doing this anthe you did the prep for this sure did hits Anthony Foxx so this is a weird freaking card like this entire portion of the PCB seems to be dedicated to these HD based he certified outputs and we'll get into that a little bit more detail later back here we've got a couple of three-and-a-half millimeter jacks what are these four those are four infrared pass-through so you can have infrared in and infrared out as well as our two rs-232 serial oh interesting so you can use a remote and have it it's actually got IR blasters here cool all right now the graphics card itself is actually not here or at least it's not integrated onto this output board so MXM is a laptop graphics card form factor that's typically used in like gaming notebooks but then they've gone and they've put this Radeon card in it but isn't something I'd ever even heard before like I assumed this was gonna be an rx something or other but instead it said what was it again it's actually an brady unintegrated embedded 9550 so this has so far raised more questions than it has answered my understanding is this is running off of it right now is that right oh yeah that's absolutely these do you want to show me how this cable run works so it's just a single Ethernet cable that comes from the card from there we're going HDMI straight into this monitor okay and then should I be able to tell any difference from using this at all not really so than Anthony how much of a delay is there if I just pop this ethernet cable out and then like pop it back in to about two and a half seconds so it's about the same as what HT mine would be so that's six pin adapter that goes in is taking care of power not just for the GPU but also for the power that has to be sent to these adapters that take that HD base T signal and turn it into something that a display can understand now you can do 10 Gigabit Ethernet networking at up to a hundred meters if you've got high enough quality cabling and HD base T can actually do the same thing so at voley sent us over 600 meters of what has to be the most badass what is this like cat 7 like shielded cat 7 or something yeah pretty sure that's cat 7 I mean look at these connectors on the end is real this is solid core cabling nice and I guess it's armored in case some idiot drops the spool on top of it it's actually kind of funny when you look at the manual it says read the full installation guide before beginning it can be found at at voley comm / ta 6 performance why you will make mistakes and you need to read the warnings in situ related items that's literally what's written here so the first thing I need to do is plug all of these into the back of the GPU correct I mean sure if you want to oh ok so then now the plan is for me to drag I don't know 80 pounds of copper like as far as you can go and then we can plug in a monitor and see what it looks like I won't be able to see it from there though because I needed that put here don't mind me I'm just you know plugging in my monitor gentleman no I'm good outside you know when we said this channel is about to get heavy this is exactly what we had in mind lots and lots of copper no I got this I'm close I can smell it [Applause] [Music] [Music] all right so there's two power leads outside yeah and we should have five here and do we have a remote for this oh man it's getting dark this is really annoying all we had to do was not take that roundabout route through the editing den and we'd be inside right now doing this hey at least we cleverly planned ahead and we're going to use the the quad input monitor from LG that thing has come in handy for so many projects like this we're like we need to output to a bunch of displays but we don't actually want to carry a bunch of monitors all right let's start with two so this is the one that should be mirroring the output from Anthony's computer inside okay I'm gonna go check again okay Anthony I got it out put on all them no I only have one plugged in so far but it's the cloned one okay cool it's not bad at all do you mind turning the volume down a bit I can't hear myself over myself if this looks really good dang alright let's go get the other display here we go and there it is that's crazy town hey Anthony is it possible to put videos on all of them yeah okay keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going okay now maximize the first one you want to come check it out you read my mind that's actually pretty cool yeah this looks really good yeah and it's over 100 meters like that's actually 100 meters plus like six or ten feet for each of these cables and they've apparently got some improvements in the pipeline so right now these are using what was it they call it power over cable power over cable but P OE is more of the like industry standard that would allow better interoperability with other equipment and they're gonna have a p OE version of it coming down the line so in terms of how this works then basically unlike most of the consumer grade in-home streaming solutions where you can do display over Ethernet that we've explored in the past this is using a 10 gig link rather than a 1 gigabit link and the thing is that even with steam in-home streaming you can absolutely run it over a 10 gigabit switch with a 10 gigabit network card but because of the way that it is designed it will not make use of all that extra bandwidth you have available so this is what was it you said Anthony eight point something like that depending on the exact resolution 4k 30 or four K 60 at four to zero even though you don't have as much bandwidth as HDMI as long as you limit some of your settings be it resolute should be it refresh rate or be it bit depth you can get something that to my eye is not noticeably compressed over an Ethernet cable pretty freakin sick what oneplus who would say no I wouldn't Brandon wouldn't so thanks for watching guys if you disliked this video you can hit that
