before we begin make sure you have the channel notification bell turned on so you don't miss an upload with the holidays coming up we have a lot of videos coming don't miss out alright what's up guys I'm random Frank P back in episode 195 of room tour project the series where you show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas inspirations for your own setup but this week is gonna be a chill themed I mean these are gonna be more chill setups versus your overkill gaming setups we've seen anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you check it out blood started off episode 195 so first for Nathan I'm really diggin the overall color theme he has going on with like the the pinks and the oranges it mixes well with the otherwise natural themed with the wooden desk and then primarily black peripherals and stuff but I think just like I said color wise it all fits really well tonally checking out his monitor these single display is a 34 inch gallium we're even using the wallpaper and stuff again to fit the rest of a set up and while there's no RGB lighting behind the desk or monitor he has an RGB bulb in the lamp there checking out the peripherals we have the courser gaming k70 Lux RGB keyboard with the courser clave RGB Pro Mouse on the coarser mm 350 champion mousepad then for audio you can see here the audio engine a 2 plus speakers and as you might have seen in some of the wide shots for his headset the coarser avoid Pro Wireless and chilling back in the corner there we have the PC also color matching this is the Corsair crystal 460 X case in size an Intel i7 7700 K CPU with the coarser h100 ia IO got 32 gigs of coarser vengeance Pro RGB RAM on Asus Strix Z 270 F motherboard and an Asus Strix GTX 1070 graphics card so yeah I don't know when I look at this I think that's a chill gaming setup nothing about this screams overkill or overdone it's all put together nicely and organized and I feel like if you're kicking back here game at the end of the day you're probably feeling pretty chill now we have para tone and this is actually the setup that when I first saw it I thought like hey this looks really chill maybe I should have a sort of themed episode around setups like this so that is the inspiration here and you can't tell me it's not looking cool with that absolute massive window they're overlooking all the trees and stuff just gives off really good vibes so checking it out this setup is more so geared towards like audio engineering mixing and production and stuff like that as you could tell by the gear but for his monitor it was a 27-inch dell ultrasharp with the vertical one on the right side being a 24-inch from Ben Q for the peripherals we have the Das Keyboard model s Logitech G 700 Mouse and then for audio the KRK Rokit v g3 studio monitors with SRH 440 headphones now under the desk we have the PC chilling this is the cooler master mystique case inside an Intel i5 6600 K CPU with a Noctua Nhu 14 s cooler 16 gigs of g.skill ram on a gigabyte z170 gaming v motherboard and a sapphire rx 580 Nitro+ graphics card very nice very nice and then across the room which you saw before tons of instruments and stuff experience of guitars drum set I don't know squat about music but it's there fitting in you know with the overall theme of this setup like I said before for audio music production but definitely chill next up we have light struck and know your eyes are not deceiving you this one is very very similar to the setup we just showed off but it's kind of like inverted the vertical monitor is on the left side instead of the right you have a speaker's mounted on each side that is actually pretty funny these were submitted within like hours of each other ironically so alright for the primary single monitor it is the Acer 27-inch with the 22 inch AOC being mounted on that left side for the peripherals lots of audio gear and stuff again but we'll focus on some of the main stuff that I could actually talk about we have the fanatic mini streak tkl keyboard with HyperX white pbt putting key caps on there and razor Mamba tournament Edition Mouse I'm a SteelSeries quick heavy mousepad and then for audio the audio technica ath m50x headphones with the fluid audio FX 8 studio monitors mounted on each side of the monitor on the stands then as for the pc a nice little ITX build kept upon a shelf this is actually the nouveau lowsec ITX case we showed this one off recently as well in size an Intel i7 8700 case CPU with 16 gigs of course revengeance lpx ram on an asus rog Strix z 370 i motherboard and the nvidia gtx 1070 founders edition graphics card so I definitely call it a chill setup one thing I really liked it didn't even really mention was you know right in front of this big window for the natural lighting you had this nice sort of like slight blue shade for the paint on the walls I could do words talk good and that's also gonna go along with the color of the actual wallpaper for his desktop so yeah I just think it all blends really nicely and it's laid out nicely as well next up we have a mirror t he was actually on like over two years ago completely different set up this time much more on the minimal approach nice and modern looking which I can just say for this episode is chill alright so for the two displays they are both 32 inch Samsung curved monitors side-by-side so they meet up nicely in the middle there you know like I was using orange in his RGB peripherals to kind of you know accent some color in there you don't really see that too often speaking of which we have the Corsair k70 Lux RGB keyboard with Logitech g600 wireless mouse they're sitting on the MM 200 extended mouse pad from Corsair and he also has the Logitech G 633 Artemus spectrum headset but for is PC over on the right side of the setup this is the cooler master master box v cooler master loves adding master after the first master so that's a cooler master master it's just stupid either way that is the Box v case and insides of Intel i7 4790k CPU with a cryo rake h v cooler 16 gigs of HyperX fury RAM and the gigabyte gtx 980ti windforce graphics card so I really do dig the overall aesthetic to this room so see with like a black accent like that it definitely gives it like a mood you know it's a it's a moody kind of setup then you have like I said before with the orange RGB lighting bringing out the natural tones and the wooden desk but guess what this is a chill setup y'all better not be rolling your eyes now then last but not least we have Garrett and before you - now this is much much cooler than what first meets the eye there was a lot of creativity going on here so this is actually a setup built into essentially like a carrying case or he could have it all built up in there like a laptop or bring it with him on the go as like a portable desktop PC he said he wanted to do this because his old laptop was you know not really cutting it anymore and he didn't have the money to shell out for a brand new laptop so what he did was he bought a lot of parts second hand built it into this portable case so he can bring with him on the go so he's building a portable set up for a fraction of the cost of a new laptop but also then has that freedom to upgrade the components later on down the line so very very cool creative stuff here for the component to use is a 23 inch Dell monitor for the peripherals here's the logitech k400 plus keyboard which you can just snap into place when it is in the kinda like the laptop mode or taken out when it's in desktop mode he also mounted some Altec Lansing speakers which you can see under the monitor for his audio setup and as for specs the Intel i5 4570 CPU with an Asus GTX 770 graphics card you can see he adds the ample fans and stuff there for a cooling solution the subwoofer built in right next to the keyboard and stuff pretty much and then when he wants to you know take it out the components all stay in the case and the monitor and speaker there get propped up as its own display so I just think a really cool creative option and a DIY set up again better than a laptop in his situation where he built it himself second hand DIY for a lot cheaper and he has the possibility to upgrade the components later on down the line you don't see a lot of stuff like this but when I saw it I definitely thought it was really really cool and you know I didn't know where it essentially put it in a themed episode so I figured something chill like this would work out because come on that's a lot of I work but the chill set up really good job Garrett this episode is brought to I'll put a link for you in the description down below alright guys I'll
