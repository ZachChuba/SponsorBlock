[The end of the year show of MUSIC BANK! SinB eating snacks in the waiting room]
Talking about this sweet potato, it's like this here so there are strawberries, sweet potatoes, and Bacchus in here. Eunseo and Yeoreum of Cosmic Girls gave this to me. They are so lovely. They gave us this for me to share with the members. But I finished the strawberries by myself. And I gave one of the sweet potatoes to Yuju, and I'm eating one now. There's only one left, and Eunseo told me to drink the Bacchus by myself. Thank you for the food~ It looks like I put lotion drops on my face. They are pearls. The concept of my makeup today is, just a crying kid, a crying kid. SinB gave it to me. I got this gift when I woke up from sleeping, I'm sorry. I'm a sinner, distracting your sweet potato time. She gave me this when I just woke up. I was dreaming, and I still feel like I'm dreaming. It's so cold today, but you cheered for us, since early morning, I would like to give away something like this again next time. You all love sweet potatoes, right? [SinB eats the silkworm pupa, and members can't understand her]
- I think people may like or dislike it.
- I think I ate it when I was a baby~ I ate it when I was young too. Who would like some roasted chestnuts~ I still eat it because I am still young. I'm still young, you see. So I can eat it. What? It can't be 3,000 won. This is 3,000 won? [The snacks that are much more expensive than before]
It's 3,500 won. A cup of pupa? The roasted chestnuts are 5,000 won. It's so expensive. I really can't eat it. No. The insects are high in protein.. Then eat the cockroaches. Yuju Yuju Yuju!! You had mealworms with me before, Yuju. It was good. We tried cooking using the mealworms. And I heard a person eats more than 10 bugs when he or she is asleep. Yeah, Eunha and Sowon eat bugs, right. Oh really? I want to take some protein,  since I have to work out.
