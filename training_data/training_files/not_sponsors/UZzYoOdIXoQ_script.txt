this video is brought to you by curiositystream and before we begin here guys this video does contain some explicit language as well as gratuitous amounts of jazz so viewer discretion is advised what the [ __ ] did you just [ __ ] say about me little on april 24th 2020 the youtube channel vocal synthesis posted an audio file of what sounds like the rapper jay-z delivering the navy seals copy pasta that classic vintage internet image board meme now in order to get this deep fake audio the owner of the channel used the neural net tacotron 2 which is able to replicate subtleties of human speech including volume speed and intonation from simple text yes everybody they thought in the future we would have flying cars but no we have i love you know i graduated top of my class in the navy sales and i've been involved the number of secrets raised on all craters and i have over 300 confirmed kills i train in girl god bless this tacotron model was likely trained on jay-z acapellas which is why it sounds like jay-z rapping but it does not have any of the salient musical aspects that we would normally find in hip-hop music namely a steady pulse and any kind of rhyme or rhythmic scheme i love you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and i've been involved the number of secret raids on earthquake but there is something kind of musical about it rhythmic about it or something there at least that's how i'm hearing it i'm hearing some kind of musical ghost in the machine happening here with this neural net interpretation of the navy seals copy pasta maybe there is some kind of underlying musical order here i asked my friend chris mccarthy to listen to this deep fake acapella and try and orchestrate it hey i'm chris mccarthy i'm a pianist and composer living in new york city chris has this project with drummer jk kim called jkxcm where they deconstruct hip-hop classics by playing along to acapellas and turning them into jazz it's like reverse hip-hop where you have the rapper and then you're creating a new instrumental instead of somebody freestyling over the instrument since he has all this experience with real acapellas and reinterpreting music around them i thought it would be fun to try and reinterpret music around this fake a cappella i have over 300 confirmed kills i train in girl or warfare and i'm the top slab of the entire us armed forces you another to me but just another [Music] i also asked my good buddy and friend of the channel josh bailey to listen to this acapella and try and transcribe it into western notation to see if we couldn't find any underlying musical pulse dude it's like someone painted a jackson pollock and then we had to paint the same jackson pollock yeah kinda this style of music making sounds very similar to the speech melody music of composers like say hermeto pasquale whose music mimics the tones and the rhythms of the human speaking voice but you dear viewer are probably much more familiar with this style on the internet with artists like say mononyon and publio delgado and of course the meme master himself charles cornell i'm curious of doing this musical interpretation on deep fake audio with that uncanny valley translates into kind of i don't know an uncanny musical rhythm so at first i thought i was going to try to write out something that matched the pitch like mano neon does or meta basketball whoever every rapper sort of has the you know the range their voice sits in that's a worldwide emotion right everyone wants to root for the underdog i don't know if it's because it's ai but to me i would try to pick pitches out and it was much harder than if i was trying to transcribe someone just talking to me i would wipe you to [ __ ] up with precision and likes it which has never been seen before on this earth you think you can get away with saying that [ __ ] to me i just tried to listen to it until i could recite the whole thing along with the recording like i was learning lines from a play or something you think you can get away with saying that [ __ ] to me then once i had the rhythm down i was just improvising pitches i know what the rhythm is and then i'm going to let my fingers do what they want to do it's more just i'm like reciting it to myself in my head and then my fingers are just trying to keep up with my brain reciting it languages fall into one of two rhythmic categories stress-timed languages and syllable-timed languages and also mora timed languages don't worry i haven't forgotten about you japanese english generally speaking is a stress-timed language where stresses are usually organized in regular pulses which is why the clapping meme works in text you as an english speaker generally organize your speech into regular pulses consider i'm the top sniper in the entire u.s armed forces part of what makes up the uncanny valley strangeness of the neural net is that the aijz does not deliver this line that way and i'm the top slapper in the entire us armed forces instead it is delivered more syllable timed like the french language is where short syllables are grouped together and long syllables are grouped together so the stress patterns are not as immediately obvious so it's harder to feel the beat in the words themselves the rhythms seem to be more based on the relative rates of notes rather than the relationship to any underlying pulse or a grid in other words you can't do the clapping meme to that kind of rhythmic delivery and i'm the top slapper in the entire us armed forces and so when we try and translate these rhythms into western notation which is fundamentally based on the idea that there is an underlying pulse to which you can relate rhythms we get some pretty wacky results i guess you could call these syllable timed rhythms so i'm thinking of it like take it to one two three four five got it so it's like four criminal triplets that are just hocketed off of this beat yep okay that's how i yeah yeah yeah i get it [Music] i wrote like a fake set of notation as if it was in time just to approximate the ratio of the speed this seven tuplet is not actually an eighth note seven tuplet so it has the feeling of a seven tuplet without actually being a seven so i approach this chart with literally thinking rhythms don't equal rhythms they equal ratio of speed compared to what else is in that phrase it is completely inaccurate in terms of correct music notation like software hardware hardware and so like sometimes something would feel like it's in a triplet rhythm but there's five notes it's five notes and six notes but they're all 16 note triplets oh [Music] oh [Music] is it important to make a chart that has that written correct in terms of where you feel the beat or is it important to write something that my eye would glance at and play a rate of five notes that is the correct rate now there are existing styles of music that are based on this kind of rhythmic structure you might not have a steady pulse but rather relative rates of speed measured on a gradient from slow to fast traditional religious music like say gregorian plane chant does not have a steady pulse you'll also sometimes have this unmeasured approach to rhythm in opera music with the technique of wretchetative where singers will sing with the irregular and faster cadence of speech to deliver more exposition in between longer musicals there's also the aggressive and rather strange modern classical technique of spluxdema which exists somewhere between speaking and singing but to me the medium that i guess best approximates the cadence that the ai delivered the navy seals copy pasta is spoken word poetry that poetic delivery style that vaguely mimics hip-hop swagger but with none of the encoded beats and none of the embodied musical rhythm that hip-hop music normally has steel and it's not true to who's inside us because we've all had bad thoughts but they don't have to define us in other words the neural net is great if you want to hear jay-z do spoken word you speak i'm contacting my secret network just flies across the usa and your ip is be traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maker [Music] and that's just with my bare hands not only am i excessively trained in the like if i'm playing just a groove there's this like fifth band member that's the beat that we can all play with and it's there's a level of confidence we all have you don't have the benefit of that with this because it's always moving so i was like okay i just need to decide to be confident in the at in the rate of the rhythms i've like designated to myself and then just attack it the way i would a downbeat that i know it's coming up when i'm learning acapella tracks that are to a grid that's one thing but i do it pretty much the same way i just listened to it until i could like play the rhythm with this there's no grid so it's it's just sort of phrase by phrase i tried to do it maybe a sentence or two at a time and then slowly put it together one very cool thing i found out about these syllable timed rhythms is that if you pair a groove with them no matter the tempo you will start to hear those syllable timed rhythms in relationship to the groove's pulse no matter the tempo of that groove the audio of the fake jay-z in the following example is not speeding up or slowing down it's just kind of an auditory illusion based on the groove that you're hearing at the time i love you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and i've been involved the number of secret raids on all crater i love you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and i've been involved the numerous secret raids on earthquake i love you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and i've been involved the numerous secret raids on all crater all of you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and i've been involved in numerous secret raids on earthquake super cool right well it turns out if you simply speak using elongated vowel sounds on top of some kind of groove your brain will start to hear the relationship of your speaking voice to the underlying pulse unlike the real jay-z a-i-j-z does not conform to a grid but you can kind of make him sound like he is when you pair him with a groove when we decided it was going to be this thing i just looked up a ton of stuff and basically the drummer videos that do this there's always moments that have like a little snippet of a groove which is like one cool way to surprise the listener because it's like oh wow that part of this speech all of a sudden sounds like there's a groove behind it because you broke the rules we're gonna say they're all simply wrong so i knew i wanted like three or four moments that were like a groove at least it like i feel like two bars is enough to make you feel like there's a groove here i don't need my extra civic training combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use that towards paul extreme to wipe your mystery boy off the face [Music] so yeah this is what i've spent the past couple of weeks doing why why why there definitely is not any grand underlying musical order even though the ai was probably trained on jay-z rapping and there is musical order to his rapping but if we listen to the result musically and try and interpret these rhythms on our instruments we get something that i think is fairly rewarding and sounds really interesting my undergraduate degree was in classical percussion and there are a ton of percussion ensemble pieces that are written out to the note and they there are some very old ones like uh ionization is like the most famous one [Music] [Music] when you listen to it it might as well be this when you listen to that piece it might be this listen to me in isolation it does not sound related to anything [Music] the silences are what gets it's like [Music] i don't know i like the idea of playing free with limitations so you have to simultaneously focus really hard and not really give a [ __ ] what you're playing at the same time which is what i would like to ideally do when i'm improvising on a standard i think just having the rhythm be the the inspiration for what you're improvising is a really cool way to come up with new stuff because you can't phrase anything in a pattern you already know you have to just go off of what the speech is giving you honestly though it's pretty difficult to interpret these musical rhythms on our instruments in any kind of precise way i'm so used to feeling a pulse as a musician and to not have that pulse there it takes a long time to really internalize these rhythms and make it feel musical honestly that's what we did with this on a microscale i don't know about you but i just repeated the phrase every little part or every longer part until it was right i said i did it over the course of like three days well this was pretty damn complicated it was a few weeks of like trying to listen to it when i was just walking around to just get it in my bones so i felt like i just couldn't recite the whole thing even without any cues throughout this whole process i couldn't help but think that it would be actually very cool to have a text-to-speech program that did encode some kind of pulse and rhythmic information in the result sort of like i don't know like a vocaloid for wrap think about how useful that might be for a producer or a musician just type in what you want and out comes a usable musical result that might be a very creative tool now you might notice that in this video about jay-z wrapping i didn't actually include any audio of jay-z rapping and there's a very good reason for this on april 28th 2020 just four days after the initial copy pasta was uploaded jay-z's label roc nation issued a dmca takedown to the vocal synthesis youtube channel presumably because the audio of the deep fake jay-z sounded too similar to the actual jay-z the ethics of this to me are very interesting because hip-hop as a genre was based initially on illicitly sampling other musicians audio and then recontextualizing it into new forms of musical expression this is something that jay-z himself has actually been sued over but this deep fake artificially generated audio is a little bit different than that kind of copyright infringement and its implications go beyond simple musical expression it's all kind of uncharted territory if only there was somebody out there who could help us understand this just a little bit better oh hey it's devin from legaleagle what are your thoughts man so it's probably not copyright infringement because you're not using the original expression the original recording although it's certainly not cut and dry who knows copyright is incredibly complicated but the bigger issue here i think is something called misappropriation of likeness where just because it's not technically copyright infringement doesn't mean you're allowed to go around making it seem like people participate or endorse things that they did not participate in and did not endorse and here it sounds like jay-z you're using speech patterns that only exist in the way that he raps and so it sounds like he participated in this particular rap when he had no idea so under a lot of state's laws there is a claim for misappropriation of likeness where you're using someone's likeness whether it's their face or their mannerisms or in this case their speech pattern in a way that they never approved of and you might be liable for it awesome okay well thank you so much that definitely helps i don't ever want to confuse the real jay-z with the fake jay-z in this video and i certainly don't want roc nation going after me and my channel with dmca takedowns and copyright strikes copyrighted content copy pasta memes i guess and yeah this was quite a fun project so thank you so much for watching everybody
