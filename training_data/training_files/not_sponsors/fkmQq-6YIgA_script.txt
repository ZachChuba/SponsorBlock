in today's video we're testing out several methods for dyeing cloth all based on one video that dozens of you sent in for us to test once again we are here to test some Internet myths we've had a lot of people send us in some videos I think all of them actually were from a single blossom video they've done it again for us guys they just keep making this so easy here's the basic idea we had a ton of people requests that we test out some dyeing methods seen in some viral videos we're going to try them all ourselves and see if we get results that match the original video so we're gonna go through and we're gonna test them trying to copy the video as closely as possible to see if any of them work the way they do in the video first one here they have a cup they pour hot water onto a couple pennies and then they actually show pouring the blue water on I'm sure to be so angry with step there apparently copper from Penny's releases a blue dye here's a penny I found that has quite a nice blue with a very slight green tint to it question is whether water will release that dye from our jar full of pennies and turn blue I have some doubts pour this in and see what it does to our pennies see if we get a nice rich blue with a very slight hint of turquoise alright I say let's just set this to the side and see if it starts turning blue in any amount of time alright next up we have grapes and Stocking hose they took their container and they had a cloth in it we're using 100% cotton I believe it is right yes it should dye very well start labeling this in let it fill up to the level of the grape skins cool alright now we just wait for purple they weren't specifying they don't supposed to be hot water we're just assuming because they were using an electric kettle so we're just gonna set this right there and like with the copper we're gonna see if we start getting some color out of that in any amount of time turmeric and this time it said hot water so we're just gonna get that in there cool and now pour some more in we add the hot water and then we add baking soda which is supposed to turn it red what is happening the turning right turning red it's also about to make such a mess woohoo it reacts what see I just learned something about baking soda and tumor I'm not even 100% sure I'm saying the name of the spice right we're both wrong it's turmeric I'm saying it that much wrong turmeric gate that we apologized to the 30 times we said was wrong all right here's the cloths that we use when our explosion of foam these were white and gray now they are yellow and darker yellow all right well we're gonna let our spice mixture set for a bit and moving on to the next one it's rosemary okay and this one it seems to be that they're putting in water and then heating it up so I think we're gonna put this in a pot put on stove and see if it turns a bright butter yellow as the nutrients are extracted from our rosemary see we never saw it like boiling in the video so I want to keep it on fairly low so I want it hot but not boiling so we're just gonna let that sit and see if it turns yellow next up they showed how to get three different colors out of red cabbage red cabbage is pretty interesting in that the coloring in it that gives it that purple color is a great pH indicator which means that if you put an acid on it it changes to one color and if you put a base on it it changes to a different color I have three scarves in this little tray here we're gonna put hot water over all of them and then we're going to add baking soda one and vinegar to one to give an acid in base reaction and see if we get the three different colors indicated by the video right away and interestingly it's blue which is what we're supposed to get after we add I think it's the baking soda yeah that color are you supposed to happen yet that water's not even very warm now it's just been chilling there well I'm not sure what's making it turquoise right now because like I was saying normally this cabbage it doesn't turn turquoise right away it does turn the color of the cabbage we want to add vinegar to one of these and baking soda to the other is it a good enough turquoise color that we're gonna get any dye to the cloth out of it because it does look like white fabric in some blueish liquid and this one is just confusing as heck yeah it's closer to the purple color that we would expect we're just gonna let it sit let's go check on our rosemary it's been steeping for some minutes now that's a little bit of change I'm just gonna turn the heat up a tiny bit and let's just leave it look at our pennies the water has turned cloudy wants to be clean not blue water now it's dirty not blue water come on purple color you can do it that water is still hot enough to burn my fingers so next up is using eucalyptus according to the video it's going to release tannins which are a yellowy orangish color these leaves you'll notice aren't gonna look the same as the ones in the video it was just the only eucalyptus we could find so we admit this is not a perfect representation they had a method where they ran the sticks through a colander we're not gonna bother with that yeah and it showed this just soaking for a while so we're gonna let it soak for a while and see if we get any blue or yellow orange color out of it it is turning yellow there is definitely yellow in there who next up I like this one they took blackberries crushed them put them in a spray bottle crushing releases purple diet says and then they use this spray ball to get this beautiful gradient down a shirt so we've got a spray bottle we've got blackberries in there yeah we're going to crush a bunch of blackberries put them in the bottle hopefully the sprayer uptake part of the hose doesn't get too soaked with blackberry gunk [Music] all right I think we should set this aside let it dry see what happens see what result we get the spray application versus the direct application of berries and berry juice coming up we have spinach something is being put into water it says wilted spinach releases turquoise dye and yeah they just showed cloth into water and it is on an electric stove and then they just sprinkle a little bit of spinach on top and it turns turquoise our spandexy material into the water it goes a little bit of spinach toss on there yeah I think we already have more there but we want to get the maximum amount of color out of it so we're gonna try that and see what we get the next experiment is actually not about dyeing something it's about removing the dye the video shows pulling some cloth out of a washing machine that was mixed in with a red cloth and it got turned pink some of you may have experienced this I believe I have however when we tried to replicate it our darn shirt held its color way too well it just didn't spread any color over to our cloth so this we cheated a little bit we used a little bit of food coloring in some hot water and just mix it until it looked like about the right color in the video we acknowledge that we may not get the same results because we're not using the same method to dye the things pink however was still gonna try it and what it shows is taking these pink cloths putting into a pot covering it in water and adding some lemon slices which Callie has just made and then heating it up the idea is that the lemon will actually help bleach the color back out of the cloth and we should end up with some nice bright white cloths again what do you think let some things sit over the weekend and see how much color they pick up I do hope there's enough room in the fridge put the cabbage because I don't want police the cabbage out over the weekend there's a great thought Nate it's been a weekend we made fruit flies we made a lot of fruit flies most of them are gone now but we very brilliantly left grapes and lemons just sitting out and fruit flies take over but I don't think they affected the dying or not dying okay mostly not dying well no not dying the way we were shown in the video certainly let's start down here okay so row marry those Mary is supposed to seep out the nutrients we're supposed to turn yellow yes have color it's not in the color we expected so there was a little bit of yellow at first it was very mild it was not the rich butter color showing the video or thought well let's just leave it maybe that'll come apparently if you leave rosemary long enough something else happens and you get this sort of red cranberry ish well light cranberry I don't know rose color it looks like a shirt somebody wore to Woodstock and then never washed again all right eucalyptus huh we were just surprised because like the leaves looked so blue and we got yellow green oh boy and it didn't pick up a lot of the color Wow that smell it's a very strong smell the eucalyptus smell is really pungent it's not really bad if you I mean I like mixing with the cabbage however that's not wonderful so we did talk about how we were not using the same type of eucalyptus so this may not be a definitive test but we definitely did not get anywhere close to a dark reddish orange in fact we got kind of the opposite on the color wheel in our water and gross yeah pennies look at this is supposed to be this this incredible rich peacock blue color and instead we have a very clear white it almost looks like we clean pusher I think that's just in comparison to everything else so blue sort of a slight earthy scent pennies aren't exactly clean dirty it's just dirty it's a dirty cloth blackberries looks the same as when we sprayed it but now it's dry all right so this one this was our turmeric with baking soda all right guys there's another are there there we go just straight brick rust water running off of that so they had a very lovely red with a slight orange spice all of these are quite pungent it's not the shade now they had what it is we're gonna wash this all of them and just run to the washing machine that way we can see not only what color they took but if it stays all right I'm curious about this these are were our hot grape and when we started we're getting like a pale green with no hint of purple coming out of it but at some point over the weekend ah something started turning purple this maybe if this is as smooth of a color as this looks it's not the same shade of problem this is purple like the waters not even that purple that's actually like it even perfectly even put its pretty closer closer and everything else you want like a nice light lavender or a Helia trope this is uh this isn't bad okay that one actually worked I'm surprised it didn't work like they showed but it we got perfect how did our lemons do at pulling color out of our cloth our clothes pink well we're gonna have to excuse the fact there's fruit flies all over this we really didn't think through leaving sliced lemons in water so what we have is some slightly rancid lemon water juice and some very dingy looking fabric it's not red anymore no it's almost has like the very tiniest orange though certainly not back to the bright white did it well they're more expensive than bleach guys finish this one was supposed to turn turquoise and our water is a slight green color I can't even touch this without gagging wine it smells gross all right cabbage water we've got the three this is with nothing this is with baking soda this is with vinegar I just want to can we just talk about the cabbages look at these colors okay so this just cabbage with I think that's from our turmeric when it was bubbling oh yeah before we put it in alright we're gonna throw all this in the wash see how it goes that'll be we'll just see what happens well we ran everything through the wash which one was purple good here there is and there is this oh this was this was purple-ish from the spray you can see there's our blackberries this one was red from surprisingly read from the rosemary this was the turmeric which was yeah I tried to rinse this out pretty well before it went away but yellow took over and the weird thing is like we had pink we had blue when we could we had turquoise and those are gone and like they're identically gone you can find what color was with the tag so every color just washed out except the rosemary didn't wash out entirely and the turmeric clearly did not wash out entirely but and this absolutely looked like you stained yourself with some berries so can you easily a natural higher natural cloth dyes we're at like Oh 410 in terms of results that you were shown in the video and like 2 for 10 in terms of things that kind of work so many of you asked to see this one on Instagram on discord on YouTube everything here you go [Music] guys that's not all you know we've always got more if you to see hit that box up at the top for our most recent video and we'll see in the next one talk to you then [Music]
