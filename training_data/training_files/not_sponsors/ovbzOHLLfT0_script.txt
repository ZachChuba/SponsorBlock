what in the margaritaville is this it's a margarita matrix little history about the margarita according to cocktail historian david wundrich the margarita is related to a popular mexican drink the daisy now i'm gonna correct there not a popular mexican drink the daisy the daisy was a popular drink the daisy uh you can get a daisy a whole bunch of different ways in the late 1800s it was typically made with cognac or brandy actually in mexico they made it with tequila and they called it a margarita because the spanish word for daisy is margarita so anybody who tells you that this was a drink that was invented for like a famous dancer or somebody who was a singer or a star or something like that that was named margarita or that it was invented at a hotel called margarita this is not true it's i mean it's literally daisy translated into spanish that's all it is it's a daisy so here's the deal this is a margarita matrix what is it the idea is let's find the best cross-section of ingredients to use to make a particular cocktail a popular cocktail so you build a matrix that's the best way is a brute force solution try every possible combination now in truth every possible combination obviously i can't do that i had to narrow it down and so what this is is a margarita matrix using only blanco tequilas that are affordable okay none of these are crazy ultra premium i don't think and that i think covers the brands people are gonna demand that i s that to see okay what spec for this margarita am i using this is the very most basic specked margarita i could it is two parts tequila one part lime one part um triple sec one part curacao whatever it is it happens to be the orange liqueur in that given cocktail a lot of people like orange juice in a margarita my dad does a lot of people like a little you know quarter ounce or something like that a little bit simple traditionally traditionally traditionally the margarita should not include those things um and it's a shake and drink that is served up so these are half scale 2-1-1 spec margaritas uh salt the rim i actually like a salted rim on my margarita or like a 50 50 where i have the option on any given sip here's the thing for the purposes of this test that introduces a uncontrollable variable because as i'm picking things up and moving them bits of salt will drop into other glasses and i figured you know what just for a uniformity let's just do it all unsalted a margarita is a shake and drink and it really needs to be a shake and drink and a shake and drink is a completely different thing from a stir drink you can't just add cold water to it you know there's fruit pulp here that needs to be um aromatized you know like we have to oxygenate it we have to shake it it has to have that agitation so what i've done is i've poured the ingredients for each one into these and then as i go down the line i will dump that drink this cocktail straight into a shaker with some ice shake it up on the spot and immediately dump it right back into the glass so i can drink and test it very fresh right out of the shaker while it is still full of air full of life and of course i can go back and do a comparative test after if i need to go back and forth on this line a little bit so be it but the idea is that each drink will be presented at least on its first sip straight from the shaker as it should be bar run is not hard to hit i did this whole thing one other time i did a manhattan matrix okay where i drank um 42 manhattan so i'm gonna put a link to that episode below some things went wrong in that episode i had to record a special opening because like what happened was i did not quantify how large a sip my sip was i have since measured the size of my sip my casual sip is like an ounce and a half because i have a gigantic joey brown mouth nobody's perfect i don't know if you know who that is he's a pre-code actor from the 30s that's in a blog post that you could find on my patreon that's the kind of thing that interests you it's at patreon.comrank so the show has deemed it satisfactory to purchase me this lovely stainless steel spit bucket so that i may spittoon my tastes when we do these kinds of multi-drink episodes whether or not you see it being used in the actual edit that actually comes out here i i can't promise that it will it might make for bad content rest assured i am using the spit bucket to protect myself i do not want to encourage any kind of binge drinking or bad habits with alcohol right um doing this as safely as i possibly can and the other factor too is that when i did the manhattan matrix we were in full-on lockdown uh since then i'm not alone i have i have a spotter here i have meredith my co-producer is with me we are vaccinated humans uh vax crew you represent i don't know that sounds terrible okay so i guess that's it really i'm ready to start shaking and tasting shake and taste oh shake it taste i should make a pin out of that that's a good one so first drink here we go i'm uh it in okay margarita one here we go this is fortaleza with triple sec and lime beautiful color looks like a margarita i gotta tell you right off the bat that's a very well balanced margarita so one thing i can tell you about this the higher the walker is that this is sweet this is way sweeter than the other ones sort of our bottom shelf option here see how it holds up too it might be very interesting if that is as good as or beats other things and this unsweetened speck it can be a little tart a little dry here fortaleza crossed with him walker and lime i don't feel like it's overly tart or too dry at all this is nicely balanced it might be missing some sharpness it might be a little too round a little too sweet maybe honestly yeah cause i was expecting something a little bit more bracing so it's missing there but not bad let's go to dry curacao at k-e-e-p-s dot com slash how to drink okay back to the show okay let's move on to ford laser with dry curacao that has an extra dimension to it for delays with higher walkers much sweeter for leaves with dry cures how though it's not too dry it's not very dry but there's an extra turn in the evolution there what is it that i'm getting it has a very um the lime is a little bit more present for starters it has a little bit more acidity to it i can't put my finger on what that extra specific evolutionary point is it's very distantly adjacent if this makes any sense to a bubble gum note that you might get from a bourbon because sometimes bourbon and whiskey's will have that a little bit it's not the same thing or maybe if it is it's just like a very tiny hint just a wisp of it but it does add an extra twisty turn to the evolution that is of interest it's interesting so on the merits i would say that that's probably better but this is easier to drink because it's sweeter so depending on who you know you're making it for they might actually prefer this so moving on we're gonna do fortaleza with the cointreau i got to do a little uh short film thing with cointra they put me in like a little mini romantic comedy uh i'll put a link to that below they'll appreciate that maybe you'll appreciate it it was silly it was fun and so i like quantro we're good friends i like them a lot but they didn't pay for this episode so they're on the chopping block okay so here we go cointreau fortaleza i think there might be some i know we didn't add any salt that has a saltiness to it it's the hardest it's the most heart of the three it is the most dry most bracing least sweet of these three i wouldn't send any of these back though the variations you know all fortaleza they're all pretty good so this is now fortaleza with grand marnier now i did an episode a long time ago called what is triple sec i shot that in the living room with my old apartment on an iphone i think in my findings i discovered that grand marnier and dry curacao were pretty similar so we'll see maybe this will be a lot like the other one one question you might be wondering is why blanco tequila well although i typically would make mine with a reposado i think really this is a drink that calls for a blanco traditionally it would be made with blanco any guide you look up is probably going to recommend using a blanco probably most people make theirs of broncos it just seemed like i had to narrow some variables down because otherwise i'm looking at thousands of bottles of tequila um and just and how to make the playing field level well there are going to be blancos we're going to look all broncos [Music] no that's nothing like anything else i don't like it this is the one i don't like there's like a banana thing going on in there there's a little bit of a banana funk fruit thing that none of the other three had it's still tart it's not sweet i mean it's probably sweeter than the cointreau i'm gonna bring my spit bucket because this kind of motion is where i get into trouble going back and forth yeah it's sweeter than that but not sweeter than this not sweeter than the triple sec by comparison this tastes like candy this tastes like taking sour patch kids and melting them down or something almost but hold on the real question is how does it compare to the dry curacao dry carousel tastes so fresh it has such a lofty airy freshness to it compared to the others i really like that now that i've gone back and forth let's try this again there's like a weird off note in there it's a it's a little bit like a rum funk but it's not desirable here i don't love that sorry let's move on to the jose cuervo 1800 okay so jose cuervo with the triple sec very sweet very sweet i'm curious to see how it compares to the other cuervo i said cuervo i meant the other triple sec i gotta tell you what in the presence of this triple sec i get no difference between these two they taste identical all i taste is a sweet orange liqueur the tequila is kind of lost and these are pretty young tequila these are all blanco tequilas i should have brash flavors that are loud both of these are enjoyable both are very sweet though they're sweet margaritas but i can't tell the difference and i can tell you i can tell the difference between these two tequilas so okay this is jose cuervo 1800 maybe i should just say 1800 because i took cause they were off the bottle uh crossed by curacao by the way i mentioned that before uh whoa i made something yeah it took cozy quaver off there why'd they do that and some people were in the comments thought like there was some cancel culture [ __ ] which isn't a thing but in actual alley it kind of was in that jose cuervo i think got a reputation for like frat binge drinking and just like cheap ass tequila and so they didn't want that association anymore as far as i know and they switch it to 1800 and i'm gonna confirm that after i shoot this and if i'm wrong this doesn't exist here we go 1800 and try a cursor that has that bubble gum note again check my palette that has like a really kind of long lasting um note in the evolution of like this very pleasant bubble gum specifically the little piece of bubble gum that was at the bottom of a screw ball uh that ice cream cone thing on the ice cream truck and uh if you were kidding when i was a kid so the cuervo dry carousel was actually the 1800 dry curacao is really interesting that's actually really good it's a little different than the rest it's well balanced it is tart balanced by a bit of sweetness with some interesting notes in the evolution that i'm not finding elsewhere so that is a good combo this is becoming interesting now we're seeing how different modifiers work better or worse with different spirits and that's good that means this episode isn't totally a waste of time it's not just like well whatever you do it's going to be best with this you know let's do 1800 with the cointreau let's see how the 1800 is with the cointreau okay here we go jose cuervo or 1800 i should say with cointreau [Music] it's okay it's tired up front it's a little sweet on the back it doesn't have any different flavor notes that come up before like it does with the the dry carousel where you get some interesting bubble gummy notes um it's just tart sweet not bad maybe not the best pairing for the 1800 okay here we go uh 1800 and grand marnier i like that do i like that i don't know it has an unusual turn in it i think ultimately that tastes like a less sweet version of the higher walker's circle sec i still think that the this one had the most interesting evolution notes no question so for the 1800 the dry cure sounds the best now i'm going to say there's slightly different types styles of margarita but let's do this my favorite from the fortaleza was the cuantro my favorite from the 1800 was the dry curious out let's see how they compete against each other and then we'll keep doing that as we go down the line for the laser with um cointreau 1800 with dry curacao it's tough call i honestly i think i like the 1800 the dry cure side a little better it's a little sweeter now i like the cointreau for laser just slightly better just slightly i'm trying to imagine like it's a really hot day i'm in direct sunlight it's like 95 degrees which one's more refreshing and it's the the drier one so let's move on to don julio blanco with triple sec wow the don julio stands up to the triple sec a lot better the triple sec is moderated it tastes less sweet here than it does in the 1800 and i'm going to assume the four delays as well that one just tastes like orange candy that's not bad i kind of like that it's a bit of the sweeter end of the spectrum but it's not too sweet at all julio and triple sec interesting okay it's funny too i haven't had a margarita really long time and somebody called me out on my recipe not having any sweetness in it and i was like i just made one in a while and i was like yeah i don't know i wonder if i still feel that way i do i still like them unsweetened like this this is way better they don't need sugar they're fine okay so here we go don julio and dry curacao it's like an off note there there's like a bitterness to that that i don't really love of between these i think the don julio pairs better with the triple sec better it needed the extra little sweetness but it's like so there's some notes in here that are taming the sweetness of the triple sec but the curacao which is less sweet is a bad pairing i'm gonna bet that the triple sec is the best one of this line which is fascinating to me fascinating truly fascinating okay so here we go don julio don julio with co-entero [Music] weird okay you know what it is this is a terrible tasting note and i'm gonna tell you i don't find it entirely unpleasant it is unique and it's probably undesirable it could be an acquired taste i'm gonna pass on it it's not my fave but what the note is is it tastes like like the fluid you pour onto a charcoal grill to light it up like the smell of grill starter fluid there's just a touch of that note that kind of metallic sweetness i don't know what you would call that smell because it doesn't quite smell like gasoline like it has its own aroma but it has that kind of a flavor like that smell in addition to the other standard things that you would find in a margarita that's what stands out a little fuelly if i wasn't doing a side by side i might not even detect it as being like a standout thing it's pretty subtle but doing a stand by side side by side i don't think it's what i would pick if i was picking a margarita for myself that said if i didn't have another margarita right next to it made a different way to compare to it would i say oh this is weird probably not i'd probably just be like that's fine so that was the don julio cross by cointreau not a good combo interesting to note for lays across my cointreau my favorite fortaleza um so interesting so far to the don julio i like best with the the hireman walker so this is uh don julio with the grand marnier is it grand marnier or grand marnier is there a d no there's a d it's grande i always pronounce it grand marnier do we go mid-atlantic with it honey yes darling we prove we pronounce it in the mid-atlantic style with round tones garand monet moses supposes better finishing start it starts out overly bitter and it evolves to a sweeter more rounded out place but it starts out bitter unpleasant yeah i don't love that oh yeah it's bad aftertaste so interestingly the don julio seems to benefit from sweetness and to that end the triple sec is the best expression for the don julio now what's interesting about that is that i quite liked this when it was all said and done i thought this was quite good don julio a triple sec but how does it compare to my sofa reigning champ the fortaleza and cointreau four laser cuantro has a more delicate evolution a little rounder it's a little bit better a little more interesting but this is not bad this is i mean that is a much more expensive cocktail so i mean julio triple sec is right behind it in terms of being on point and actually i got that you too i think it's sort of telling that they have like almost the exact same color and visual presentation so i would say these two drinks weirdly are very similar with this one edging it out in terms of just having a better up front a better opening a rounder more interesting easing into all the flavor and stuff like that than the julio but this isn't bad with the triple sec so let's move on to espalon um a tequila i don't think i've ever had actually espalo espelon espanol tequila espelon with uh triple sec here we go very sweet that's kind of like the ford laser with the triple sec this one had a late arriving tarp turn a little tart note that came up that made it a little bit more interesting but it's very sweet not bad but very sweet okay espelon with the uh dry curacao so this is uh espalone with dry curacao i started out interesting but it turned bad that is a terrible combo oh man it started out with a really nice like familiar kind of bubble gummy kind of cognac note which was nice and then somewhere along the evolution it just turned into like burning rubber that was truly um bad and i don't normally just say bad but i honestly that is a note that i don't think anybody will enjoy i think we can say that burning rubber is objectively bad taste i mean and then i'm gonna i'm gonna correct myself because i don't know that that's true because people really like super you know brutal mezcals and and um isla scotches the thing about that though is that that's not a margarita right like if you want that you want that you're gonna find that in those spirits that you're looking for you wouldn't be asking for a margarita if you expected burning rubber so i'm gonna correct myself a second time and say that in this context of it being a margarita it's bad i would not recommend that dry curacao and espalon combination i think that's bad um i just think it's [ __ ] bad okay let's move it along espalone and koantaro arms are getting tired espelan and cuatro espolan en cuantro es belong en cuantro espalon espalon and contro i think you have to say it like that espalon i don't know enough about tavella telenovelas to make any appropriate jokes about telenovelas here but i would if i did okay espelano quanto so here's the thing this has a very very nicely balanced opening the tarte sweet combo is in perfect harmony on the front of the string and that lingers for a little while and it evolves it seems like it's going in this very round pleasant tart balanced perfect kind of way and then just this little bit of sometimes it's burning rubber but i think maybe it's sometimes it's just like um like um disinfectant like cleaner like kind of thing very subtle very very subtle so subtle that to be perfectly honest it still might be it might be my favorite esp alone because it's so subtle but it is not desirable it is an off note it's a very subtly often a subtle off note but it means it's just shy of perfect again that's so far i think my favorite of the espalons so let's try the grand marnier espelano and grand marnier it tastes like like a limeade doesn't even taste like alcohol overly bitter overly tart i don't hate it it might be my second favorite of the esplans um i think the cointreau responds better yeah definitely overall espelon i already know the answer this um i prefer the fortilaser to the cointreau and the espalon is not my favorite tequila in this lineup all of these are serviceable drinks it's just if you're gonna go splitting hairs i think that the other tequila's performed better in general we're going to take a short break to get this camera over my head turned back on and also to add one more row of drinks we realized that we had neglected to include patron in this lineup that was a mistake so we've corrected it the patron is back in the show and so i got to go back and do this patron row and we thought about putting the patronus at the end but that would have been shifting everything which would have changed the alignment we left our lime juice in the shot it would have meant shifting everything so we just put at the beginning and so we're gonna do the patron row so if you were waiting for the patron it's time for patron patron and uh triple sec it's not bad patron's another one that's like drying out the triple sec pretty well that's interesting i don't eat that that's not bad at all it is pretty one-dimensional it's just sweet and tart in balance do you get a lot tequila notes no not really maybe there's a little grassiness to it that might be true for all of these as well by the way but it does seem to knock down the sweetness of the triple sec which is good if you're working with triple sec right okay patron and dry cure sound i'll say this it's unusually tart for the dry curacao dry curacao usually presents as a little more character this really pairs it down to just being tart there's really nothing else going on there which i mean i think in my brain that makes a lot of sense because patron paired well with something very sweet so something that's a little moderated in sweetness it's probably going to be overpoweringly tart makes sense okay moving along so this is patron with cointreau that's bone rye that is so tart wow ah that's too tart honestly that tastes just a little bit like vomit in my mouth just a little tastes like vomit actually a touch that's too tart like bile it tastes like bile okay so now let's do patron with grand marnier not bad honestly ounce for ounce i like about the triple sec this is still a little too tart so for the patron i think my favorite is the triple sec and if i were to compare that to my favorite from the fortaleza which so far is my reigning champ i think way more character here you get a lot more of the grassy agave notes of the tequila with this pairing than do with this pairing and yet it's balanced whereas here it's not balanced let's move on to casamigos this is of course famously the george clooney tequila i heard that when they were testing names they considered clunquila but they decided that that was not a good name for it clinquilla it tested poorly in all markets actually all of them okay here we go um casamigos and triple sec so here we go cass amigos the house of friends i guess that means casamago's house friends friends house friends friendly house is that friendly house house of friends friends in a house house with friends house friends houses that are friends uh casamigos that is a candy-like cocktail there is like a legit cotton candy aftertaste to that that is really kind of surprising actually um that is sweet candy-like and surprising which that's cool less candy-like in its sweetness than the fortaleza with the triple sec but yet more like specifically has a cotton candy aftertaste you know that's interesting okay uh this is casamigos with dry cure sound i like this bottle under my left arm i can use it as a rest it's making things a little easier for me okay here we go casamigos with dry curacao so that cotton candy finish is a cass amigos thing that is casamigos because i'm getting it here as well i like it it's cool i i like this even better it's balanced and tart and not too sweet but it has that really cool like cotton candy finish which is just fun i mean you don't see that a lot that is enjoyable i like that a lot i'm curious to see how this goes on the next one uh i gotta say right now our cast of amigos might be my fave for all of these just because it's so unexpected yet balanced in both of these drinks and surprising but not um not in a way that detracts from it being a margarita at all like it's just like an extra little plus a little something extra i like that damn it george you beautiful bastard you're a perfect man and you make perfect tequila too i got nothing on you george so casamigos with cuantro let's see how it performs the cointreau takes away the the aftertaste of cotton candy oh it's there it's just really subtle it's almost um ephemeral it's almost like as if you're smelling a whiff of it like a mile down the road you're on your way to the carnival or something like that so in that case i would say that it is kind of diminishing what is unique about this tequila and cool i would say that that is not my fave so far my favorite for casa amigos is still the dry curacao okay moving on let's finish out casamigos this is casamigos with grand grandma we've had an incident it is the first time i've broke a bottle in this bar you're a beautiful bastard all right well i'll just put you back there well i'm just gonna keep going okay so this is casamigos with grand marnier surprisingly dry very very tart but we still have our cotton candy finish so i don't hate that on the whole i prefer the casamigos with the dry curacao but the grand marnier might be my second favorite for the casamigos kasamigo's pretty good casamigo strike curacao versus fortaleza cuantro i gotta say casamigos dry curacao is not my favorite this is now the winner well i've saved the last for last um and it is this stuff called um la trumba the tromba which was tromba tequila which was a kind of a whim buy i just saw and bought it and then in the process of doing this we broke the bottle so here is it's edifice but we'd already poured our shots into these cocktails so let's see how it performed despite now being razor sharp and a a health hazard because it might be the winner we don't know okay this is tequila tromba tequila trombo blanco [Music] yeah that's pretty good with the triple sec that's not bad at all there's like um a minty sort of finish to it not minty but like in the way that i feel like you sometimes get like menthol notes on tequila's and i'm getting that here with the triple sec pairing otherwise it's um on the sweeter end of the spectrum as everything with the triple sec has been pretty much but enjoyable with a strong menthol finish which is interesting not minty not cold like mint mint mint like brushing your teeth but like that menthol taste i hope that conveys okay here we go this is uh i'm sorry tequila trauma to get tequila trombone with dry curacao like fresh cut grass and peanuts weird fresh cut garage peanuts and a little bit menthy it's not bad it's pretty good balanced tart not overly sweet okay tequila trumbo with cuantro trembo cuantro very well balanced on the tart end of the spectrum unsweet dry interesting sweet grass kind of finish but ultimately my initial reaction was like uninspiring it's just like very s it's just like a tart thing it's not a lot going on in there um it's not blowing my mind kind of that menthol thing just showed up shows up late okay and so that brings us to tequila trombo blanco with grand marnier that i don't like it's just overly tart it's super tart aggressively unpleasantly tart honestly for the trombo tromba it's very sweet by comparison i think the dry curacao was the best bet for that one i think of this 28 drink matrix my favorite one is this casamigos with the dry curacao by far it's so interesting i've just i mean to just take lime juice dry curacao and tequila and get something that tastes like yeah of course you get lime sour sweet and sour margarita flavors but also like all that fresh cut grass and stuff that you get with like a good tequila but also like the bubble gum and and um cotton candy the bubble gum and cotton candy thing it's just so unique it's very cool and it takes nothing away from it as a margarita i don't find it off-putting at all i think that's fascinating the overall i liked the dry curacao best with all of these although amusingly not with the tequila that i often cite is my favorite tequila but in fairness i don't have the most cemented opinions on tequila so i picked one i liked it i have no opinion you know i don't object to it i've also i've also often cited casamigos as one that i like a lot so most of the mostly dry curacao was very good and then the follow-up to dry curacao i liked quite a few with the cointreau and the triple sec is very sweet so the triple sec it's interesting it's like the cheap way to go and if you have a cheap tequila that you kind of want to hide it also will work well with that it also also happens to work really well with some of these louder tequilas like the patron or the espalon or i think the don julio i also liked that but we'll check that anyway the grand marnier didn't work out well in any of them it was just bad i don't think grand marnier belongs in a margarita let's say that that's a finding from this episode this has been matrix number two the margarita matrix if you enjoyed this and you're still watching and you were hungry for more why don't you check out the uh the manhattan matrix also known as the episode that tried to kill me i yeah i think probably the next matrix will be a dry martini why don't you let me know in the comments which matrix you actually
