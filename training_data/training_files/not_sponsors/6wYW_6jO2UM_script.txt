♪ Jordan's Messyges ♪ Well everybody, here I am yet again. You need my help, of course. You guys, you aren't perfect yet. Not everybody can be. So let's get to your questions. Hopefully there's some relationship ones in here, Josh. Well, my opinion—and my opinion is pretty much always right, Josh. We've never received a messyge reply that has said that I have been wrong, I'm assuming. JOSH: Right, I don't think you've ever gotten one. I don't know. Never. I would say that you—there are two things that will probably happen to you. Number one: you will—I hate that you have to hear this, it's not hard to say—but you will probably be friendzoned at some point in your life. I don't know if it's gonna be with this guy, okay, but you've just gotta prepare yourself. 'Kay? Don't put all your eggs in one basket. 'Kay? Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Because if he's talking to this other girl, that means he has options. Okay? And if you guys—it's just—it could be— It's better to be in the "I don't care"-zone than to be in the friendzone. You wanna know what the real question in this messyge is? See, you always gotta read into the real question of the messyge. The real question is that right now, you are a liar. - (JOSH LAUGHING)
- I hate to say that. That was actually really harsh. But let me expand. You are a liar because you have made up a story, fib—it's not just a fiblet. You're actually continually lying about this made-up relationship with a made-up boy. Okay? You need to stop because ... JOSH: But if she's moving away soon, what's it matter? Okay, Josh, let's put it this way. I can't think of a good example. - Say I shot somebody, killed them, murdered.
- (JOSH LAUGHING) And I said, "It's not gonna matter. I'm leaving town." (JOSH LAUGHING) It's not gonna hurt my conscience. Guess what? Later on, it'll come back to haunt you when the cops start knocking on your door. You don't have to tell—Okay, let's put it this way. You don't have to tell them that you've made this up. I don't think that that's necessary. I would just stop with the whole thing. Now if they ask you, "Hey Meg, why have you stopped talking to your guy friend?" then you could say, "Oh yeah," and then you're gonna have to tell them. - (JOSH LAUGHING)
- Because there's nothing else to say if you don't wanna be a liar anymore. We all know that girl at youth group, super flirty. But this is what I am a little confused about, Jack. - Is that his name? Jack?
- JOSH: Jack. Yes.
- Jack. Jack. I am confused because is it basically like she is destroying the youth group with her flirtatiousness? She's ripping the group apart limb from limb (LAUGHING) because of the amount of flirtatiousness that she has in her? Or is it that you like this girl a little bit, don't want to admit it, but you're a part of the problem? Because your flirtatiously-aware nature ... which is a new thing ... that is the issue. Now it's really hard to get into this messyge, really into the nitty-gritty, because I don't have all of the information. You've really removed yourself from the situation, honestly. You've said that, you know, she's kind of a problem. But she's only a problem if people are letting her be a problem. 'Kay? Jack, I'm talking to you, buddy. Don't give in to the overwhelming flirtatiousness. 'Kay? You've known this guy for 8 years. He's tried to get a little something-something on the side for 3 and God knows what else. So I would tell you when he starts to go to prom and tries to get a little something-something on the side with this other girl, I would tell you to forget about him. Okay? I know it's gonna be hard. He's known you for 8 years. Okay? That's a long time. But it's done. (JOSH LAUGHING) Don't take his text messages or his calls when he comes back begging because this other girl has figured out his tricks as well. He will be alone and he will be gone. - And he'll probably be banned from high school as well.
- (JOSH LAUGHING) I am so glad that the views on Messyges just keeps going up and up and up. The YouTube analytics graph is about to explode out of our iPhones. Guys, if you have a question, if you have one—I know you do—messyges@messyges ... whatever it is. I shouldn't even give it out because we have thousands of messyges that I will never answer. I feel bad. You guys need my help. I can't all the time. But when I do, I really get it spot-on. Don't be messy. And leave good messyges.
