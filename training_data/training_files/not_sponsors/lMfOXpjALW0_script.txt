and we're back back at you with another weigh-in show how's it going hope your day's been great we got some news for you such news intel invests a billion dollars to meet 14 nanometer demand this year billion dollars also the amazon anti-union video has leaked they sent it to whole foods or something controversial elon musk getting sued not by some little backyard yokel either by the sack security is an exchange commission because he's been fraudulent yeah we'll get into that no sex no drugs no violence no money from me then on apple's streaming service we'll talk about that later as well it's time for the intro [Music] oh man [Music] honey [Music] yeah remember they sounded so bad to the people who are getting called if you have the sound board you're sitting there you got your computer speaker up to the phone you're just going hi how are you i'm a cop you idiot and the person you're losing it you're losing it the person on the phone's like huh it sounds bad like a terrible speaker recording what's happening i used to love um what was it called so there was the ventrilo voice service i used to love ventrilo is that like before you type in and it speaks out no no this is like like before discord i think teamspeak i don't know if teamspeak was around when ventrilo was originally around but like they eventually became like the two platforms for a while and people kind of left ventrilo and it was team speak for a while and then skype and all this other kind of stuff came around and the discord finally got rid of skype and all that junk but back in the day there was ventrilo the name is ringing a bell and i just don't know and one of my favorite things used to be because you could bind keys on your keyboard to sound bored to play through so it totally got rid of that like quality issue that you were just talking about yeah and people could i guess you could have a levels issue still you could but if people like tone it in all that kind of stuff and there was people who would do ventrilo pranks um oh yeah that's oh wait is that the one the duke nukem one yes yeah yeah yeah yeah this was amazing yeah yeah tree little harassment yeah that's what they call it duke nukem style you gonna put that on your screen put it up uh yeah there's a famous one and sheila pranks this duke nukem style one was huge ah okay the person he's talking to on that one is it nine million views and this was uploaded in 2007. is that a boy or a girl this was big that he's talking to you i do i always thought it was a young boy i think it's a girl we can't you know people know people uh is is there a name for the the person like debbie or something i don't know whoa all right we're not gonna play it i'm here to chew gum uh i love that everyone should watch that person's angry but there's there's some really good ones one of my favorite one is just someone has a sound board of this like random girl just talking about nothing important and it was my fear because he would just jump into channels and you know like the classic nerd like oh my god girl yeah cool and it would just be like yeah like on fridays sometimes me and my friends will like go to the store and i'll like buy a chocolate bar and everyone's like oh yeah that's so cool it was so awesome i have heard that you just used to love it one time we were pranking people with the sound boards and we're just about done and then my friend goes one more one more one more and he dials it in and we're using a sound board from the movie phone booth okay yeah it was a key for southern movie with uh colin fit not colin farrell right is that his name will ferrell colin farrell call him fur no i'm not calling for there's a dude from pride and prejudice anyway there's a dude in a phone booth and then yeah the guy who's talking on the phone allegedly has a sniper rifle pointed at him so he stays in the phone booth the whole time yeah so there's a soundboard based on that and it's a creepy soundboard and that we call this person and it's a woman who answers and then the soundboard is real creepy it's saying like colin farrell yeah i have a 32 calibers or like semi-automatic sniper rifle pointed directly at you like oh my goodness obviously gun nuts i don't know guns that's like stats are wrong or whatever but it's really bad you could have gotten a lot of trouble for this and um so okay it's like mildly funny we prank this person we hang up a little while later so as soon as i tell you what happens next you're gonna understand what happened but i didn't understand for weeks a few weeks later or a while later my mom was like like your friends tell your friends not to call here or like someone some creep called me and told me all this stuff and i was like shut up mom what are you talking about and then i was like my buddy i pranked my own mom my friend typed in my mom's number and i didn't even i remember you recognize a voice i remember when she picked up thinking like do i know that person but i didn't i didn't actually recognize the voice and uh yeah i pranked my own mom and then i didn't even realize oh my there's so many points in the story where i could have realized that's hilarious yeah it was pretty bad anyways actual topics if you want to go down an awesome hilarious rabbit hole on youtube and you don't mind some bad language because sometimes the the people reacting get pretty angry check out ventrilo harassment really funny some of them suck but some of them are really funny but here's the other thing about my mom she thought it was real she didn't know it was a sound board like everybody else she thought like she may not have thought that that was actually happening to her but she thought that she was talking to a person not a right not a sound board so i remember being like ah it doesn't make sense all right anyway real news uh my favorite one if you guys can find it is uh a guy's talking in wow and one of his friends records him talking over ventrilo and just plays back himself talking just to like mess with him and there was one part where he goes like i think it's like three strength like three strength three strand leather belt and then goes like and the guy recorded like that weird his like weird voice thing at the end and his statement and just constantly played it back to him just drives him nuts it's hilarious now that you say that it all makes sense i have a friend who used to say those words all the time and i never knew what it was from leather belt thing yeah yeah yeah yeah what are you saying hilarious this is like a decade ago it's i haven't heard it in probably yeah like 10 years so i don't remember the exact line but it's something like that there's all those you ever have those weird memes that like you say for years and years and you don't even like i i'm not even sure if i saw this video but one thing i still say once in a while is oh my god i love the map dust it's just like a same deal but from cs yeah level 18 four-strike two-stem leather belt yeah there we go heck yeah i love it anyways uh intel they invest a billion dollars to meet 14 nanometer demand bob swann intel's cfo and interim ceo if you watch previous wan shows you'll know that the ceo left the company issued an open letter to the company's customers and partners today in the letter he addressed light uh tight supply on some of the company's products mainly their lower end entry-level stuff they admit it outlining the set of actions until it's taking to tackle this problem he said uh this that there is a surprising return to pc tam or the total addressable market like the amount of people interested in buying as far as i know um there's there's yeah there's there's pc tam growth which there hasn't been since i believe yeah 2011. it's modest growth like in his letter he cites all these different stats of like our cloud computing business grew 25 this year something else grew 43 but then they don't say what the pc business grew they just say i think modest growth i think the point isn't necessarily that it's like oh it's so huge it's that it's growing at all we haven't had any pc tam growth uh since 20 so for like the last seven years so that's that that is a pretty big deal regardless and it wasn't expected as it hasn't happened in seven years and a lot of speculators have been saying that it wouldn't uh but they're thinking that it's just it's fairly natural it's from the interest of people into gaming and all these other things well the spin that he puts on is that like they're doing such a dang good job that people are so interested in the new cpus that everybody wants to upgrade totally man yeah that's definitely it maybe it's just that everyone's 2600 case are just finally getting too old but maybe that's it um there's also intel is also prioritizing production of xeon and core processors uh to serve the high performance segments of the market we'll get into why that matters later and supply in general is tight particularly like we already said in the entry level pc market intel believes they have at least the supply to meet the full year revenue outlook expected in july which was 4.5 billion higher than their january expectations so this reassurance that he issued everybody um apparently has inspired confidence because their stock price went up like between three and five percent at the same time that amd's went down so it appears to be a zero-sum game um so i guess intel went from like 45 to 47 and then amd went from 33 to 30 or something like that last time i checked it was a few hours ago though so i guess it's it's good people believe the bops one but why don't we break down just exactly what's happening here from a manufacturing perspective uh so when you're running in a fab there's a certain amount of wafers of cpu cores you can make or dies you can make uh per month essentially that's your output is how many of these wafers you can put out per month and a cpu that has way more cores on it is like literally going to physically take up more of that wafer right so if they wanna one wafer is gonna have fewer dies on it if they wanna have these bigger cpus which they are because they're worth more money to them where they get more profit and there is an increase of demand for those cpus i think amd has done a great job of marketing uh cpus with higher core counts which is great because that's awesome because i think everyone wants that and people are jumping on board and wanting intel's version of those kind of high core count cpus as well which is increasing demand and taking up more space on these wafers right you also brought up something earlier which is where like um if you take up uh like like you need a block so if you take up a corner yeah it's like if you got a bucket and you're filling it with lego and you had those giant lego pieces you might only get like eight of them in your bucket yeah but if you had the same like weight of lego blocks but they were tiny pieces you could they would all just fit in so much more nicely which is why they're gonna mix up like there's the binning process and they're gonna mix up like they're gonna have some of the smaller ones edging out corners and the bigger ones and stuff but as you put more of these bigger ones in you're reducing the over amount the overall amount of real estate like the absolute number of of course you can put on a waiver is reduced when the dye size is bigger but they're you're saying they're going to mix them up you ever seen one of those cross sections i used to work at a place in forestry and they had a poster on the wall that showed a cross-section of like i guess it was like a lumbering industry poster oh like how they showed a log like they cut a log down and they showed all the little like two by fours a two by four will go there and a four by six will come out of the middle yeah that might be relatable to you i love those like explosion things yeah or whatever what's that either way when well when you take like a car or a lot oh yeah or whatever and you explode it you pull all the parts apart so you can see like where everything is and stuff it's cool um i think i know what poster you're talking about i think i've seen the same thing oh really yeah i don't know every kid yeah had that on their wall we're all from like forest land canada um so yeah each each wafer can have multiple cpus as we're saying uh blah blah blah this is just a bunch of what we were just saying yeah so all of that is on on the 14 nanometer die so they are trying to allocate yeah yeah the 14 nanometer node i should say and they're trying to get as many of the fabs on the 14 nanometer node to produce these high end core i9 and xeon 28 core chips what happened because of that was that the low end of the market like the what is it the hcl3 yeah no h310c jesus that lower end chip caught the shaft because it's on the same node but it's not getting any priority because it doesn't make them as much money so in order to meet demand for that they made it a completely new node a 22 nanometer version just to get the supply up of that meanwhile they're still trying to focus on the 10 nanometer node which they say they're making gains on i don't think that they're gonna they can't afford to not spend money on that yeah so this new this new billion dollars um that's just on top of it's on top of 14 billion that they already they already put out for cap expenditure in 2018 so this total of 15 billion is actual record and this billion dollars can be put into the various fabs in oregon arizona ireland and israel that produce on the 14 nanometer node is it crazy how much is that going to make a difference is it a lot no one knows how they're spending the money yeah that's the thing yeah and where is the money coming from is it just in their own coffers i mean probably did they do you think they had just enough like revenue kicking around do they have to take shareholder dividends dude this is probably reallocated from a different cash bank just like okay we'll just we'll just drop a cool billion boom yeah i'm sure i'm sure they've got money in reserve and if they're like hey we need to crank up production because we're just going to make a ton of money because we'll sell everything that we make if we crank up production with a billion dollars then that's a pretty safe bet i guess if they're like we are not going to be able to produce enough it's low risk match supply yeah exactly and then if they're and if they're like hey we can spend a billion dollars and that will make it so that we can produce enough to match the demands and then they're just like hey well we just get to sell a whole craft had more cpus yeah and make up the money they must have the money sitting around because if they if it was the case that they had to like dude sell back their own stock then you would have seen the stock price dip and that didn't happen so it can't be that you know this is one of my favorite things to look at you're googling what are you googling how much money does nintendo have in the bank oh that's only as as of 2015 though nobody can see what you're looking at no i know i just wanted to look up the number um so like one of my favorite things to talk about every once in a while is nintendo because nintendo um i suspect compared to intel they're a relatively small company in terms of uh capex market cap market cap capital expenditure as well for sure um probably even literally just like employees um i don't know but i i'm assuming they're a much smaller company we can look this up but people will always talk about like during the wii u phase yeah nintendo's very spiky um and during the wii u phase people are always talking about like is nintendo even going to survive but they've got so much money in the bank like you can see my jaw dropped is nintendo way bigger no nintendo had it from the fiscal year 2010 to 2018. nintendo okay nintendo had a total of 5500 employees 5500 employees dude cactus club has 5 000 employees and no one in the us even knows what that is [Laughter] is that a canadian only company yeah yeah okay yeah like they're they're a pretty lean company and they've got billions in the bank and people will be like oh wii u is doing bad is nintendo gonna die it's like no dude i can't remember what the stats are but there's something like if nintendo just immediately stops selling everything now and keeps their capital expenditure at the same amount and just makes no money at all they could survive for like a hundred years or something it's like you guys they're doing all right it seems like a natural fit because their products are always so bold and risky like they don't when they reach when they launch the wii they have no idea if people are going to like it or not yeah the same with the switch it's completely out there it seems like you better have some money for a rainy day yeah and they do and then they've done really well enough times that they've just got all this money they can sit on and keep taking risks which is cool it's one of the reasons why i love nintendo that is cool someone is cactic club cat cat what is cat it's just a cactus club it's just a restaurant in in canada hold on i'm going to get the numbers i'm on wikipedia now and it confirmed 5500 for nintendo's employee number until until 106 000. yeah so that's what i said like like drastically different style companies and even nintendo could drop that billion and be completely fine i think ibm has 800 000 if i remember correctly no 300 380 000 which is that means there's more people in the world working for ibm than holding icelandic passports there are fewer icelanders than ibm employees there might be some overlap there i wonder how many icelandic ibm employees there are hit us up on super chat yeah if you're if you're an icelandic ibm employee toss us some of that old-school computer money yeah give us them that model m money yeah from the north are we are we done this topic yeah okay we're gonna move i think so we did it i think uh did we talk about the 22 nanometer stuff yep and the stock changes yeah cool yeah i think we're good moving on uh amazon has an anti-union video that has leaked allegedly because it only sort of leaked it sort of leaked so gizmodo broke the story okay and they say that they obtained a video from anonymous sources they posted screenshots at gizmodo but they did not post the video themselves because they say that pokemon they post the video that it will compromise the people who leaked it so they have they themselves have reached out to amazon to ask amazon to publish the video that's not going to happen correct and also it's kind of fishy because it is fishy it's kind of like political then because amazon has its enemies oh yeah like in business and in politics so that's interesting okay let's get in let's just let's just unwrap what this is new site gizmo has obtained what it calls a 45 minute union busting training video so amazon uses training videos all the time like cartoonized animated videos to train management and lower level employees and everything yeah um allegedly this video was produced i think by amazon and then sent to team leaders of whole foods last week and whole foods of course is owned by amazon now they sold them or amazon bought whole foods for 13 billion last year 13.7 billion dollars less than whatsapp was worth to facebook yeah that was 16. um so the the videos narrator states that the video is specifically designed to give you the manager of whole foods the tools that you need for success when it comes to labor organizing so it all well i'll go over some some of the other stuff that it also states it also says we are not anti-union but we are not neutral either i have no idea what that's supposed to be that means your anti-union yeah pretty much uh we do not believe quote unquote this is not me saying this quote unquote we do not believe unions are in the best interest of our customers our shareholders or most importantly our associates meeting employees associates our employees our business model is built upon speed innovation and customer obsession things that are generally not associated with union when we lose sight of those critical focus areas we jeopardize everyone's job security yours mine and the associates the associates so the video provides some background on the neighbor or the national labor relations act as well as showing some like different warning signs so if you are a manager at this whole foods and you see any of the following you might have a potential union like unfolding in your hands or about to erupt so warning signs such as use of words like living wage and steward distribution of petitions and flyers associates raising concerns on behalf of their co-workers that's a big one or even more blatant wearing union t-shirts hats or jackets workers who aren't normally connected to each other suddenly hanging out together don't make friends with people that you're not already friends with okay any other associate behavior that is out of character that's a little please stating that i try to like i i try to make it so that people at full plane are friends because i want everyone to be friendly maybe i'm doing the wrong thing well if it comes from the top then it's it's not a warning sign right okay the video then asks managers to listen to 10 hypothetical employees and select whether their remarks constitute a warning sign or an interesting interaction um so they say they and then they talk about um what you're allowed to speak what you're allowed to say to employees that is legal so apparently basically anything goes um there's nothing really unlawful that you can say in regards to unionizing but they still give you some guidelines such as you would never threaten to close your building just because associates joined a union but you might need to talk about how having a union could hurt innovation which in turn could hurt customer obsession which ultimately could threaten the building's continued existence potential organization uh are supposed to be escalated oh yeah so if you see this happening at your store you're supposed to escalate this to human resources and general managers immediately quash it nip it in the bud the video itself does not appear to be publicly available online as we already uh yeah i tried to go to live leak and stuff like that it might be on now this was like five hours ago but yeah it doesn't appear to be available uh gizmodo like you already said asked amazon to publish the video and yeah basically the rest of it is just what was already spoken about so you have a you have a hot take i have some problems with this okay okay full disclosure first unions are awesome those lights just die sometimes they're really really important when you need a union you need a union i'm not anti-union at all but i'm also not pro-union it depends it depends in an ideal world to be no unions because in an ideal world every employer would treat would would treat their employees really well now the fact that this story when you read about it like i had to really scrutinize this article to to figure out like oh this is actually talking about whole foods it's not talking about amazon oh because it's it only says that like in one place near the top and one place near the bottom and the rest is it talks about amazon's track record of like people peeing in bottles or amazon yeah there's been some pretty brutal news out of amazon yeah and everyone knows amazon sucks in that way or has and that's basically if you're a low-end employee yeah that they dodged paying taxes and that they kind of strong arm the cities that they operate in to give them favorable like subsidies and tax exemptions and stuff like that so they're really focused on having on benefiting the customer they're obsessed with the customer at the expense of other things like employee happiness but this is about whole foods and whole foods has its own ceo and you know i guess ostensibly like its own practices and stuff i don't know how entangled those two companies are but that's just one thing i want to keep in mind um obviously it would it would definitely be the case that amazon just like other big retailers like walmart whoever at target who have been scrutinized for this in the past it would be really bad if they had their workers unionized i don't think it would be that bad for whole foods it'd be worse for amazon if they got you their workers got you yeah because i think a lot would have to change um i i have only ever personally been in one union i thought you're gonna say in one whole foods uh i think that might also be true uh there's a did you like nature's fair near here which is essentially the same thing i've been in there a bunch of times that's like local though right yeah have you did you like working in a union no i freaking hated it um but i may have my problem is that i've only worked in one and my case was relatively unique i guess um where i worked at a bread factory i worked at canada bread factory you're a wholesome guy very wholesome you're a whole wheat oh yeah we made some of that um by the way basically all the bread in somewhere like walmart all comes from the same spot and is made the same way and just gets put in different bags it's great uh anyways i used to work there we were all in a union it was a multi-whatever union where like it oversaw a bunch of different types of workers yeah like where we live there's the bc geu it's the biggest union and then that covers like everyone from prison guards to firefighters yeah yeah yeah this this wasn't that one but it was a different form of a similar thing where it's a bunch of different disciplines uh and our union guy i guess the steward from reading this for our factory was a expletive ah i hated that dude he hated him with everything i've got i had to pay union dues when all i'm trying to do is make money to go to school and this guy was just a big jerk and none of the people i didn't know a single person that worked there that liked him and there was nothing we could really do about it um the the people above him in the union that we tried to contact wouldn't get rid of them so we had like the same problem that you would have with like some jerk boss that was just within the union and i had to pay him to be a jerk to me and i was like this freaking sucks do unions ever go away like once they don't know i don't know i don't know enough about it i don't really personally want to comment too much on this because i really don't know enough about it i just had one singular bad experience and i haven't been in a union outside of that so i really don't know i do know from like history that there's been multiple times where unions were absolutely necessary completely to solve a giant major problem but then do they ever go away after that that's the that's the thing i don't i don't know i know quite a few people that don't like them i know quite a few people that do like them i know my experience sucked um yeah i worked for a union and it was sweet for me because i made more money than i should have and uh that was great cool um i have a friend who's in a union again he's he actually is a corrections correctional officer okay prison guard and uh it sucks for him because the pay raises are completely just like regimented it's not like you kicked a lot of butt this year and you're gonna get a sweet pay raise it's like well you've worked here this long and we're they're renegotiating the union agreement this year and we're all gonna get six percent raise and that raise by the way that we're they're fighting for isn't for your particular job it's for like what you said a cross-section of different industries and everyone who fits in this bucket is getting this same raise even though you've got to deal with people stabbing each other and stuff i like my one of my problems was where where i worked when you when you got hired they had you do a super basic math test and the super basic math test was good well there's 24 slices in a low and then five loads basically they're trying to see like how how smart are you because there's like there's a position called bun packer that was great where you you pick up stuff off a conveyor line you grab it you turn to the right you put it down you rotate back you grab it you turn to the right and you put it in your body get all the all the that's the whole job for eight hours a day so like that job can be done by anyone but then there's like the mixer who has to like put in the ingredients and that's a little bit more specific and there's people who like pack the trucks and you have to put the right amount of carts of the right amount of stuff on the right trucks and there's like slightly more advanced jobs so so you're a bun packer well everyone starts there regardless of how well you do did you ever leave the bun back i did yeah i got moved up really fast and the union head didn't like that because the the non-union guys got to pick where you worked but the union guys picked your hours so because i went up in position really quickly the union head just screwed me not in terms of he gave me really low hours but he would just wreck me like he'd he'd shift me at like the worst possible times and he'd always have me as like the emergency call guy so he'd be he'd be like be there in 15 minutes uh and he'd call me as i was trying to go to bed because it was purely on call and i was just like oh my god and he made my life hell for an entire summer so i don't i don't like that and then they have all those things like like promotions based on seniority and stuff yeah it's like girl he's been here 20 years i don't care that's because he sucks [Laughter] he has nothing else he has no other prospects everyone else good left so yeah i don't know i think there are situations where it can be bad and i think there's situations where it can be good and i have no idea for whole foods okay well here's my one last this is my tinfoil hat hot tape sure yeah can you get the screenshot up from that article yes so if you open up the gizmodo article they've got some embedded screen caps from this alleged video just go to the first one and just just go through it just give me that guys i'll bring it in we're going to go on a journey here actually that's the screenshot that i want i'm still going to go here because it'll probably be bigger yeah might as well give them living wage grievance contract representation is that what that last word is uh i want to go to the tips one tips yeah there's this this one okay tips remember remember managers tips if you see someone trying to organize just remember tips threaten interrogate promise and spy i have a hard time believing that any company that sounds so fake that is so egregious and outrageous that if that's true that's crazy but there's it's just so outrageous that that can't be true and then i see that i'm just like is this whole thing fake does this video even exist because that is just over the top threaten and interrogate come on as if promise promise what so like and are they telling you to lie because what do you promise i guess that's what that means but promise is the nicest word in there but can you imagine telling like all of this stuff the executive executives are telling the management like sitting down the team leaders at whole foods which is like threaten and interrogate your employees yeah exactly there's no way they said that doesn't sound real come on so i think it's uh fake news i wonder if they got sourced something that seemed super legit and then they just believed it it could be man the russians that throws me off a lot to be honest because that sounds really really beautiful you know what uh this interrogate thing made me think of uh one of one of my employees how's it going aj uh he was mentioning in french uh the question mark it translates to interrogation mark oh interesting well there's a uh he'll say interrogation mark when he's talking about question mark i'm like that's so intense yeah yeah yeah it's a weird translation there's an obscure form of punctuation that is a mix but you know how when you want to ask a question intensely and use a question mark and an exclamation point yeah well there's a one unified really like notation it's called an enterobang i have heard that phrase but i didn't know that yes um there's actually a really good episode of 99 invisible about it tarot bang there's like 99 invisible oh it's this awesome like design focused podcast yeah you you should uh show everyone it looks pretty cool it does look cool i'll bring it up there's this dude who like championed it and like tried to make it happen really hard wait so it's is it a thing or no um like is it officially recognized notation i guess it's well it's not on the keyboard it ain't real it kind of looks like a really powerful p it could be an alt code thing though and terra all code it has a unicode yeah and terrorbang is not a standard punctuation mark wow few modern typefaces or fonts include a glyph for the entire band character the standard in terra bang is at unicode code point u plus 203 d are your sponsors rip yeah sponsor time [Music] what is that is that pink panther that's no what is oh god [Music] properly yeah so there was a problem though because so what happened was it's like an interaction between multiple different features in the facebook code so it stemmed from a change that facebook made to their video uploading flow yeah which affected vue as and that changed the video uploading flow was in july 2017 that's a pretty long time ago that sucks so facebook issued this like uh this post that they had fixed the vulnerability and informed law enforcement including the fbi and they said all these things that they like here's what we did because we care about your security so much they reset the access tokens of the 50 million accounts affected the access tokens are like those they're like digital keys that allow you to not have to type in your name and password every time you enter your browser or navigate around and so this this exploit like got the keys so people could screw you and so facebook they reset the access tokens to like 50 million accounts that were affected and then they took the precautionary step of resetting access tokens for yet another 40 million that they thought like um they could they had been subject to a view as i suspect in the past year some overlap there but yeah um i so i have heard from a person uh i haven't talked to many people about this yet but in the small group of people that i have talked to i have heard from a person that they had to relog into facebook on all of their devices well here's the this is the night yes this is the fun thing i did today um because when you here's what i did i went to my phone and i went facebook and i got this and facebook messenger as well session expired please log in again which means i either was compromised i'm either one of the 50 million or one of the 40 million yeah and i don't know which one and then it says that once you log in again you will see on your news feed a notification at the top that explains what happened damn it yeah i didn't get logged out on anything dang it instagram as well facebook has yet to determine whether these accounts were misused or whether any information was accessed they don't know who's behind the attacks they don't know from which geographic region the attackers hail i mean you can probably guarantee that in some way it was misused like they're gonna try to harvest some form of information i don't know what it's gonna be what if they just made funny posts like they just made luke's status lola hacked this guy's account it's luke status don't you hate when your finger punches through the toilet paper [Laughter] ew luke tmi why would you post that i did it and i have that like extension on my computer so i can't see my news feed have you heard about that oh no but i like the idea no it's great and it puts like an inspirational quote where the news feed is or where the i don't know what it's even called the the feed in general not necessarily news because it's your friends posts and stuff but yeah i i only i exclusively use facebook for chats and groups yeah that's awesome um so i just banned the feed so i wouldn't even know if you have that on mobile no but i just don't go to the facebook app on mobile i just only use messenger yeah that'd be awesome they should get it for instagram but then that would get rid of the entire app buy instagram i guess you you could see like stories and pms instead of the inspirational quote they should give you a nihilist meme just a direct feed from the nihilus arby's twitter yeah just the inevitable end of the universe is to heat death nothing matters nothing nothing that you do matters because it will be deleted by the sun um anyways so that's that's scary if you got logged out of all your stuff um just a heads up someone had access to your account they've been pwned like me yeah oh facebook by the way says you don't need to update your password uh because it was access token based not password based so they didn't have to do anything they didn't forge the key to the lock they just walked around the door that's how i described that security style cool because some people talk about like oh like i have a password that's a hundred characters this account is invulnerable to everything like no because if they find a way to just not have to use the password or if you give it to them or yeah or that yeah did you follow the uh the disney fox comcast thing like pretty much not at all we've talked about it a little bit um let me give you a 10 seconder sure okay 100 because like it's it's been evolving over the summer there's these really big players that are all trying to trying to acquire each other because there's a giant race for streaming platform and where you're going to watch your tv next so let me give you the tl dr come on zeke d did a super chat sorry i'm new to this stuff i don't know the youtube streaming stuff he said you guys are awesome oh that's us that's us yeah yeah high five dude thanks man yeah nice also rip headphone users floatplane for the win i appreciate it man thank you very much i appreciate you yeah by the way zeke full plane has a new payment system which is cool and there's now no bitcoin though no no bitcoin no bitcoin and there's now discord integrations from floatplane.com to discord what does that mean uh you can have your account sync up so this is it's a general thing any of the creators can do it i haven't told tech deals or bit wit yet because we're still testing things a little bit and making sure it's a little bit more cleaned up but theoretically they could turn it on anytime um but there's there's still some work to do before it's perfect um and it makes it so that if you join that creator's discord you get a special role saying you're like a subscriber to flow plane away and you can get granted access to a chat i don't know how the creators want to decide they get to implement the perks as they want yeah so much freedom the land of the free is floatplane seriously it also has a notification feature so it can like post links to new videos as they come up into the discord and whatnot that's cool yeah cause you're just hanging on discord anyway yeah anyway here's the timeline from the whole like auction drama there's a ton of auctions to buy stuff it's actually kind of interesting okay fox was for sale okay like 20th century fox oh wait is that different than fox i think that's a subset of fox i'm gonna cut you off for one quick second we've got another crazy super chat i have no idea what this is worth but it's 1024 sec is that uh that's not singapore is it what is set currency he said olive review channel on floatplane heck yeah dude oh it's swedish krona nice nice how much was it uh 1024. from that's 150 bucks of rules canadian holy geez yeah buddy thank you thank you for playing sports okay sorry let's let's get back to the fox was for sale disney wanted to buy it disney's making a streaming service and plus they also own a large part of hulu so buying fox gets you a lot of sweet shows over the years like family guy and all sorts of stuff that they could put on the streaming services so fox wanted to firefight so there you go disney wanted to buy fox comcast was competing with them to buy fox and they had like a bidding war and in the end disney won and they acquired fox but um meanwhile fox owned 39 of this european network called sky and obviously both of these companies comcast and disney want to be in europe because they want to expand globally so while fox was for sale and being bid on by disney and comcast fox itself which is owned by rupert murdoch was trying to get 100 stake in sky or at least a majority stake in sky oh wait comcast was no no no fox owned sky or owned 39 percent of six and yeah and and fox was trying to own it wholly so that when when it was when fox was bought whoever bought it would also get all of sky um so in the end between disney and comcast disney won they spent more than they wanted to and they they got fox but they didn't end up getting sky because when comcast did not win the bid to get what when comcast did not win the bid to get fox they started bidding on sky and they actually outbid fox on bidding on sky does this make sense okay yeah so now so then comcast owns part of sky and disney because they bought fox they own part of sky and in the end um fox was just oh wait no disney didn't get it it was it ended up not being part of the deal and then fox was just like screw it comcast you can have all the sky so now the at the end disney owned fox comcast on sky there's no more partial ownership okay there you have it that was a mess not not your explanation just everything that happened there it was crazy it's a it's pretty it's not a back and forth interesting little dance there i'm surprised they i'm surprised disney gave up on that because they've been just chomping things lately surprised they were just like no we're taking that 39 i don't i don't know how that works i don't because the disney deal i thought was just going through so much earlier that i don't know if this had an effect like that they ended up changing the price that they paid for fox because they thought that sky was gonna be part of the fox deal crazy hold on what's the sale price here okay hold on you guys need to recheck the caption on the amazon gizmodo article you got the tips picture wrong people are flipping out oh really let's look into this thanks for the tip oh don't want to report the wrong thing no um bob swann bob swan okay we're navigating back now we are you got to go to the original source though yeah gizmo dude what does that he says the caption that's right under it tips are the tactics amazon advises management not to use pretty big important difference oof so oof okay okay well now i'm just gonna shift blame to gizmodo well uh okay cause that that uh screenshot is really incriminating and deflammatory but they don't actually i don't believe they address it in their article except for this little caption so i think that's a little misleading but yeah let's own up we didn't read the caption yeah obviously they don't they don't want people interrogating and spying how's it going dude hey you guys uh it's hard but sometimes we did two super chats no problem colton's yelling at us are we supposed to love you guys dude you know how many chronos we're getting how many we're rolling cronus over a thousand whoa yeah swedish cronus look that up cool yeah i don't see any like main oh my god i didn't do anything i like the look what actually just happened are we still streaming did someone turn that oh god remotely through the app people please that that the the squid the squid oh it's dead so that means the camera's off oh my god okay whoa anarchy this is anarchy are we streaming we are we are streaming and the camera's on you can see that you wouldn't be able to see that oh oh i like that interesting we got a little bit of light i like this low-key look thank you zach f for the heads up that we that we screwed up i don't personally i don't want to yeah i don't personally see them really talk about this tips thing in any of their main line stuff but we absolutely should have read the the caption regardless that makes a lot more sense don't threaten interrogate or promise or spy on your employees that makes sense because they were we did talk about how they were talking about things not to do got a phone call from the dentist here nice that's important just gonna let that one ring out don't have a voicemail anymore that's a little update i don't know if i ever talked about that one show but i talked to linus about it because he was saying you know how you get these notifications for voicemail and they just don't go away you can't clear them yes i hate that i absolutely hate it and then you go to check your voicemail and if you're someone like me who doesn't pay msp until like because it just comes off your tax return anyway so there's no reason and anyway i always have a full voicemail and then so linus said that he had a colleague in the past i think at ncax who said his voicemail was literally hi this is the voicemail blah blah do not leave a message here email me or send me a text do not leave a message here and i thought that sounds like an okay thing to do but my voicemail is always full of scams and of msp who's gonna leave a message anyway so that was gonna work so i just got it completely removed my life is better all right there you go i uh i just do direct withdraw on msp yeah because i don't want to think about it yeah ever i did that before i think but whatever i like your style too though i think one of those two are probably the way to go evade yeah pay it or dodge it no you're still paying anything it gets paid yeah yeah you're still paying you have to anyways yeah so sorry about that inaccuracy thank you for checking us on that thank you very much and i'm happy that's i'm happy that it's fixed now um was there more super chats i read probably are we like how much yeah i guess we've been going for almost our allotted time i don't know how to check the super chats though so can you talk to me about this uh playstation cross platform playing fortnite's the first uh game you can play across platform from your playstation yeah so here uh you talk about that i'm gonna try to figure out super chats okay well i'll give the notes but i actually want to hear your like your take on it i will i will comment on it cool so finally um sony interactive entertainment says it has identified a path towards supporting cross-platform features for third-party content so the first step is going to be an open beta which is on now for the game fortnite of course that will allow cross-platform gameplay progression and commerce across the playstation 4 android ios nintendo switch xbox one microsoft windows and mac operating systems ah i think um i think this is weird like aren't you just gonna get pwned by people with keyboard and mouse um i think to a certain to a certain degree i think people almost don't care but in this in a battle royale where like if you're the third one left alive and then you get wrecked and you're you're just getting like ah you're gonna rage quit and you're gonna that guy definitely has a keyboard mouse yeah i wonder if there's a way to queue cross-platform in a way to queue not cross-platform if that makes sense yeah i i wonder that as well but i can find any information on that because i would still like to be the ability to play with my buddy so like if my buddy has a ps4 and i for some reason wanted to play fortnite um i'd like to play with him i think it would probably make sense if we had to queue for the pcq yeah i think it would be segregated because you'd have to bring up the i don't know how to say this not as tactile experiences yeah like if if you wanted to you would have to buff them yeah well well not you'd actually have to hurt them or nerf the other ones yeah because you wouldn't it would be it would be kind of brutal i think to bring a pc player into a console only environment yeah by inviting him to your group but if you're going to have to go the other way oh yeah it would have to bring up someone it's like it's your decision to queue with a pc player so you have to go play against pc people you know what i mean if you want to play mobile fortnite i don't know if this is a thing probably no it is if you want to play well no but if you want to play mobile fortnite with a pc player yeah are you just going to get so wrecked and the thing that's interesting is that the game developers are pushing it for this for a while sorry i have no idea what like the fortnite cross platform cueing stuff is i'm just saying that would make more sense to me game developers not just a fortnight but of other games have won a cross platform for a long time because they just want more and more people to play your game but obviously the the console makers like microsoft and sony they have the opposite incentive they want people to be silo siloed so i wonder if you're playing and you're getting wrecked by someone with a keyboard and mouse and you really care about the game you're thinking well i gotta switch to pc because i want to kick ass with a keyboard mouse do you think there's a fortnite will already cue keyboard and mouse apart from controller unless you're grouped with friends so they're doing this so you can be on your pc on a controller well yeah but the game recognizes that and that's how they oh that would make sense i think because there's no real advantage there yeah a little bit of frame rate or like hurts like refresh rate stuff but yeah okay that's cool but do you hear what i'm saying like if i'm playing and then someone wrecked me with a mouse and i'm like why am i playing on console i'm just gonna move to pc and then i'm no longer a sony playstation customer i don't think that's really gonna happen because if if they're already splitting the cues for controllers and keyboard mouse unless you're in a group then the only reason why you're bringing being brought to play with other people with keyboard and mouse is because you're playing with one of your friends yeah and the amount of people that are going to be in that niche group and then also care enough to buy a whole other platform yeah it's gonna be really small you've also already got the sunk cost of you bought your places already so maybe on the next gen you don't buy the next gen you buy pc instead maybe and i think playstation is is making so many people happy with this change and it's honestly they might open the door for a lot more people to buy playstations because if if one if someone's like yeah i only play on freaking pc because my friends play on pc and i want to play a bunch of the really good single player experiences on playstation like god of war uh horizon zero dawn spider-man all these really good single-player experiences they could buy a playstation and still play with their friends it won't be an optimal experience or you're playing on mobile and you want to get more into it but you can afford a gaming pc get a console yeah still play with your mobile phones i think it's a very good move for playstation i'm very happy with it we don't know right now what the future holds for other games other than fortnite getting this they haven't announced that at all so people are also bringing up that you can keyboard mouse on on playstation it's not the same but yeah um to go through some super chats uh someone asked is lta i'm not gonna go through all of them by the way but i'll do but we will thank and acknowledge all of you thank you yes thank you very much you're super i'll go through some notable questions that i can actually answer uh is ltx going to be around mid july next year i don't know exactly i don't want to say a definitive thing um but i suspect roughly yeah i suspect it would be somewhere around that area i don't know if it would actually be mid july but like yeah someone if you're booking off time yeah if you're booking on time don't um we don't even know which country it's going to be in right now yeah to be honest who knows but like it will probably be summer-ish so yeah you guys are awesome thank you very much pat myself in the back for that olive review all over you heck yeah all right all of my dudes i'll be doing that it'll be uh we'll put it on steam we'll make an uncensored erotic story game about olives [Laughter] someone said luke any plans for mobile apps for floatplane absolutely uh there's there's some other stuff for us to tackle first but yes um and i think that's about it ah we're gonna end the show there thank you very much for showing up we'll see you next week on the lan show it yeah what about this part i mean what am i gonna do i'm running out of sounds [Music] you were my favorite extension
