okey-dokey folks welcome to I believe this is episode three of the Minecraft but all the loop drops a randomized multiplayer series has always brought to data packs folder it's pretty easy peasy lemon squeezy so and took me a while to figure out yeah youth youth the reason why it took you a long time to figure out is because you were expecting it to be complicated it's true I was expecting more and then it turned out it was not complicated in the slide yeah it's just about the easiest thing you could possibly do you're like Oh didn't didn't think that he handed me a zip file and I was like unzipping it he's trying to figure out where to put the files and he's like nah dude just drop the zip file like literally the zip file in there and I'm like I made it as easy as I possibly can for you that's that's convenient no you know that's where we are but so you said there were horses somewhere so I figured courses today's mission should be let's let's leave this area let's go travel somewhere and you want to take your horse so I can tame the horse and leave it yeah yeah yeah yeah oh this stallion shall be mine don't shoot my future horse do not shoot my waifu alright here we go let's change it I shoot my wife boo yeah there we go what that my hours get I tamed I forgot about the random thing and so I just tried to get my fence post back and it turns out I got a smoker I don't know if we've been down that route yes smoker breaks into a bunch of seeds in some bread all this horses mediums mediums you need a source it's it's I don't you gotta like do some genetic breeding and genetic modifications if you want to get the best horse so I've missed I really haven't ever worked out all the different course stuffs I've never forced around with it gotcha alright well uh fine let's find a village how about it shall we village village like that what you almost fell into that case I was close but I didn't all right I'm trying saying I was like what sir really close though what natural things have we not run into we haven't run into a desert temple which there is a temple or there's a desert over here so it could be a decimal somewhere I was just thinking like oh man are we gonna run out of water and then I realized oh we're in not we're not in our L craft ya know you don't we don't need water and it's not we don't need to worry about it getting too hot in the desert and we also don't need to worry about a food even because we're riding a horse so it's just all-around very nice where do you get off - I was right on this hill right here oh hey hey wait what the craziest option wait oh it's village Hey that's what I'm talking about right there brah just right over the hill from us can you believe it it's been here the whole time it's been here the whole time we don't have a we don't have a fencepost to put thing I guess we can make one mmm or you can just put your horse in a hole Wow your horse in hole works all the time every time why did this guy right here hey bud all right horse you wouldn't mind you don't mind dude mine's already there look it took us the same amount of time and now you're stuck down there and you have a horse that you got to figure out am I stuck my huh yeah yeah oh we have we merked a rabbit yet I don't think we did mercury we did okay I can't remember what it was but and and so that could be important but I well it obviously wasn't well it gave me experience and nothing else okay cool you know at some point you have to ask yourself do you Merc tumors or not - Merc that is very good listen the to Merc the villagers I got emeralds and what are the heck is all this junk we've got a chest of some sort from this chiseled sandstone Levi's been down this road before oh but wait a minute if I've been down that with a silk touch on the slime block nope that doesn't do nothing oh uh okay I found Derek oh wait no it's coarse dirt so sandstone are smooth sandstone blocks they give you some kind of village chest it would appear not that that's yeah that's whatever oh okay you were saying that cool yeah mm-hmm I appreciate your saying that and what about the terracotta that gives us rain concrete I believe we've been down this road before Oh dirt oh you made it to dirt too I I see yeah yeah oh wait those custard yeah oh yeah it is and that led to definitely a path that we've been down before I've burned and a potted plant can you pot of burn you can't no no and it breaks into nothing so that's good oh we do have little thing here so do you want to be the but still yeah yeah yeah that was uh that was that was a thing what I broke a block and it turns out there's a ravine this was all saying but I did find diamonds huh would you get that from I was distracted by the ravine okay it might have been the bed no it was was the bed now it wasn't bad well what do we want to try the old iron golem beef do we try it oh yeah careful careful they they hurt they hurt sorry bud really sorry for this we're not proud we're really not proud nothing okay sorry yet I never actually know oh oh oh uh we need to try the bail bail me bro the bail gives us cobblestone all right bail me bro and that gives us quarrel which fell me baby one more time uses leather which we don't particularly care about I do not think that is a and I usually use some leather to make a hair mine and I don't think there's an item frame demonetised a cat no that's what that's what I was gonna ask you oh that's that whoa okay it's potted cactus that dropped the diamonds but it also dropped an enchantment but it was potted cactus huh okay well I just I just wrecked a cat and got a repeater out of it and the repeater gave me mmm corn flour in a power pot so okay let's see corn flour and what gives enchantments plus diamonds uh wait yeah cactus in pot because I got a frost Walker one at Oh whoa what is this whoa what chest is this this the sandstone is giving me actually a really good stuff which sandstone the smooth sandstone like that the base of the house is it has a bunch of a chairman City are you having problems I just broke yeah I'm good because this could end up having like another infinity or something loyalty three well I'm getting out of those is great banners so though I'm so touched it that's what it is hold on is it no maybe it's a different you must be hittin a different block yeah yeah cuz this definitely has some some serious stuff feather falling for Maura I totally got a handle that on um so I was all excited about because I had a bunch of pairs of boots and I was like these boots are gonna be great and then it turned out that the oh it's a desert temperature oops flame okay okay so what are you breaking that's so exciting it's the it's the smooth stone here like oh I see so this this I see okay nice - here's some gold diamond armor or a gold gold gold diamond I love gold diamond armor cold horse armor I know I have some diamond horse armor for my horse okay Oh unbreaking 3 loyalty 3 flame protection - we do not need there is so many good on power 4 dude I got power 4 yo that's big plays that you can apply to your bow III oh my god this is where it's at I mean and we're good I don't think I need loyalty 3 I don't have any enchantments out of it though that's true we're hitting different ones okay there's one no you just have to keep hitting them of it eventually you will you'll get yes makes sense flame flames good it was good Oh mm down the ravine we go it's very disconcerting when that happens well oh I got a got Apple oh yeah Oh like I Oh really like a god Apple out of yeah okay that's that's gnar buckle buckle mm-hmm so can I can we make that how do we craft that that would craft why we would need to have like sandstone I think or I guess if we just got safe and sounds easy to make sand and then how do you make the chisel or how do you make the smooth sand I believe it's in the furnace oh yeah we do have a lot of sand that we could just yeah we Canada there is in fact a lot of saying well no but when you mind saying it doesn't give you ass and forgetting that work does yeah well I I'm right but I wonder do I have a torch whether the torch trick I don't have a torch Oh buddy hey you know how you were upset with me I'm always upset with you okay well go ahead and not be upset with me anymore Oh buddy yup now job levels I mean I have eight levels I might be able to hook it up six levels doesn't bring that anvil did we nope we could well I had hard we just dropped a bunch of iron ingots over all over that is that's true it's true we can we could we could get those pretty easily yep oh my god there's so many more of these though we can also break it's crazy I might add some diamonds to me horse Oh some diamond to me horse there we go now you're looking real pretty okay I was worried that they didn't drop experience but they do drop experience okay you were worried that what didn't drop experience just mobs oh okay yeah you know they definitely do everything feels a little weird right just casually wandering into the villages and just showing everyone's houses you know always nice to dance one does did you try that terracotta over there which kind it looks like it's white or blue egg drops a potted plant and tree oh sorry I'm just this villager is trying to sleep in his house while I'm just wow sorry bud sorry if any zombies come you're all toast and it's I accept responsibility it's totally my fault Wow yep ooh this is fun repentance II of it yeah like I need to worry about mending too much because I'm not like No much matter that much that I'm gonna end up with it being a problem um any other enchanted books the problem is I wish I could just you know only get the enchanted book rather than everything else that comes with the territory in these chests but um it's I don't actually think I need many more enchantments I beat the ender dragon with much much less but we can't are you making an anvil by any chance I was going to go back and cuz I only have of all the iron ingots I gathered I have like 20 oh okay I mean there's there's definitely more over here fine oh we got freaking Zam Bros coming in dude are they coming in hot yeah oh hey villager you might want to watch out for those buds mmm I should get should get iron eventually there we go hey get out of here dude oh he dropped something all right so there's 36 iron cool that's enough and let's see what is it it's three blocks and then yeah it's 31 it's like do I place it cuz I'm able to pick it back up but here we are Bo and infinity let's see so I could add for the helling for to my boots what are you positive 5 oh we have a spy poor and we found a spare infinity I could add flame to my bow which would cost 5 hmm I think feather falling because flame doesn't affect the Enderdragon I don't believe or I get out I'm breaking to my boots hmm I'm breaking to your bow would be good oh that's a good man I mean yeah it's not a bad idea that's not a bad idea that's gonna cost 6 though hmm [Music] I'm just go fetch the more experience from the boys out here shouldn't be too hard nuts and so what I'm doing right now it is nice okay by these how are you doing I would like to have some levels from you if you do not mind great level song dude thanks it's it's to the tune of money money money mm okay did you oh there's a freaking desert temple over here hey that's pretty cool hey we're house powers what goes on right power is in fact what goes on about yes okay these things with the gem you before you all mock me mercilessly I mean it's not like it would actually allow you to do it if he is no I is quick charge but uh Ross Bo uh mm-hmm sad times efficiency three don't care about Wayne we already have frost Walker the loyalty I was just hoping for an unbreaking that I could add on as well hmm gotcha no no I need more mob more Mob Experience before it is daytime give me mob experience here come here skele bro give me two five okay get made of hi there we go we have five we out here feather falling for get it on there I did I did throw out an unbreaking to you found that I found the unbreaking to okay I honestly think you will be totally fine with that like we're not gonna it takes a lot of arrows to go through that maybe I want to shoot a lot of things you just you just want to shoot your arrows in the air sometimes saying ay-oh creeper KO that Enderman didn't drop any experience for me and I'm a little upset about it that's a bummer I had to listen to the whole how much would it cost for me to get a nine if I wanted to put flame on my bow what is that one Oh extra infinity hmm what do you know yes I had two infinities that's funny why is that and then you landed with two Dini hoppers I've got a lot of hoppers uh negative I'm okay I'm okay actually all right if you need any hoppers good guy cool I'll keep that in mind yeah yeah we've got we've got I'm big in the hopper biz this is a composter which doesn't make anything hmm so that's good and then we have a brewing stand which we could either brew with or we could dig up and see what brewing stands do I would dig it up I feel like we're not gonna really spend all that time on enchantments it gives us a dead coral block okay oh wait let me oh no it doesn't matter if we'd still touch that or not it doesn't matter wait where you know you're in here Oh worked myself to a stone home nice dude nice was that off of the Turcotte in here no that was off of the brewing stand oh okay I didn't know if the term or any words no no jungle sapling in there that's a nada zip nothing but hey if you want them diamonds cactus in a pot tell a friend for sure or sure guess who's back oh it's Joan cool not a great deal there go off of there it was late mushroom did I silk touch that I think yes cauldron of course ah the old cauldron ruski wait you can put a hopper down then we put a hopper down I know I don't know that we have yet it gives you leather cool cool very nice we still have no Belize I mean getting me problematic yeah I guess I mean we can keep traveling I don't know let's let's check out the let's check out some temple right alright I'll be back in just a second it's been wandering this Ridge getting the copper or the copper the coal so that I can make with the enchants I have an enchanting personality and an impeccable sense of direction okay so the leads are not showing okay now they're both God dang it now they're both God dang it it was just I'm going over to the thing Oh Frick I just picking everything up did you are we leaving the anvil I guess we can't pick it up can ya we can't really do that nope I'm afraid we can't do that Dave speaking of which did you see that a lot of you were confused about your reference to Dave and they were like Aziz named Dave that's her real name yeah wouldn't it be funny if that was actually a real name though they'd never know yeah has anyone over the course of YouTube actually like guessed your name and you obviously just kept a straight face no sorry not YouTube but YouTube and twitch so you know one no one has actually guessed it I it depends like you know I've had some people that have tracked it down Oh gotcha but it's not a name that you would just guess I don't know if you just went through the dictionary of names you might eventually get to it possible oh you more fences no why did you hate it horse wow you hit my horse and then you trap me yeah yeah well the horse stepped in front I was just digging too Sam oh my god I'm going elsewhere Wow okay fine find your own hole to dig I will isn't there a way to not blow this all up I feel like I would trigger this almost immediately what do you is there a way to not blow it all up yes there is a way to not blow it all up you don't step on the TNT pressure plate well I don't know where the TNT pressure plate is Oh creepers don't it would be at the bottom and it can't be set off by items or anything it is purely set off by you standing on it so you know I got the Elector NIF we want any custom enchantments from villagers that's nice there's electron lead to a composter which we forgot to bring a collector believe I feel like I'm almost saying no I broke the composter didn't make anything I took care of it so only sometimes it drops election Oh a composter oh okay you you were like the L that goes to a composter which we didn't pick up in gotcha saying that we touch it nope doesn't go to anything all right let's see oh there is this blue terracotta stained glass pane that gets stripped jungle wood which we've definitely seen before its jungle wood it's excited Oh loom block that is new actually he's on a new one bamboo you ready to get bamboozled we need to we need that dirt but we'll get to do it again we're not getting bamboos with anytime soon good luck I'll be fine so you've never been in one of these before I sure I've passed by on occasion but I don't remember them much oh oh more enchantments huh cool ah just like old school aren't they appear to be quite empty yeah no that's that's a thing I got unbreaking too if you want it I haven't breaking - as well cool I mean I guess you could kick can you combine books yes so if you brought that up then I could get em breaking 3 and deedily do so you can bring that oh we haven't checked TNT though now that's I was figuring you'd take care of it sure what does it drop I actually don't know which that dropped it was the orange ooh notch Apple boy yes out of the TNT I know that was out of one of the chess purple concrete powder that's new as well hmm there is many a new thing but so oh okay oh it's uh it's the iron golem sheep dropped with orange that's what it is what it is that's what it is it's actually kind of funny that you can get the drop from a desert temple chest from the sandstone that spawns on the floor beneath the chests I don't know I think that's kind of fortuitous all right we'll check orange wool though see lots of a get up here yes what we get for orange wool it's Cod it appears it's very exciting times rock hard and what is it if I don't use silk touch I got still touch nothing no need cool cool cool cool cool alrighty um-hmm oh yes don't forget my horsey would be no no Boyle are you trying to take off without a horse no all right purple concrete powder let's see yeah Sooey yet wait touch it like we've done that possibly polished and say it leads to nothing nope it was new because that unlock new recipes for me so was new indeed unless you had gotten it sure head alright moving right along to wherever the road that may take us the cod did have us where is the row taking us uh to somewhere new I'm gonna oh yeah let me place down some of that bamboozle see we get there does not appear that dead bushes do much bamboo leads to a birch log so that's that's cool never run into one of those before what you found chicken to smooth stone slab to Flint wait yeah we've definitely hit chicken before I just check just checking remember everything we've done is I'm trying to think of like punch things I break things for sure for show tryna they wouldn't natural things we haven't hit and we hit oxide Daisy table table right there have got to be some flowers that we haven't hit like if we found a that we found a flower plane wait I haven't had a lily pad before if we found like a flower plane I bet we could at least get a couple new things there's a flower plane to biome Oh beet roots when does that become a thing oh wait I can put beetroot seeds on tilled grass hold on flower planes have been in again forever that gives us a dead Bush in a pot but you actually have we done dead bush in a pot before all right we're gonna pop going elsewhere dad Bush grow your pillagers here we go just some bad omen up in here dude yo oh if we went back into the village we get a raid we'd see what some of the some of those dudes do I did not get the bad omen did I did yeah course go bro you want to you want to start a raid where did my purse right here dude it's right here I is it obvious I can't see it dude you want to start a raid go to start a Raider all right it was easy bleh I got you oh I kind of had a feeling after you like ran two inches right I can't I can't buy my horse I was like just turn around the horse is gone I'm like excuse me did they killed that they kill a horse and diamond armor that fast like wow where do you go all right I'm with you I'm with you is it this way I think it's this way yeah okay fingers crossed so what what knew we would get a evoker Vindicator and ravager those would be some drops God can you imagine if the if it was like an evoker that dropped a blaze rod Oh imagine there's the rate all right let's uh chain up these horses I guess hope they don't get rekt and what oh no no no no no no no whoa the horse is not good see this it's the horses hit quantum singularity oh my god okay well I'm sure it still exists no problems here okay so they just drop this knock knock back that I certainly don't have because I just have man your horse goes on forever yup okay we go oh my God where is the final one sometimes they get trapped in underground things and there is a big ravine so it could pose problematic could pose problematic there's a villager who's in the ravine there he is I see him where is he at he's right over there oh nice he's in there inside the house oh yes hey bud he drops a chess helps us greatly how about a the banner I wonder what the banner drops a 6-sided birch okay and I should get my apples out I mean well we there's gonna be Ravagers soon so just a little bit of lag middle ick don't worry about don't worry about it okay next next step that dropped ace excited stripped register birch which yields charcoal interesting interesting indeed bird all right you see him nice yeah there's a yeah Ravager is a bit big man everything careful they they will make pain they have the ability to make pain ran into a friendly one in my episode that went out that was never never wall I think we've run into before all right that leaves evoker I think is the final point of interest oh that was it never mind no evoker oh hey we're already Oh acacia log never run into that before we actually have have we yeah have we done it oh okay cool cool it's good to know yeah good to know definitely ah so do we disconnect will that fix it or if we're both seeing it it might they're both here now for me oh okay they're both here for now nope nope BRB BRB I only got one of the leads I don't know where the other one is hey bud are you doing cool cool no I just want to just want to get on the horse alright and let's go off on a new adventure again this time with less mm-hmm I mean it really all we can do is just try to find a new blocks as like a starting oh you know it'd be great as well is if we could find a Mesa biyo may surmise goodbye Mesa biome yes flower fair man in here cotta but uh have we get snow No wouldn't that be embarrassing why would we be embarrassed because it's like it's a pretty obvious thing oh we haven't done the big p OE thing P Olli and whatever that doesn't but it drops diamond blocks Wow yeah yeah that would've been a heck of a thing imagine we just started off with a snow biome we get a shovel and it's like oh okay yeah yeah that's that's what I mean I don't think we've tried diamond blocks have we uh do we have we have definitely tried diamond blocks yes rich rich dude oh man it's crazy dude let's get this know for sure dark oak forest any Oh peonies I don't think we've tried those that's what I'm saying and that is a spongy spa shampoo what they try with silk touch I could good do you know you can get your own so it I was thinking you know try to do anything yeah that read that read that read nether or whatever read nether whatever red another yellow leather red nether brick slab okay let's try silk right another riggers NuLu nether brick fence which we have there's nothing nothing with silk touch as well one of these days we'll fight oh I have we done shrooms yeah we we've certainly found shrooms I don't know about these bigger shrooms though they know that's what I was saying is I don't know if we've gotten these it's a fence gate and that is a diet I found dirt yeah like literal dirt and fence gate see also touch it oma seawall is new actually let's see done that you guys can get the outfit here polish fret it is okay just making sure that it wasn't a maddening bad happening right now the brick stairs which lands nothing diorite wall is also wet sponge though not a dry sponge we're getting all types of sponges here that's a brick wall die rate stairs purple wool which I think we've we had another one in purple wool apparently not it's unlocked a new recipe for me to I can't pick us up that's quarrel oh but end going on nothing that was they're not going that was the owner did you try the brown mushroom uh yeah that's dirt literal dirt oh good good not so touched so yeah mm-hmm what other biomes could we run in so Mesa flower planes would be good if we get dark oak leaves how did we I have maybe not let's try it let's try it everyone's saying wet the punished I then and I ended up getting a wet sponge so we covered it it worked out in the end there's an explosion with a lot of skeleton hands over there don't don't explosion with skeleton heads oh that is new these seem to make them an azure blue yeah it's because it's a it's glass required so much care careful with domine I led to the azure blue it the black wool wait have we then really of the valley no nothing but what about you another coral okay there's also that ice biome with all those spikes ooh ice would be yeah that is new I don't want to get too far I guess we have oh we have access to coordinates yeah it doesn't matter if we get split yeah I was like I don't want to lose my only friend in this world I'm glad that you uh are attached there's a cedar tree like at the top of that dang mountain like one cedar tree oh there's some over here you mean you mean a spruce yeah that one that's what I said I just said different words before it but it's what I meant in my heart some you're not the first you're not that was literate that literally came up on the last time I was on the SMP live server where Cara was saying spruce or at Cedar instead of spruce and it was like now it's it's a spruce tree it is a spruce tree what'd you get what'd you get polished andesite slab and I'll try with silk touch looks like a repeater with a shear or a comparator I don't think don't comparator it's new it's not tripping off anything new for me so yeah we do have gotten that cool come on blue ice packed ice and ice yep yep yep if we can find some ice that will be nice don't think twice hope you don't eat my rice Wow I went to rice you with the lice yeah lice is icky have you ever seen like a gif of a kid like it it's just like oh my god and then they look at the comb and it's just lice crawling all over the comb oh my godness way to go I lost it oh and frosted ice with frot wait this frost Walker create a different kind of ice really I didn't know that sunflower sunflowers something we haven't tried I don't think I just don't know about all the tulips and what tulips we haven't haven't done but we'll just try them all if we do find a flower biome but yeah you can't you can't ride the horse in the water doesn't work it's been invisible on me again so it's like I got all of it and just disappeared it was like somebody be a common reoccurrence yeah I mean this is just a vanilla install so yeah I know it's it's I'm sure it's just a bug with the data pack vanilla no no it's probably just a vanilla thing use your bucket to pick it up Oh pick up water and place it on biome for ice yeah we'll just find a nice bottom so we can get all the different types of ice at once feel like that'll be the way to do it that'll be the way mmm I've horses always stop to rear up every now and then sometimes they do I've got my well tron-like mine's like all about that oh really I've got mine like super well trained yeah well you know I mean you're better with the animals [Music] taking the easier train I sort of went off the light okay I that's fun having some problems are we my horse kids is phasing in and out of existence dad that is pricey you in the water over there okay hey listen I'm good cool cool hey come over no no come over this way come over yonder yeah at least you can still see me right who me oh-oh-oh I think we're entering into a flower biome over here it's very small but it does have some no Creek oh yes I have acquired new block which is interations congratulations yeah okay no just go straight to a village Jess that's not very helpful I would have bet a red tulip sandstone fence which I feel like we've done yeah or goes to arrows oh that's a lot of arrows Wow Wow that would just use for infinity yeah purple shocker box and then obsidian which would have been useful I also would have been useful dude obsidian is from the the pink tulips Oh dark oak log we somehow didn't do that goes to an activator rail a Federale goes to mushroom block which we have definitely done before yeah done all that but oh wait no in their mind I can't get that put I was like huh energy chest that's actually kind of useful oh that's why you got obsidian because you if you still touch it it goes to an ender chest that's kind of dope actually that's kind of dope we can just store some stuff huh yeah why not let's just put some stuff in here there's stuff in there yeah so many tulip goes ooh ender chests like I don't know iron for stuff and Shanta Golden Apple or I don't know wood wood that I could access at any time there's there's a bunch of stuff that could actually be useful another ender chests anymore pink tulips there that turns into another wart block did we do not know we haven't know that nothing I was gonna I was gonna silk touch it but that's fine I think that's giant Oh yep glass which leads to a new terracotta leads to a different kind of shelter box leads to black powder No Oh which leads to great it's I hate it because it Forks in like different directions once you get to the concrete powders yeah cuz it's like I could have dang it I could have put it in the water and then I would have got the else but now we have two concrete powders in that path and I don't want to lose all the ender chest because I was like putting stuff into it so I don't know did we break obsidian we did yeah we did yes it goes into nothing because we were digging out before he made the the thing right right right so definitely made well this flower plane could potentially continue over the hill and if there are more of the pink tulips then we could check out the different having's uh we even tried llama I don't think nope we're having a llama tonight sorry llama Carroll the llama the llama the llama zilch nada nothing you got experience well okay it's more than not kind of a big deal dude kind of a big deal Swamp have we tried vines I can't no vines lead to jungle leaves which then lead to great great we definitely have before yeah yeah I'm Colin died right order me see there is a new flower over here that I can try though you can try a new flower mm-hmm where's all the lily pads it's a swamp no what about to use it this is a swamp without lily pad brown concrete powder have we done that before that's excited Murch brown concrete is overrun concrete's totems which we can get totems from [ __ ] in the witch's head you can kill a witch raise flowers easy-peasy we've not done a witch no I don't think so we get n stone brick and beetroot seeds huh you want to save it so I can still touch it or sure I'd have done that before where did you head off to I'm killing a witch okay and she didn't give me much of anything I was a cat in there hmm I don't know whether you got off - I'm in the middle of the swamp here Accords 1500 negative negative 15 negative fourteen eighty negative 189 oh okay oh you went way off in another direction for me name dude I wouldn't do them small up I was like a swamp yeah who's it down or a swamp yeah dark oak trans oh I see the witch's Hut is that we're at I killed the witch oh I see you I see you there hello I'm on the other side oh yeah oh yeah I'm trying to get out of the water so we can just continue heading this notation come with me horse I jumped off the horse so that I didn't disappear I was like no I don't want this did you soak touch a lily pad I don't think they did yeah I I did okay Oh jungles would have watermelon too and also we could do monetize a panda we found that and you know sad sad I know you could you have been banned from China yeah you were now I'm out of our Hong Kong well played there's a way have we done the I don't know if we've done the Blue Orchid yeah we definitely been no slime good slime those spawn and freakin swamps oh yeah cocoa beans too okay you just make more slimes I'll do a little slimes drop

you are hey what's up horse dude what's up he was he was never that far from your heart hmm okay well this is not good I needed it did the horse disappear again I didn't disappear but it's just you know got it swim across with them I'm all set I'm on the other side I got you no trick we have tried to play except I kind of think it comes out as a as a concrete powder but I wonder if or as a concrete but I wonder if we were to do it outside of water if it come out as a powder which is hard to know well in the I don't form it doesn't do anything it's only if you place it down as a block have we done rosebush doesn't do anything that way yeah nothing dang nothing at all there's zombies I don't know whether you have gone through I am just on other side of three I see zombie I'm right by where I wrote you I'm literally where your brain is I'm up on the tree Oh tree traffic it's a little it's a little difficult to aah no no no okay good yeah it sucks for trying to ride a horse through the forest hmm it's like it's like horse parkour oh that's a good idea for a map oh my god no no idea of that yeah I think I think enjoys in the chat hens would you hear this work or no one will play it I promise score score I will play a dude core score dude it's emotion as it really it's just the ocean oh goody leave a coral biome we definitely have seen what vines break down into now don't hurt yourself it's not worth it well we can just continue this way that's what I'm doing yeah you can tell by the way I am how the oh there we go ding-dong it's got to be like a Mesa or something honestly okay all right trees wolves I guess well it's worth a try sorry pups what did he give me red sandstone slab I think which you've definitely gotten before big big ravine do not fall down ravine some kind of many many depths if all many depths if fall yes actually I got from that skeleton cracked stone brick which I don't think you've done no and I got two of them that you can try this the biggest offense all right which gives us a clownfish yep good times all around good times oh that's a creepy creepy is it yeah dang dude it's praying for a Mesa biome seriously I was praying for blaze rod of sorts I'm kind of swinging back towards with the ocean I was just kind of following that path a little bit all right it's such a pain it appears like we're through I mean it's true pretty good I have headed back towards the ocean don't see you yet I am at negative twenty sixty one okay I think I am on the right freaking track at least the freaking track these are can we get out of the freaking forest so we can get on this frickin track uh have we tried double hi friends oh that's where you got your cracked brick I was like skeletons don't drop that oh there goes my horse I'm starting to feel like the horses are more trouble than they're actually worth I'm doing fine with it oh I found the damn thing that does the dang I was just another coral block dead fire coral trying to get away from me magenta concrete gives a book so yeah I tried the whatever the that stupid plant that hurts oh they're worthless berry bush yeah um is this uh oh just a lava pool next to some stuff lighting it on fire I'm not sure wow I just found a mean I don't know whether there's new blocks but I found that I think it's what is it outpost post yeah oh I've never found one of these in a in a world before like a survival world that's sick you can't say that anymore it's right here bro that's sick okay well there's definitely some new blocks we can try here I think also I have a bunch of different kinds of wool and I tell me when I got them I got a zombie head oh that's worth trying it gives a cactus and a putt okay oh there's there's some pillager boys over there regular cobble gives the old oxeye Daisy the dead bubble core what honey what the pink wall gives brown wool yellow wall gives horse you cyan concrete gives a dropper did you put down a fence for your horse uh no but there should be one that we could use right here okay my horse is on his way he's like I know that's why I was saying they just they they try to go bye-bye but there's there's fence right here so I wonder if we can hook into it oh yeah definitely yeah use the resources available I got back to pufferfish yay he's always I found netherrack high-end stone stairs which is new to prison block to an oak sign to a daylight detector okay I wish this is like no don't hit my horse I just tried like 800 things that went nowhere but sorry horse Oh God pillager is out here dude there's a couple of them

all okay us even this before red wool I did the stairs the stairs I think it was either cobble set yeah the cobble stairs goes on an adventure but it does end up going nowhere hello okay it was like eight things that eventually ended up with bamboo and or the bamboo platform and then scaffolding and then that died out jungle slab is the chest loot at the top I think I've done this one before pretty sure they keep spawning more I don't like it yeah I've done this one yeah we can I think we've done what there is to do here for the most part found one in a regular in a regular world yeah
