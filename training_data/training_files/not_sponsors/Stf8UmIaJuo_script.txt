while a casual gamer might not pay too much attention about their gaming mouse for a lot of people the accuracy weight and shape of the mouse is incredibly important so then Logitech G Pro Wireless is only 80 grams has 60 hours of battery life and a top notch sensor which is great if you want to spend a hundred and fifty US dollars on a mouse 150 US dollars for a mouse so today we're gonna show you how you can get a mouse with nearly the same swagger what's more than quadruple the battery life the nearly just a third of the price do you love your pet but have a booking at the link below [Music] this year is logic XG 305 light speed I know it doesn't look special and to be honest aside from the light speed Wireless and hero 12,000 dpi sensor it really isn't there are clear places where corners have been cut and costs have been saved like there's no RGB there's only three extra buttons and it weighs nearly a hundred grams which in a field with players like the final Mouse airs 58 at 62 grams is actually pretty fricking chunky but bear with me for a minute here because on the bright side the overall shape is a straight copy from Logitech's much-beloved g pro wired not the G Pro Wireless because they're completely different and it's cheap relatively coming in at just under $50 but it's not a new Mouse in fact it's been on the market for almost a year so why are we talking about it now well that year has given the enthusiast Mouse community plenty of time to dream up little hacks and major mods to make it into a mouse that can really swing with the Heavy's or in this case the lights the light hitters before trying these mods we need to establish a baseline between the stock G 305 and the G Pro we think it could beat okay so this is the first Mouse I want you to let me know about the feel and the weight of it okay I usually use AG 502 so I am yeah I'm a chunky boy I mean how can I not love the G Pro wireless it's light and Wireless and it still has like the fantastic sensor it's so balanced it's great it's like like no part of it feels too heavy it feels like it's just like so easy to move so easily carry and it's like it's pretty natural to move it like I don't know everything about the G Pro is just good I think this is what a wireless mouse would be like that's the baseline that's a standard is this mouse heavier well this feels heavier I think the G 305 is a bit heavy for my liking it seems shorter I don't know if that's true but it seems like a less longer yeah the weight distribution feels fine it feels like it's definitely back heavy it almost feels like there's too much weight kind of back here there's it's not on the back end it's more Center so it's where my fingers are I think I like the shape of the other one a little bit better yeah it feels heavier in the back as well in the same kind of way if the G Pro Wireless is a 10 as a wireless mouse the G 305 I would have to put 7 yeah it's just like way too heavy so weight reduction is a priority there is actually a ton of support for the G 305 on sites like Thingiverse with full honeycomb shells ready to download and 3d print which can get this mouse down to obscene figures like 65 grams for this user set sadly that's not something many of you will be able to do at home if you don't have a 3d printer but don't worry there's still a bunch of room for improvement that is more accessible namely towards the back of the most where there is a 23 gram weight in the form of an alkaline double-a battery there are several different choices with some benefits to each approach so we bought them all and weighed them for your viewing pleasure and if the pleasure of maintaining the 250 hour rated battery life is important to you then the natural choice is likely Energizer's lithium doublea's which bring the overall weight down 8 grams from 96 to 88 that's a sizable jump but the lack of recharging is a bit of a bummer so if that matters to you we'd recommend some rechargeable lithium double aids like this pair from 10 volts that we picked up for a admittedly rough $26 on Amazon they have an advertised 1000 discharge cycles and they only have a 2 gram weight premium over their non-rechargeable counterparts but for me the stupid long 250 hour battery life is honestly a bit unnecessary I'm personally a fan of using a standard rechargeable nickel metal hydride triple-a battery with an adapter this give us about 100 hours of rechargeable life at about 86 grams not too shabby along with being better for the environment than a disposable and a hell of a lot more convenient however the lightest option is actually a triple-a lithium cell at just seven and a half grams for the battery and an additional two grams for an adapter we bought on Amazon that we cut up to save weight although you can also just use a small tinfoil ball and some tape to make it even lighter this setup brings our total weight down to just 82 grams only 2 grams heavier than the g pro Wireless add nearly a third of the price let's see what our testers think now Wow looks like the other one hmm interesting yeah it feels really light that's awesome this one does not feel as back heavy bottom heavy y'all the weight that was in the back is just gone it's only get like shifted it's just gone there's less weight back here and it makes it easier to move around when you're gripping it kind of like in the center it doesn't have as much junk in the trunk you might say do you see that kill this feels like a much more like balanced Mouse it feels great it's like light definitely feels more balanced than the one I tried earlier more ammo yeah 305 with a lighter battery is basically just the best most in the world the modified G 305 is not a 10 yet I think it's eight eight and a half this is a hundred what how much is it 50 why is this worth ninety more dollars yeah this is pretty amazing and if I'm saving $100 u.s. I would probably pick this up okay not bad but overall it seems like there is still something have you said for the engineering put into Logitech's flagship G Pro Wireless with its near perfect weight distribution excellent feature set modularity and no fuss functionality hell we actually love both mice and if the G 305 isn't quite the right shape for you and or you have the money to shell out the G Pro Wireless should definitely be in the running for your next Mouse what show should the G 305 that's the end of the video go out and get this thing it's gonna be good it's gonna be and thus you just have mitts and maybe get to working for me though the math out at drop comm at the link in the video description so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked which it didn't you know what to do but it was awesome so like the video get subscribe and check out the links to where you can buy this stuff in the video description also on that down there is a link to our merch store we can get cool shirts like this one and a link to our community forum which you should totally join is that a bad guy I'm not gonna die there's no way did I kill the bad guys David Ellie 17 are they below me use them both the same time this isn't bad actually this could work
