you think my knees are crossed I think you boy are you kidding me these and jeans of super says hey guys and welcome to today's PvP challenge today we are on the beta world's the same beta worlds from the battle royale and Lincoln I figured we have to get all the content we can out of this world while it's still here so yes you see a very outrageous Third Age pickaxe and Third Age axe and the 250 coins in the inventory now as you can see we're starting this episode north of the lava dragon Isle it's gonna be a will the only but the thing is it's only gonna be the northern part of the wildy the line that will divide it is the prey or ulcer so draw a straight line from west to east across the map everything north of that is allowed now it's very hard to get tools so all the tools that we need are in the bank link and I just grabbed every tool we can think of we also have a max cape in the bank that we can use to get back really quick if we do die and we can use it to change our spell book during and before the final fight so linked pretty self-explanatory and we're nodding on everything in this chat we've got unlimited Rob yes yes a limited run so that's not gonna be an issue cuz with big areas so it's it's the worst thing about these challenges so which means we'll be a lot more efficient here than we would normally yes yes but anyways link let's hop into this two hours on the clock we can attack each other and before we start guys just want to also say we will have a five minute grace period before we can actually attack each other just so we don't rack each other off the very beginning because that's that's rough that's rough so link let's hop into this and start the challenge let's do it mom but let's give one last big thank you to rake on for sponsoring today's video ooh start of the exact same time all right I'm gonna go the rune rocks the rune rocks are gonna be meta because you can make rune equipment you'd also superheat it Smith it I'll get get a lot of money to buy magic runes it's gonna have a lot to do with these brunei tours got the Sapphire nice and wet all the room rock and it looks like link is holding his pickaxe so I think he's gonna rush through and I ORS I'm gonna hold mine sooo so he knows it we have that 5 min a grace period so he's definitely I can attack me in that time there's a lot of room doors to go around it's gonna be a very intense competition I think so let's see we can hop across that I think there's actually a rune or down there as well oh I might have to check that later though but I want to try to yank these from him smashing is he gonna do it as well I stole about it no come on come on come on come on come on come on yes oh my god come on come on come on come on come on please oh my gosh you just like one tick that rock are you kidding me too what just happened okay there's three room rocks up here and it looks like link isn't going in this direction which is actually great news because I think there's three up here I can get cold really really quick from the chests the will detests too by the way okay that is all three rocks in the West is called the frozen waste plateau yeah all three rocks are mined from there and the timer is set so 12 minutes we are definitely gonna make our way back there now in terms the order I want to do things I'm not too sure I definitely want to bank a lot of things as I get them because you know when you die he could go in the room and I or or whatever I have in my inventory and that won't be good at all so probably at a bank B's and then I might head right to the row chests because I mainly want to get food I mean there's many things we can get there like coal and whatnot I'm not too bothered about that now I just want to stack up on resources but also I guess he could rag me so there's many ways to think about this but let's just bank the ruin or the 250 coins will probably keep the axe just so we can slash the web and yeah try to get some sharks okay uh he's gonna get the three rocks up there that's fine I'm gonna get the one Rock down here and I'm also gonna grab myself the battle stuff and the steel plate body oh that's [ __ ] brilliant okay let's get the staff of Earth even not battle staff just we have a weapon and then yeah we'll grab the plate body as well gold necklace I'll take it it's got a high out of 270 probably worth taking as well and then let's grab the plate body and we got ourselves a few outs and a little bit of protection as well if we do run into kids while we are getting attacked I've just realized my stopwatch is the wrong way around just gonna have to deal with it guys I do apologize so I yeah we're going from nothing up to two hours apparently please don't attack me oh I've been poisoned oh no there we go we have three rune rocks beautiful so we're gonna try to get a lot of sharks really really early on I think that's gonna be the smartest place so let's Bank everything like that perfect well guys link is mining coal link is mining coal you can get coal much faster from the Rogues chests plus so much other things so I'm actually really glad to see him doing that really glad to see him doing that thirteen coal already see you get it so quick but the main thing I want is those sharks maybe I can make some room stuff early on and try to I'm a bit I think that's what he's gonna do ooh Kolak n yeah it's it's gonna be crazy and if he attacks me there's this whole castle like I try to navigate through and get him off me so zombies doesn't have magic I should be okay but freezes are gonna be crucial maybe I should go for like Biraj super early on so the first inventory is done or what I really should say is the first group of prior points have been depleted now prayer is really annoying to get back I could do it at annacarl and just wait a whole bunch of time is he in there I see you in there ID FB I want to get sniped right now that'd be horrible if I could just make it to the bank but yeah so I might have to run all the way down here recharge my prayer and do another trip we did get food but it's not the food that we want but all food is just gonna be greatly appreciated though because you know anything to help make link stay off me it's gonna be very beneficial yeah let's go recharge your prayer points and head on back because there's no way you can do ro chests with 0 armour 0 prayer points it's just it's just impossible honestly so I decided to also bring my third aged pickaxe with me so I could buy in those ruin ores on the way back up I'm gonna see if link mine those ones those first ones that we mined real quick cuz those should be back in like 30 seconds or so then I'm gonna swing north mind those head to the bank and then I think again I'm going to try and go to the RO chest and get those sharks I went to get those really early odd I don't want him to have that lockdown the rag ear and block me from getting sharks I think that's worst-case scenario if that happens I'd probably go for some barrage runes and at least just scare him away a bit you know there we go I fix the timer we're all good right let's go in here open the gate yes and we're gonna mine a little bit of gold here yeah we're gonna get ourselves two bits of gold and we're gonna get ourselves some coal as well and then we're gonna Bank and probably to be honest I'm gonna have to get myself killed here because I'm on such a low for not such low health that it really does make sense just to disclaimer I might be like 5 seconds off on the timer I'm just gonna play it by what kin says because obviously he'll be able to uh he'll be able to tell me when we're about to finish but ok we're gonna go ahead and smell a no we're not we're gonna go ahead and smoke a rune Akbar and can we smell another one though we don't have enough okay cool we'll just do one for now I need I really need to go get myself killed to be honest because I yeah we're really not looking great 40 HP at the moment yeah if applicants runs into me now he's gonna grab all of this loop so uh hopefully he doesn't see me poisoned splatted because if he runs past me now I think you'll probably dip he'll probably be like no not worth it looking at what gear I currently have and I gotta grab myself a Sara Cape as well nice might as well grab a couple just in case he kills me actually yeah he is gonna kill me hopefully straight away beautiful okay cool I think they should be coming in in a minute but I don't know if he's bucking oh yes yes yes yes yes yes I thought maybe he'd gotten I thought maybe gotten but he hasn't which is awesome nice okay that's both of those and then I'm gonna try and grab the ones he wouldn't mind at the start as well up here three Runa was up here are we gonna get it probably not I did expect him to be sending it back there to be honest I'm not gonna lie but you know we'll give it a go anyway while I'm here I'm also gonna pick up the water runes probably should have picked up the water runes but it's the cosmic runes I was looking for so there we go nice nice we got a room rock here that he hasn't come back for the other one is there so maybe he has grabbed himself one of the room rocks oh no its back its back its back it's there nice I don't think he's coming back for him which is interesting there he is there he is he's here at the rune rocks he just took those first to it so it looks like he's trying to snipe them let's see if we can come in and get this one link tried to yank the ore from me looks like he had that time perfectly he's going for it he's going for it come on come on no way whoo got it damn it man he's getting all of them let's um no [ __ ] way bro no way as he does that no I'm not gonna attack I don't want to skull I don't want to skull actually because I know if I die I lose everything I have plus we can't attack with the weapons anyway so not gonna be worth it punching into the bank he'll definitely get back in time actually I just realized I can set destination 44 and get to the altar much quicker that way we're actually pretty low in terms of our HP I need to cook this food I need to figure out the best way of course I can't actually unnoted we don't want to walk into him definitely not big yikes big bikes let's get that partner back and figure out how I'm gonna cook this food and find out the best and safest way of doing that also just forget out I can use tele block and if I'm ragging him that means he can't access the bank so that's gonna be pretty exciting if it ever comes to that of course that means I can't be casting barrage or burst if I'm doing that but it's just a good idea to have in the back of my head you know just got these two rune eye tracks that's hella sick I'm also gonna check down here first I believe there's one in there who there is with poison spiders so I gotta be careful oh gosh not worth it not worth getting poisoned over we that was a close call it's really just not worth it guys if I have food I'll keep that in mind probably pretty safe bet down here also there's a ladder in gates it's probably pretty easy to get away if he attacks me so well we'll just we'll just put that in the back of our head okay all those ruin rocks were just available but I feel like now we're entering dangerous territory it would be best probably to go back and fill up my prayer but I need to really secure these in the bank hope he's not camping the bank even if he is I could survive unless he's got freezes it's definitely not hard to do that and I have no food these are raw I can't cook these before I go there which quite sucks so I had to proceed with caution and hopefully we can get in the safe zone and we are secured in the bank let's just throw everything in there it is a safe soda in here right okay it is you know what actually let's get the mage cape real quick magic defense super easy to get totally worth it I'm gonna get enough to make a semi right here think that's enough with what I mined before we'll see we'll have to see I'm going into the majors Bank anyway to get my steel-plate body I'll grab the battle staff as well I think yeah he's gone in there as well interesting one of those one of those that's grab that let's grab the coal I'm gonna put those two away I'm actually gonna put all my coal all my rune away for now we're gonna grab that we don't need the cosmics right now and cool let's do that I'll need the hammer the hammer cool that was just in time hammer Hammer hammer Hammer hammer nice this is my [ __ ] off Kings gear to just make him piss off me in case he thinks a fight is up for it you can you can leave me alone kids that's what you can do room bar dice gotta see me you got to see me we have a silly rude silly oh yes I feel like I feel like I'm the king now I feel like I'm the king not gonna lie guys can I take on the rune Gollum and get the rune rocks here I don't even think it's worth it to be honest right I'm not gonna start pickpocketing the rogues I'm pretty sure I physically cannot fail so we're just gonna get pretty decent amount of money fairly quickly we just need enough money so I can get some casts and some Alex and stuff like that so that's why we're going for this I think I'm gonna have to drop a call yeah going for it and that is 897 coins right there I'll take it I'll take it well they've dropped an iron dagger P I'm gonna have to take that if I can poison him that would be amazing also dropping jugs of wine here I think I'm gonna go back I will grab one more joke of wine just in case we get into any fights I'd be really nicer to have that because we could probably beat him now even if he did have maybe a little bit bit of gear so we're to go back to the to the bank now I'm gonna buy myself some probably just gonna get some fire strike or actually I might just go with earth strike because I've got the earth stuff anyway yeah probably go with earth strike and we'll buy some of those I've gone too far here where the [ __ ] am I going this way yeah I'll probably buy some strikes and then we'll go over to the lava dragons hit them up by 51 of those he's bought some as well he's over by fire he's like he's there he's there he's over there yeah bye what were those 150 200 caste is that gonna be enough I want 300 I've got enough money yeah it's by one one okay so he's over at lava dragons right now doing exactly what I was thinking about doing which means if I get myself like three or four more food I might be able to absolutely end him here so I think I'm gonna pick pocket the Rogues just a little bit longer I don't want to take too long because I do want to go and get him this one looks suspiciously lured no I'll [ __ ] oh I could have been bad okay he's not doing what I thought he was doing okay well I guess we will go for it if he doesn't want to do it maybe he's already done it that should be the first kill it is what do we get some guan not what we're looking for but we are looking for the black dragon hide that's the only reason we're here so not too much of an issue to be honest okay so now what I think I'm gonna do is I'm gonna buy some gnats and some PHY rooms oh let's claim some rooms 50 we could actually just sell some of these I don't want to sell too much because again the whole tele block plan I might have let's buy some nature runes buy a bit more and they'll just buy a bunch of fire runes we're gonna need a lot of those ah no it's buy more than 50 all right so there's no range that's close by which is quite unfortunate but I decided to bring about a half at the inventory of food to the roach s there's actually a range right over here I went way too far hikes in the Rogues castle so I'm thinking cook these and then if link attacks me I could probably hold my own hopefully he's not going magic this early on in the fight that'd be crazy but yeah this could probably at least defend me over any attacks but of course some low prayer but I really just want to cook these before anything else truthfully check this out guys we got 20 sharks 30 death runes 40 chaos runes some diamonds I'm actually gonna go in here real quick there's some gold ore spawns that we could pick up and use this to make some jewelry and stuff which would be really really nice I actually just had a horrible thought I realize there's only a limited amount of Bloods and deaths in the shop probably you should have thought about and out early on now that I think about it I didn't check to see if he did that and I'm a bit nervous now but we have but but we have those rune ight bars so what we're gonna do is rush back there make those into medium Helms Alec them oh don't kill me don't kill me okay let's check the store I have to see this oh you can't buy blood you can buy the deaths though I might buy these out I might buy those out interesting so we can't do barrage I guess there's still so much time left though huh I gotta figure this out real quick chem by death runes but I have a decent amount of deaths anyway those chests are very very generous let's see 30 60 I guess it's not too much we can just you actually okay you know what let's just use the bars I'll probably make a rune scimitar that much of rune meds and I think I'm just gonna buy some death runes maybe deaths and chaos [ __ ] I thought there are blood runes in here this kind of changes everything now now I'm kind of unsure how to approach this kill number 2 are we gonna get looting bag rude like bolts [ __ ] sake not what I need but they might ask for a little bit actually 180 each yeah okay we could probably just go ahead and and out them although I think the the mages bank actually sells nature runes for more than that yeah right I don't have enough runes for another kill so it is just gonna be three here I'll have to come back for another one to make van braces I think that's a little bit annoying should have bought a hundred more but it's the way it goes sometimes there's gonna be the kill come on give me something good give me something good oh you a beauty right let's err for that odd no way kids coming near me no way he's coming near me here surely not surely I'm super protected right now oh that's awesome okay we need to get back and I need to probably start getting some food together now grabbing the sapphire again so we now have enough for two recoils I'll be able to make them at the and I mind the gold already so we're good on that front hopefully I can grab the room rocks I'll do that same route again mind these two and then mind the three round and then that should to be honest be enough for what I want to do right I think I have all the room I need now I'm gonna go back to the bank and do a little just work out what I want to be doing here because I'm not 100% sure how I'd plan is shaping up it's a little bit everywhere okay selling the nature into 180 each which means we can out this mace I got from killing me a little guard guy or the ice warrior even I'm gonna Bank the D - now I'm gonna get rid of Oh gonna Bank those for now as well how much do these out for and watch these out for - 7 th okay might as well buy a few more outs are the 9 th I'm a [ __ ] idiot [ __ ] sake let's go and get food okay I'm gonna go feed a few rogues and hopefully get a few wines from that and then we can sort out how I'm gonna get my food okay we've got a decent amount MOT wines now and I've got three kgp pretty happy with that gonna quickly go and make the recoils now yeah let's make the recalls now - sapphire rings and then I want to enchant one and it shot the other beautiful two rings of recoil I'm gonna grab a bit more coal and then we're gonna go back okay we need one more lava dragon kill and then I'll be able to make the van braces I'll also be able to make the D hide body which would be really really nice so yeah just gonna get this killed quickly and I've got more than enough runes now so we're good to go and then I probably need to go and i could upgrade this to a kite shield I've got enough rune or I'll probably make a decision on that at the end as of right now I think I'm just gonna go and get the food sorted after this kill yeah so I'm gonna do so let's quickly make that rune scimitar just one of them and then to med Helms just so we can out them because I where's it ruined short stories that give more money either way it's by a few hundred coins if anything so that's fine we'll al Cleese and just buy some deaths I just don't know exactly what method I'm gonna be doing but if this stops him from going magic or whatever then it's definitely worth it in my eyes and we still have so much time to get somewhere Brunei or I'm probably to do that next as well and we have that 20 sharks which is is so reassuring it's just so happy I'm so happy yeah Wow these sort more expensive for him if he wants to you know buy some of those did you buy some cosmic or only 20 in here I don't know the shop - well guys as you can see but uh yeah cool we're actually gonna bank this rune scim II yeah I don't see that I have one I want to think I'm like wearing nothing I have nothing obviously it's not hard to get but that's good to be the strategy link yo inked up the rune eye Oregon not sure how much he needs truthfully I mean maybe he just wants to buy out the shop like I was thinking I'm not sure the fact that it doesn't sell bloods I'm not sure how much I care because I can just go to the rogue chest which is where we're going right now by the way kind of taken the long way because I'm already in route yeah we could squeeze right up there should be fine should be fine another rogue chest trip complete ten more sharks which means we do have a full inventory for at the final fight I'm actually gonna swing past those rune eye tracks right now and see if those are taken and snag them if they aren't so I'm gonna try to snag all six ruin I tore these two I will go for the one down below just because I have some food now so if I do get some damage it'll be okay by the time I get back to the bake it should be gone or almost gone and then those three over there as well so a total of six they might be mined I don't know but we're gonna do a nice sweep through and see if they are there to get that extra coin guys extra coin I'm definitely going magic this challenge if you guys haven't realized I figure I can go full rune rune scimitar and if he has the same gear it's an equal fight but if I have I guess I can't really get blood and so they kill it and coos or something but if I don't then I'll have ice burst yeah ice burst and it can just freeze him in spot worst-case scenario he has ice burst too so I think magic is defi the way to go for this one I've just realised the rune square I got from that from that laughs dragon earlier was a one in two thousand seven hundred plus guys it was a rare drop table rune square shield what hopefully that's the kill it is very nice what are we getting live dragon bones and some queens I will take it I will take it cool let's go and sort our food out I'm gonna drop that and that as well now this is the moment of truth did he think about it did he think about getting a lobster pot and is he killing an coos for dark fishing bait this is where we'll see it guys this is where we'll see whether we're gonna get the food advantage or not I mean it doesn't give us conclusive evidence have I taken a 10 there really doesn't give us conclusive evidence the fact he's not here but it does make me think that we have a better chance that he hasn't thought about this which is always good dark fishing bait 60 [ __ ] beautiful let's get out of here I thought they'd drop them in once I totally forgot they dropped them in that March how much do you need dark fishing bait each cat uses up one piece of bait 60 [ __ ] dark crabs right there guys oh he's there he's there bees and jeez what's he got what's he Hocking what is he rocking what has he got he's poisoned he's poisoned what am I here for lobster pot lobster pot lobster pot go we're out we're out we're out he's poisoned guys he's not having a good time he's not at the good side I think he's been down mining the room Rock probably I probably could have killed him there but he was by a bank he wasn't gonna have anything on him he wouldn't just banked it all and I would have scald up so yeah I think it's better than I just left him there otherwise I'd you know I've really wanted to kill him because I think we had him I think we had it but I think he's a little bit worried after seeing us there he didn't look like using the best of spots right dark crabs I don't want him to see me so I'm gonna go right to the back here and hope he just I don't know walks past or walks around or something [ __ ] I don't know thingy we'll note these so I can note 60 dark crabs cook them then note them and that's gonna be super useful no I don't want a medium clue okay and then if we use this on the fire I hope we don't burn them I don't know what the burn rate is [ __ ] okay so we can burn them quite badly it looks like as well huh no hopefully this is gonna be enough I just have to get 4:28 here and forget using these in the before the challenge before the fight yeah the burn rate seems pretty high here use these on yeah 450 GP that's expensive how much money we have right now that is now a Philippa tree of crabs so I'm actually gonna go ahead and drop my wines there and we'll describe a few extra in case we do run into kins we'll be able to take out like 10 crabs or something and we made it back to the bank let's just put everything in six more everyone die or let's see let's see actually what I what I really can do is also a lot of this other stuff I think diamonds Alec for a lot we're not a lot but enough to be alt but yeah let's let's buy more runes actually we don't need to heck yes so let's make these at the bars and Smith them up get some coins for them wait a sec this just pops in my head could I claim that free staff from this guy doesn't that thing out for like 50k I hate you damn it to network anyways let's use all these bars up and buy some runes so you know what I'm just gonna go with the rune swords I'm gonna make all the rune swords we already everyone see me in the bang which I still buy bring to the final fight all this poison that's gonna mess me up crap of course it is just had the shark just in case of emergency so I'll look it back to you guys when all this stuff is made and alked and buying the runes guys these diamonds Alec for 1.2 K each so yeah we're Alchemist [ __ ] this actually just might be better money just send the chest and out the diamonds you get 1k every now and then and you get runes the rune spawn back really really fast guys we bought out the deaths we also bought three of these packs just to get a [ __ ] sonic chaos runes but they spawn back ridiculously fast so I think buying it out unless I just camped your hall episode it would be very very hard uh so I guess just what-do-i-do what-do-i-do what-do-i-do what-do-i-do do I rag him now I don't even have a staff I guess I could just go like this a Dyer gets +1 maybe I should have made a dagger but it's plus-one it's not like it's game-changing maybe I could try to hit up and coos maybe I try to hit AB and coos I'll just bring a shark's and all my casts in case I see him I'll have to spell book swap so let's do that really quick so decided to actually do something different I think I might just camp the rogue chests the rest of the episode I can get dragon stones and if I do get one I could actually make a what to call the bracelet which is pretty pretty cool if I get sapphires I can make recoils and if he tries to come here I have burst casts and even if I can't kill him it messes him up pretty pretty extensively probably need to grab myself some coal as well because we need to start thinking about making full rune and I think I might have to upgrade this year because there's a good chance he's gonna have one he's gonna have a kite shield so I don't want to be lacking in that area just because I got given a square shield so I think I'm gonna do that as well there we go that's all my fishing done and I don't think he saw me I was keeping an eye out I don't think he came either side so if he hasn't thought of this we now haven't given him this idea which is great and I'm just gonna go ahead and superheat a couple of them straight off where the [ __ ] is the guy there is so let's buy like five nature's nice super he yeah nice one of those super heat another one very nice Bank and we might be able to get one more done here yeah we're going to be able to just nice super heat that nice okay so how many bars have I gotten now because I've three bars so I'm gonna take that gonna take the hammer I'm gonna put that away and I'm also gonna change to will probably take I've got so many will probably take that and I'm gonna change my spell book to Lunars as well spell book Luna beautiful Bank that and then I need to grab myself these the needle and the thread let's do that and let's grab ourselves a few of those as well in case we do run into kins nice ok let's smell and make oh let's go on the anvil even make ourselves the rune plate legs nice and then let's go ahead and I didn't bring my pickaxe ah that's annoying ok that's ok we'll just go over to the fountain of rune quickly I wouldn't mind going into the final fight with this gear and what I'll probably do is just hit the obelisk go 244 will d4 charge my prayer come back I have all these sharks but I'm kind of dropping the items I don't need as I go along and I might just do this for the rest of the episode guys - dragon stones that means we are getting the bracelets the combat bracelet also if there's a way to get a ball of wool I don't see how I would but if there's a way I will also make a glory sapphires are apparently common and I actually haven't gotten it once in all of today I know I've been dropping my loot right now but I definitely would not have dropped sapphires so when I get the sapphire loot we'll go make everything the ring of recoil is the bracelet and we'll try to research the ball of wool and yeah simple as that also I think that is a pretty good alik if I make the bracelets like 12k or something not that I will I don't really need money right now I don't think so I want to say that link isn't going for sharks from the road chests he probably brought a lobster pot and it's going for the crabs I thought for sure he was just gonna say - no that was gonna take too long and it's like at the sharks and get the coal and the diamonds and the dragon stones and the coin drops the rune drops but I guess he hasn't and I'm actually gonna give up on the dream of getting the recoil it's the reason I say this is because if I go do another trip I'll have to come back he charged my prayer then go back to the bank unnotice make this and I'll have enough time yes but if link interferes with it at all it would all be for nothing I'd rather make this and then just play the offensive for the rest of the episode see if I can catch the money's fishing we're trying to do one last thing we actually do need that but we can actually buy it anyway so cool I guess we don't need to buy cosmic runes but we have so much money it's ridiculous I definitely don't mind anymore now for those of you don't know the fountain of rune gives unlimited casts on anything as long as just stood in the vicinity of it yes tan lever tan lever okay very nice and then we're gonna make one of these oh yes then we're gonna make that as well oh you beauty go take the D hide all just in case kin sees me and hasn't come up with that idea do not want to leak that to them spell book swap to standard and let out the plate body we don't need that anymore to be honest we don't need the staff of earth anymore either might as well get rid of that and I'll kit gives us a little bit more money to play with and I don't know what I'm gonna do with that money so for now I'm just gonna Bank Bank Bank bank those because we don't want to lose them now I'm gonna put the coins away as well gonna put two of these away I think yeah that'll do and how much room have I got probably gonna take all of the rune actually what's that for yeah they've got so much yeah I'm gonna do that a [ __ ] forgotten the pickaxe again and what's perfect about this areas I can make one bar at time so this is just gonna be enough here to do everything that we need for now might make a room plate buddy I just don't know the reason we made the black D hydros it was pretty easy to do and obviously if he goes magic I just Chuck that on and whip and whip you know laughing so we'll see but maybe it might be worth making a rune plate body as well if I have enough time and stuff because I've got food sort and I've got weapons sorted I've got pretty much everything sorted so yeah it's gonna come down to time okay and then we can make our kite shield which I know seems a bit silly but we know our kite shield which is obviously better and if I now kill these two rune eye golems I don't know how this is going to go I don't know if we're going yeah or not it might just mmm I was about to say it might be worth just going and mining the room rocks down below me I think it is actually yeah it's gonna be worth it yeah and then we'll have enough room rock again to be able to make a play body obviously and the great part about this plan is I can monitor this area as well this is the only place I know of I might be being an idiot that you can get dark crabs because this is actually under our zone it's just under our zone here which means you can't get the crabs there and I think this is the only other fishing spot oh here he is here he is boys and girls here he is [ __ ] all the [ __ ] oh yeah oh oh oh is you great let's get a PT oh yes this is [ __ ] amazing come on stupid nope he's gonna get gap it's gonna get gap it's gonna get gap oh no oh no B's and G's all these [ __ ] are gonna attack Oh No get this piece of crap off me right here where is he going Oh [ __ ] hell go go don't go get down yeah we go get the gap running in dangerous territory right now oh god he's got luck why do I keep splashing always caught me [ __ ] call me we're in multi and I don't know where Mott where there is no multi [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] let's take him to the chaos Alec yeah yeah yeah yeah chaos alleys on him chaos alleys on him alright let's get out of the case of the elemental maybe the elements will take him out this could go really really really wrong oh my god ah now he's the army me Chris could go really really really right okay we might get gap here go for I'm go for him go for him oh man that telly that [ __ ] telly keeps [ __ ] me broke and I've got no prayer left come on get away get away get away get away get away get away he's really not happy if I can just get to the majors bank I can actually Bank everything I'm fine that's what I need to do let's go to the majors bank go to the majors bank get out of here bank everything he's gonna get a few hits while I'm getting the while I'm getting the what's it called spiderweb but that's fine he's given up he's given up all right so he got away maybe I could have gotten an extra hit when you're slashing the web and stuff but that's totally fine my F keys are all wrong freakin magic is f6 and inventories escape it's atrocious that's why you didn't see any F keys in that little clip right there actually guys I figured it takes two seconds to do this okay what exactly do we need for enchant tracking so we need to earth runes let's buy some earth rings yep my coins beautiful probably actually already had worms in the bank but uh who really cares this should take like no time at all and if he really needs to go in the resource area I mean I'll see him there in a sec you know boom so we got that spank that actually go back to ancients that would have been really really really bad ancients sweet bank that let's just bring some tuna do we even have any tuna I don't screw it then we have extra sharks we have six extra sharks so this will be the final gear guys I'm gonna camp in the resource area hopefully he's there okay we're gonna do that I'm gonna get myself full prayer back and then I'm gonna go and attack him and just griefing cuz I'm ready I'm probably I'm not gonna get this room plate body which is a bit annoying but that's fine that's absolutely fine we've got the black dehydrate seeing him on ancients is great that means he's probably going ancients for the fight as well it can take that spot is he fishing please say he's not fishing what the [ __ ] was he doing did he just see me did he just see me was that all he said he just saw me and thought [ __ ] I'll attack him ah he wasn't even going for the dark crabs I thought he was trying to get the crabs oh I'm gonna go get some more Colvin I'm gonna get my pickaxe out we'll grab some coal and we'll get a plate body together just in case he doesn't go ancients in the fight here he is here he is Oh is he gonna rag me or something okay does he have magic too maybe he's dying on purpose I mean I have six extra sharks so it doesn't really matter it's to be honest I'll probably just waste my prayer a little bit try to get a freeze just like that we'll just do this we'll just do this we'll keep running around and play some games no he's going back in there he's going back in there I wonder what he's doing there we go caught the freeze caught the freeze I missed it ah let's see get up get out let's get up let's not risk it that could have been bad why am i trying to play games here there we go okay um right guys so that's linkdead he was definitely trying to rag me they're probably waste my food but I think I still have six perfect so what I'm gonna do is just spend these coins buy out the shop and even though it looks like he's not buying runes at all but let's just buy these death runes these come back so quick so it doesn't really matter right now at this point so this is how we're gonna end it guys I'll probably just walk around punch him let him kill me or something let's make sure we bank everything and yeah that was the final gear what you guys just saw me to you I'll make sure I have my f keys right in the final fight he'll look at him look at a look at oh come on and and and and and please yes come on that's got to be huge that's got to be huge no nothing nothing is he baiting me as well or we just both wasting each other's time though there we go that's all the bars we need if I had really hover with me if I'd been smart enough we would have been able to make it right there and we're not skulls there would've been no chance of losing it but there we got a minute 33 see if kins is here or not he seems to be patrolling this area I think that might have just been what he was doing I think he's now realized that I wasn't doing anything though so he's sort of given up it was like ah link doesn't even care so I think he might have stopped patrolling this area looks pretty good so far Smith play body there we go we got everything we wanted guys everything we wanted I've got the Dragonoid switch if he does go magic we're looking looking Beasley linkie boy my game interesting challenge we didn't really see each other that whole time until the very end honestly ragging at the end yeah we both stole a red rock off each other at one point as well yeah did you snag those first two is like so good I was so fuming starting off I think it's like kidding me in two hours that it didn't need to be contested so I was like huge but it's more annoying it's like okay yeah yeah I guess we'll get right into this reveal I mean I think you gotta know what to expect there's only a few ways you could have honestly gone I know you how to ruin Simmi yeah so you saw I had a room semi so I guess we'll just throw that on but if you want to give a space or I should say a gear slot that you want to see me put on let me know man let's go to hell mate let's say it's your favorite I know you like it I don't have a hell no really mm-hmm even though you're mining rune Wow okay nice nice hump it right now man was thrown ancients at me and Oh help I'm really goes loves okay black dragon hide Oh have you got a combat bracelet oh that's impressive rogues chest dragon stone yes I didn't think of it but I was like it's a rare chance is it gonna happen yeah yeah yeah Wow yeah fair play that's pretty easy it's pretty special black dragon Heights freaking me out of it though we'll see yeah nice little nice little thing to get for sure uh so it's serious your call yeah Michael mmm a shield Kent I don't have a shield what the [ __ ] did you do with your braid or did stuff okay alright okay where'd you get those could you make black tea hide at any place freaking me out a little bit there bud something someone's gonna drop out played me with the the combat bracelet to be fair well maybe in that slaw I'm not worried about the vambrace is like I'm gonna go keep I feel like we both know what we're about to see here my guy went Sarah though I'm a seller a man may I'm a sorrow I was actually gonna go guthix cuz everyone hates that one I just wanted to be that guy but I was like I don't want to be running around looking at that [ __ ] for two hours makes sense gives a little bit of magic defensive bonus yeah Ted actually Wow yeah that's pretty creepy and it was free it took 20 seconds to get so mm-hmm yeah I go leg skins I don't have any legs oh yeah he's going magic [ __ ] sake [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] all right how did you get the van braces man no you don't you don't get to find out so everything's out lay oh boy but secrets and I I have nothing else that's it for me [ __ ] off yeah that's it no nothing else to put on in any other slot nope [ __ ] you no okay all right well uh ring plate Oh two rigs of recoil kidding [ __ ] dude I was doing the rogue chest that I didn't get one sapphire sapphire Ford that's you know when I know to Royal Troon rocks off you and you went running that's what my [Music] ya see Rick the recoil Wow [ __ ] yet alright how did you get it I have to know what what's the strategy here I go I picked up the earth battle the earth staff from the lava thing okay when mind and whatever runes and errands so I could cast earth strike sad mob dragons killed them for black D hide yep then ran to the fountain of rune after a spell book changed to Lunas and used a tablet I forget about the rune and I use tan at leather hide and when you were casting agents at me at the end there I was so happy I was like this is incredible this is incredible [ __ ] yeah so I made by a bad braces that Andy hi buddy right and I'm gonna assume that you fished dart crabs correct yes yes cuz I was camping the chests for ages I didn't see you so I was like okay he's deaf he doing it cuz I saw you mining : [ __ ] I was like it does he even plan on going there you had a very like safe hidden away from everything sort of plan I feel like my sort of plan was like if I can cover both bases which I think I've done here then it's just gonna be down to where the kindess comes up with a 200 IQ move really yeah I forgot about which I don't know you might I'm a little bit worried that I don't know what you've got in terms of food I don't know and then obviously runes as well I will say I [ __ ] up a little bit I don't think it's detrimental I forgot to buy more of water runes but I think I still have enough because verse doesn't exactly use too much okay but dude I I was like he might be going magic right so I bought out so much runes I did see them go out and 289 waters but it's only four per cast and you know I'm gonna try to hybrid you so I bit nervous about having so little but I think I should be fine and then I precise yeah I decided not to go too through pot route and just get that with my coal to like save time so I'll do that take that's right like I'm shocked rare isn't it I got it pretty late but I knew I was gonna camp there for a while I was ready to rag you if you showed up sort of thing I did the same thing I was sat in the Resource Center I fished I think 40 dark crabs in the end so I had like 20 or whatever spare and I just sat there with my 20 dark crabs waiting for you to come and fish them so I guess right yeah we're just camping [ __ ] places it's that's it's actually funny how we had two different plans completely almost yeah dude I can't believe I forgot about the fountain rune because I would have never went magic I mean sure I could I could forecast you now but it's it's [ __ ] burst I've got a pretty high defensive yeah yes 62 plus magic defense Roger she's looking alright I'm rocking 13 right now bro yeah this one so guys if you enjoyed this episode right after this fight you can actually watch the same similar style challenge we're max but we're in felt-tip Hills we have access to the Dragons underneath myths killed all of MIT's Gilda Oh curses everything fells Appeals has to offer and the exact same thing like this one ragging competing for resources and then we do a final fight at the end like you see here so go check it out of that is of interest to you but of course it is because they're watching the fight right now link like they're curious about it but we have a fight to do right now and I have a feeling this is gonna go a certain way unless for some reason I'm gonna be way more accurate than I think but I think we know where this is gonna go it should be /se hopefully right but we'll say we've been surprised before yeah so you get the first tip man yeah okay he's probably read it the worst challenge that I could give this first hit out but yeah this is a really nice one to get first hit yeah actually are you ready yeah it's up to you man here we go however not here have I not hit i fuming sorry link dragging you everywhere this episode right you do what you want yeah we're definitely definitely not yeah this is this is like like I do my 13-plus magic dude
