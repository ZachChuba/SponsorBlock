hi I'm Annabel trades and today I'm going to show you another project that has been over a year in the making and that is finally my completed woodshop platform to host my website on for the last five years I started dreaming about this space 3 years ago when we moved to the farm and it was basically originally a condemned building that was constantly halfway under water because of flooding issues and a broken roof and this year a group of my friends and I totally gutted and restored the building at least this part of the building there's actually two more sections behind the section right behind me is going to become my metal and fabrication shop and the section beyond it is going to become my blacksmithing studio so if you want to see that a construction side of this video check out the building my dream shop video on my youtube channel I will link it below and now I'm going to show you what we did inside this base every finished building I'm very much of the mind that a creative space should be beautiful and comfortable I want to get inspired every time I'm in my shop I want to be a place that's fun to hang out because I love to work alongside my friends it's good to have open spaces to work but it's also good to be able to move things around to accommodate different types of projects the most important lesson I've learned though is proper storage is critical little projects like building clamp racks on French cleat or hanging up wood racks as well as finding spaces for all my little drawers that I have is been hugely helpful it's crucial for everything to have a home both so I can find the dang thing when I need it for a project but also so my friends that are always borrowing stuff know exactly where to return it [Music] so since we're already here let's start with my hand tool area and my hand tool chest this is a Dutch tool chest and this was a project I did before YouTube but the good news is that you can check those out through lost art press there's an article also in Popular Woodworking magazine and this is a fantastic photo chest because you can just pack everything pretty much up take it with you when you go it has a secret little compartment here that you can take out the coolest thing about this chest is that it has every tool you need inside it to be able to make a piece of furniture from a rough sawn board just pack it all up and roll it on out of your shop and build some furniture somewhere else this is especially helpful for me when I'm teaching elsewhere because it allows me to take all of my core tools with me of course I can make anything I want using these tools inside this chest but of course it's really nice to have some collections as well so you'll see various items some antique restoration tools some stool some tools I've helped actually develop for various other companies some tools I've forged myself some things I'm just collecting like the magazines that have articles I've written within it obviously no shop is complete without a mandolin you see my bow frame saw that was a video that we did a few weeks ago feel free to check that out you see the first tool chest this was the second project I ever made these were my first dovetails my first whole lots of things that I mean nothing about this chest is perfect but it has served me very very well one of the coolest features on this tool chest I think is this saw hanger and the way that the planes basically just used gravity to make it easy to grab them and use them but also they're not in danger of falling on the ground [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] then over here we have my workbench and this was my first project that I ever made you'll see that it's quite low and the purpose for that lowness is so that I have my center of gravity above my work as I'm planing you see my Moxon vise which is here to raise my work up to a comfortable height there's this cool restored vice which is a quick-release vise you can also pull up a tab and put a dog in a hole and clamp things this way of course the Moxon vise is removable the other really cool thing about this bench is it has all of these dog holes in it these dog holes are awesome when you want to use a holdfast or a clamping mechanism of sometimes and the most important thing that a workbench can do is give you solid solid surface to work on and also to hold your work pieces securely when you're a blur and let's move over to my favorite spot in the whole shop and this is my tiny wood stove it actually is made by a company called tiny wood wood stoves and I have a circulation disorder which makes it very difficult for me to work when it's not warm in the space and so I keep this little buddy piping hot and it has no trouble heating this entire space it has a Stirling powered fan on top which displaces the heat obviously no shop is complete without it shop kitchens those guys are great you see my first Windsor style chair all of my favorite woodworking books of course I love me some hand tools so that means that I love Roy Underhill here's his book and lost art Press Chris Schwarz if you haven't read the anarchist tool chest then make sure you check that out and here's another previous project from my channel as well my shave course you saw on my workbench I'm currently working on another Windsor sail chair so it is nice to pull that guy out and work on some spindles work on some spoon carving over here we have my sharpening station and there's nothing that fancy going on here it's just different stones slip stones and things like that my water stones which I soaked in water prior to use a little stop block to set my jigs so that I can make sure that I'm getting consistent results every time a flattening stone for my water stones my diamond plates for when I'm teaching various jigs and other things like that this is my Kennedy chest which is full of all my machining tools and I'm a big fan of organization and keeping my tools that I've spent so long restoring and up here you have my collection of molding that I've all restored as well that number 55 there has a very cool story I actually found it while I was helping a friend clean up their grandfather's wood shop and they ended up giving it to me as a gift as a thank-you present for helping them with that project the coolest thing is though the patent date is my birthday a hundred years before I was born and that was a fun little thing to figure out then of course here we have my saw stop with my router table installed than a cheapo workbench which I had just cut down to cut the legs down so that it could also act as an outfeed table it also has a restored vite a quick-release spice on it and this vise just drops in and out of bench dog holes so it's obviously not in the way of the Soph we have sledge storage sander I'm notorious for getting a project 99% done getting it fully functional then not finishing it properly for a long time that was certainly the case at this shop if you watched my dream SHOP video back at March you'll know that I was on a major time crunch to get it ready to film a project with the Wood Whisperer but the place then went without trim or a logical workflow or spaces for all my stuff were a really long time I played around with the tools and lots of different orientations and finally just now have everything just how I like it well most of my tools are on mobile basis it's easy to move them but a huge hurdle came when I decided to move that giant bandsaw across the room the last time I moved it I used a skid steer this time my buddy Nick and I used a crowbar some leverage and our muscles and I think I finally understand how the pyramids were built and then the piece de resistance or however that said this beast is in the process of getting restored I am retrofitting a old Powermatic fence for it getting the VFD wired up for it replacing all of the bearings and it is gonna be up and running very soon so be sure you keep your eyes peeled for that video as well in a small space like this it's important to have your tools on wheels so I'm able to pull out my favorite apprentice the jointer and electric planer when I need to use them but they also get tucked back in this corner as well of course no shop of mine is complete without a lathe and my little bandsaw over here which I basically just used to make sure that my big saw doesn't get a complex is this is also on wheels and I can pull it out and use it wherever I want as well then over here we have my drill press and this little fence system by woodpeckers tools is super awesome I love using that of course Adam insisted I put a TV in here for his occasional visits to the shop and then over here we have my miter station which is basically just a whole bunch of clearance cabinets from my local box store and they might have saw you'll probably notice all kinds of vintage drawers and things all over the shop I love as I said organization and everything of mine always likes to have a special home that it lives and so I collect those at any kind of estate sales and garage sales that I can find any hand tool woodworker has to have a saw bench so of course you've got one of those I actually should make another one but I often will just you know use my saw donkey instead just giving [Music] [Music] as I mentioned at the beginning of this my woodshop be sure you click that below thanks so much for supporting me Cheers and then the pasties and then the PS turist and then the position
