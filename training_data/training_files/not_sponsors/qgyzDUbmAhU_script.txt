today's video was actually inspired by one of our four members because people like to watch stuff get thrown at you so thanks stab your face for recommending that we do the amazonbasics thing again with monoprice stuffs to have your face that's the username and well know it's only two words it's stab your face got it and what is this look at that spoilers you'll find out soon enough and this model price gaming adventure is brought to you by Tory blogs wellhouse expecting you to same can't tell you that's a spoiler two story blocks video them out at the link in the video description [Music] so the premise is pretty simple yet again we basically went on a monoprice shopping spree not because they paid us or we even particularly like those guys to be perfectly frank with you I don't slide it too much oh it doesn't have a thief feed on the bottoms of this thing will screw up your desk Wow and potentially your day cheese you've you know you've as you get that so obviously this is a dual monitor stand yeah if you somehow want to put your dual monitor as vertically okay so what are the specs of this puppy this is a 2560 by 1440 P 144 Hertz freesync monitor 34 Hertz yes not bad it also has some kind of quantum dots and I tested the colors and they're actually pretty good over 99% coverage of srgb okay and how much did we pay for one of these 400 bucks so this was the $36 mechanical field keyboard yeah which didn't impress us much yeah mush City so it's a 10 keyless and it uses at Emma brown switches how much do I pay for the privilege of attending grounds two dollars more than that one thirty-eight dollars total and even though this one has the double shot injected keys that light can shine through yeah it's there's no backlight it's not RGB and this Amazon one is RGB did you hear that backspace when I hit it the key stabilization so bad Oh I'd take this I'd give up my number pad I'd give up my backlighting I'd give up my macro keys but then I type more than I game and when it comes to just lwas being around back when I used to game a lot honestly I used to membrane keyboard anyway so yeah but now you have taste Wow it doesn't have a forward button please tell me this is programmable I felt a lot of review thing it's not you know what this thing sucks and I hate it one thing it has is weight you can change the weight although it says push it actually means pull or push on this this is actually a cylinder stack a little weight tuning disc holy crap Brendan check this out so my gut feeling on the pixel response time motion blur look at the trails behind the banner on the ltte website as I move it around that is disgusting Wow see that I thought it was like an indoor parallax effect of the website no that is horrendous ever seen that in my life so that's what happens when you take a panel that doesn't have adequate pixel response times for the refresh rate you're running and just overclock the snot out of the refresh rate the worst part we aren't even at 144 Hertz yet but this is one of those examples of monitor specs being misleading it's like yeah 140 40 Hertz get your gaming gaming this is not gonna be an amazing gaming experience what keep at me hope right so their bread and butter is cables yeah so here we have healing so many mana price cables this is a mana price DisplayPort cable and way too much money this is an amazonbasics DisplayPort cable the monoprice one better be cheaper because this is a really old housing style with the the button lock this is the one that we had already oh just buy it we didn't just want to behold it no remember how in the Amazon video you're like why did you buy this we have a million of these yes well now I see how it was not necessarily better to do it the other way thank you James for illuminating that for me so there's two types this is the ultra slim one yeah that's four feet for ten dollars and this one is the premium one which is six feet for 650 bring me on this cheaper than ultra slim right that's probably just good because yeah this is cheaper to manufacture or you can get a nice braided wonderful Mavs on basics six feet for eight dollars I like this slim one really lightweight and it actually makes no difference for a digital signal to have a premium cable that's thicker braided or whatever else having this nice lightweight wire much easier to manage super flexible - I like this one mono price is actually fairly well known for their headphones headsets at least that's my understanding so these are they're $90 active noise-cancelling gaming headphones yeah interesting let's have the unboxing experience here my friends you can put your nametag in here put like a business card in there so somebody could wait what they're actually a spot to put it oh yeah there we go those are from this side okay oh but you could take it out if you want so if nothing else you've got a hook and loop business card holder even if the headphones are complete garbage and you hate them so you've got these inline controls and I like that it's got that soft touch fish yeah they would have done well to put this same finish on the mouse these buttons are very rudimentary buttons these are these are cheap buttons so they're USB to power the active noise canceling but audio is actually handled via analog is that correct so it looks like oh that's an unfortunate position for the inline control this thing is heavy whoa these are clampy yes no length adjustment on the microphone you know what I actually kind of like the bit of resistance to the articulation of the ear cups though because it means that they're not constantly like fighting you and that active noise-cancelling is basically just like someone going in your ears you're trading HVAC for a hiss well if you don't like the $90 premium ones you'll love the thirty or I should say $28 worst ones oh wow these are these barely even have padding in the top they're probably better than what I was using for 28 bucks back when I was like first getting into gaming but this is one of those things where I'd really recommend saving up or waiting for a Black Friday promotion or something in our cheap gaming headset roundup there were other sets for twenty-five dollars that were better they're done they're done I'm giving these a recommendation over these cuz for $90 you can get some pretty good stuff whereas for like 30 bucks yeah you can certainly get stuff that's a lot better than this but like yeah I don't recommend either none of what I just did is should be construed as an endorsement this is the mono price desk cover modesty panel with wire management you know your desk you're very privileged there's a wall there but some people might have you know other colleagues desk cover modesty panels so you can man spread without your privates exposed on kilt date so what the idea is you hang this off the back here desk with these clips you actually screw this on to your desk and then you just take your excess cable and just like put it in your pocket here well I think you've run it in this way and there's these little velcro that you could tie it in there with 28 bucks 28 bucks yeah if it was me I'd probably just get a tablecloth or like would you believe it has no reviews on Amazon I would personally I think it's great if you're the type to stick your boogers to the bottom side of your desk David Ratcliffe how else can monoprice improve my gaming experience today Gaming I don't know but they have other verticals that they specialize in like smartphone stuff with their stitch line Oh interesting what appears to be an antenna switch droid Khan's so this is a door window sensor when it gets opened it'll make an audible beep but apparently it's not that loud but in addition you'll also get a notification to your phone no matter where you are in the world because it's Wi-Fi not just Bluetooth so really today's theme is not home security though and home automation it's like your desk setup right so the way that I see it you got something really you know valuable in this drawer here or something wait let's put something valuable in that drawer yeah so if I were to come in here and steal yours hey oh there it is hey let's see if I can get a tamper alarm pull off the big one sure hey you tamper with my stuff oh you are tampering nice that's not a bad delay either bad boy I probably should have given you this earlier this is the monoprice 5 port 10/100/1000 megabit per second unmanaged gigabit ethernet switch for $18.00 that's not even a great price actually hey man it's got 5 ports even though the product page says 8 and this has the fakest review ever it says works great I love all monoprice products I'd buy and they stand behind the quality look I'm not saying I'm too good to wear a headlamp I'm definitely not too good to wear a headlamp I'm just saying you got to have the top one because these straps wear out and that's what it'll actually hold it in place now with that said this seems pretty alright yeah so you can get a tp-link switch with a metal housing for 14.99 with prime this thing is done it's done it's out its out it's done you don't blow you just hum no another way other way why don't the hell do they have this because they sell music stuff I know you're gonna do I show you I should have just bought the 150 dollar guitar well I'll be keeping that in my high-security drawer lest anyone tried to steal it from me that's a bargain to $8.26 although keep in mind 22% of people gave it a one-star for not working at all so for $65 i got us you know James I think you're really stretching the definition of desk accessories here what are you talking about this is DIY phone case dude I'm making a screen protector right now I figure we're not you're gonna vacuum seal your phone alright where's the vacuum seal acumen oh yeah baby isn't this the vacuum er this is an accessory hose oh yeah he's pretty sealed I think you just hit the release buttons now can you use it oh yeah sure let's see if my fingerprint sensor works no hold on no maybe fight okay nope no fingerprint sensor let's try the iris scan come on baby can you work through that come on work with me here no match can you please keep your phone in there until the end of the day but I can't use it can you keep it in this your ranch oh no come on please no that's not me how am I supposed to it's awesome looking good quick release so overall then you know what I'm uh actually kind of disappointed so do you suppose I mean that you don't think that Mona price is clearly better than Amazon basics no I really don't think I would say that at all I think they come out ahead on the keyboard even though these switches are really inconsistent feeling but I just the mouse isn't great the mouse pads alright I think I'd have a pretty hard time recommending this monitor it's just nothing special stick the cables monoprice yeah good cables monoprice good cables and I mean this thing seems alright to I guess you don't know that speaking of seems alright our check it out today at the link in the video
