hi guys welcome to another vlog this vlog is actually full of house changes it's really exciting I've got a handy one to come in and like hang everything that I need hang in and I'm just buzzing because that's happening tomorrow and I'm really excited but before I jump how you get in on that would be really nice but for now I'm gonna flashback to a few days ago where actually dyed my hair because I've just realized that I've got different hair if you don't follow me on instagram you won't know that so let's flashback good morning everybody today is hair dye day I was gonna get my hair balayage but I canceled my appointment because I thought I was going back to Sheffield and now I'm not going back Sheffield so I just thought I would do how diet myself because I cancel my blooming appointment now so I'm just gonna go dark and then if I want balayage anytime in the future they can just do it from dark and I'll have my roots dark right now the colors a bit weird I'm not really liking it I don't know if you can see that it's like gingery Brown this is the one that I'm gonna be using it's dark chocolate brown by John Frieda I really really like these these are the ones that I always use the phone ones so it should end up looking something like that hopefully and then I'll image looking like that which is not gonna happen but today is beautification day because we are getting our eyebrows done later me a month my eyebrows right now are like blondie mousy brown and I can't wait to have them super dark oh I'm just excited that you feel nice I feel quite grim at the minute so let's dive is her right let's go we're gonna do this as quick as possible I think it's about 11 o'clock and I want to get it done so here we go I've got my eye on now they'll leave it for 30 minutes let's do its thing and hopefully it turns out nice good morning I'm dyeing my hair again today because it didn't go as dark as I wanted which I knew it wouldn't because whenever you go from like warm toned hair to dark you need like a neutral color and I used to warm to have one so I've now got the shade 3n which is deep brown black and I think the N on it means it's like a neutral so this is the color that it went with the last dye remaini said okay color I'm just really wanting to go back to the dioxide so oh my god I like Monica good morning everybody I've just realized that it's been a good few days and I have an update with you on my hair so I actually went to get my hair cut as you can see it is a lot shorter I love it I feel like I had a tiny bit of not a bad haircut just a haircut that didn't suit me it went a bit longer in the front and he put a few layers in it and it just didn't really suit me I like mine super blunt yeah this is my hair now I love it and this is the color that the dye did i'll show you properly in the light if you can see that it's a really nice like dark dark dark dark brown just put a bit of makeup on today because i've got to shoot a picture for Instagram after after that I'm gonna show you all the changes that are gonna happen around my flat some changes happened last night I was bored at like 10:00 p.m. and decided to move things around so I'm gonna show you that and tomorrow is the day that the handyman comes to fix everything in it so I'm just so excited so rainy so this room is coming along so nicely I've got these new lights which I'm so excited about I'm gonna leave them as in a link below with your from a shop called spark and Belle and you can choose what color you want this and you can choose what color you want the piping as well so I went for this like big sag and the brass oh my gosh it's raining so hard so they are gonna replace these tomorrow which I'm very excited about because I personally hate them then over here I've just hung this friend I was gonna have this in the living room but I actually think it looks really nice in here it kind of gives me 70s vibes and then I've just got a little plant in the corner this was from battlin home excuse me strychnine involving so I got this cabinet from home since a while ago and I've never known what to do with it it's pretty much been in every single one of my flats and it's actually got my art supplies in because I do some oil paintings sometimes but aside from that it's never had a home and I think it really goes with the vibe of this room so that's amazing I was actually gonna get rid of it but I really liked it so that's that and then this little plant pot was from Ikea and then I'm gonna get this mirror hung up above this because right now you might think that that mirror looks too big for that cabinet I actually think when it's a bit higher it will look really good and it just kind of opens the room or so that's what's happening tomorrow he's gonna hang them hang the lights so yeah that is everything that's gonna be happening this room I really like the vibe of it I like where it's going a lot then in the hallway I don't think I've ever spoken to you about this but I've got these lifes which I think are from Ikea if you do like them they're personally not my taste I'm not a very silver person so I'm gonna be switching them out as well tomorrow and I've got these gorgeous lights these are from swoon Editions I bought these two years ago and I originally thought that I was going to be hanging them above my dining table that's why I bought them but now that everything's a bit more orange I think those ones look a lot better so I'm not gonna put these to waste because they're gorgeous and I'm gonna have them home in my hallway this home wait desperately needs painting and sorting out but that's light last on my list so these are just freshen it up a bit yeah I'm very excited for tomorrow there's also so much that's gonna happen in my bedroom oh my god she's nearly fell but I'm doing a whole video about that which will come next after this video so I don't want to show you any of it sorry good morning guys the handyman came yesterday and he couldn't do everything he couldn't mount my TV's because the one that I've got down there is too heavy so I either need to buy like a lighter TV or something it's very heavy like I can't lift it on my own it's that heavy and the one in my bedroom curry sold me the wrong bracket for it so it wouldn't go on the wall so he's gonna come back on no say I think either Thursday or Monday and mount my bedroom one I thought I would show you everything that you did to my dining room so there are a couple of things that I do still need to do in this room but it is pretty much finished now the only real things that I need to do is get my wooden floor laid but that I'll probably be in October and then obviously when that slide I'll get a nice rug under my table so just ignore ignore the carpet for now who'd wanna fire you but you make it watching this on my baby is my Kimmy five trying to take a deep breath but I just can't control my so as you look into my dining room from the living room this is what it now looks like I'm so excited about it I think it looks really nice so obviously the handyman hung these lights which I will link below anything in this room that I show that I can find I will link below but I actually found these files in Marks and Spencers it was nine pound 50 and it goes perfectly with my life so I want to get some eucalyptus in there I think my dining table and my dining room in general just looks so much better with these lights now let me know what you think in the comments and I think this is how my shelves are gonna stay for now I still think they look cluttered I can't really do anything about it and they offset so many times I don't like the way my DVDs look but I'm not gonna spend hours like changing the paper in them to all brown paper something match which was a suggestion and it was a good suggestion but I'm just not I'm not gonna do that I am turning these into built-in cupboards so I'm getting this whole thing ripped out and then I'm getting some cupboards made that just go up to the ceiling so they won't be there with doors on and I'm gonna have room for like my hover and everything people have suggested just putting doors on these but that wouldn't work for me there would still be a bit pointless with how they set out but anyways for now they look like this I think we look okay and then obviously I've got my flicker line I've got a battery on the way from Amazon so it's not the correct time right now but how cute is this this was actually a birthday present from my mum to me it was from me calm again if they still sell it I will link it then coming around this way this is what my shelves look like now moving along obviously I've got my print and this radiator cover which I used to hate but I actually don't mind it now it kind of adds to the vibe you've been a little plant in this corner I would really like a real hanging plant but for now I've just got a fake one from Ikea I still love this door that I painted I painted it in the shade railings by ferrule ball and I really like it still and then a handyman hung this mirror so now this is a vibe and a half I love this little area as well like from here I just think that looks so cool so it's perfectly centered a look how lovely I absolutely love it I haven't got anything oh my gosh ignore the mess in there that is the next room that's cave toward but I haven't got anything on the two walls I'm not sure if it needs it or not I think probably not so I might just leave it but here's another overview of my dining room it's so cute so cute now and then in the hallway obviously he hung these lights which look really cute especially the one going into the bathroom because the bathroom is so pink but as you can see my hallway is an actual mess right now so this one is in need of a makeover and that is it for this video let me know which room you think I should tackle next I'm like midway finished with my bedroom so that will be the next video and I think I'm probably gonna work on the living room but I'm finding the living room quite difficult with eyes a story for another day give this video with them if you enjoyed it and I will see you in my next video bye [Music]
