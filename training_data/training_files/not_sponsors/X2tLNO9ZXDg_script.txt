shame on you son the goal is to find some common ground somewhere anywhere the problem is I don't think that we have that anymore I think that might be the whole problem people are starting from they're completely different foundations now and their their goals conflict so it's it's different than just generational differences you see it's foundational morals and mindsets honestly I don't I don't think there's anything that can be done anymore no no I reject that I think that there must be something that you two can agree on come on Oh give it a rest son you can't do anything with these entitled Millennials yeah dad I'm never gonna get through to this privileged white nail she's never worked at Hollis and her like he's too blind to see that the world is changing with or without him Oh believe me honey I know all about the world changing I believe it or not in my day you had to earn your keep there was none of these government handouts that you Millennials love so very very much what is that oh this is my social security check how is that any different from any other government handout oh well granddaughter the Social Security is there to provide for the needs of the beat you know I don't really know I think we found something that you both agree on government handouts I'll happily pay my taxes if it means you guys will get along yeah grandpa looks like maybe we do agree about something you know what granddaughter you're right Social Security is a government handout that helps keep me alive and you know what the longer I'm alive the longer I get to spend time loading McDonald's Jimmy Trump boom government handouts not sounded so great anymore are they honey I will never die oh well maybe next year stay tuned for a scene that's squarespace.com slash Cal go do it next week on messy Monday's grandpa gets an award this is what I don't understand honey okay you spend all of your time building up emotional walls between me you your father I've even heard you say the f-word on Facebook why won't you support building a physical wall to keep the aliens out grandma I'm just gonna leave Oh what do you want a participation trophy what okay in hindsight that really didn't make that much sense would imagine how much of a sick burn that would have been had it been in a different context I think that I deserve at least some kind of credit for that
