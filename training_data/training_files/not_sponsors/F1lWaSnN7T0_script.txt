you're kidding you're kidding what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] you're joking literally jump this is alpha testing a cool guy from us who holds a current Longchamp record with vanilla settings vanilla settings are exactly the same with matchmaking while for Casey to use a bit different settings for better movement that involved pre strafing 360p hopping or high air acceleration in this video alpha is going to help me out and show you some very hard champs in csgo teller doable in regular matchmaking so everything is vanilla here although you have to have amazing movement skills and you also need a bit of luck on your side very quick and easy let's watch it one more time in slow motion in my opinion slow-mo is the best part of those movement highlights super general the next jump comes from the map named agency and CT spawn from those stairs to the platform over here this one is kind of risky as if you fail you will fall off the map alpha has said that it takes a bit of skill and people should be proud of their slaves to land this one I can only confirm that when you fail you'll be dead and here's how it actually goes you can definitely see the hours and hours that has gone into developing those crazy strafing skills without the practice I'm brave enough to say it's impossible and let me remind you this is the second easiest jump in this list alright train and jump from a site form train to red train once again straight up long jump it takes some hard strafing and you have to land on a clip brush that's a little higher than the Train itself consider yourself good if you can land this one that's what alpha said and I can consider myself not good enough on the other hand I'm happy to work with good guys here and of course the same beautiful jump in slow-motion a very accurate takeoff + very smooth landing 12 style points from me [Music] now one of the most popular maps in the game right now and believe me or not it's once again a pretty fresh slash heart jump for you trash to triple alpha said that this one is kind of hard for people not comfortable with strafing hard out of be hubs however this one is very useful he did a pre keep long jump which only three other people in the world have managed to do right now he knows a lot about it so let's believe the numbers I'm not gonna even try this myself but let's watch eighty successful attempt I wanted to say simple as that but it's not really a right place to do so also I have no idea what happened to this guy I thought it was a friendly jumping session once again train jump from cat to yellow train on beep on-site our master said that with this jump we are getting into the stuff that could make it to read it if you Lantis with a long jump either you have no life this game into oblivion like him or you're using a script or you're using lower sv gravity like me let's see how it goes with default settings amazing stuff also one rule that I just came up with the harder the champ the better the slow motion it's only getting better and better like a great wine but don't drink and casey actually when you're drunk you naturally start strafing so never mind alright agency jump from CT to e box here we go into high hops AKA jump box this one isn't particularly hard for the more experienced vanilla players at least the ones with high hop experience but as most people aren't tuned for strafing out of a frame of perfect set of inputs it finds itself on the list here we go we hope at its finest I'm not so sure what high hop exactly means but this is just a very attractive jump over here wonder if you hit that Anton instantly one Digg someone it's at least as good as winning a major [Music] next up multi bhop combo on lake alpha said that this one is just insane as of right now it's only been done in a competitive game once and that's with multiple members of the vanilla community trying to land it for cloud there's not much you have to do to get the cloud just a little bit op like that [Music] at least now we know what we're gonna see in wingmen in the next couple of days everyone goes crazy and we'll play like just to hit this jump in the middle of a match if you hit it you're officially insane [Music] Inferno jump from park to the top of the fountain not quite the last long jump you'll see on this list but this one is for the record books it's never been landed on 64 tick no matter how hard alpha tried even he had to do this on 128 tick so if you do lantus on matchmaking servers you could do straight-up Cisco history this is how history looks on 128 tick just look at the replay mat strips over here just mats trav√©s super general X 15 next up nuke and a site to create it could be very useful jump if you could only do it consistently alpha said that it's just [ __ ] insane two people in the world have ever landed this and no one has yet to do it without using the console to allow you to jump and Crouch at the same time for extra height if anyone ever did this no bind they would be heralded as God among men if you want to become a god you know what to do here's half guard performance I have no idea how it's possible but here's the video proof of it and I guess I just have to take that life surprises you every day one two three four before the new cash comes out there's still content on the old one and it should be the hardest jump on this map alpha said that this jump is a [ __ ] you got to start on the light try to not get too much speed when jumping off too light so that you can accelerate in the air faster while not overshooting the target today it is the only one who stepped up to this challenge without hacks here it is and the slow-mo first jump nice and light I can do it as well no problem but the next part is impossible I will promise you guys if I ever hit this jump I will give everyone who likes this video 15 bucks Young Money cash money feel free to take the deal iconic rush P map dust you with a pit jump although alpha may not be the first one Smike and Wes will both agree that this one is for the record books t demo file for trying to land this one is almost as large as all the other demos put together ladies and gentlemen we are talking about gigabytes over here let's appreciate that for a second and watch the result what a champ awesome skills Pro congratulations from the whole community [Music] Inferno and the chump from balcony to a side crates let me get straight into alpha testings comments here [ __ ] this jump my demo got corrupt and played only at 1 FPS so unfortunately we don't have a demo to work with but fortunately we have his POV recording from this amazing success this celebration says it all guys but before you see the sickest jump of the video he himself has something to say as well hey guys alpha testing here just wanted to say a quick thank you donating for giving me the opportunity to help make this video it took a lot of time and effort and I hope it gives you the inspiration to go out and try some of these yourself if you liked the video be sure to hit that like button and if you want to see more content from linking then be sure to hit that subscribe button I hope to see you guys soon ATL 80 has an amazing radio voice and you will find all his links in the video description if you're interested to see more sick jumps make sure to give him a follow and huge thanks to alpha one more time we may collaborate in the future as well we'll see let me know what you think about that in the comment section but now the sickest jump combo of the video it takes place on nuke 80 claim that is for sure the world's first and he hit it accidentally in his casual gaming session so he has no proper demo out from it and the POV recording he got is not the nicest either with a loud background track so I can unfortunately only show it without in-game sound here it is a very quick clip but it holds enormous content inside it this is how it usually is the best things happen to us when we are not ready for them right now I would kindly suggest you open your cisco go to nuke and try it out right now it really feels like we're playing a different game than him this is an insane gap to do it with a bhop like that by the way I have two more hard chumps videos for you already out on my channel I will put one of those on the screen for you right now there will also be my most recent video and the subscribe button to test your aim skills when you can't hit it in the next five seconds I don't know I would uninstall csgo [Music] you
