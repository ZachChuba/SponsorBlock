now you used to be a math teacher so does that mean you're gonna kill tonight in their numbers around right well I mean the problem is I wasn't a very good maths teacher when I first told my dad I was gonna become a teacher as furious because he thought was such a damning and diamond of education that I was allowed to be a math teacher times tables you want to teach math you bastard so I'm worried we're speaking a bit like being a teacher then did you pick up any language for any words from the kids did you pick up any sort of you know I picked up phrases and stuff like incompetent employee tribunal we had this thing where some of the kids even if they're really intelligent they would try to put on slack it's almost like an anti intelligent attitude so like you know you don't block a kid that's got like target in a at a level mouth and like you say my world I need it yeah well just cuz I smashed up the calculus in it prob meeting with their parents and they say um so mother's very grateful that you organized this meeting with us thank you so much okay before we go on let's change things up a bit I'm gonna give each team an extra player so let's meet them it's Romesh Ranganathan and Paul foot I'm gonna give you some facts about our extra players Paul has a degree in maths from Oxford University she used to be a maths teacher but when he appeared on cats does countdown he didn't score a single point in the numbers round Paul likes to tweet interesting anagrams he finds in everyday life such as I've just realised that Travelodge is an anagram of veal taja recently tweeted I'm drunk mate I wasn't wrong I was drunk okay time to pick a new teammate Sarah you're behind so you get a pick who you're gonna go for I think I might go with rubbish because I like doing what you've got to give on the letters round to step up my game and the letters I didn't smash this year that a ver - yeah so if you'd like if you'd like Paul on your team Sean and Rama see if you could go just don't join in no I could do that I mean it just brings up the diversity booking if anything it says he used to be a freestyle rapper correct brough used to spit bear bars and it will that help you return this evening I think it were there's a lot of transferable skills so what do we hear some freestyle rap I'll give you a little I come rotten like shagging cotton up the bottom I bring the butter you know this ain't no margarine and quit to clean up the scene up my name was MC window lane [Music] I bring the burro Yanni I'm Asian and I'm proud but I'm not pakistani on the player from sri lanka gin whiskey by the tanker stab it to my crew and you get played out like a wanker yeah I brought I brought this little toy Lion belongs to my second child now I want to sort of show support for him because basically when we had our first child is like really nice and like decent and chilled out and I thought we were like really good parents and then the second one arrives at us and he's just feral he'll run away and I don't mean like run away like I wasn't it funny like run away like he's fleeing Isis and so I've brought this because he always freaks out when he's not with it if you want to do it it's one plus nine is ten that degree wasn't wasted multiplied by 50 knots by by 55 500 and the other 10 multiplied by the other nine is ninety yeah over then what let's just leave it in one day no cuz Romish wants to know if you finish up come on Robert you tap it in because of your ego take the 75 last time I came on here I brought on like a little toy liner than if you remember you know my idea about how my second son's a prick so I brought this lion because he really liked it and I thought he'd freak out my wife said it's out of order so to be fair I've brought something that my first son really liked this is his favorite thing in the whole world Nintendo DS and he really loses his if he hasn't got it what I'm thinkin is I'm here my wife's got no idea I've taken it she's gonna be having a bloody nightmare at home she won't ever what ever find out because she doesn't support me or watch anything I'm on so tomorrow I go back she says to me oh my god he's been losing his he's absolutely freaking out and then I go oh isn't it here and I look like I found it I've ruined her evening and I look like the hero the next day how many of you go listen mate I'm gonna be honest -
