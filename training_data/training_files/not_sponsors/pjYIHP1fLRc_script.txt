chris is that little limpet you am i to believe that your consciousness is downloaded into that small creature what does the term limpet mean i i yeah what's the that's i think that's the first time i've ever heard it spoken aloud it's like a uh it's a sea creature it's a little like shellfish type thing okay i like that the selection sound is a wet dick who wouldn't that's actually the original developer's wet dick hitting hitting his desktop i've been excited for this this is this is fun have you now yeah we we played the demo it was a lot of fun pushing down the grass that sound again that all familiar sound i'm gonna write lyle you ready it reminds me of how l oh you better ride it fast it only it only has about like uh 15 feet of history 15 feet of history is what i call my dick this is just going to be the dick episode george washington didn't even wait two minutes to start talking about jimmy carter dick now this is a video game see that that feels good too is that your tongue or is that just a wad of your spittle it's my little spittle oh this is so fun to control you do have an affinity for balls yeah what's wrong with that nothing at all this is just basically an advanced form of ball game oh my god you're right i still can't wait for that xo one game either that game is so that's the one i was talking about yeah oh yeah anything with little balls bouncing around or flying or swinging or singing look you're doing anything really what more could you want in life this guy looks like gooey from kirby you remember gooey from kirby he does look like that [ __ ] the uh was gooey the fish gooey was not the fish gooey was like the little blue guy that shows up in kirby three oh who's basically he's got the same powers as kirby except he licks and he looks almost exactly like this and i'm connecting some dots here i was gonna say i was obsessed with kirby 2 where they introduced the little like animal friends but i don't know any of their names i don't think i ever did this is the kind of game that feels good to just blast through it as fast as you can you gotta blast faster i'm trying no oh yeah you could do that you saved it come on recover recover recover you can do it i i really think you can oh i almost did it yes oh the return of the king did you ever imagine it would go like yes yeah no yeah you got it okay there we go i feel like you learned more struggling up the side of those than you would of doing it the right way i told you or if the game had landed you with some annoying tutorial level instead of just throwing you right into it you know thank god for this i think we always learn best through failure would you agree chris that fear of failure is the greatest obstruction to learning no i think that people who fail from the beginning are losers they should give up i see unless you get something perfect your first try you heard it here folks don't pursue anything you can't get right on your first try just drop it you clearly can't do it you either got it or you don't okay as they say in the biz i used to believe that about everything did you really yeah it's like i can't do it this sucks i'm stupid learning how to learn if that makes sense is like a really valuable life skill in general yeah if anything that's what the best thing you could take out of school because nothing else will actually stick right except for that thing on your neck then the lawsuits well i don't know why you had to bring up the thing on my neck sorry it's got to come up at least once a year by contrast you're a little benign tomar you're too mar see i'm good i told you it only took me five minutes this is my benign you a tumor uh does anyone else want to try i i could here we go it's fine is the tongue like uh right trigger where else would you put it after all are there any other buttons i even need to know just jump jump and tongue okay jump and tongue jump and tongue there you go oh right trigger in a what right trigger and a at the same time i don't know that i get it are you made of paint i don't know i think that's supposed to be like his little snail trail like he's supposed to be like a goop i don't think i got what they were trying to teach me but what did you say was in uh five hour energy b vitamin b12 and caffeine and like everything and taurine pretty much it's like a cocktail of everything that is either proven or just widely believed to give you energy chemical acts do you hear the guy this approach clearly isn't so great do you hear that the ceo of five hour energy is like trying to drill to the center of the earth to create a massive like graphite wire that uh i i do recall that being real it is real you take that energy and you bring it up he's a madman no he made this like series of like look at me i'm a zillionaire so i'm putting all my money into crazy [ __ ] some of it seemed practical some of it was just [ __ ] dumb i don't think he's getting to the center of the earth i'm just gonna come out and say it but you know what prove me wrong [ __ ] get to the center of the earth you should just buy a bucket of acid and pour it on the ground yeah must be so funny like i bet he all the contractors he's hired are con artists yeah we can do that it's just going to take a long time and a lot of money that's non-refundable we definitely need to figure out how to actually get up the walls properly can i can i try for a second oh for sure let me just there's one guy in the car who's actually punching his forehead with his palm right now he's putting a hole in his drywall because we just failed to grasp it did you guys ever have cousins growing up and they always had holes in their walls that they didn't repair yeah i guess not specifically cousins but i certainly had friends what is it with males and putting holes in the wall i mean to be fair drywall is pretty pathetically weak that's true it is super empowering when you actually find out that you're strong enough to do it oh wait you can jump up like that i guess that works see is that all it's trying to teach you is just to go vertical just i don't know to release i think that's exactly what it was trying to teach you okay okay okay so sometimes swinging is not your best friend i guess is the point there no you were doing good listen man if i've learned anything about this video game it's it's silly what do you think these little mushrooms are they not cute um i think they're pretty adorable [ __ ] adorkable i would i would use the the japanese term kawaii in case you didn't know that one this is a very frustrating topic because you're not getting any because i'm not getting any yeah oh my god okay oh you're a little bouncing bean of a boy look at me go live look at me go holy whoa where do i go save yourself grab something i tried it you wouldn't do it okay here we go let's try that again oh my oh god that's cool is that what that was supposed to do maybe i guess that's that's very like sonic adventure this is work in a good way this is where jim carrey gets banished wait what's that under there i see you who are you mate with it i got an achievement can i bounce from underneath okay no that wouldn't really make sense never in a million years i already forget what's this game called again crumble crumble it's a weird name it's called swing or something yeah why isn't it called lucky tongue swing man yeah or like wet wet ball oh yay i'm [ __ ] flying oh my god holy [ __ ] you're picking up a lot to see whoa make this a sonic game i think it's actually really fair to compare this to sonic and that it does a lot of things that sonic could be doing better it's true imagine if i was sonic right now i'd feel amazing instead you're a ball even better yeah you really cut out the middleman by always being a ball yeah exactly no sonic what's the worst part of sonic when he's not a ball when he's not curled up this is amazing oh this is why it's called crumble see this crap oh cause everything crumbles beneath you beneath your mite god this is fun seems like everyone's better at making sonic than sega yeah exactly it's like the original creator of sonic said he said when his spine is aligned i say nine this was during world war ii so you know it's a line i'd say nine he picked up a little bit of german but the original that's yeah little known fact is sonic was actually developed by nazi scientists at the tail end of world war ii nazi scientists basically invented like rocket technology and a bunch of stuff that got us into space and banana splits i thought radio predated world war one yeah you're right just trying to give them a little more credit than they deserve maybe don't do that anymore oh yeah that is that does look very fun it's satisfying to watch everything is good when you're going fast they also did kind of take the design philosophy of like if you put lines on something you'll like see how fast you're going from sonic lines yeah like in green hill zone with the lines horizontal lines yeah like lines on the floor yeah if they were like vertically away from the camera like like there you can't really see how fast well you can because of the shadows and the light but you know what you keep talking i'll shut up it's just over it is your channel you talk more [ __ ] okay uh today we're going to talk about blue the color blue the blur the blue bomber versus the blue blur who will win did anyone actually call him the blue bomber um yeah yeah i feel like they tried to make that stick because they were jealous of of of the blue blur or something [ __ ] to be fair i i thought i did love both franchises to death back back in like i cannot i just cannot get into mega man i didn't know i don't think i'd ever even played a mega man game at the time i just watched the cartoons and i was like i think i like mega man do the mega man the ruby spears no no sorry it's not [ __ ] it's nothing to me it's just nothing yeah i i liked mega man uh x like after they let you play a zero but uh which is when people start saying they get bad so i don't know but i i like the way that zero plays okay specifically i think he's like a lot more fun than your standard mega man this is my hot take but i think mega man's a little overrated wow i mean they haven't made a game in like a zillion trillion years it's kind if you guys have played like like as what's that azure striker gun vault or whatever i played that a few years back on the 3ds and i thought that was pretty fun it sort of reminded it was like it was like a sort of new take on a mega man x type game no i mean mega man's like it's got like an okay like design philosophy like adventures of chris is basically just mega man you say mega man is the dark souls of the nes i i hate that it it kills me there because i'm clearly still hanging on i hate that it kills you there's definitely some stuff where it's just like looking at your coordinates on whatever like y-axis or whatever and it doesn't matter if it you're clinging yeah like like here like what why is it killing me that that that that one will give you that that's that that area seems bugged like like whatever their kill box or whatever is too high up [ __ ] you it's a good name for a video game made in 2006 killbot killbox tongue ball with the young the old ball and tongue so what you call your woman ah the old ball and tongue actually that's what your woman calls you the old ball world one jungle i made it to the prepare to crumble i have a compliment yeah way to come in 1745 place chris it crashed oh no oh it did at least we made it through a whole level the developers thought that your performance was quote unquote sad that's not fair and uh exited you out of the game kindly to spare you i wonder are they looking through like a webcam at us right now oh yeah i can only hope oh yeah the way that one stares at the moon and wonders if that's special someone developer is gonna be the first comment when you post this video and he's gonna be like by the way that crash i did that actively despite you i think this is a new level right holy [ __ ] definitely i think it looks yeah it seems different although i guess that last level started pretty different from how it ended so i'm not sure get off stupid we do really have the memory of [ __ ] goldfish and i i certainly do i mean this looks like the earlier levels it's not my fault there we go okay i'll know if i see that that one special tree these are the truffula trees from which you can make the needs which everyone needs oh i love that the tomax the tomax i am the tromax i speak for the trees speak for the jews for the jews have no tongues oh boy i'm sorry tomorrow it's really [ __ ] up the lilacs is uh what do you call it one of those guys who just wants society to crumble oh like the joker but a little wood nymph holy moly no i mean like an anarchist that's you yeah the lilacs that is a cool name for a character the lilacs like this is a fun level holy [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] your world is falling apart little man roll i i really do think that yeah oh that was just unfortunate that was maybe that really is why it's called crumble maybe as this goes on we're gonna rise the premise is that your world is crumbling yeah and all your friends are dying and you still smile this big goofy grin this is so fun holy [ __ ] because they took your soul first oh my god oh no not again no that was the bomb that was the bomb that did it someone's bombing us yes i had a dream the other night that someone nuked uh me while i was in the car you have those a lot this is like the third or fourth time you first brought up nuke dreams i think about nukes a lot that's pretty cool i started taking these pills i got pills from the doctor to help with my back pain and uh ever since i started taking them i'm having crazy dreams about nukes well that was one of them oh shh you got it oh you whoa oh what the [ __ ] you just did a checkpoint take a look at egypt before you [ __ ] fly off the edge due to momentum silly face that's a that's a murderous what are the what are those called like moai faces the easter island heads they are bombing us do they have a name other than easter island heads i thought they were called like moai statues or something like that they probably were called something not easter island heads no abstract i'm pretty sure that easter island was not called that by the people that actually lived there oh my god this is cool i don't think they celebrated easter every single day i think instead yeah instead of eggs they hid that dude's head everywhere stop bumming me up i've heard those things have feet is that true that they built like the whole body and then just buried it yeah apparently i i feel like i've heard something similar yeah that sounds like something that they would have just done once and then hoped you didn't dig up the rest of them that's what i would have done yeah just call them all my face yeah i like it no [ __ ] no yes oh you did it i'm a god you cheated so hard at that level whatever it worked crumble crumble combo combo i love trouble i love crumble i hope this guy's game makes a million dollars eat the mushroom eat the [ __ ] the fart i hope he handles the success well wait listen listen listen good more more more oh oh oh my god okay this guy's a genius you have food i do oh whoa my tongue my silly tongue oh oh yes pretty cool yeah as soon as you like accidentally connect to something with a short tongue here you're pretty much screwed can you make it longer like going the right way i don't think you can lengthen it oh i think that's what would be going on actually if there was a mechanic that let you like like loosen out your tongue that would help you in those situations i just don't know if that mechanic exists like yeah maybe l trigger or something does that i don't know does l trigger have a function in this game that's also jump whoa you purpled i could be whatever color this is they never knew okay this game is just [ __ ] amazing if only rachel dolezal was still alive to see this who the [ __ ] is that rachel dolezal is that woman that said she was like trans black oh is she really not still alive no she's still alive i think in my heart i don't know if she's still black but come on there you go no oh jump on up there you go yay i like being the purple one i think you've done it once more thanks bro oh no [ __ ] oh oh you had that check this out though are you ready do a little jump like that did you do that tomorrow brace for impact oh i didn't yeah and you landed right on the mushroom look at mario well what's the greatest mario party the greatest mario parody yeah definitely mario's funeral mario oh mario's funeral for sure that is a good one
