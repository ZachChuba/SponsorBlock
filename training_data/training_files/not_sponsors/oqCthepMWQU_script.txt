hello everyone and welcome back to 4fs gaming now after thousands of hours playing hunt dealing with ai mobs becomes an afterthought you move across the map efficiently clearing or avoiding them as if in a trance it's effortless but if you are new then a pack of dogs or a hard to reach hive can really ruin your day in this video i'll teach you everything you need to know about dealing with trash mobs in hunt so you can focus entirely on the real enemy hunters now this isn't exactly a summary video it's a full-on guide intended to help you absolutely master the ai and make them an absolute joke to deal with in a follow-up video i'll look at the four bosses but first at the same time so let's get stuck into the rest of the video before we talk about any specific ai we need to talk about loadouts ai are essentially a distraction they will slow you down get in the way they'll make noise but they're not a significant threat now you can of course run around the map shooting everything you see and yes that is efficient when it comes to dealing with ai but for this video i'm going to assume that you want to move both quickly and quietly you also don't want to commit too many of your weapon or gear slots to dealing with ai you want almost all of your loadout focused on winning hunter fights because that's the real challenge here to this end there are some things you will need to take the most obvious is some kind of malay tool or attachment although you can get away with a bayonet that will only give you three stabs before you're out of stamina so i do recommend at least take a melee tool in every loadout in addition to whatever else you have now these tools all have their strengths and weaknesses but i prefer the basic knife it kills hellhounds with one strong hit too well anywhere and it's the best clutch weapon in a pvp situation the dusters are better at killing hordes of grunts and the knuckle knife is a very efficient ai killing hybrid but in the end any of these will do the trick it comes down to personal preference i'd probably avoid the heavy knife i think it's the weakest of the bunch if you take a stabbing or a slashing malay tool you will still need something to kill emulators now a full length weapon without a melee attachment will do fine here but if you are taking two medium slot weapons or if your large slot weapon has a bayonet or a talon i would be taking either the dusters or the knuckle knife as your tool otherwise emulators can become a bit of a problem the other component in your ai killing tool kit is something to kill those pesky monsters at range this is for when you've triggered a hive on a rooftop or need to quickly deal with that concertina armor that's charging towards you for me i use the flare pistol due to its speed at killing armors but some people might prefer the fuses as a budget option or even throwing knives because they're a little bit quieter if you have a silenced weapon or a crossbow in your loadout no problem then you already have this covered now that we have all the necessary tools let's look at how to kill the various monsters in hunt we'll start with grunts these are pretty simple you hit them in the head with your malay tool the tool you are using will determine where to hit them and how many times to hit them basically if you're using a knife a heavy attack to the head or chest lets you kill four grunts in one stamina bar a heavy knife lets you headshot with a light swing which is very stamina efficient the dusters can do the same with heavy punch and be extremely stamina efficient as well with the knuckle knife you can tap twice with the punch for stamina efficiency or you can heavy stab if you need to keep running without slowing down now it might seem pointless describing any other way to deal with grunts because they are so simple to kill but when you run out of stamina they can still cause problems if there's a lot of them and you're surrounded fortunately grunts cannot open doors or climb over fences so by vaulting over even a small barrier or even closing the door or even just standing on top of a hay bale you can render yourself immune to their attacks while starting your stamina regenerates or they lose interest grunts of course can carry a range of weapons doctor grunts are the most irritating as they will instantly apply ts3 poison so target them first then worry about the cleaver grunts as they are most likely to take a health chunk from you if they land a stray hit the torch grunts they require two hits to set you on fire so they aren't that problematic and remember that if you are set on fire any enemy that touches you will also get set on fire so if you're out of stamina and surrounded by way too many grunts let yourself catch on fire and watch them all burn for free just keep an eye on that health chunk grunts are pretty slow and they're going to lose interest if you move too far away from them so running is often the fastest way to get through them while retaining stamina as you're crossing the map now we're gonna move up the food chain to the hives now hives are annoying because they are the only ranged enemy monster their swarms of bugs can be killed by bashing them or slashing them but piercing weapons will take longer a much faster way to disperse bug swarms emitted by hives is to simply kill the source which is really easy run up and kill it with your melee tool if you're fast you won't even get poisoned and if you do it'll only last for a second or two at most the problems start to occur when the hive is sitting in a place which is not easily accessible this is where you use that ranged killing part of your loadout throwing knives work really well for hives as do silenced weapons i often don't carry either of these anymore so i just use a flare pistol shot if i really need to clear a hive at range if i'm moving through or i'm leaving an area then often i won't even bother and i'll just outrun the swarm until it dissipates perhaps more than any other ai do not leave hives alive in your area if you start a gunfight with enemy players they will really screw up your day and tend to poison you at the absolute worst time now let's move on to hellhounds they come in packs of two or four they are fast and they deal only light damage but they apply bleed with each of their lunges they are also very perceptive and will detect you from further away than most enemies they sometimes come with helmets that protect them from headshots and this is why i like using the knife a full stamina bar and a knife means that you never have to worry about hounds again you just tap them once each with a heavy attack and they'll die it doesn't even have to be in the head other malay tools can work and most people make them work because i know the dusters and the knuckle knife are also very popular choices but they require headshots or a follow-up hit and this can be a bit tricky to land as the fast moving dogs are running around and jumping or the ones with the helmets are really really difficult to headshot at all the heavy knife is good at killing dogs but it uses a lot of stamina and then if you miss a hit you're in be trouble that's because it's when you're out of stamina that the hounds become a problem just remember that if you get up on a box close a door on them or simply vault a fence then you will get a moment of reprieve i've seen many people die because they kept trying to malay hounds on no stamina rather than just bolting a fence if you're really stuck out in the open with no stamina start shooting them that'll do the trick and kill them as well and it's better to be noisy than dead alright so let's talk about the armoreds now these husky shamblers do hit hard but they are easily staggered and dispatched with malay tools all malay tools work fine here and are similarly effective three heavy stabs with a knife is my standard approach this is of course time and stamina intensive so for a faster approach i often use the flare gun if i need to be quick now the concertina variant is more annoying not only will it cause bleed if you get close enough to malay it but it's also more resistant to malay attacks so it takes even more stamina and time to kill not to worry if you have a flare gun though because fire kills them all the same some of the longer range weapons such as the pitchfork or opposed bayonets or even the bomb lance can hit the armors beyond the range that they'll start bleeding you with their concertina but it's a narrow margin and it still takes up a fair bit of stamina due to less resistance to shooting throwing knives and silenced weapons are faster against this variety than they are against the normal armored so throwing knives are pretty effective against these ones but again neither variant can get over a fence ultimately your best tool against ai is the vault button they just can't deal with it now we're going to chat about the emulators emulators are very very easy and not usually a problem until someone screws up they may be fast aggressive and they're going to bash down doors like hellhounds they're also very perceptive and they also make a lot of noise they attract other players to your position but there's still not that much of a problem as long as you remember the golden rule do not hit them with stabbing slashing or bullets blunt damage only now i don't usually carry a blunt melee tool so i inefficiently dispatch emulators with four hits from the butt of my rifle or shotgun i almost never regret having this is my only option and this has worked perfectly fine for me ever since the emulators have been introduced into the game so don't listen to anyone that says you need dusters you need a knuckle knife a winfield will bash their heads in just fine however both the dusters and the light attack of the knuckle knife will kill them much faster and leave you with much more stamina so if that's really important to you they are clearly better choices here for this specific situation be careful with the knuckle knife though because if you're just a little bit clumsy you'll accidentally do a stab and then you're going to get a bit toasty and warm probably too much for comfort the other option is poison the poison crossbow bolts or poison ammo which is usually delivered from a silenced neganda or sparks will instantly put an emulator down without causing it to explode that's right i mean i haven't mentioned it but you should have been paying attention and probably picked up on the fact that if you stab an emulator or slash it or shoot it with a normal bullet it will explode it'll set you on fire and if you're too close it'll instantly char 25 health off your character which is really unpleasant so if this does happen and the emulator explodes because of either a mistake or enemy intervention then you need to kill that emulator instantly usually i'll just shoot it with whatever i'm holding don't try and juke it out with an enraged emulator it's just gonna burn down too many health chunks and it's not worth it just kill it going loud doesn't matter at this point and then there's the water devils now they're not really enemies they're just environmental traps that prevent you from crossing large sections of water if they are present when dealing with water devils there are a few things that i like to consider they're loud so if you want to be quiet you wouldn't cross where they are even if you can make it across the gap you'd go somewhere else to get over the water if there is a small section of water to cross you will likely be able to do it without them catching up to you and causing damage but it's still going to make a bit of noise if there's a larger section of water infested with water devils and that's where you want to cross or it's going to take you ages to go around you can use throwing knives crossbows or silenced weapons to kill a water devil cluster temporarily you will then have 10 seconds to get across before it reforms in other cases you will just suck it up and cross healing once you get to the other side this is risky if you feel any hunters at all might be nearby the most important thing is to just remember to check a body of water for water devils before you cross getting caught by them as a surprise is very painful to finish up we have one more nasty monster to discuss and this one kind of counts as two meat heads and leeches meat heads are big and ugly and they come in two variants blade variants will cause more damage and also bleeding and they're much more dangerous than the pick variants now these ones still hit hard but it's nowhere near as bad meat heads are blind and death so if you get near them they're going to swing around their weapons randomly the main way they track you is through their leeches a leech will move towards you if you get too close and if it gets right up and squeals then any meat heads in the area will home in on your position a leech attack deals very little damage if it hits but a high intensity of poison and meatheads can also see poison once you are poisoned from any source they will charge towards you luckily you can usually outrun them or take my standard approach and jump over a fence they are only a real threat when you are surprised poisoned by a hive or something else when near a meathead and suddenly you have to worry about them chasing you down on top of whatever else it was you were already dealing with almost 100 of the time you can just avoid meat heads they don't chase you unless you are poisoned or literally go up and hug them and they can be outrun very easily and don't follow very far however sometimes a meathead is on a clue of course the serpent trait is the best way to deal with the situation but without that if you're in a team i usually get one person to run up and get detected by the meat head the meat head will run off to chase them and then someone else goes in and picks up the clue now there are circumstances where you'll want to kill meat heads either for the book of monsters for the xp over the chance that they have of dropping trait pickups when killed there's no really fast way to do this silently the best way to do it is just shoot them or blow them up use any fire at your disposal poison them a combination of all of it because they have so much health if you want to be silent you can use a combination of lanterns and an axe and this can do a reasonably good job it still takes a little while so make sure you're not about to be ambushed oh and do yourself a favor if you have never stuck a meat head with a bomb lance shot go and do that now it's it's beautiful okay so that is how to deal with all of the monsters in hunt except for bosses of course but i do have a few more general tips to help you deal with ai firstly ask yourself do i actually need to deal with this ai obviously you clear them from areas you are inhabiting or if you're about to be in a fight but when moving across the map you can outrun almost everything except for hounds and emulators and it's usually faster and quieter too secondly silence is overrated it's better to be loud in a good position than staying quiet when out of stamina and getting torn apart by ai if you're out of stamina in the open and vulnerable to any approaching hunters just shoot to get out of that situation faster guns make all ai a joke in terms of difficulty there is also a piece of gear that makes you win against pretty much all ai and it's the extremely useful stamina shot this allows you to kill anything in malay over and over without worrying about stamina including bosses it also allows you to outpace most ai and enemy hunters and it's just really handy all around because it's good to go fast it does only last 10 minutes so you need to pick your moment and use it carefully the small stamina shots are pretty useless however they just don't last long enough now if you really never want to have to worry about ai you could also think about taking a silenced negant with poison rounds i see this is a bit of a waste of a weapon slot because you could take something that's far better at killing players but the ability to just one-shot emulators to shot any armors and do it all very very quietly is pretty nice give it a go but don't get reliant on it please and that brings us to the end of this guide if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask in the comments below sometime soon i'll be working on a guide for the four bosses and i'll be talking about how to kill them most efficiently without leaving yourself vulnerable to enemy players it will also help support the channel as you
