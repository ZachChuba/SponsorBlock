what's gone everyone Jeremy are from there quartering and time for more serious video a video that I hope you'll share because this is an important topic it's about supporting alt tech and the absolute cowards at patreon strike again it's no longer a secret in fact it is widely known that Silicon Valley tech companies have a hive mind in terms of what they think is acceptable and what they think is untenable content that they believe is righteous and morally correct is supported promoted endorsed content that goes even slightly against their own ideologies is labeled as all sorts of horrible terms even when it isn't cell tech censorship is an important topic that I hope you'll stick with me through and allow me just one minute to plug device head to - Lang comm slash quartering now many of you know that many of you don't know maybe that I was banned from patreon a long time ago and patreon is an important tool for many creators out there to offset potential earnings issues or if you're creating content that isn't necessarily going to be deemed advertised friendly you know patrons a way to survive the ebbs and flows of content creation and it's an important tool for many years patreon was fine accepting everybody's money they were fine with Sargon and Milo with me for example although I was far less polarizing I would imagine but over the years once they were financially stable all of a sudden they had opinions about the type of customers that they had one of the most cowardly in things that we see happen forgetting the people that built you and you don't need to do much searching but you can see all sorts of people being purged from patreon it's not just patreon that's doing it it's also MasterCard and PayPal this is why we must support all tech I have a mine's comm page mine's comm slash the quartering it is a great free speech supportive Facebook alternative people should invest some time into that there's a reason I have a [ __ ] shoot page for all of my channels if you want to watch my content on [ __ ] shoot I support that there are many alt tech Alton alt payout options outside of PayPal that while up sometimes our pain in the butt to setup they are good in that they reduce your dependence on a company that will enforce their own political ideologies by banning customers we're moving their ability to make a livelihood to make content creation untenable for them you can see a wave of like NSFW content creators being banned from patreon which is odd because I thought that that was stunning and brave you could see all sorts of content creators that are deemed I mean this is the level of discourse that they have they call people alright like Milo which I don't know maybe you could make it case four it would be very weak Carl Benjamin sargon of akkad you know there's all sorts gavin many many many people that patreon was fine taking their there five percent over the top on the top of their money for years but all of a sudden you know now that they have plenty of money and that they're buddy-buddy with all the other people in saga in Silicon Valley they start banning people and people need to fight against it now it's a tough position as somebody who supports content let me give you an example when I was banned from patreon I don't remember exactly how many backers I had it was several hundred maybe 500 to 700 I don't remember exactly it's been a while I opened a subscribe star and even today there's you know 211 I'm very thankful that those 200 people are there but that means many more hundreds of people didn't bother moving over and I don't blame them because they probably backed other creators on patreon and although in 2019 it seems like this type of funding for channels is going by the wayside you know people just don't move over they don't want to they've got everything set up by the way subscribe to our doesn't use PayPal many people who back people on patreon rely on making those payments via PayPal so there are some people that just simply cannot move over and then late last week they came for everybody's favorite weatherman a lowly weatherman was banned from patreon so there I was last night playing the hottest new gaming service around showing my co-workers from the station that the weatherman can indeed make it rain when all of a sudden from out of nowhere there was a knocking at my door of course did what any reasonable person would do and hid behind my couch for at least 20 minutes to make sure they went away then I got on my rascal scooter and drove to the door what can I say those diabetes feet make it difficult to walk but I do love a lollypop upon my arrival I found a note waiting for me oh my god patron remembered my birthday I was giddy with excitement what gift did they left me and must be waiting for me on my patreon page oh wait I don't have a patreon page they removed it apparently they don't like weathermen very much it seems to be a common theme these days not sure exactly what it is why there's so much anti weather right sentiment out there we're only trying to forecast the future to keep you warm and dry help you avoid those natural disasters that plague society and yet here I am once again Susan taking away my monetization and now Sidney taking away my patreon I'm gonna be destitute I'm gonna be I'm gonna be living in the streets under the weather I'm telling people to avoid talk about irony now when faced with a serious situation like this you should always take the adult approach which I did when I email back patron to support hi Sidney got your email read this part in the future if you ever want to fund a new project on patreon that is within the site's guidelines feel free to contact my team I do you see I have a passion for the weather it's been something inside me ever since I was a young child obviously that's mr. Mehta Kerr who has said some spicy things in the past and him and I have had our differences but it's not really a matter of any of that it's about the way big tech is able to treat content creators and private citizens when we don't support things in alt tech whether that's bit shoot that's mines that subscribe star that's gab that's library that's was any number of alternate tech type sites that need our support and I don't know how many backers Jim had before this but I guarantee you was way more than 77 so regardless of whether or not he'll be able to how do I say recover at least similarly this is after having his monetization removed on his YouTube channel which I don't believe he ever ran ads on his videos but he did take advantage of live streams to generate his revenue live streams that as far as I can tell never violated Terms of Service these were spicy videos certainly things would get a little hectic on live streams but as far as I know his channel was in good standing he received the dreaded your channel is reusing content so we've removed your monetization email the same one that I've said before that I got counting Kela Bering and myself that we got on our incredible sell mine podcast a podcast that of course did not reuse content a podcast that was 100 percent original content a weekly show that we ran for over a year they removed our monetization for that's right reuse content and when I reapplied for monetization they declined it in Jim's case from what I understand the allegation is that they YouTube owes him many thousands of dollars and that while demonetised you will not receive that money until you re monetized the problem is if you're never Ramana ties which let's be clear Jim knows this I know this you know this he will not be Ramana ties he will not be reproved for monetization so are they ever going to pay him his money I don't know how much it is but I'm going to guess it's several thousand because his live streams were pretty ridiculous and this is just big tech doing what they want to content creators that they don't like get too big the hat the nail that sticks out that gets hammered down and there's a disincentive for content creators like myself to promote bit shoot financial disincentive and many people won't do it for that reason and I understand that I understand that not everybody is in a position to want to tell their viewers hey go watch my videos where I won't make you know it's hard enough to make any ad revenue but I want you to go to a place that I guaranteed won't make any ad revenue you know that that is not an easy thing for a lot of people to do and I understand that and I have 15,000 subscribers on bit shoot my videos there generally get between maybe 600 and you know maybe a thousand to two thousand views very small in comparison but if you're a content creator [ __ ] shoot is still a great place to grow an audience let's be honest a lot of us content creators really aren't planning on ad revenue existing for a long period of time we have to do ad reads like I did in this video you think that I do a lot of added reads now wait till I lose my little green checkmark and that day is coming of course it's coming for all of us who dare to not walk in lockstep with the genuine genuinely generally accepted narrative as defined by big tech or all tech media and I realize that it's not often that I get kind of serious about things here on YouTube because I know most people watch my channel to relax to laugh at a few things be entertained and for the most part that's why I use it too and I try to stick to that but the big picture is is if more more people don't support something like [ __ ] you like I will absolutely be supporting [ __ ] shoots crowdfunder to get live stream going live streaming going the monetization is an issue [ __ ] shoot obviously as a content creator you like the idea of earning some money but hopefully they figure something out down the road same with minds.com they've done a lot they're starting to roll out some monetization for content creators they've got to get creative because people like PayPal and Google Adsense and things like that aren't gonna support these platforms and if they get too big what happens PayPal says hey you know prawn hub guess what you're not gonna use PayPal anymore so 80% of your creators actors/actresses can't get paid anymore they won't know what to do they're not gonna want to deal with cryptocurrency so hahahahahahaha take that we're multi-billion dollar corporation and we can do whatever it is we please this will not get better on YouTube this will get worse and if people don't take a moment to embrace all tech and I'm not saying hey you've got to use [ __ ] shooter you've got to use mine so you gotta use Gabe but maybe try one of them I'll leave links to my stuff on those on those platforms give them a try you don't have to give them money what they need is user bases once you have user base you can do a lot more bit shoot doubles their user base every time a major batting on YouTube happens well now they're just not outright banning channels but the removing monetization and they're suppressing content you can look at a channel like sticks hex and hammer his channel is clearly in a silo one that I think my channel is also in although his seems to be worse his channel won't grow no matter what he does now is it because he doesn't run ads on his videos I'm not sure is it because of the things he talks about probably this is the new form of censorship you know they're going to suppress they're not going to promote they're not going to outright ban that makes too many headlines when they banned Sargon off patreon a lot of people left and by the way you should not be using patreon anymore because we know how they act we know how they do the bidding of big tech so if you have craters on patreon you should tell them hey you should at least create you know whether it's on Project Newgrounds is that another one or subscribe star or whatever I'm gonna support you there but I'm not gonna support you on patreon anymore because last time this had a major effect a ripple effect where patreon actually had to respond to it you know making a statement about all these people that they've been and then you had you know Jordan B Peterson and Dave Rubin come out there working on you know working on an alternative again the problem is the gatekeeper for all this is the banks a lot of people think it's only that it's exclusively PayPal or patreon banning people sometimes that band comes down from MasterCard if we see as we've seen happen before sometimes that ban comes down due to a dedicated outraged mob which I would say probably Milo would qualify for or probably mr. Medicare might qualify for that guy I couldn't believe his patreon was up as long as it was gotta be honest with you but they finally got him and now he's over on subscribe' start where I am and many other creators are and I hope that viewers out there will implore the creators that they like to try out all tech in addition there's a lot of great features out mine's [ __ ] shoot gab services like the center you don't have to use it but it'd be nice if you tried it out I hope you enjoyed this video I'll talk to you again real soon [Music]
