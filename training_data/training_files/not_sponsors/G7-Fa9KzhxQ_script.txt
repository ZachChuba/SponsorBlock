it's no secret that pretty much every phone on the market is gonna firmly eventually if you run something intensive on it for long enough so whether it's a video editing program or a graphically intensive game your performance is gonna start right around here and it's gonna end up somewhere right around here but what we don't know is how does that difference in performance between a peak and a sustain state get impacted by installing a phone case because here's the thing most cases on the market are designed for ruggedness or looks or cost-effectiveness and I haven't seen any that I can think of that appear to be designed for thermal conduction so are we all just taking our mobile devices and installing a great big insulator on it and how much of an impact does that have we're gonna find out private Internet check it out at the link in the video description before we can determine how much a case affects thermal throttling we need to set a baseline for how our devices thermal throttle without any case installed at all now in the interest of fairness we're going to be testing both camps so representing Android we've got the Galaxy S ten plus and representing the iPhone we've got the iPhone 10's max which side do you want to play for today team iPhone team Android team iPhone and doing it so we're gonna use Geekbench and we're going to do subsequent runs just like I did in my phone water cooling video a couple years ago to see how our performance tracks over time three two one go you have a percentage bar I just have a timer yeah all right I've got my first score much lower than my fifth run for the iPhone is 11 318 what was the Goucher and the Samsung is ten nine three five so that's it ten runs and we've got kind of some bad news like my phone's definitely hot yes it was this one all along the back is really warm to the hand but I'm getting the exact same scores that I was at the beginning almost to the point same with the iPhone so obviously they're not thermal throttling I messaged my buddy in from a non tech he said one of the ways that they get phones to thermal throttle is they run a battery test for an extended period of time like 10 15 20 minutes okay and then they run the test instead of just running the test manually over and over again we did 10 tests do you think that was enough or should we have done 20 or 25 I don't know let's try his way okay and see what happens so let's start the Geekbench battery benchmark I'm gonna crank up my screen brightness because that affects your thermals as well and go okay so it's been over 20 minutes now they're already super hot so now let's run the cpu tests for ten iterations we've got a problem even after preheating it and then running our ten benchmarks in a row again we're still ending up with all of our scores within margin of error okay so one of the things I've heard is that Android handset manufacturers will purposely tune their devices to check what software is being run and it's a benchmark program it'll actually allow the phone to heat up more than it normally would before thermal throttling the processor so one of the ways that you can mitigate that is to use a program called an apk extractor grab the apk the install file for the app off the phone rename it to something else then put it back on so if you change the name of the program it won't be on their whitelist anymore some of them will will behave that way the problem though is that that doesn't help us with the iPhone no because we can't slide little stuff on an iPhone and there's not that many tests for this kind of stuff in the App Store like they have an - - but I've run it six times now there's no change fortunately they are still 3dmark last chance this has to work so how do we gonna run this one on the iPhone it's a little different than Android I'm gonna use slingshot extreme unlimited which pretends that there's no such thing as vsync and lets it just run as fast as it can off screen and then I'm gonna use slingshot extreme unlimited OpenGL ES 3.0 one as my option here and then I'm gonna go ahead and run okay so what do we want to do ten runs here better ranked at 12 odd choice you just never know what's gonna happen I don't trust it okay so I got my first baseline score four or five - three second test is about to finish four three zero zero Wow that's lower yet dropped again 3479 oh this time it wasn't higher back to being lower 3350 dropping even more 31:48 slightly higher 32 10 lower again 31 1-5 final round lowest score yet 30 78 a clear trend so we had that one outlier where it kind of spiked back up but then other than that this is gonna be really easy to map against yeah 6006 I'm down a little bit this one's actually back up again 60 53:59 44 wait what 44 95 that's it baby we just dropped 25 prick we're throttling now I think it's not gonna go back up like feel that that's hot like it's really hot I just don't know if it's gonna keep going down further so you can either be like up here and then crash and like just kind of to tears or it could crash and then keep going down like sloping yeah 45:29 4473 4538 final test 44 97 we know what we're looking for with the iPhone we're looking for either a faster decay or steeper curve yeah or a slower decay if maybe the case aids in cooling or it falls farther if it gets harder than it ever did and performs worse than it ever did and then with the s 10 plus we're looking for whether it will hold for as many runs or fewer runs or more runs before it throttles down and maybe drops farther than ever or maybe drops further okay so do the shopping mall charge it [Music] I do not belong in here should we try one of these leather wallet ones that looks like that traps heat big time 10s max leather case oops about the leather case this thing is 70 Canadian dollars after-tax that's crazy hey buddy I'm looking for cases for Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus and iPhone 10's max normal silicon little beefier Galaxy iPhone kind of comfortable [Music] what do you got okay so I got a selection for you I tried to go from the most basic case you could have wow that's a really basic case yeah you paid more for that than you'd like to know so that's for the iPhone and then that's for the Samsung so we're seeing if that maybe insulates it more yeah so then one level up from that is semi rugged sure like that one oh my God look at that what is up with that they just put it on a little stand to spray painted and then I got you some wallet cases okay and then I got you the actual official leather case from the Apple store you don't want to know 70 US dollars not you are Canadian appalling can we return this so let's start with the most basic cases oh this thing sucks look at it it's like jiggly in there this is basic buy like every definition and go so we're finished our 12 runs for our Android device we ended up with basically exactly the same behavior we throttle that the same run and down to the same amount so as far as we can tell putting a really sort of basic plastic case on your phone is not going to have any noticeable impact pretty much the same story with the iPhone as well except there's a little bit of problems with 3d mark on this one it crashed around test 2 so we couldn't just pretend that guess three counter does test 2 right because it's actually run for more time now it is getting it hotter so we did an extra test test 13 but even with all that it's pretty much the same results as no case the trend line is still very similar so I it's hard to draw a conclusion yet shall we move on to the rugged case yes all right let's do it yeah this is exactly the same that surprises me actually I had me too I would have thought as we go into thicker cases I mean they're made out of things that are not known to be excellent heat conductors I guess these aren't the most rugged cases this isn't an otterbox or anything but it's like a lot more substantial than this but I guess it doesn't make a difference all right wallet case time and that's the same okay do you want to try running them with the case is closed yes now that's interesting so on the iPhone we not only throttle immediately and harder we actually end up at a significantly lower steady state so it looks like the iPhone 10's max actually relies in a very significant way on its screen for cooling which makes me wonder then why didn't covering the back matter okay so I'm done not that there's still the Apple branded leather case the $70 leather case I know writer if you have any theories like you're a motorcyclist you wear leather so there's no wind going through I wouldn't say that my experience with leather is that it feels more insulating than plastic though so okay so we're done with the leather case that's it actually kind of beat the base better than a bear phone I mean barely it's probably just margin or error I'd gas but it's definitely not worse it's not worse definitely not worse so unfortunately this video didn't end up being the make your phone run faster with this easy trick conclusion that we had maybe hoped for so what we found from all of our testing is that phones thermal throttle absolutely if dependent on the workload and unless you're going out of your way to do something particularly stupid like enclose your phone in a non breathable insulating material it's probably not going to have a huge impact on the performance of your device this is a good answer Linus that means we can have our performance and protection - this is the
