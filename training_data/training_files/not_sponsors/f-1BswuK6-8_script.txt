okay and that's we're gonna find some treasure but I'm just really excited to get out there in a spring and show you guys what that looks like because I invested in my dream setup this is an underwater camera housing when the camera inside and I'm seriously just so thrilled to be able to use it so it's something I've wanted on my bucket list for the longest time thing looks ridiculous but this is seriously like my dream setup man and it's gonna help me record some of the most beautiful footage that I've ever had on my youtube remember the goal is to burn the most calories and also find the best treasure [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh well hey what bottle number is that you know that is it's an iPhone X I can't see I don't know what it is could be it looks like wow it looks like it might still work I don't think there's water inside this has been added for so long - Justin man we didn't do so this is my friend Justin from Roy is not there helping out with the video - I can't believe it that's crazy what do you think so far well I can barely see it I can we found that I can't believe I got that we're currently waiting on Tristan me and Jake out of the water kids are gone I'm trying to get some last-minute calories cuz I'm pretty sure Jake's got a bigger budget stop you're gonna forget the calories going already yet stay back I don't want you to no not enough but you don't catch up yeah go kiss our URL that was for calories here we go how many calories do you think you burned today buddy I don't know but both my calves have cramped up see you boys done did you find anything good I got a few things all right first banger yeah oh my god ready okay all right second banger another one whoa oh that was that was kind of dope there you go Jacobson it is now your time to shine what bangers do you have for today bangers man I got a bag of name-brand sunglasses oh okay an ID three golf balls Oh an iPhone X you got an iphone eggs I did man look at that worked you dude okay so you obviously I found two murder weapons so those boys are absolute legends because they both found freaking bangers I just got a bunch of glasses a really nice pair of goggles not any name brands I'm not sure some weird watch which I'm I don't know what this is it could be something I'm not sure but my banger fine is a freaking Asst jewel I got a Julia and it's actually like a white or silver one so somebody put a wrap on this thing means they really loved it but uh she got lost in the river the main goal for today's adventure was to see who could burn the most calories we are at the very end of the road and now it is time to check live so let's all get on our phones come back here and see who has burned the most calories and has deemed the winner of today so Jake's gonna start it off for us all right so I burned 2213 calories okay okay let me win the best treasure find I did a lot of jumping jacks I saw you and I managed to burn 2626 calories today oh yeah maybe and your winner no with the day life some we got it thank you guys so much for bringing us out and letting us show out today or at least I did but we had a blast being healthy checking the app for all the things we were burning and walking and stepping and cuz I don't probably scroll down and so if you don't believe it from the wall right here okay okay alright so I just got back from the truck I wanted to see if this would charge up it was completely dead when I found it and if you look at it the screen like that I guess the case here is all buckled and destroyed but I put it on the charger and it actually still charged this how well does that man there's a little bit of mold on the back and it looked like this phone potentially could have been in the river for a few weeks to a couple months but I can't believe the phone axis still turns on and we're gonna be able to give this back to him and so I'm gonna try my best to figure out who these two people are the front office here at the jinnee Springs location actually has a lost-and-found book and if the person who lost his phone put in their information I'm gonna be able to figure out he just belongs to it I can give it back to him so what we're gonna do is go to the front office check their books see if they have an iPhone X that is lost in their book and if they do we'll check out the contact number shoot him a call and see if this is actually their phone that they lost but to be honest with you guys I'm excited man this is probably one of my favorite things to do to call the owner and tell him that we found their phone you know they definitely thought this phone was lost forever and today we're gonna give it back to him alright so we're calling them right now this is always so much fun man hello hey how you doing hey who's this this is Jake I found your phone while diving in the river and we figured out your phone number and we want to give this back to you the phone actually still works when I found it I had a whole bunch of mold and there was some water inside the bag it looks like the phone's been in the water for at least a couple weeks or maybe a couple months I'm not too sure how long ago he lost it but a month ago it's been in a water for about a month and when I got back to the hotel that night I actually put it on the charger and it started charging and I ended up trying to figure out who it belonged to and I got your phone number and I just love to be able to give it back to you well you're the best yeah I would totally okay for you to ship that back to me that would be awesome if you get a chance shoot me over your address and your name and everything and I'll send us over to you and I'll just cover everything so don't worry about anything about that thank you so very much I really appreciate it what's this over to you and actually it's us out tomorrow for you things you have a wonderful night you too thank you bye bye I'm so cool man so we figured out that the phone actually belongs to the woman on the screen and we're gonna ship over her phone to her first thing in the morning that's pretty cool man found a phone in the river it's been underwater for about a month and now we're giving it bacteria to be able to reunite people are the last items is probably my favorite thing about treasure hunting it's so much fun and I know like she had a lot of memories on here probably like photos and videos she would love to keep and when she dropped it overboard she thought that was lost forever and on top of that I'm sure this phone are here the iPhone X cost over $1,000 and for her to be able to get this back in her hands is pretty awesome man and we're gonna be able to do that for her so first thing in the morning we're gonna put this in the mail and ship it to her free of charge and she's gonna have her phone and her hands that she thought she lost forever yeah thank you yeah welcome YouTube that's crazy man we found a phone in a river that's
