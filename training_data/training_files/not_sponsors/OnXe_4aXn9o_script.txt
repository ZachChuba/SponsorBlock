there's a jeep down here guys oh okay they're all dead i feel serious 1c4 and they're all dead hi everyone hope you're doing well today we're getting straight to business with the growl this is probably the best all-around weapon in the game right now and when i've used it in my cod warzone videos a lot of you guys ask what setup i have on it well here it is this is generally what most of the ground mains use i would say and i do think that it is the best build for it although some people like to run it with no stock but i just don't like how it handles with that so this is what i would personally recommend you get a really clean iron sight with this setup too i've got an absolute monster of a game to show you here loads of kills bit random though but this morning i just asked on my discord if anyone wanted to play and a couple of guys called thomas and kobe said sure thing i'd never played with these dudes before but we did have some nice chilled out games taking names with the growl i hope you enjoyed this one leave a like if you do and let's get into it there's a guy right behind you thomas i'm gonna drop on him yeah i think that's the guy oh they're dropping more oh no i'm gonna give him the old razzle dazzle oh oh that guy stays i got him oh that's you yeah always somebody in front as well whoops there's a couple guys here in the house yeah what do we do we don't have pistols let's go to the right go up the hill two guys down here right yeah i mean i've got snapshot we can push it and i can roll it in there hey you guys got guns i've got a normal or odin sorry oden oh let's go for it oh hey flankers that's nice this is a war crime do not shoot wounded personnel there's still one alive down at the bottom just so you know so be careful when you get up i'm gonna immediately run back oh what about behind us okay okay that guy's really oh he's pushing all right he's dead see what all right i think i should get the attitude of one problem at a time i think that would be great i did see someone here right on the roof one down i'm sure there was another guy yeah the house i think maybe we should move out of here because it's just like two squads fighting over there oh yeah that's definitely good here yep oh let's go chase them let's go they're in a fight we can shoot him in the back all right let's go three of us probably two maybe not sure but there's someone up in that building to the right down the road oh yeah i just got lit up disney definitely more people around there watch out oh yeah yeah on me down finish them there's guy in the reef straight okay yep yeah i saw that i saw the tracers [Applause] he was in that building i don't know who you saw colby which one did you say oh towards the left around about there okay so that's someone else then yeah i also saw tracer there oh wait the bouncy the bouncy guys guys should we go for that bounty well do you not want the money it's actually it's yeah six never mind yeah could be a bit risky oh whoa whoa whoa yeah up on [Music] oh let's move let's move get some cover all right again again did you just break a window was that them hang on the minute oh they're coming they're coming up the stairs watch out he just put c4 or something there didn't he yeah wait wait wait it's done come on oh yeah yeah sorry come up if you can oh that's rpg time then oh no i think there's one more okay i've got plenty of cash i can get you guys back should i go actually you know what i'm gonna go that one it's gonna be fine right fema's just less work i don't see a problem there's a crate which is good probably means it's not not been looted all right there we go and we go on the loadout dropper right on you oh man i say go with that loadout so you can get your perks and stuff okay all right and then there's a couple of armor plates here okay let's move to the next zone if we go like here stick to the coast take that building because that's got a nice rooftop we can go on and if that squad to the left uh coming into the zone we can just light them up is anything ever playing with you any rooftop is a good looking rooftop i think yeah they're gonna have to run towards us now over there over there oh fine coming [ __ ] clean shot sir just got a launcher wait isn't that also going to be right on top of us no we're okay i'll miss us i hope trust me it will be all right all right okay we're going to have to move for the gas guys let's go right down here stick together we're going to play the edge of the zone and just move in with it i have the ancient battle royale tactic even described in the art of war of sun too stick to the zone in your state the sun siri referenced fortnight in that book as well yeah he's very very intelligent time travel as well in 2015 there will be a new hype a very realistic combat simulation okay i need to buy that box he detects it for fortnight yeah maybe he maybe even like predicted or they'll rematch through it one of the most famous quotes in it is if you get stuck just build lol we don't have a uav do we nope nope just a fire hose man okay right so looking at the map we've got a squad on the roof here yeah this is going to be a bit dangerous we're moving through these buildings all right we got to move let's go oh to our left to our left i got spotted to our left okay on the roof oh uh shot in the back panicking shoes oh my god it's trying to stay down stay down we are absolute muppets yeah okay i'm gonna face these guys one two good all dead nice we lost thomas though i'm gonna have to get some assault rifle ammo come here yeah my body have some my body just got like 140. i just pick someone you can have mine if you want i just got some from that guy there colby thank you okay okay just stick to the edge here kobe yeah keep moving in slowly don't sprint can someone just shoot at you no no i saw somebody else uh around west north it's not a bad position right now okay there's a guy over there maybe on the roof to the right i'm gonna get in this store here safe yeah this isn't a bad position okay so the gas is gonna move back now right yeah yeah okay this is gonna get crazy man just hold that window kobe all right ready to go oh no no no no no no jumping off the roof keep moving if you can oh it's a nightmare okay there's a guy right there oh we've got no cover ah bird where do we get third that was crazy wow well played guys jack i need to know what are you using i need to know so there we have it we couldn't get the win unfortunately but some really great moments in
