yeah he has i've vanished your night vision goggles are so scary he doesn't know what it actually is all right we got a guy in his base over here this is perfect actually just close this door he hasn't even reacted to that i don't think he cares oh now he's moving i'm gonna stand right here in the corner as soon as he walks in he's gonna see those glowing eyes [Music] homie you're fine [ __ ] heart attack bro i knew there was an admin on [ __ ] with me but like what got me when i turned around i just screamed in my discord bro yeah he's savvy i know he did he saw me oh this is his base that's perfect this guy seems kind of new too wait is this twig oh it is we're gonna have to help this guy out before i get off oh wait what if i push him [Music] hey you should probably fix your uh twig door frame come up here see this this should be uh there should be at least wood but you have it as twig so i could just break that and walk in if i wanted to all right we got a guy up here hiding in the corner that is so perfect i'm gonna stand right here stalking him so this is what he's gonna see he just moved so he's about to peek and see me well maybe he won't see me it depends oh god he sees me what if i'm right here he's sneaking up behind right now he doesn't see me hey what's up i meant to uh stay in vanish but i accidentally clicked out so kind of ruined it but uh yeah i hope you uh have a good time trying to get this great i'm gonna disappear now you scared the [ __ ] out of me dude i thought you were someone that uh had night vision on i was like how am i not hitting him all right we're gonna start doing this in the daytime because it's so hard to record during the night because you guys can't see anything and so can't i i can't tell which direction they're facing and stuff like that i think it's time we use some scarecrows as well he sees the surrender oh he actually acknowledged it i don't think he likes that he did not see me yet but he does not like seeing a scarecrow in the middle of nowhere i think we also need some of [Music] these oh god that is so scary [Music] that is so terrifying i don't like looking at this myself oh he's taking dude he just literally knocked out of that he's going the other way now he's about to come up to this one over there [Music] oh yeah now he's freaked out for sure oh is this your base oh it is perfect i'm gonna put a scarecrow right here the next time he leaves oh this guy outside who's this guy rip that guy perfect time to do this [Music] nope never mind nice oh rude he's gonna door camp him as well he just asked in chat why there's so many scarecrows oh no he just killed himself okay perfect now we can do this perfect i don't know if he's ever going to open that but that will terrify him if he does um i'm curious now where did he go he might have spawned in an outside bag oh there he is he's running back from all the way over there to see if there's a door camper that is some commitment right there all right there we go i'm not sure if he's ever gonna open up this door so i did that just in case oh wait did he get killed oh yeah he's about to die so we should probably remove that oh he just respawned i hope he opens up the store right here if he doesn't open up that door i'm gonna knock on it that'll make him open it for sure all right i'm gonna leave a note that just says help inside of this guy's triangle right here okay he looked around for the other guy that killed him and now he's gonna come back and he's gonna see this note right here hopefully he doesn't say anything in chad i do have the hud open in case he does let's see oh he saw the note it just says help inside of his triangle there's no way he can know i hope he doesn't say anything in chat oh he didn't say anything he just left the note there [Music] what should i do i'm just gonna write save me it's right there too i love this oh and also let's add a few things here that'll make it even spookier i'm not going to turn it on yet since you just got back okay now i'm going to turn it on oh god that's so creepy i did not know that was gonna happen oh he is freaking out dude this guy is definitely freaking out right now he keeps grabbing the note i think every time he hears that he just keeps grabbing it i'm not gonna touch it until he leaves all right now i'm gonna turn it off oh god oh no i just threw it i think it saved the save me part oh and he just bumped into that oh now he's gonna say something in chat he is terrified actually i'm gonna delete it oh right here there we go now
