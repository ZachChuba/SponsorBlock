hey guys today's video is gonna be a little bit different I have a lot of different clips of shady and weird stuff going on in runescape so I'm gonna show you and try to explain them to the best I can and tell me in the comments what your theories are someone tweeted at me recently that there were a bunch of level 60 to 70 BOTS on a PvP world in the Zarek's Inferno tele a few accounts teleport repeatedly while the rest of the bots try to attack those teleporting I went to check it out and sure enough there were 20 plus accounts all in the same combat bracket I was pretty confused cuz they were all just standing there and I wanted to see what would happen so I stood around and they started attacking me actually I started looking them up and a lot of them had almost the exact same stats 60 attack and around 80 strength and after they killed me three or four times and I kept teleporting back I finally realized that they're risking a lot of GP so I quickly geared up and started attacking one most of the other accounts had already logged out and the guy had no food it had basically the best melee setup for 60 attack accounts without having to do any quests the loot totalled to be over 8 million GP whatever was going on here they definitely didn't think anyone would find her kill them since I'm guessing most of them were risking at least 8 mil I kept checking back and there was no one there until an hour later I found some of them back online and attacked the only guy who was scold but then I got distracted there was this level 64 in the corner who just caught my eye [Music] even though I didn't see it happen I think I know what was going on from the tweet and for the record I have no idea if these accounts were BOTS they could definitely not be but basically when an account teleports and gets hit at the same time the damage doesn't register but the account that's attacking the teleporting account still gets XP so just a few people could easily use this to train up 20-plus accounts at once by just clicking on accounts that are teleporting repeatedly over and over again and given the account stats I'm guessing they're power leveling them to sell I tested this at other locations and it seems like there's already a safeguard put in place where you can't repeatedly teleport to most locations on PvP wall it's probably for this reason to try Nord VPN now let's get back to the video [Music] the next unusual event is incredibly hard to find but extremely lucrative and it requires a lot of luck and patience to actually find what I'm talking about basically botters and gold farmers need a way to transfer GP undetected because for example Jagex is able to flag suspected bots and track who they actually trade their gold to then Jagex can just ban the mule account and erase a lot of the bots farms progress I don't know exactly what jagex monitor is but it seems like the bodies and gold farmers think that drop trading for example is an easy way of laundering the GP they probably also kill each other in PvP worlds for example I was sent this footage by a guy called kids on dids he has a YouTube channel I'll link the YouTube channel in the description go check him out he noticed a lot of accounts going to the second floor of the West Vera Bank and it was pretty obvious to see what was going on there are a lot of accounts ranging from level 20 to 45 with mining pets in full prospector gear so when he looked him up a lot of them had 90-plus mining some of them weigh over 99 mining 1 even had 30 million mining experience and obviously these accounts have almost no other stats the accounts were all dropping their gold either from botting or gold farm in mine it's likely that there is only one account trying to pick it up so if someone has pid' they can just take all of the gold B accounts dropped and that's exactly what happened as you guys can see in this footage and the Twitter DM he sent me he said he's been tracking a lot of things like this other BOTS firms do this too like the Green Dragon bots but he said he made over 120 mil just from the mining bots and some of his friends also made at least 30 mil the guy ended up with 57 mil in a matter of minutes but drop trading like this in a regular world is incredibly risky because you have to actually wait a minute for the items to appear so if someone's been scouting you they have time to come and sabotage what you're doing but in PvP worlds when you drop something it appears instant now the guy who sent me this stuff wants to remain anonymous he stumbled upon a bunch of different drop trades in PvP worlds like I was just saying the accounts were literally geared up to kill Zora and were dropping obviously loot from killing Zora I have a bunch of screenshots of different loot he picked up including a hundred and ninety 1000 Zoeller scales and 27 dragon all birds it looks like the drop trade went down right next to the Barack Museum and that's the thing you never know where this kind of thing is gonna pop up he showed me the username of one of the accounts that was doing the drop trades and the account is still on the high scores with stats that you could probably do solar with and sure enough he has just about 4,000 Zora kills there is a bot farm running in Lumbridge on the free-to-play PvP world and it's a very very simple script there are hundreds of BOTS doing it basically the bot farm just runs into the PvP zone and attacks each other and then when they die they run back in and that's it hopefully it'll be really easy to ban these accounts it's pretty crazy though because you can log into the PvP world and check the whole bot farms progress I first saw it when it was level 6 but at the time I'm recording this it's between level 18 and 25 but again hopefully it'll be banned before too long thanks to Charlie K RS for submitting this clip his twitch channel will be linked in the description Charlie has been grinding banjos for a while and has noticed some of the four or five man teams having incredibly robotic movements the accounts don't even have a fire cape they're using obsidian capes or God prayer capes and now since we can see the boss kill counts on the high scores we can check to see what their account actually looks like I think one of them has already been banned or at least changed their name cuz I couldn't find him but here's one of the accounts shown in that clip all 99 melee stats with up to 21 million XP there almost every other stat other than ranged in prayer is insanely low I need to go down to the kill count he's ranked 35 in van gogh's KC now that got me curious so I just went to the top 100 ranked players in Bandos KC I started clicking through names and found a lot of other similar accounts this guy had 30 million strengths experience every non-combat stat is below 35 and he's ranked 14 in Bandos KC with over 18,000 kills at first I did think these guys were gold farmers but after I went through over an hour of footage you could tell there is a very distinct pattern one of the accounts always peeled off from Bandos to kill one of the minions when Bandos was under let's say 30% of his health but the thing that actually convinced me is one of Charlie's friends came in to crash them and with dragon claws and a scythe that friend was getting every single kill the bots obviously didn't say anything but they didn't even change their movements none of the bots said anything or even change their strategy for killing Bandos I love it when you guys take BOTS busting into your own hands so huge props to Charlie now I got a Twitter DM saying there was a bot farm at ents all with high range and wood cutting levels in a specific range of worlds I went to check it out and immediately found what the guy was talking about the first guy I saw I immediately started to attack all the account did was prey range after a while I was in level 13 wilderness which meant I could just kill the guy I was attacking but halfway through the fight a guy of one or two levels higher who couldn't attack me logged in in the exact same gear obviously he had been killing ants too he was trying to attack me but couldn't because he was one level higher the guy had just gotten there he only had like a hundred and thirty K in logs and gear obviously I started looking them up and one of them had 15 million range experienced 95 woodcutting you know basically no other stats and another one in the exact same gear logged in and tried to attack me but couldn't because they were one level too high all three of these accounts had 98 plus range and in the 90s woodcutting but before anybody jumps to a conclusion like this is a network of bots that works together to kill anybody who tries to kill them there's definitely a simpler explanation because I asked them if they're gold farmers and well they just said yeah but let me know what you guys think in the comments I'm sure they'll still be there if anyone wants to go get some free logs someone saw a lot of bots tele grabbing wines of zamorak in the deep wilderness dungeon I was super excited because if you've done the world earnest hard diaries you get noted winds of zamorak so I thought the bots might be risking Bank what I actually found someone he's dead Loren's and some wines of zemerik 17 Lauren my god forgotten content nobody comes up here 70 magic he must have been telling grabbing these wines for a long time to get 70 magic did some quick math at this bot started off with 33 magic for telekinetic grab it has grabbed over 16,000 wines of zamorak and has probably made approximately 30 mil almost exactly the same stats as last time there's another one my god a D plate geez they all wear the same thing why would the bot maker be like yeah I want all my BOTS to wear an adamant G play party there is is he gonna log is he gonna he's not even gonna log that's why they had their melee stats up at different levels cuz they bash the monk alright we found one yeah I want to follow him I actually was gonna kill him this time let's just take a ride with the bot and see where goes now I'm not condoning this whatsoever and it would honestly put you basically at the level of the bodies but I'm sure it would be pretty easy to make a bot to just hop world's kill these BOTS not take any of their loot so that you're not profiting from the BOTS but it would literally just shut down the bot farm game over again your accounts could all be banned for doing that it's definitely not worth it but I've seen a lot of comments suggesting people making thoughts to actually kill the BOTS where does he think he's going oh no goodbye if you guys are liking the videos I make lee's remember to subscribe I am so close to 200,000 subscribers it's a goal I've had for a very long time and I'm really excited for it thanks again to
