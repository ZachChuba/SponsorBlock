day and save 20% by a brilliant org slash vector first we got power beats Pro a more robust take on Apple's second generation air pods with the same h1 headphone chip but in the power beats in and around the ear design now we have beats solo Pro that's the not in ear not over the ear but the on the ear beats design likewise Prout up with the h1 headphone chip and quite a bit more since I mostly use headphones to listen to podcasts audiobooks and to watch video I figured it'd be better for everyone if I got some legit music knowledge on the line so please join me in welcoming I'm or managing editor Laurie Gill back to the show I Rene Ritchie and this is our beats solo Pro review the design to me looks like previous generations beats solos but almost like an anime movie sequel where they get slightly sleeker and kind of next generation with their mecha but the overall look is the same yeah I'm gonna agree with you on that there's a little more brushed aluminum to it you can kind of see in the area where they they allow you to adjust the size you'll see the you'll see exposed brush aluminum but other than that like the differences are so slight that other than matte versus shiny you're not gonna see the difference between the either pro or solo 3 for sure and we both got the red version they have black ivory white grey dark blue light blue and red and we all went for the mostly matte really matte version but more matte red more matte warm at night so I'm gonna admit up front that this is not my favorite design for headphones the on the ear version I really like in-ear headphones I wear them almost all the time if I'm doing audio work I'll use like the big studio cans that go like completely around the ear people have asked if they bothered me with glasses they don't I'm wearing them with glasses now and I can feel my glasses under my ears but they don't bother me but I noticed two things one that they look way better they just they kind of I kind of look like I'm an an emoji these things on like someone put them on top of me an AR or something and you they look really good on ya it's it's like they're designed for likes I'm not gonna I'm not gonna throw you under the bus or anything but fits smaller heads you know it they definitely fit flatter on my head than they do on either they I I feel like I put these on and I just think I am stylish right now people are gonna look at me with these headphones on it's true and I feel but we have different experience with the comfort level yeah because while I don't like these I don't mind them and I've had beats all those before they've never bothered you but they are not the most comfortable form of headphones for you either yeah so first let me speak to the the glasses and sunglasses thing i I've found it to be the same as you they're surprisingly not uncomfortable sunglasses for me I don't wear glasses but considering that's right where the band of the glasses would be I thought they'd be a lot more uncomfortable but they're actually not and in comparison to the power beats Pro these are more comfortable to wear with sunglasses then the power beats Pro are for me so that's an interesting thing yeah they did they just have a better fit they don't smash those bars down quite this you know in terms of there's the general overall comfort I found them to be surprisingly uncomfortable after more than a half an hour period of time I immediately could start feeling the pressure on my head and you know I've been forcing myself to wear them for two or two or three hours to really just push myself through but I find that I actually have like absolute fatigue all over my whole head by the time I take them off and that's with me like really making myself like put leave them on I wouldn't do that normally I would take them off after an half an hour or hour because it was so so painful for me yeah I haven't had that at all so I would recommend anybody interested in this design by them try them out and if they're not comfortable for you take them back and get in here or over the year because almost everyone makes all the versions in terms of comparing the beats solo Pro to the beats solo 3 I would say the comfort level is about the same do notice between the two that the beats solo Pro are more are they're heavier when you hold them in your hand there's a significant weight difference assuming that has to do with the active noise-cancelling stuff that's in there that that makes them have to be a little bit more weighty on your head this is where I really value having you on here because I don't listen to a lot of music I listen to a lot of podcast it's a lot of audiobooks but beats has a very distinctive sound and how do you feel that coming through with the solo Pro the beats curve which is what what they had been known for in the past for having bass heavy sound and even the solo 3 has that that beats curve that goes a little bit heavy on the bass with the power beats Pro though they changed that completely they took away all that heavy bass and they gave you a better balance now with the power beats Pro they they still have this amazing way to balance music that was intended to have heavy bass would it would boom you would feel it it was thought it was jumping in your chest it was thick but when you were not listening to music that had a heavy bass even it was guitar heavy music acoustic audiobooks things like that it didn't do that it balanced it out so with the beats solo Pro what I found unusual was that I was listening to chronic by dr. dre and I did not feel that heavy thump e bass now an active noise-cancelling one of the sort of bad parts of it is that it tends to up the high frequency so I'm thinking what happened here is that even though they were allowing that heavy bass to pull through with the power beats Pro with these active noise-cancelling headphones that heavy bass just never pulled through it still manages to have that fantastic balance of audio but doesn't give you that thump e bass that actually I kind of like when I'm listening to rep so I'm I wish it had a little bit thicker base C sound to it when I wanted it yeah I listened to the autobiography of mr. Chuck and to some early Eric B and Rakim and it was the same thing I've gotten used to beats just smashing that stuff through the floor and into the basement and it seemed to stop at the first floor with yeah which is great when you're not trying to listen to rap music but when you want it I feel like it's singing these ones a little bit a lot of companies have active noise cancellation that people aren't familiar with it passive noise cancellation is just when you plug up your ears so that other sound doesn't get into it most ear buds have some like actual ones that go into your ear have some level of passive noise cancellation including the power beats Pro now active noise cancellation is when they use software to sort of read the out the outside noise and cancel it apples talking about adaptive noise canceling we're I'm sure they're using their fancy lab next to Apple Park that's been doing cool things like modeling the the different sound for how you hold your iPhone to your ear but they say that whether you have hair or earrings or other or glasses they'll sort of figure out where the headphones are on you and then use those microphones to cancel it even if the seal isn't you know perfect but it worked really well like it felt like everything was silent let me put them on yeah so it's it's entry so I just because I think the way it looks good is it's nice I wear them over my hair and I get the same noise cancellation that I would when my hair is out of the way so it's doing its job I was um having band practice last night and I just decided to see how good these active noise-cancelling really is and I so I put them on my head and we're making a lot of noise in there you know my my watch is going off it's really way too noisy in here I could buy everything was clear and not loud it was like I was listening to music at volume you know 35 or something like inside the headphones it was amazing that it could do something like that I put on a YouTube video playing through my iPhone onto the headphones and then played another one on my computer and I could only hear the one my headphones it was great transparency which is that the beats solo Pro have three different audio versions they have active noise cancellation transparency and then just off so that their regular headphones which has a little bit of the passive noise canceling so transparency means it actually bring it it uses microphones and-and-and frequencies to actually bring in some of that ambient noise that you that you exclude yourself from when you're out and about walking down the street it's very safer when I use it when I take walks because I in a busy city so if there's a car that's you know coming by when I'm gonna walk across the street or something like that I can hear it before I can see it as if I weren't wearing headphones at all so they're also using Apple's h1 chipset which is the second generation headphone chipset the original ones had the W series and those moved over to Apple watch and now we have the H series which is Apple's headphone silicon and it's what does the pairing it gives you that same pairing experience as air pods and it also lets you do audio sharing so if Lori you and I were sitting together we could like watch Godzilla king of the monsters together or something right we could both be wearing our more matte red beats solo prose and watch the same movie sitting next to each other in airplane I did have a chance to test out switching because that's always been the Achilles heel of audio devices for me and I connect it to my iPhone I connect it to my Mac I went back and forth I went to my iPad and back and it all was seamless yeah it worked great across all of the devices just like ear pods do my phone my my watch my computer everything it all just connected right away it was right there for me when I needed it so yeah it's a great experience have you tried it with Syria I have is it works really well it does and it works well with calls and I was I'm always tentative about using headphones like this with calls the air pods at least have a little bit of a boom which just gets it close enough to your to your mouth and beam forms it a little bit better in my experience but this seemed to be fine in terms of recommendations I always fall back on if you know and love the beats sound then these are just much better next-generation beats devices for you to get if you likewise have fallen in love with bose or with sony i don't know that this is enough to tear you away from what you're familiar with but I do think Beats has come a long way in terms of not being quite so beat Z by keeping like the good parts of Beats but also opening up to the more mainstream public's musical tastes absolutely in terms of the quality the audio quality it's like beets grew up they were you know rough-and-tumble teenagers who are trying to turn their music up too loud to piss off their parents and they grew up and they still listen to the greatest music around but they know how to listen to it better that's what it feels like to me like they found like this perfect beautiful balance and I I said this with the power beats Pro I still feel this way beats is making fantastic audio sound and with noise cancelling I find myself hearing even more than I was hearing with power beats Pro in terms of the layers that you listen to you can hear the like you know the sounds when somebody's you know singing like the things that maybe you weren't even supposed to but it's so clear that you can hear breaths between between music and things like that and the layers of the background vocals not just that you can hear you know 16 people in a choir singing but it's almost as if you could hear each one of their individual voices more than I ever could before so the active noise-cancelling on like on top of the fact that beats is just put you like they are performing really well with their audio makes for an incredible audio experience thanks Lori you can find her on iron more and at Apple holic and thanks to all of you for supporting the show so those are our first thoughts on the beat
