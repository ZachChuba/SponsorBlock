hello sip fans a welcome to the Firaxis live stream for the new frontier pass Maya and Colombia pack my name is Karl Harrison I'm the Civilization QA lead and I'll be driving today hi I'm Pete Murray I'm gonna be your host for today's live stream and I'm Anton stringer I'm the lead designer for the new frontier pass so this is really exciting Karl thank you for driving us today we've got to show you guys the Maya we're going to show you a grande Colombia and you're gonna get to see the apocalypse pack all together just as a reminder this is our first DLC in the new frontier pass this is up today you can get this Maya and Gran Colombia right now if you get the new frontier pass not only will you get the Maya and Gran Colombia but you will get all of the remaining DLC drops that we'll have for this year so Carl tell us what we're gonna jump into here in a moment we're gonna be starting with Maya so let me go ahead and get into the game we've got a Maya lady six guy up and ready to go Anton why don't you talk to us about her abilities absolutely so the Maya are all about having compact rural empires that may have a totally different way of approaching the sort of housing and city settlement problem once we get into the map in a minute here we'll see the settler lens is totally different because fresh water doesn't really matter for the Maya it's all about getting extra housing from farms and farms don't just give the plus point five housing that they normally do they give actually an extra one so one point five total they give more gold they also get benefits from settling next to luxury resources so it's a really different silly City a settlement placement game than normal and if you do are able to sort of pack your cities tightly together all cities within six tiles get plus ten percent for all of their yields which is really great and all of your units within six tiles will actually get higher combat strength even if you haven't settled yet so you're sort of like have a really nice way to early push out into into the territory you can settle outside that at a slight penalty but really it's about getting that sort of like compact tall civilization up and running and then the whole che and the Observatory play into that as we'll see once we get into the game here and here we are in the game so Carl this looks like this is pretty early on tell us what this setup that you have going on is yeah it is early on we are in classical era right now I've got a couple cities down this their capital Whatcom now you can see our settled it next to an olives resource and my I get plus one amenity in their city if they're if they are adjacent or on top of a luxury resource so I settled right here I have that over at this city as well but not all of my cities were able to pull that off and some like over here in order to get adjacent to the luxury resource I would have had to go beyond that sick style range this is exactly six tiles right here mm-hmm all right so go ahead I was gonna say I've got to map two pins up here this is also at the sixth tile extreme and I'm gonna open the settlor lens which Anton was just talking about you can see that there are no green tiles because fresh water just doesn't matter and there are some tiles down here that I could settle as well if you go six tiles out from each side of the hex of the city centre for the capital that's the maximum range that you can go and then that will leave you space in between like this free to settle additional cities altogether you can squeeze up to twelve cities into that six tile range but your cities are very packed in if you do that it can be great because you're getting tests plus 10% on all of them but we're not going to do that today because this is all desert and you can't put farms on desert so yeah it won't actually work out that well now it makes sense it's not all desert can you take a minute and it looks like you've got a new natural wonder that's parked in the middle of the desert there do you want to talk about that real quick yeah that's right that's one dozen might go down to reveal it and then antara anyway there it is so this is PI T D it's a sort of like it's not quite historical but very sort of mythological site in southern America that was sort of like the it's this lost city of gold that lots of explorers kept searching for and had a lot of really interesting mythology to it in terms of gameplay what it does as you see there the desert tiles even though they don't really have food or production are quite nice because they have gold culture from being adjacent to a TV so the ones that are adjacent to two of the three PI T D tiles they're like the one on the south get six gold the four culture which is quite nice again from Maya it's not the best because without having be able to put farms on desert tiles we sort of are really hampering our growth but for someone like the Molly this would be amazing and even though we can't really like get the benefits of settling right on it ITV will also allow us to like if we place theater squares or commercial hubs next to it we're missing out on the the natural yields of the of the tile that it would give us but we get major adjacency bonuses for doing that so it's almost like when you place a holy site next to a natural wonder you get a major adjacency for pi TD the same rule applies for theater squares and commercial hubs so you can settle right up against this mystical City of Gold and get lots of yields that way - that's really cool now next to pi TD there there's what looks like a unique unit but that's not the that's not the whole chair that's not the Maya as unique unit it is not this is the nihon it's a unique unit that actually comes from a city state carl has managed to become suzerain of a city still called Lahore I think he I think it's over off to the east there yeah it's a militaristic city state so this is a really cool unit because first off it's purchased with faith and because it's a unique unit they can actually be kind of like achieved anytime in the game so like we're right now we're in the classical era so they're holding swords but their combat strength will actually increase as long as you sort of keep your military buildings in your account with districts up to date their combat strength will increase they also have a unique promotion tree that sort of reflects the weaponry that they get over time as they become more trained and sort of like the final cool thing about them is that our art team had a lot of fun with them because again it's a unique unit kind of like our Mayan hole che which we'll see later but because you can get it from a city state kind of anytime in the game we wanted to make sure that the visuals stayed up to date so as they do get stronger as you have them in like the industrial of the modern era they're gonna be carrying rifles and fitting into your battlefield just fine very good all right so what's your game plan for what are you gonna walk us through today Carl but we're gonna start by showing the unique things about Maya so I just place a plantation here on this olive resource let's go ahead and take a look at what production we have available you can see that the observatory here is here this replaces the campus and it gets a plus to science bonus for being adjacent to a plantation so if I go to place this down we'll see that we have that bonus right here from this olives but not this one because this one doesn't have a plantation on it the title does have to be improved already but once it is this will be plus four and then I can put another district here the Observatory still gets a minor adjacency bonus from other districts so by making a district triangle I'll get an additional plus one and then it gets plus 1 / 2 adjacent farms so I can put a farm here and a farm here for another plus one totally yeah and this is kind of an example of something that on the design team we were really excited by it because most of most of playing normally through a civilization game and placing your campus you want to be up next to rainforests next to mountains but the observatory really changes all of that strategy when you're playing as the Maya you want nice open flat land where you can have you know luxury resources nearby districts nearby and farms so it really changes the sort of like strategy that you go with both the observatory and again like I said earlier at the Mayans sort of like housing difference so it's similar to this sort of Koreans say one district in that way where we took a very popular and very powerful district and sort of changed the rules of what makes it good so carl chat is wondering if you wouldn't mind toggling on yields they'd like to look at those things as well - sure well it's a good time because actually like your standard kind of on one of our new resources which is maize and you have an or you have an observatory already constructed there you can see like the the sort of like nice dome structure one of our sort of historical inspirations for this was an archeological site called I think is called El Caracol in Central America it has this sort of like sort of like snail like spiral to it and again by being next to both of those maize farms and the dye plantation and the olives plantation it's getting five science on flat land next to a river yeah and I don't double that yet either so it'll go up even further here in a bit oh yeah yeah that's good stuff men the babies yeah go ahead and talk about maize Karl like maize provides to Gold at base instead of the additional food that rice provides for example it has three gold here because I am Maya and Mayas farms do provide an additional gold as well so I'm getting three gold from maize but for everybody else it would be two maize also still gets improved by the water mill if I were to build one I don't get an additional food awesome that this is a this is a pretty good start to your setup it looks like you have a nice you know useful world going on you've got some partners that you seem to be doing pretty well with so everything's good right this is all perfectly fine everything's pretty well so far but we are playing on apocalypse mode we do get some surprises with that here we go so yeah by playing with apocalypse mode on there are a couple of new things that get mixed into the game and this is one of potentially the first ones you'll see this is a new global competition called appease the gods and it has to do with another new part of the Apocalypse mode which is the soothsayer unit which you can purchase with faith soothsayers are really cool and we're gonna build one in a minute with faith here but what they do is they can use charges to cause natural disasters now you can use that offensively against your opponents you can use it sort of like defensively if your opponents are attacking you or you can use it economically to try to like generate some yields for yourself but once they're out of charges they're gone unless you're able to power them up throughout the game and that's what these competitions are all about so to appease the gods you need to have your soothsayer grab a victim and drive them over to an active volcano and sacrifice an adjacent unit and while it's very sad and that unit goes away their combat strength is reincarnated as points towards winning this appease the gods competition and if you're able to win the competition you get a free soothsayer unit which is pretty cool but perhaps even cooler is the silver tale rewards there where you get a free rein promotion for all present and future suits their units and the promotions are very cool they all will give an extra charge so you'll get more disasters you can cause and there's some other goodies to get thrown in as well especially we'll see in the next save and then we get some faith return kind of in the background just for participating as well so Carl how about we get in on this soothsayer action and maybe sacrifice a unit that we don't necessarily need anymore sounds good to me so I'm gonna come down here you can produce a soothsayer in any city as long as you have the faith for it so we're going to come to tea hall where I already have a warrior because this is fairly close to this volcano next to Auckland influence our buddy so we don't want to like necessarily causing a volcano to explode right make Prime sacrifice location well once once we advance the turn that unit will become active and we'll get to see what the soothsayer looks like so Carl what happens if you push out past that six hex limit with Maya and try to settle the city if I were to settle outside of that six tile range rather than getting plus 10% yields and it's all yields every single yield science culture production faith gold all of it food it is a huge boost if I were to settle outside of that I instead get minus 15% to all yields now granted that's still 85 percent of normal which is high or zero so settling a city outside of the six tile range is better than not having a tile out there city outside of that range and the same thing happens if I reconquer city is the maya still because it's outside of six tiles even if it's another player's capital it's not my capital so it still gets that minus 15% which is very important but again and that 85% still higher than 0% so it's not it's not a huge problem but it is just a little bit of a debuff it's totally doable it just sort of comes down to how you want to balance above your amenity spread and then your loyalty you don't want to overextend yourself but yeah it's totally possible to do as maya it's just really about that core is supercharged so if you want to have a you know like very powerful core Empire and just kind of write out a culture of science victory with that that's kind of what they're about but if you want to go conquer the world go for it so it looks like we got a settler coming up there and you're not gonna bring them quite to the edge of the six tiles because looks like you want to be next to that silk and closer to some places where you can build some farms exactly if I were to go all the way up here you can't put farms and tundra or snow so well this is the sixth Isle extreme obviously I do not get that freshwater bonus and I will have trouble growing because I can't put as many farms down so I want to stop right here and settle adjacent to this silk so that I get that plus one amenity and I'm next to plenty of Plains that I can still put farms can we zoom in on that gorgeous yes thank you the whole J yeah so this is the Mayan unique unit a great early game escort for you know exploring or you know in this case gardening or settler they look awesome and they are particularly strong against wounded unit so they're great at finishing folks off and actually we have another sort of like fun story about this guy so car so they're there wielding what's called an atlatl it's kind of like this spear thrower and Karl actually has some experience with this weapon yeah I old and hot a lottle once upon a time and I do own one so when the art department told me that they needed references I was like oh well you know I happen to have one and I could bring it in so I did and we played around with it a little bit to look at how it works and how it looks when you when you actually use it so that we can get the animations right and you can see here that there's a little tooth on the end of this this sort of stick this is the spear thrower and then you take this sort of light spear or long arrow and you put the the end of it onto that little tooth and then you pull it back and you throw it and it can go really far and it's very powerful and very dangerous it's surprisingly effective but yeah not something that like you know you you see ergonomics with you know just watching archers and slingers and stuff like that it's a very unique weapon right it's um it's also rare to work at the kind of place where you can say does anybody have an auto model for our art department to refer to and some of these gonna jump up and say oh yeah I totally got one right here so it's very true oh great alright we're we're pretty big historical weapons nerd for access it's true the soothsayer has arrived look at how awesome that is so this is a really cool unit to do again for our art department and you know collaborating with our design team they have this big horseshoe sort of stand they've got some creepy candles people with hoods so yeah they're just great and when we sort of like see them get up to their shenanigans later on they have some really cool things that will happen to that horseshoe there so we're gonna bring on get along an unsuspecting warrior you know just out for you know for patrolling don't worry about it oh you've always wanted to see that volcano right see it up close you know right then the lava fumes really it's really ya know finally inspiring if you will yes it is I think there was a question in the chat about can you play the apocalypse mode without the soothsayer so no the the apocalypse mode is sort of a couple different things bundled together so let me go ahead while we're waiting for the soothsayer to make it to the volcano and dive into some of that so the apocalypse mode has a couple parts there are two new natural disasters eight comments and a solar flare we'll talk more about those later and it also has these soothsayer units and the apiece the Gods competition that goes with that suits their unit and then the final thing is like once the climate change reaches its final level bad things start happening namely those two big new disasters also when you turn on apocalypse mode in game setup sort of under the hood what it does is it disables the climate change slider so you can't you know set from zero to four like you would normally because it basically chain turns it up to five six seven eight when apocalypse mows on so disasters are more intense there is more of them and you have soothsayers to trigger them for your own benefit as well so on top of that there are two new disaster types that you don't have to have apocalypse mode for there's the forest fire in the meteor shower so anyone with Gathering Storm with the Mayan Grand Columbia pack will have those in in every game and those are kind of much tamer and they sort of like fit in with the balance of our existing disasters somebody's asked if you use the soothsayer if you cause a natural disaster in somebody else's territory does it generate grievance I don't remember where we landed with the AI balance on that one they definitely will be able to reap the benefit if there are yields that get improved from that but kind of like one way around that too is you can't activate in someone else's territory unless you are at war so it is definitely considered a hostile action and you know as it causes things to be pillaged and stuff like that and causes damage that might feed into the grievances calculation as well I have been asked to say noriko we are not pre-recorded this is live we have like many different pieces of software and the cables plugged into each other to bring ourselves live to you on launch day during quarantine but this is very much not canned I would hold up a little piece of paper that says you know live on whatever but I do not have a camera so what Carl's playing a good Wonder game here he's got the Oracles which will help boost his great people points which as the Maya again because you sort of have like a compact Empire maybe not as many districts at someone conquering the world it's a great way to keep your great people game competitive you also started building the pyramids over in chichen itza over there which oh man pyramids great normally but as the maya who use builders to create a bunch of farms it's very very good all right so you ready down here with our soothsayer I'm sorry go ahead and select this unit you can see I've got two new buttons on it one is caused disaster and the other sacrifice adjacent unit if I were to click cause disaster it would use one of the two charges on this unit and it would activate this volcano causing it to erupted that would not damage the Zeus there because Zeus Ayres are immune to natural disasters that when they survive the disasters that they caused and can literally walk through fire it's pretty great that's not when it's kind of our buddy so we don't yes certainly want to do that to them and again because we're playing on apocalypse mode a lot of disasters are more intense so the the volcano would if we were to trigger it would actually damaged units up to two tiles out instead of just one tile though this connects oil is still only on the adjacent time right the volcanic soils still only the adjacent and it is random so if I were to trigger this I could hit England's units but I might not hit England's units I would probably damage Auckland oh and yes since there since we're suzer and we don't really want to do that but we do want to participate in appease the gods so I'm gonna go ahead and sacrifice this warrior ooh here we go nice more shoes on fire with dark evil magic and intentions got a question from the chat what difficulty are we playing on so these saves today we're actually playing only on Prince we got a lot to get through we got to SIVs we got a whole new Apocalypse mode and this is the brand-new livestream that we're doing the first one for the new frontier pass so we wanted the you know against Carl the Prince AI is not not that big of a deal so we wanted a you know sort of like remove obstacles for him to just be able to like you know sort of have free reign over the map so we're only playing on Prince difficulty for today I feel like this is my fault I said to him Carl you know let's so let's just get some saves set it up so you have some cool situations for us and so if if Carl is stopping the the AI here it's largely so we can show off this new stuff not that it's any sort of you know a key serious challenge for Carl and his abilities so and we will do some stopping later oh yeah that's our next saying that we're gonna show before we get to that yeah what do you plan to do with that soothsayer Carl you're not bringing them back to your own territory it looks like you're driving over to England there yeah so I'm out of units down here I could you know potentially purchase something else but I I think I'm leading I am with 20 there you get all flood so you see that this is a thousand-year flood you will see this more often on apocalypse mode like like Anton said all the disasters are bigger they're stronger they're more devastating they're also more frequent that's something that I don't think is actually specifically called out in our patch notes but they are more freaked as well not just bigger and stronger so you will see you know sounds a little flood more often but yeah I'm leading here so I wanted to go ahead and move this soothsayer to someplace that it could actually do some damage and like you said we can't use it with in England's territory that none of the tiles are highlighted so I'm gonna use it right here and I'm gonna start a forest fire to hopefully spread to these surrounding tiles and maybe damage Manchester and Liverpool and because it was outside their territory you know it's not your fault it's just a lightning struck there exactly exactly number of reasons possible deniability so Carl what do you do when like you have a city state kind of like Mexico City there and like Auckland down to the south that's sort of within your Sikh style radius how do you sort of make the strategic evaluation of do I want this city to be giving me my plus 10% for being close to the capital or do I want to keep it for its Caesar in bonus well I think Mexico City is actually just outside of that range oh you're right yeah okay in this case I decided to leave Mexico City and I can stay and not not conquer them but if there was in your radius or if you have neighbors that settle within your radius you want to go ahead and conquer those cities and have them for yourself because land is a premium for Maya especially once you are within that ten tile radius so you really want to try to get as many cities as possible if someone's taking that land you take it from them and they do have that classifies combat strength that'll homeless em style it helps them with that you're right we've had a couple of other questions that have been sort of drifting in can you sacrifice somebody into a volcano to stop a natural disaster no you cannot no sacrifice is all about the competition that's really the only thing that it does once a disaster is started you cannot take it back whether it was you or the soothsayer that did it in fact I mentioned that you can use sue sayers sort of like defensively or economically Carl has kind of a funny story about that where he learned about the double-edged sword that his forest fires when we were testing yeah so you know when we were first testing this this mode out it hadn't really occurred to us right away to try to use it economically to boost our own titles but that was suggested to us I believe by Anton it was me yeah surely a controlled burn there would be no problem right so I went ahead and I tried that in speaking of forest fires actually I do have one up here looks like so no hopefully that will cause any any further damage and I may have because this is only for this is my second city and this is eight so hopefully I have not lost much population yet but they have a nice view of the fire from the observatory yeah from up there probably pretty warm that close though but so what when we were when we were testing that out we decided to go ahead and try using it on ourselves and I had a city that was tons of woods and rain forests that I had improved with lumber mills and I was like you know what I'm gonna go ahead and burn those down because what happens is the the forest gets burned away and you lose that initial forest yield but then it comes back it grows back and it grows back with additional yield on top of it like with most disasters in the game so I I would wanted to make those tiles even better and I started a fire on myself planning to just rebuild all the lumber mills once the yields were fantastic well the fire spread so far that it hit my city and hit my districts and the city which was 15 population dropped all the way down to one pretty nasty that's uh yeah forest fire spread as well as well see shortly Harry that's a can be hard to predict so be careful kids so to put out a wildfire you need water so to to water related questions regarding the Maya how do they use and mohenjo-daro the city state they interact with uh with the my ass I can take that one the Edit on yeah yeah so the aqueducts cities Mayan cities start with a water housing of two they do not benefit from fresh water they always have the very base which is to so what you'll see when you open up your city details panel if you look at the housing it will say housing from water to that's standard if you build an aqueduct it will bring them up to the level of having fresh water which is six total so building an aqueduct as Maya gives plus for housing however mohenjo-daro says that city will will without fresh water will benefit as if it did have fresh water as if it was settled on a fresh water source but Maya do not benefit from settling on a fresh water source so mohenjo-daro does nothing for the Maya but the aqueduct does all right we are just about ready here oh we've got one more production looks like I gotta brush it nice all right so let's come down here and let's start this fire right now it's only gonna burn this tile because it's a tile it's on but the fire should spread so we see it I only improved one tile it actually has not improved yet it won't improve until it comes back so let's advance to turn and see what happens I'm sure this will be fine this will not cause any problems at all I mean there is there is a chain of forest that does lead up to oak small there but hopefully I won't get too out of control right and it can cross the river two rivers do not stop forest fires if there are mountains in the way the mountain will obviously cuz that's a whole tile but rivers do not actually stop the forest fire so there we go it's spreading waters one yeah twice good there we go alright very nice and looks like I won the competition so I get a free sincere in my capital and I get the promotion for stealth Inquisitor so now England can't even see that this unit is here because it's not adjacent to any of four other units or her cities so yeah for all she knows this was a natural disaster you see nothing that's amazing I like it and if we were to continue this on it would probably damage Manchester and the population would start to drop also I was a that was a tricky play I like it and we because of the promotion we earned from the competition our sue sayers actually you know barely didn't really even have to spend a charge at all right I'm still a to again and this one up here would be at 3 yeah perfect so I did want to point out there have been a lot of people in chat who have been asking about in frontier pass on Mac and Linux so we are working with the spire to get it out as soon as we can as soon as we have more information to share with you we'll do that alright and let's go ahead and we are going to jump into our next stage so Carl tell us what we're going into 4x1 so the next save is grande Columbia and we are going to be in early industrial which is really where Simone Boulevard shines a lot of his stuff comes online at the very end of Renaissance or the very beginning of industrial era he has a great early game his settlers have three movements so they can move into a forest or onto a hill and still settle you can have builders move and chop or move and build an improvement on the same turn his Scouts have four movements so he can scout very well forest yeah right but the biggest thing for him is is in that industrial period because that's when his unique unit and infrastructure come on so I've got his abilities up here yeah if you want to talk about that a little bit yeah so similarly VAR is sort of a very strong militaristic civilization he's very fun to play like Carl mentioned you know all the units get +1 movement and sort of as a cherry on top promoting a unit is not in that units terms this is kind of a throwback to how promotions worked in Civilization v makes it great if you're on the move closing the gap with your enemies but yeah like Carl said it's also great for civilian units especially early on to sort of really I think piece that brings a lot of Simone bolivars abilities together those two commandant a general so this is a special unique unit tied to Bolivar and it's kind of like a unique great general so every time you enter a new era which in the base game means a new player era and in rise and fall and Gathering Storm means a new game era you will earn a free commandant a general and these are there are 10 I believe different ones they're all historical people that were part of bolivars revolution in south america and they all have unique retirement effects just like all the great generals do and they provide a passive benefit to all the units that are nearby as you can see like yeah Carl's got a whole army to go and just roll over the Maya here so there's Gregor McGregor one of the commandant a generals and so he has the the same two hex radius you are accustomed to as a great general but critically the +5 combat strength and the +1 movement is not error restricted so you can keep these common Delta generals from the very first one you get in the Classical era all the way through the end of the game or if you want you could use their retirement effects like a Gregor MacGregor here will give a promotion and give some gold back based on the cost of the unit he's also got one down here Santiago Moreno who would if he retired would give a permanent +4 combat strength 2 million anti calves units within two tile so you stack a whole bunch of people together burn his ability and everybody's stronger for the rest of the game he also has a great general here like a normal great general Joan of Arc yeah so come on Dante generals cannot stack their AoE effect with each other but they can stack with great generals so you can have a great general power strengthen and also comment on to general great power strength and those can stack up so we're gonna go to the war with the Maya here and show all of this off and like Carl was saying this is a really nice time for Bulevar because this is when his young aero unit comes online just to reiterate to everybody we are playing on Prince difficulties so if we're I think the AI there's kind of a reason for it but we do get to show off fun that you can have with Gran Colombia so I'm hovering here sorry Pete go ahead go right ahead you're doing it I've got a linear generic or here and I'm hovering to show the combat preview so that you guys can see through that I've got plus six from Intel I've got a spy in the Mayan capital I get plus four from an adjacent you nearer and that does stack so if I have more than one that bonus would increase and we might see that here in a little bit that's part of your Niek ability yeah right and then I have plus five from the Commandant a general now I only have the one here I'm not going to go ahead and bring in those other generals because I'm not going to need them and I want those to come over and attack copan here so let's go ahead and do this attack and then we'll move on to the next city so that you guys can see what that looks like but move on to the next city that yeah there's something scary down there Carl yes there's a soothsayer here and I have all this forest and jungle to move through my armies gonna be coming right through here so she were to come over and start a forest fire it would damage my units if you have a unit inside of a tile that is consumed by forest fire that fire will damage your unit just like any other natural disaster in the game so I want to go ahead and kill that so that she can't start a forest fire and damage my army that's a good call yeah I also don't know if she had any promotions on it I actually didn't look so it's possible that she was getting some kind of benefit and I want to keep this city well what are you gonna do with copepod because that's uh that's kind of an oddly placed City like I'm not a great zoo player and I don't think I would have built it there well she can build it here because she is Maya but that's yeah like you said that's the interesting thing about attacking a Maya player as their cities are definitely gonna be built differently than how you would normally build your your cities so she has no fresh water on the city it is not in range of being able to build an aqueduct and her campus is not up here in the mountains because her campus doesn't get Mountain adjacencies so I don't really want to keep the city I'm gonna go ahead and raise it after I take it some of these others like this one down here that's much better because it is on a river but good yeah when when she's when when you attack a Mayan player you have to be very careful about what you do with the cities after the fact I want to call out too so in addition to the great generals and the Commandant a generals next to cap on there you actually also have a suits there and so why did you bring along that suits there yeah they get a great just actors as well it's a great eye I could use this soothsayer offensively to cause some disasters and maybe lower some population but since I probably want to keep these cities I don't necessarily want to damage them that's more for like a you know raid that you go in and then leave I'm not sure in this particular case I brought this soothsayer along because of the promo that I have I've completed to appease the gods competitions already this game and I achieved messenger which has the +1 charges all of the promotions do and then +2 movement so that this soothsayer can keep up with the rest of my army and then I also have incantation just allows the soothsayer to function basically as a great general so I have the effect of three great generals on this unit so let me take a look if I were to well I'll come back to the scene arrow let me move this guy in first sure this field cannon has four movement because it has the base of two the one from being grand Columbia and then it started in range of a commandant a general so it had an additional plus one so it was able to move on to a rain forest hill tile which consumes three movement and still attack which is huge so when I soften up the walls with these field cannons first that's crazy to watch I it never gets old but Carl you were saying that that this is very situational that that while it's very useful in the beginning of the game or scooting you know your builders and your settlers around it towards the end of the game it's maybe not as much of an advantage potentially yeah it really it really depends on the circumstance so movement is fantastic when you're trying to close the gap but once you have a city surrounded with cavalry let's say I have a movement but that 8th movement doesn't matter for much when I'm attacking only one tile and cavalry units can ignore zone of control but melee units cannot and you see where was that great general right here yes this one this commandant a general their effect was +4 combat strength permanent +4 combat strength to all melee and anti CAV units so if I were to get somebody like that early in the game I might build an army of melee units as many as I can to fit within this 2 tile radius and then if I were to use the retire effect it gives that permanent +4 combat strength on top of any future Commandant a generals or great generals that are buffing them and that's a pretty significant bonus but mainly units have to obey zone of control so +1 movement or additional boost of movement from Kommandant a generals is really nice but only goes so far once you hit that zone of control range right yeah we're actually in a pretty happy place after many play test iterations with where the balance of grand Colombia is I mean of course you know we're gonna we're gonna watch how all of our fans play with it and if we need to adjust you know in future patches we can but like Carl was saying the military bonus is sort of very specific to certain play styles and we've definitely Karl definitely was able to take advantage of that in this particular war again on Prince difficulty but you know on the economic side bolivar isn't quite as strong the exception there being again the early settler and builder pushes which might give you a little bit of an edge and then the Hacienda or approvement which will show off later on which is quite good and there goes coupon if you guys are watching the the comment preview on that you narrow I did have +5 from commandant a general +5 from great general +5 from soothsayer +6 from inside so it was pretty gnarly you can get some really big bonuses stacked up but we've seen a couple of people talking about how high those bonuses can be and we want to just remind you there's there's a whole bunch of really great warmonger sibs that have those kinds of bonuses Mongolia for example can get up to a plus 27 if played properly and that's without a great general yeah it's crazy alright so are you gonna get rid of that city yeah it was not doing anything for me I am gonna come up and improve this city though with the Aussie Enda that's the so you can see that I have a plantation right here the ASEAN de gets +1 food / 2 adjacent plantations so this one if I built one here would get +1 food because there are two once I reach replaceable parts it is per one plantation so building one here would give me plus one food once I get that far if you build them adjacent to each other let me excuse me let me go back so we can see what that looked like if you build them a nation to each other / to adjacent ASEAN does you get an additional +1 production and same thing at replaceable parts that becomes for everyone so I'm gonna make an entire ring of ASEAN Dez right here and they're gonna be very nice yields particularly once I get to that replaceable parts and you can see that the fence went ahead and circled them all and I have a couple of other spots where it's doing the same thing you want to try to build these in triangles just like you do with farms because they do stack there their production benefits when they do that and if you can get that next two plantations it's even better reminds me a little of the cattle stations and with Australia a little bit yeah yeah yeah exactly so if somebody and while you're playing around somebody had asked about whether or not we were going to do balance changes yes actually there's a big balance update they went out with this we have some exploits that naughty people were using we also did a rework of the diplomatic victory so yeah there's a lot of balance changes that kind of wall we were working on the other parts of the new frontier pass we wanted to get that to you all as fast as possible but also moving forward you know a big part of the new frontier past is not just the big DLC releases that we're doing the six of them of which this is the first but also in between those community updates for everybody and these will include balance changes and new features even if you don't own the new frontier pass so that's when we're really taking the opportunity kind of like we did with the updates after Gathering Storm to listen to feedback to make balance adjustments and you know squashing bugs that we happen to come across as well yeah yeah right now can you go back to the Bermuda Triangle for a second oh you saw that did you what I did I did but uh those are big science numbers you want to talk a little bit about that anti oh yeah they're bonkers science numbers so the Bermuda Triangle is one of our three new natural wonders pi TD you saw in the last game is another one of them they have bonkers science numbers with the Bermuda Triangle because it spawns in deep ocean it's gonna not be every game that you can actually get those tiles within your city but you know since random maps are such an interesting part of savant to include it just in the off chance it does lead to that really cool really cool combination the real big part of the Bermuda Triangle though is as you know with these like kind of more fantastical natural wonders that we're experimenting with in this release the Bermuda Triangle effect is really cool you send a naval unit into it and it will pop out on the literal other side of the world like it will take half of the distance of you know the width of the map have to do this at the height it will pop out somewhere any radius on the other side of the world and we thought this was like a fun and flavorful way to represent the sort of like mysteriousness of the Bermuda Triangle while not gaining like to into crazy territory like it could be a fun way to you know maybe stage an invasion oh there's a mega colossal eruption from the apocalypse load hopefully that doesn't yeah then yeah that's two miles out yeah yep so you have the pillage the damage is real another thing about the Premio triangle is it's not just about movement if you do this you will also earn a plus-one movement bonus for that ship that does it forever so that Karl's gonna go ahead and mysterious curse word it'll pop up in your unit queue again don't worry yeah it's it will show up on the other side of the world and actually yeah oh oh went went that far from over here yeah yeah yep that's awesome and actually Carl if you could go back to the visual for a second there this is another example kind of like the nihon where well we don't see it anymore but you know it had that sort of like so go ahead and keep playing Carl but all that it had this sort of like blue bioluminescent sort of feeling this was a really fun back and forth with our art department because we were trying to figure out okay this Bermuda Triangle thing doesn't really exist nobody's really sure and even if it did exist it might just be you know it's just a range of ocean so you know how do we represent this artistically and a lot of the early concept paintings were about we're about you know having lots of glowing and lots of special effects which seem cool but it was a little bit too over-the-top a little bit too fantastical so I dug back into my memory of like growing up on the beaches of Southern California and sometimes what happens there is you get this sort of like algae in the water that when waves will crash will actually light up in this sort of like really interesting teal bioluminescent color so we used that as a way to sort of like guide the artists in sort of like coming up with a cool new interesting visual direction it would be you know sort of like interesting and kind of fantastical but still grounded in reality so that's kind of what we did for that very cool so Carl do you want to tell us what we're gonna see now as we jump into a late game with grand Columbia sure thing um let's get in the game here we've loaded a different save this is much later in the same game and I have been pumping out co2 so I've built up a whole bunch of Units that burn through resources I've built up a whole bunch of coal power plants and I've been really trying to crank out that co2 s that I can cause global warming an increase that that slider that level so when you hit the max level of seven you will enter the apocalypse mode which we should be getting to very soon it is also worth noting that when you play with them pocalypse mode enabled you actually start at level one I'm going to go ahead and open the global climate screen so we can see what that looks like you start with this enabled already so the rate of co2 is unchanged in the game you just start higher so you will get to coastal flooding faster you will get to bigger disasters faster and you will get to this level seven faster and that's something that I'm gonna be very conscious of it kind of changes how you how you settled on where you settle right Carl like you're much for Shire about settling along you know flood plains and stuff on this mode right I actually we actively avoid it when we think we learned to to truly fear the level of disasters that could happen so if the choices were between settling on flood plains and settling one tile off of the river and building an aqueduct we would settle off of the river and that's never something that we would do in a normal game but in Apocalypse mode that's something we all do the same thing with coastal flooding you hit that coastal flooding so fast we try to avoid those one-meter lowlands as much as possible yeah yes that's that's something that we really like about the modes kind of like we did with the Maya sort of like changing how you play the housing and the campus game having these most active we want them to you know offer fresh new game play where you you know sort of challenge the patterns that you may have fallen into through Civilization six over the years and experience the game in fresh new ways and we realized that you know the the fanciful you know soothsayers going around and and you know apocalypse mode being active might not be for everybody especially if you want to play like a more symmetrical competitive multiplayer which is why we're doing these as modes they're experimental and if you want to turn them off that's totally fine you'll still be able to get the natural wonders the city-state's and of course all the zooms and leaders and by the end of the new frontier pass you know having six different modes you'll be able to mix and match you can have a populist mode and secret societies which is the second DLCs mode we've already announced twenties a little bit you can have both of those active at the same time if you want n de- so uh we talked a little bit about some of the new disasters one of them being wildfires forest fires and people are asking if they can actually fight the forest fire in the game you cannot you just have to wait it out unfortunately that's sort of like a historical you know we don't have like a firefighter unit so it's really about especially when apocalypse mode is not on it's about sort of like minimizing global climate change to make forest fires almost less likely and just sort of being able to sort of like plan your city layout and you know react accordingly and of course there'll be a dress to come in you know if someone's afflicted by a forest fire and all that good stuff it looks like oh we got we just got another level of coastal flooding is that yeah there's more coastal flooding and that means that we've probably increased in the climate level so we might be seeing something happen here I'm sure it'll be fine sure nothing bad what what oh my goodness blammo more population loss from that or how many tiles were affected now this says fertilized but this is four tiles affected and this is what they look like afterwards so let's go ahead and find where that hit I'll be fine this snows it's just a nice swimming pool now yeah yes the screen is red there's this ash falling around the borders of the screen here because Li now in Apocalypse mode this is what the crater impacts site looks like and if I mouse over this you'll see that it has zero yield and is impassable anything that is on these tiles when they get hit is instantly destroyed cities wiped out districts gone Wonders removed from the game even if it's a mountain tile it will turn into this kind of crater you cannot move units through it you cannot improve it they are just gone and yeah if you lose all of your cities to comet strikes like this and other disasters then you will lose the game and there's a special loss condition for that with the apocalypse mode enabled yeah so if you reach defeat wall this is sort of like n times red flashing ash on the edge of the screen is happening you'll get a new custom defeat victory animation without goodness it's keeping going that little idyllic farm oh oh man well that sucks was that your capital i I think that was a Maya city okay so yeah we were working on space race that's why the fact that I have actually wiped out most of the citizen the game at this point I stopped my conquest and started focusing on science victories that we can make sure that we actually saw all of this happen and you can see this to clean the ash is really prevalent there yeah so certainly the idea behind apocalypse mode is sort of twofold like on the one hand we're hoping that it adds more interesting to Matic gameplay just because the stakes are so much higher so working to control climate change using the World Congress making responsible choices about power you know will be very important but on the other hand you know if somebody pollutes like crazy like Carl does here it's sort of like an exciting and dramatic and yes fairly random way to sort of trigger the end game and make it much more exciting and much more of like a like a final countdown to the end of the game so it becomes much more of a race because he knew eventually comets are going to pummel lots of different cities and might ruin your plans so it's sort of like win now or lose with the new victory with a new defeat animation that was Jerusalem oh so yeah there was a city-state the Aztecs had conquered them and I liberated it but we were allies and they are just gone now so thankfully it wasn't one of my cities I guess but very close to taking up my whole art 8 there was a close call air I was dusting the ashes off of their uniforms so who was it that when you guys were developing this mode somebody like lost the game on turn 2 because you had there's an earlier iteration oh yeah all the time it used to be that the Comets were kind of like the other disasters they would just happen like at any point in the game and yeah like Carl something you and your team had some complaints about that yeah a little bit yeah we had somebody lose as early as turn two from their city getting wiped out by a comet because they were random we just had them in as random disasters and they could hit you that early so we were like it needs to be a little bit later and then it was like it may be a little bit later and then we decided to go into this actual apocalypse state once you hit that climate level 7 all right let's tie it to the very end game right yeah it worked out pretty well that way yeah and they can fall on your capital I mean they can hit any title they want any tile yeah there's no protected territory so this one looks like it was a one tile I don't think that there was a city here I think I had already wiped out the Brazil City had been right here I took it out with my Navy but yeah they can be one tile or they can be four tiles like that if either one or the other oh that's another oh wow that's just like the way that as I why she have not seen it go right into a city before her yeah that's like the way it was glinting off the sized skyscrapers is so sad okay well now the lake is bigger so are those tiles impossible forever can we you know top of it or no I think they are just impassable they are impassable that is just gone that's really great this is fine I'm sorry just cleaning through here I'm just training we're on Mars we just got to get to the EXO place yeah exactly I'm trying to get to the end there and to see what happens oh there's a unit here I think this is the Cusco capital of the Inca that I had just put some great people in okay Oh Karl make a stop I can't make it out there's literally no way to make it stop that's true yeah past the point of no return so yeah now that we're in no they weren't apocalypse mode this is just gonna keep happening it goes happen in the game everywhere the other single turn you know these will drop or another major disaster will will happen so do you win a domination victory if the other capitals get wiped out by viddy airstrikes and you have the last capital yet sure do yeah I mean it's a technicality but we allow it Last Man Standing victory I shoot that giant robot that minus one yeah good job barbarians oh they were all got one hitting up there bye-bye encampment well a suit again how's the meteor strike potentially it will not know so the meteors the the comet strike and the other disaster we haven't seen yet which is the solar flare those are sort of like you know space born disasters and so we don't allow the soothsayer to cost them the sue sayers kind of like more about the earthly like the you know the tamer you know but still dangerous floods forest fires volcanoes that sort of thing got a wreck that oh man it like have the population of that city-state yeah one things I really like about this too is as more of it as the comments are you really get some nice views of the really cool city part and the buildings all around the map you know you see this sort of thing when we do a natural wonder reveal or only do a world wonder being built up or when we do a space race but yeah it's just really cool especially the late game city sets to see all those in there you know fluorescent glory and also watch them get destroyed oh that's really cool let's go over and take a look at where that was yeah oh my god like two two strikes turn after turn you can see this unit has more movement but I cannot enter these tiles even though it's all water these are impassable I cannot go there up too much comet debris that's crazy yeah and what end what it'll just keep going so this would just keep going until we won the game or we made it to space or can you died because rocks dropped on our heads that that's how that would have gone yeah yeah yeah alright well that is mega-disasters from the Maya and Gran Colombia pack so today we showed you the Maya we showed you Gran Colombia we showed you what happens when rocks fall from space on your cities the Maya and Gran Colombia pack is available now it's $8.99 if you want to get the new frontiers pass that will get you both the Maya and the Gran Colombia pack as well as all of the paid DLC releases we'll have over the next year yeah and even if you don't get that we're going to have additional updates for the community through the course of the next year as well too and we'll be happy to talk about those there are a whole bunch of changes that went up for everyone today some balance changes some fixes you want to check out the patch notes on civilization calm or most the places where you can get the game
