slash polyphonic to start your free trial today the album is to music what the novel is to prose what the feature-length movie is to film it's the definitive medium for this form of artistic expression but it hasn't always been the album as we know it is a recent invention there's a lot of moments you can point to as the invention of the album but few cases are as strong as Frank Sinatra's 1955 ode to loneliness in the wee small hours that album carries with it an emotional depth and cohesion that was rarely seen in its day and its release helped solidify many of the norms that would come to define the way we think of albums today let's take a closer look in the early 1950s Frank Sinatra's career was rebounding from a serious slump the back half of the 40's saw him lose status as the biggest artists in the world as Sinatra fell to the wrong side of 30 in a young man's game but he persevered with his art signing a new deal with Capitol Records and teaming up with the conductor Nelson Riddle together that pair released two albums in 1954 songs for young lovers and swing easy the success of these albums launched Sinatra back into stardom but while his career was finding new life Sinatra's personal life was in shambles because of a failing relationship with Ava Gardner that relationship featured Affairs on both sides pregnancy scandal and a constant media spotlight it was all enough to drive Sinatra into a dark place so when it came time to put together his third album with Riddle Sinatra channeled this misery now up until this point most pop albums had mostly been collections of singles new songs alongside jazz standards designed to make their way into jukeboxes or onto the airwaves and Sinatra was as good as it gets at that but given his emotional state he wanted to do something more he didn't want his next album to be looked at as a collection of some nice songs Sinatra wanted people to take him seriously as he showed off a painful vulnerable side of himself and you couldn't do that with a collection of chart toppers you needed something more connected so Sinatra picked songs that worked around a theme broken love he took this collection of songs and placed them temporally to as the title suggests it's an album set in the wee small hours of the morning it's a special time before the Sun rises but long after midnight a time for lonely walks down dead-end streets a time of smoke and alcohol and a time for reflection our lives and loves past Frank Sinatra painted a scene around these liminal hours and in doing so he created one of the first concept albums while the concept is simple it's unavoidably present in every track the first song was the only new song on the album written by David Mann and Bob Hillier that duo wrote it during a late-night session and it was such a perfect fit for what Sinatra wanted to do with his 9th album that had between the title track [Music] both lyrically and musically Sinatra sets the scene for the album with that song riddles arrangements are slow and creepy and Sinatra's voice is deliberate and vulnerable that's the time when it comes to the rest of the album Nelson Riddle is just as important in creating the mood as Sinatra himself on the second track mood indigo he uses subtle string themes and a strained muted trumpet that makes the song feel like walking down a dark wet Street in the evening one of the album's highlights is I get along without you very well that Hoagy Carmichael song was a hit for rad norvo and his orchestra but Sinatra's version couldn't really be more different than norvos softer aims for and dripped from Lees than I recall it's important to realize Sinatra's persona when you listen to these songs most people saw him as a larger-than-life figure filled with energy and swagger but this this was a completely different side of Sinatra it was a pained human side of a broken man listen to the way he sings and can't we be friends this isn't an immortal man singing this is a broken man singing his heart out [Music] some reports even have Sinatra breaking down in tears after recording when your lover has gone and that is a heartbreaking song singing of the way the world loses color loses meaning when you end a relationship when your lover [Music] in the wee small hours gains momentum as it goes riddle arrangements become more pronounced Sinatra singing more desperate in what is this thing called love riddle paint Sinatra's musings with descending runs of strings [Music] just as the misery builds before the end of a relationship so does the album it's a perfect mimicry of a universal human emotion but Sinatra didn't just stop at the music when it came time to package and release in the wee small hours he wanted something that would match the emotion of the music most album artwork at this time was pretty simple take a picture of the artist put a colored background and put the title in big bold letters but in the wee small hours is a painting something that seems to be pulled from a film noir scene or a hard-boiled detective cover it uses a blue palette to accentuate the sadness of the songs within and paint Sinatra as a lonely man in the wee small hours of the morning the only part of the album that didn't fit with Sinatra's vision was its original printing when in the wee small hours was released it came out on 2 10-inch records 10 inches were the format for pop music and light our music but that's not how Sinatra wanted it to be released he wanted this record to be taken seriously so we wanted it to be released in the format that serious music at the time classical music was released on 12 inch records eventually the album's success convinced capital to release it as Frank wish a pop album on a 12-inch record by releasing it like that Sinatra started a trend that would take over and soon enough the concept of releasing an album on anything other than 12-inch seemed odd in form and function Sinatra created the album as we know it would you sit down and listen to in the wee small hours you're listening to an album that's unapologetically pop but still carries weight to it it's an artistic work where an icon lays himself bare so that you can experience his work in the way you watch a great film or read a great novel it's a coherent piece that showed the world a new side of Frank Sinatra and entirely change the way we listen to pop music Frank Sinatra is an incredible character in America's musical and cultural history while researching this video I you [Music]
