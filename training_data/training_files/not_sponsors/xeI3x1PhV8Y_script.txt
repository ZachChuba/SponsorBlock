the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft is a chaotic place a place where minecraft game mechanics are turned upside down when you have a no-rules environment players will do everything they can to gain an advantage over others this is why hacked client usage on the server has gone up since the server began 10 years ago when you think of players hacking in Minecraft you probably think of speed hacks or tracers killaura criticals but for to be two T players that's not enough they use every single tool at their disposal to get ahead and will go to extreme lengths just for a slight advantage this includes using hacks that to a normal player might seem useless but to a seasoned to b2t player are insanely useful hacks that fundamentally change the way minecraft can be played ranging from special combat hacks to rendering exploits to hacks that I can't even put into words today we are taking an in-depth look at some of the tools being used on to b2t that would be considered useless by the majority of the Minecraft community but our must-haves for seasoned Anarchy veterans let's begin whole ESP is a hack that highlights one block holes in the ground to a normal minecraft player this would seem absolutely useless but to to b2t players this hack can mean the difference between life and death what whole ESP is actually identifying our safe spots that will protect you from n crystal explosions one of the deadliest weapons utilized by PvP errs on anarchy servers you see in Minecraft a player's hitbox covers their entire body but the bottom half is more susceptible to explosion damage this means that a crystal will do full damage if you are standing on the same level as it if you move one block below where the crystal is placed it will eliminate almost all of the damage so to win at a crystal fight it's better to have the low ground than it is to have the high ground if you are being attacked near spawn hole ESP will show you safe places to stand so you can be in safety for a few moments to make a decision and calculate your next move there are three colors that signify how safe a spot is green means the hole is surrounded completely by bedrock making it the safest option yellow means that part of the hole is made with obsidian so while it's explosion-proof it can be mined out by other players exposing your lower hitbox to explosion damage red means the entire hole is made of obsidian including the block you are standing on making it the riskiest of the safe spots to use regardless any of these three options are safer than being out in the open where you'll get torn to shreds by crystals even having an extra five seconds of safety eliminates a lot of the stress that comes with crystal combat but be careful standing in a safe spot for too long we'll give your opponent's time to react or even trap you butthole ESP is an example of a simple hack that seems useless at first but makes a major difference in the right hands mob owner is a hack that does exactly what it says it allows you to see who the original owner of a tamed mob is why is this useful well this hack is incredible for to b2t base hunters and historians it's useful because even if there are no written signs at a particular base you can still find out who the base belongs to if there are tamed mobs nearby being able to see who an abandoned horse or donkey belongs to can leave a trail to a much bigger prize it has also led to some very interesting situations for example 3 years ago when I made my pilgrimage to the world border I spent a few weeks there travelling along the border via horseback I tamed several horses out there took the best one that was available and left the rest all of it was done off-camera so nobody could have known well a few months ago when to b2t player II pearl was streaming on Twitch and was exploring the world border region he stumbled upon a group of horses when this happened see these are teamed by Oh that is quite a find he had found the exact horses I had tamed from three years ago without the mob on her hack there would have been no way to discover that these had originally belonged to me just another example of how useful this hack is for bass hunters and historians this hack has helped unlock the secrets of many forgotten bases and places no assign render is a hack that makes all text on signs disappear it's client-side only so the text is still there you just can't see it this hack would seem to be the most useless one yet into a lot of players it actually is useless but for the people such as myself that make content on to be 2t or live streaming this hack is incredible allow me to explain six months ago I noticed that I was getting stream sniped far more often than usual meaning players would find my location while I was streaming and usually attempt to kill me after two streams in a row of being discovered I began researching how it was possible that I was being found so quickly well it turned out that the massive world download that had been taken of to be to T spawn region that extended 50,000 blocks out in all directions included sign data if I passed a sign on camera it was possible to enter that text and find the exact coordinates of the sign I had to make sure not to show signs on camera anymore if I was going to be in the spawn region and additionally while streaming there's always the chance that you stumble upon a sign that flat-out says the coordinates of your current location such as highway markers no sign render eliminates both of these problems making it far more difficult to be tracked after taking these precautions I have not been stream sniped on my main account during a live stream since proving just how useful this hack truly is we're only halfway through the list no pressure though no pressure anyway let's continue the story behind the anti weakness hack is unique - to b2t you see a while ago it was discovered that n crystals cannot be detonated by hand if a player is under the weakness status effect the reason for this is that weakness lowers the amount of damage you can do by two hearts crystals can only be destroyed by dealing at least half a heart of damage meaning that punching crystals with fists or items becomes useless anti weakness was invented as an addition to auto crystal if the hack detects that you're under the weakness effect it will automatically swap from crystals to a weapon so that you can still blow it up your overall damage per second will be lower but it's better than being defenseless this highly situational hack is just another part of the unorthodox arsenal of to b2t players anyone that explores the N dimension knows how annoying jokers can be especially giving players the levitation effect and causing them to rise up but on to BTT this status effect is actually a problem because it interferes with the server's anti-cheat plugins sometimes if you are under the effect for too long the server might think you are fly hacking and attempt to kick you if you don't have priority queue it means having to wait hours just to log back in only to be potentially kicked out again the anti levitation will make it so that you remain on the same y level when you are hit with the status effect allowing you to avoid the anti cheat kick another example of a subtle hack that to BTT players use in a very specific situation the final hack in today's list is probably the most bizarre to the casual observer chest aura will cause you to briefly open and close any chest that you come close to and also works on shelters and other storage devices now why on earth is this useful well it's useful for stopping anyone using an illegal weapon such as a 32k sharpness sword you see for the longest time on the server illegal weapons could only be swung by keeping them in a shocker or hopper nearby I'm not going to explain the technical details but essentially any illegal weapons inside became reverted back to normal if their container was opened by hand due to an anti cheap plug-in so if someone put down a shulker to try and kill you with a 32 k you could use chest or to open it and cause the weapons inside to become useless it became the best defense against anyone attempting to kill you with one of these when you least expected it a seemingly useless hack that saved many people on the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft and this list today is just an example of some of the seemingly useless hacks that are actually insane when used properly the overall goal of them is to keep players safe and
