hey what's up guys this is Braveheart and welcome back to my channel or if you are new here welcome for the first time today I'm gonna be reacting to twice as a brand new music video more and more and I'm so excited to check this out but including an extended version of this said I got my caffeine got my k-pop k-pop let's go okay you guys I know we're just like a couple seconds in but I just want to say the vibes the colors the music the vocals this music video is going to captivate me I know I'm setting my expectations really high but this is twice so if they haven't failed me yet anyway just one put that out there so pretty so vocally I want to dive in kind of right away just because I really want to point out how beautiful that vocal line was done by Minah she's really bringing in that element of like breath and kind of doing this sort of speech level singing that I really really love because it just feels so natural and it just sort of draws you in and it's so soothing so I'm just really taken by those first few lines especially performed by Minah all right let's go I like how nyan is just sort of like sitting casually in this whole group of leopards like no big deal something that I really particularly love about twice and I can't remember if I've said this in other twice reaction videos I feel like I have but I'll say it again I really really like how they always add in these really really pretty sound scapes with all like the background vocals cuz their voices sound so pretty individually but when I hear them all together the voices just become even more beautiful so love those little like background vocals a sprinklin I totally forgot that I have my coffee here don't mind me I'm just gonna get caffeinated okay you guys seriously this is gonna be one of those songs it's gonna be one of those songs isn't it it's one of those days where you hear twice long and you end up singing it pretty much the rest of the night the next day the next day the next day that is such a singable hook I feel like you can't listen to the song and then not get that stuck in your head let's keep going oh that is so cool I love that seriously love that musical breakdown that was such a cool twist on where I thought the course was heading because I thought it was just gonna be the repetitive more more which as you know I already loved but then adding in those chopped up vocals and kind of like switching up the musical arrangement right there like it just kind of sends this song into like hyperdrive yeah really really cool so I really love the juxtaposition of this like very chancy fun dancey chorus with these more open ethereal feeling melody lines in the verses and also I really really get to hear a lot of their vocal texture and kind of compare and contrast between them when they do these solo verse lines it definitely like shines a light on each girl these are so pretty you got so much vocal goodness happening like all of those vocal layers it just it's so pretty when you hear it all together especially when she sings that little riff trill thing because the harmony melody is perfectly synced up with it it's just such a beautiful marrying of sound like it just makes me so happy anyway let's get back into it okay seriously one thing that I needed like mention that I realize I haven't tapped on yet I just have to say something about this whole aesthetic like visually with this twice review I'm a lot more honed in on the vocals just because I feel like this song really kind of sets the stage to really like dissect vocals but they are definitely not lacking in the visual Department every single seam that they've put into this video is so ornately decorated and it just creates such a like fantastical fairytale dreamy kind of world that you get to like live in for a moment when you watch this video so my assessment so far vocals are amazing visuals are amazing twice is amazing what can I say all right let's go oh my gosh that was such an unexpected sort of like belt that they just threw in right there I mean I need to know who saying that I don't think they even revealed the face I think that was when we were looking at that really pretty unicorn scene so if you guys know who sang that amazing belt note please please please leave that down the comments let me know who that was because that was a full-on powerhouse vocal that I was not expecting all right moves are so cute like what is that dance way you hold on I have to go back and see that again yeah definitely don't think I can pull it off the way that you can so as much as I love this hook I feel like we kind of know where they're going vocally here so I'm gonna skip ahead and get over to the bridge or break down or whatever they have going on over there cuz I really really want to see how they kind of change things up which I know they're gonna do so let's go oh my gosh I love this okay you know what I'm really loving about this rap it still totally fits within like the overall tone of the song they're not going really hard or doing like a really edgy sort of wrapping stuff even tonally it's like a little bit on the softer side with like the way they're phrasing each words I think it's a really cool take on a rap breakdown that complements what's already going on in the song so really into that okay let's get going okay again what who use my words hold on okay was that the same person that sang the last bell or was that another girl if you know who's singing these parts it is your duty to let us all know down the comments we all need to know please keep going you cure those those background vocals oh my gosh that was really pretty so extended version of this video and and yeah I will see you guys next time bye
