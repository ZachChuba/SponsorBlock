Waking up early liberates you from a huge
amount of stress. Having an extra hour in the morning before
your usual routine gives space for practical or relaxing activities that you wouldn't find
the time to do otherwise. Many people use their morning routine to tackle
a personal project; others focus on organising and preparing for the rest of the day and
others just focus on exercising, meditating or doing other type of physical activity. Whatever you do in the morning is up to you
but rule number 1 is being consistent **[ 1) be consistent].** Personally, I like to wake
up at the same time every day, even during weekends. If I am extra tired on a Saturday, I give
myself the pleasure of one more hour in bed, which means getting up at 7 am, max. The good thing about consistency is that it
slowly builds up the habit, making your body and mind less and less prone to create resistance
to your alarm clock. , Your brain forms connections based on what
you do repeatedly in your life. Repeated mental states, behaviours and responses
become neural traits, which eventually decreases the resistance you feel from your body and
your mind when you are trying to incorporate a new habit - this is called neuroplasticity. As you strengthen your newly found habit of
waking up at the same time, the behaviour will require less effort and it will be easier
to do it on a regular basis. And speaking about alarm clocks, finding the
perfect sound and distance **[ 2) pick a good alarm sound]** from your bed is key to waking
up energised every morning. I'm really not into classic alarm sounds and
rather prefer soothing music that builds up as I ignore the alarm; I put my phone out
of hands reach, on top of a dresser so I have to stand to turn it off. I'm no longer feeling like going back to bed
by that time. Waking up early becomes more manageable as
you enjoy your morning routine [**3) create an enjoyable morning routine]**. A well-balanced and relaxed morning routine
will give you enough motivation to get up in the morning; a stressing and chaotic routine
will create more resistance. Creating a morning routine that is both practical,
efficient as well as relaxing can have a detrimental impact in your day. My rule of thumb is to spend half the time
of my morning routine in practical morning tasks like having breakfast, showering or
doing my hair, twenty five percent doing household chores like cleaning the dishes, watering
the plants and making the bed; and the other twenty five perfect doing something entertaining,
like reading or journaling. For me, in a two hour morning routine this
would look like one hour dedicated to practical morning tasks, half an hour for cleaning and
organising and a second half an hour of reading or watching Netflix. But I will tell you more about my morning
routine in a video going up in a couple of weeks. Another thing that will make waking up easier
because it enhances your morning routine is preparing everything the night before **[4)
prepare everything the night before]**. Picking an outfit, preparing the cutlery and
containers to pack your lunch or setting the table for breakfast are all activities that
create a solid transition between your night-time routine and your routine in the following
morning. The more mechanical these activities and routines
are, the better; a steady workflow of minor tasks can lead up to to less resistance from
your brain and strengthens your habit of waking up early. For a special boost of motivation, you can
also challenge yourself [**5) challenge yourself**] to complete a project or a deadline during
your morning routine. If you ever wanted to start a blog, create
a journal, knit a scarf featuring your Hogwarts' house colors or just become a runner, you
can use your morning time to do it in incremental bursts of productivity that you can spread
out over a longer period of time. Instead of feeling like you're waking up to
go to school or go to work, you change your mindset by stating and acting upon the idea
that you're now waking up to take care of your special new hobby. As a final note, I have to remind you that
waking up early is not for everyone; and if you're a night owl, you definitely shouldn't
feel the urge to wake up early because someone tells you to (unless it's school or your boss,
and in that case there's nothing you can do). I actually ranted about the "I wake up at
5 am" a LOT in one of my videos so never feel the pressure to be productive at a schedule
that your brain is not naturally inclined to use to be productive. I hope you've enjoyed today's video and I
will see you next week. Bye guys!
