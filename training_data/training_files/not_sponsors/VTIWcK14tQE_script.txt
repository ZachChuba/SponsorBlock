hey guys backyard scientist here today we're gonna take a look at this an induction heater and it uses powerful magnetic currents to melt metal it's actually pretty simple and let's do a quick overview about how it works an induction heater works by sending a large electric current through the coil back and forth back and forth creating a rapidly changing magnetic field the rapidly changing magnetic field makes the electrons in the metal move back and forth really fast and that's what heats up the metal this is a circuitry that drives the coil that does a sandhill crane this isn't this is the circuitry that's used in the coil it's actually the same circuit that's the one you can buy on Amazon I just made my own and modified it so I could water cool everything I even modified the capacitors by exposing the raw terminals so they could be cooled more efficiently I mentioned the heaters water cooled so I also needed a pump a radiator and fans in order to power everything I'm using a 3000 watt server power supply that is a lot of power now I can melt copper brass aluminum and even steel [Music] molten steel does this really cool thing when you throw it on the ground and it kind of explodes and splatters and a bunch of little sparks like that the sparks are pretty much harmless and they're not gonna really hurt you if they hit you but you still don't want to get hit by the big globs of it and yes I sprayed down all of the leaves to make sure I didn't start any fires I posted a picture of the induction heater to my Instagram and a lot of you had some really great ideas and then some of you had some never mind anyway what we're gonna try now is some viewer suggestion ideas that you want to see me trying the induction heater let's get started well I know a lot of you are curious to find out what would happen if I stuck my fingers in here so let's try that out first alright here we go wait a minute I'm not that stupid I've got a ring on and if I stick my finger in there my ring might melt onto my finger so yeah if you put your finger inside the induction coil you wouldn't feel a thing and it wouldn't burn you but what if you were wearing a ring so we're going to try a silver and a gold ring on this wiener and see what happens to the hot dog three two one Oh sizzling right away oh wow so what it looks like to me is the gold conducts heat a lot better than the silver ring does yikes I would not want to wear a gold ring around an induction cooker so it wasn't really anticipating this video having any marital advice in it but yeah if you want to your marriage is failing just stick that ring in the induction cooker sear it on to your hand and you can never get it off again that's I guess might solve the problem I saw some other comments asking what would happen if you put a lithium battery in there so we're going to be trying just a simple double a lithium battery right in there let's see what happens [Music] whoa that actually exploded that was awesome power supply did not like that okay I shouldn't breed this let's let's check out the high-speed well I know they tell you not to dispose of lithium batteries with fire but that is just too much fun so we're gonna do that again what that that's really fun you can see the red flame of the lithium now you can't South gone oh wait now it's back see that red flame oh wow wow it's like molten Lippe metal coming out of there you see that whoa now we're talking that is awesome oh god no way okay that is way cooler than the last one I'm so glad we did that again well you know now we've got to try some regular rechargeable lithium batteries for science you know all right let's try it whoa okay so instead of that we're just gonna drop it we're just going to drop it right in nope nope no fire just a bunch of bad smoke oh no come on I kind of like this whole fire theme that's going on right now so let's try some lighters this time oh yeah well now I know the GoPro whoa Oh shadow gosh what turn off turn up oh poor GoPro is always so so good thing this has water cooling running through it or else everything would probably be overheated I can't wait to see the high-speed of that the next one might get a little bit messy so we're going to put a shield over all the sensitive electronic bits and put a can of shaving cream right in the center and let's see what happens this is gonna be I'm gonna hide if I hide behind here I can't get in my shrapnel whoa oh my gosh it's snowing it was snowing in Florida some people wanted to see if the light bulb would light up so let's try it No not lighting up actually what about on this end no it's on fire out of all the things to catch on fire a light bulb really next we're going to try to blow up this watermelon somebody on my Instagram challenged me to blow up a watermelon with an induction heater and at first I didn't know how to do it I think I have the solution now we're going to take a bullet like this and put it inside the watermelon and hopefully it'll blow up let's try it here we go it worked let's check out the slow-mo that did not it wasn't as loud as I thought I was like freaking out like I was scared let's see if we can find any remains inside of this watermelon haha here was check it out if you're wondering why there's black tape on it it's because I put electrical tape on it or else the watermelon would cool it off too much from being in contact with the grass but that worked and that flowed up so there is your exploded watermelon wonderful if we can find the bullet Oh yep there we go this is the bullet I know some people were probably worried the bolt was gonna shoot off and the bullet is gonna go up into the sky and come down and kill somebody but no way that is not gonna happen you did that was gonna be super loud and it's going to shoot sure I thought it was gonna be louder - but it wasn't loud I think the watermelon did most of the is a silencer oh no well I don't know about you guys but I am tired I'm ready to take a break so why don't we try cracking open this drink yes let's try this whoa hey it worked that's awesome why don't we take a break from the experiments and charge up the batteries for a handheld version way down buy my merch and now let's move on to the wireless induction cooker for the handheld version I used a commercially available induction heater board and for that I needed some powerful batteries which were provided by the makers of the Jen's and tatu batteries so why would you need a handheld induction heater well what if you lost the key to a lock and you needed to melt it off let's try it out so first pump on and the next we just turn this on there's a lot of no it's melting watch this I think when I take this away just gonna fall not quite nice there we go oh the fence is on fire alright so it's not even too hot because this one doesn't have a radiator in it so it can't really get rid of too much extra heat but so far so good it didn't melt the lipo's didn't catch on fire it did recording so you needed to do some acts of espionage or some other kind of spy stuff and you needed to destroy a computer or wipe the hard drive this computer doesn't have a hard drive but let's say it did let's see what this induction heater would do - it takes to take - that was that was just the pump not to turn it on yes I got to turn it on I would be a bad spy here we go on oh it's oh wow that was fast what about down here where all the juicy bits are actually let's destroy the screen first and then oh do you see Casey right through there I suppose good whoa are you getting that are you getting that yeah oh that's a good spot see how up ten smells good not gonna lie if you ever had a cap gun as a kid that's what it smells like now let's see oh yeah I killed it oh it's like red hot what is that oh god that might be the battery okay I would step her back a little bit they pop the breaker they pop to the breaker that's awesome it worked alright guys that's the end of this video I hope you enjoyed this video and the induction cooker and thank you for all your suggestions on Instagram I had a lot of fun trying them out if you have anything else you want to try you let me know down in the comments and I'll try it for you we'll see thanks for watching see you guys next time bye
