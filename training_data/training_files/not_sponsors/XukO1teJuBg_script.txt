it's so close that curb please just go further left look at that that is absolutely stunning and we've got someone walking across the road incredibly slowly there's no way it's doing this corner no wow welcome back everybody to attend to driver and welcome to another auto pilot city tour today we are going to Plymouth and we're going to be as you can see Britain's Ocean City is what it's called and we're going to be going down all the way to the water and basically going down to the seaside and see what it's like so we're coming off on this one we can be in either of the first two lanes actually so maybe that's why he's in that lane and we'll see how it deals with this coming off here I'm not sure if it's gonna go left and take that left lane or if it's gonna stick in this one it's good it's stuck in this lane and we're going to continue down I do actually need to get into that left lane though because we're going to be coming off at the end so the cars slowing itself down so here it does slow itself down all the way to the end but it does do it a little bit early sometimes and like this feels a little bit unnatural going down to 50 already the van behind me is really really close behind me because he's not expecting me to go this slow down here but we'll bring it all the way down now because it looks like we're going to be coming into a complete stop which lanes are going to pick its picked the right hand city lane which is fine and we will go up to here so obviously yeah it probably would be able to do this if this would have been green for us because it is land all the way all the way down and across for these lights you'll see it's not actually showing it changing lights and I think that's because it's not using like the wide angle or any other side whoa that was actually swapping lanes there and going into that left lane which we really didn't want it to do yeah it needs to use I think the other cameras and maybe the wide-angle camera so that you can see all of those at the moment it's just using one forward-facing camera and sadly it's not picking up all of the lights when they change color and whatnot so here's like a three lane carriageway it's a 40 going through again speed cameras here on the road it would be nice if the the Tesla showed us it knew where speed cameras were I think that'd be pretty cool I think we're just get yeah we're just sitting in this in this second lane I'm just gonna get this at Nova and here we go so this Plymouth I think might be quite nice and easy one to drive into I've driven into it before and it is very much like this down to the center and down to the water so hopefully we should have a good run all the way down and it should be quite a nice Drive and we'll see what we can pick up you can see it's picking up all the arrows it's picking up the pylons as well on the side of the road but picking up all of the arrows really nicely is it going to show the cyclist over there on the screen no didn't show the cyclist but it is showing those bollards as COEs on the screen at the moment I was intrigued to see if it was going to react to that van at all that was pulling to our left there but no no problems and now I'm always nervous about big curbs on the left with no lines because we know what happened in Oxford I really don't want that to happen again so again we've got speed camera lines on the road here and there's speed camera over there so be good if it told us there were speed cameras and this is definitely one of the nicer drives that I've done on autopilot in a city so the city is in the UK if you didn't know every city is defined by having a Cathedral we're actually going to drive right past the Cathedral here in Plymouth which is closer down to the water again I've only come to these cities a couple of times and that's only because of football and it's only because I've supports Swindon so I don't get to go to the best cities we go we go to smaller cities so it looks like this left lane here isn't the lane I need to be in at the end of the road it looks like they go to two separate ways you can see there on the on the board but this is saying the left lanes fine for now again another speed camera here I was what I was worried that these lines might actually confuse the system a bit but they're not worrying them at all they're not changing them at all at the moment Wow we've had this van pull out on us and the cars braking nicely again it had to do a heartbreak there but it did that really really well and this is actually taking us off to the left here so I do want to go into the right lane I wonder if this guy let me across yeah I think he's letting me across okay right into a 30 now oops into a 30 and we're gonna just gonna follow this guy he was taking us really slowly cyclists there on the left did it pick him up it showed him as a walking person oh my god this fans going really slow like really really slow but this is good for us because we actually do need to go slow down these roads so thankfully we've got this potentially questionable driver in front of us okay through a tunnel no problems before it may have lurched in tunnels as well but now there's no problems at all again following this guy nicely I'm gonna indicate go into that left lane it's not gonna move me over myself so sadly I'm gonna have to move the car over again that's because because there's no central because there's no central divider the car itself won't indicate indicate across if there was like a central divider in there then it would actually indicate us into the other lane again hopefully that's something that soon in a later update there will be changing or removing or just making it possible for us to actually change lanes even when we can because on the on the on the maps and everything it should say let's cut this guy on the right is like swerving close to me but just watching me film it's actually you know the maps know that this is a two-lane road for us so hopefully you all sort that how soon you can see coming up here we've actually got a really tight corner intrigued to see if the car slows down or does anything different for it it shouldn't do it should be fine for it but we have also got a cyclist in front so let's see how the car the cars picked him up there and I'll have to go all the way around him and we'll go back into our city center line and I'll wait we're coming up to a roundabout here which the car is gonna give a go at yes car look at that well done it actually did it it completed it really nicely a little bit a little bit too far so it did the like braking and put your hands on the wheel warning but it actually did complete it really nicely and this Lane is yeah this lanes the correct lane to go in it's just straight forwards and this will bring us down as well behind this Peugeot to a stop which will be really nice and I hope I hope this is the right lane to be in I think it is the right lane to be in again here you can see that it's picking up all the lights nicely but even that one there it can't see or I can't see it now actually because of the van let's see is it picking up the arrows it is it is it is picking up the arrows inside the light as well which is really cool or I got really close there and I don't know where this Lane kind of go so I'm literally just following this Persia at this point okay we need to actually get across here to the right-hand Lane is the car gonna push us across no the car didn't push us across I think maybe because it was a dotted line the car wasn't liking it so it wouldn't actually push us push us across look at that that is absolutely stunning wow that is so amazing I don't know what the building behind it is but that looks incredible okay so as these cars have come out our lane the Tesla actually wants to go forward and sit in front of them which isn't good because we do actually want to be in that left lane so I might have to do a lap of this roundabout I think but look at how incredible that is that's actually a shell that is actually a shell of a church maybe that's the Cathedral I don't know I don't quite know where the Cathedral exactly isn't everything but it looks pretty impressive I've got to say okay I'm gonna go left down here and continue the way we need it to go and I think it's yeah it's gonna be left and then left down here so again on these roads it's not doing roundabouts it's not doing things like that so I'm gonna have to control it for it if we're lucky if this is a lane roundabout and there's no one coming we can give it a go yeah there's no one gone oh it was taking it too close too the left and then I felt like it was gonna curb okay where are we going now Wow all right this is interesting this is interesting okay now it wants me to go right down this way again if it could show zebra crossings that would be quite nice and these here are actually electric parking or no they're not sorry I thought that was electric charging but it's just a electric van parked there damn it I actually thought that was an electric charging Bay it's not here we go back in I'm gonna bring this all the way down to 15 for this bit of road it's pretty horrible but yeah the car did it nicely oh you know that again that just I really think that would have just gone into the bollard there like it just doesn't feel like it's slowing down at all or at least it definitely doesn't feel like it's slowing down early enough okay put it back on sorry there's a lot of junctions and a lot of turnings and stuff that we're having to take so I'm having to turn autopilot off and on just like constantly and you're picking up people as well walking which is really good nice to see and again sadly here we're gonna have to go around these cars even though they are in Park bays and everything the car of course isn't gonna work its way around that just yet wow this is really nice this is a really nice light area lovely greenery and stuff and up here are no again sadly we're not going to be able to get auto pilot to work here because of the cars parked on the side of the road it's simply not going to go around them and then that's going to cause us lots of issues ok I'm going left this way oh my god this is so confusing and autopilot will work but I'll just wait for this corner before I turn it on because that was a pretty harsh corner for it here we go ok autopilot back on and there we go we are at the city jeepers that was so close I don't know where jeepers come from I think I've watched scooby-doo recently zoinks yeah that was really close again going into that car this is a really nice drive down I don't know where this go so we're just actually this does a little lap so let's let it let's let it just do the lap while I put in my next destination oh no that's not where I'm going I'll go back to Exeter okay we've got an interesting area coming up here is it gonna work its way around it no just just too tight again it's just getting so tight on them and I just don't trust it to not curb the car after what happened last time ok did this really nice it's doing this nicely oh no going a little bit into the pavement here no don't take the left lane oh gosh no that wasn't the best was it this is actually a really interesting route for it though because it's like goes all the way around so speed bumps I would love it to be able to slow down for like this oh it's a little bit harsh there we go and then we kind of have to do it ourselves and it just doesn't feel that great maybe if I do this at 10 that'll be alright for the speed bumps I love this I love the red road like the red side of the road you can see actually it's all I can put a line there for it or up and over again oh wow this is really taking it yeah there we go see again it's picking up that as a diamond we have that in the last episode where it thought loads of things were diamonds all these are big old speed bumps what a beautiful drive through everyone what a beautiful drive this is and these cars are parked in the bays but the car doesn't seem to think it okay it kind of does yeah it's ok with it now it's going past it now so it means almost to confirm that they are in bays before it will go past it this is called ho Road so shout out to everyone here or that's such a big like they are such big stops okay right I don't know where this way goes so I'm just gonna look around there's no one here I'm gonna let the car decide where it wants to go what it wants to do it wants to continue down this way okay I'm up with that this looks pretty cool to me and again this is all in one way it's getting so close to the right here it's so close to that curb please just go further left nope Oh again it's not quite reading that like that curb as a line it did show it as a line but it wasn't quite reading it nice enough for me yeah it's doing all braking hard there because that van on our left this is a real real test for it okay go and really tight here hopefully it reads this correctly why does it do that it goes so close to the edge like it can clearly see surely you can clearly see everything around it why is it getting so close so I'm gonna bring him down to 10 miles an hour so it has oh my god okay it breaks so hard there and actually did it nice it actually did it well because it breaks so hard initially so again going really slow here 10 miles an hour it's not sure about the van it was trying to work its way around the van and then this is gonna be really interesting as well coming up whether it's actually going to go around it or it's gonna sit behind know it is going around it and we got some cones perfect we've got some codes that should guide us nicely yeah the cones guiding us around at 10 miles an hour and then I'll just do this at 10 miles an hour then I'll start to pick it up a little bit don't worry there's only like 50 cars behind me I'm joking there's no there's no one by me okay really tight but nice and easy should be able to do it should be able to do it note there is not a chance that was going to curb my alloy okay so we're now back onto just a normal road as normal as they kind of get in these city areas you know again it's it is a two-way street but with no central line so the car's not happy it's not picking it up as a road then it will autopilot on which is fine and it is slowing us down for all the parked cars around us which is a good thing so at least it's saying that it can obviously see the cars and everything but it doesn't want to take us around any of the cars and it won't autopilot or actual autopilot down the middle of the roads but I'm pretty sure I know this is a one-way actually so if we can get it to work then that's ok but or braking really hard and that was for that microd just there so that started - that slammed on there for that micro again I'm hoping it pick like all the bins it's picking up doing an absolute incredible job of picking up bins all right worked for a split second and then turned off again we've got someone on the roads and is it gonna see her it did pick her up for a second yeah there you go it is showing how there so it did see the lady jogging which is good and we'll take this left road back onto kind of more more normal roads I guess yeah so here we go all over a bag so I'll see it's no problems just kind of going over bags and stuff I'm gonna keep it down at 15 miles an hour just while we go over these speed bumps it's not quite central to the seats to the speed bumps so we are going up them slightly which is quite a hard quite a hard speed bump to go up but it's okay let's do it it's doing nicely I'm hoping here it will hug the right because it will see that line in the middle and it will go very central no it went right in the middle of the - ok let's bring up to 20 now there's no way it's doing this corner no wow that was actually not only was that not doing the corner because it couldn't turn that far it was actually following the road in front of it and taking us up that other road which would have been would have been pretty bad so we've got a human and a dog Oh in front is it going to pick up the human again it's not turning tight enough for the corner it needs to turn that little bit tighter for some of the corners here they aren't pretty crazy torn corners I must say but this is obviously what the cars got to deal with again picking up a human really nicely they're picking up a person show the the jogger but again it didn't necessarily need to and which lanes are gonna pick here we need the left lane and it's picking the right lane yeah it's picking the right lane so I'm just gonna have to take it over and go to the left lane myself and I don't know quite how we get out of here so I'm just going to follow it down okay another roundabout and straight over there and then we can put autopilot back on quite confusing roads I've got to say and you can see that lots of the lines I kind of have disappeared or have you know worn at worn down over time and again here there's not there's no lights that the car can see there is a light actually just over there but there's no lights that the car can see and read to tell the car to go forward so again I'm intrigued in this kind of scenario how is it going to react in the future and how is it going to know whether it can actually go or not on those kind of areas okay also pile it back on to this 30 and then these are gonna be the roads back out now of Plymouth and we've got someone walking across the road incredibly slowly like it's stopped it stopped so nicely for that person but I mean I would have just slammed my horn I was thinking about it but he was already gone by that point you saw it said stop on the side of the road there even though it says bus lane the car puts stopped for some reason which is pretty cool actually it's not pretty cool because it's wrong but it's interesting that any kind of text it thinks it sees it just puts it down as stop looks like we're going to be coming to some wide areas here some wide lamed areas the card dealt nicely with that and actually in fact we need to get into this left lane to go left here so I will just do that actually could have also piloted this bit that's a shame I didn't realize that was potentially autopilot sort of autopilot or a bull autopilot edible nicely around that corner really nice considering how tight that corner was that did that really nicely so we've got a central parting here I wonder if it will let us change lanes on this road I'm not a hundred percent sure if it will do we're coming up to around about so I need to be in this Lane anyway go bring it down for the roundabout we've got something behind us so sadly I can't let it attempt this would have been an interesting one though because it is again lanes actually I might just go a little bit slower and just let this car behind me let's see if he wants to overtake me just so if we get to one of those areas again I can give it a whirl so bring it down to 25 so yeah again it's just the being able to change lanes like on any road would just be huge it would have just allowed that little bit more freedom again to get into the lanes that we need to get into it's just such a it's such a strange thing in my opinion for them to take away and to limit on because it didn't use to limit they didn't use to limit it on us before I'm not sure why but this car on my side is refusing to overtake he's just watching I've noticed this a lot a lot of people watch me self-drive around now there we go there we go okay right so we're going to come up behind the cyclist I'm gonna let the car slow itself down and control what it wants to do behind this cyclist here he's not exactly going slow and you can see that it just pulls up behind him nicely and they try and change lanes sadly it's not changing lanes even though this is a central it's got a central divider down the middle it didn't want to change lanes and overtake him so we've got to do out that ourselves and then we'll come back into our lane one thing I'd love to see actually is the cyclists behind me like if the back camera picks him up when he cycles behind us so he is coming this way oh no he's turned off he's turkeys turning off behind us I'm just intrigued to see if it shows him at all going backwards that way there's the car he was just in front of that car back there so no it's not it's not gonna show him that had been pretty cool actually if it was showed him like going off on the side as well slightly strange lanes here it might switch the lanes for us it's not sure about it it's not sure it's it's stuck to the correct lane but it did meander over to the other lane for a split second when it wasn't too sure I think that's the thing when it doesn't know what it needs to do I don't like it when it kind of goes like sporadic and goes left right left right when you're driving you don't know what to do you keep the car nice and straight you keep it like you know what you think oh that's where I use that's where I've been to the football stadium over there okay I didn't realize we were driving right past it yeah I wish it kind of just kind of kept it smooth and straight rather than like darting around and trying to figure something out following this van nicely though again picking up all the lights all the cones is it gonna pick this person up no I'm not showing the people on the pavements I've got to say this is probably the most challenging city yet with that kind of seafront area that was really challenging however I've got to say it's also really impressed me with how it's done considering it's not meant to do any of these roads yet I think it's done really well and it's yeah it's it's impressed me a lot so will coming off in half a mile now oh it's a bit tight but it's done it nicely coming off in half a mile and we will do a tiny bit of the navigate on autopilot as we come on to the motorway here and that was Plymouth everybody a really nice place actually a lot bigger than I remember as well see like here again I would totally use the overtake feature if it would allow me to and we could have gone around this van but sadly not spin this around see yeah look at speaking up the cars behind us as they come to us so we've got another cyclist now in front of us that the car is picking up yeah he has picked them up in the cyclist is regulating our speed I don't really have to like go around him here because obviously the bike lane appears so the car's gone around that nicely and we're just sitting now behind this van in this lane so I actually did really well and it worked out well the saree worked out well the cycle lane appeared yeah good job the car they're pushing us into the right-hand lane which is correct picking up the cyclist as well nicely which is goods there's a lot for the car to read here I'm a little bit worried there no good job I was a little bit worried because I couldn't see the lines and I thought the car might switch lane but it didn't switch Lane and it stayed in its correct lane and now we've got cyclist motorbikes vans cars arrows there's so much happening right now on the screen and again this cyclist here it's got to come out of the bike lane because of the bus the car reacted nicely to it and now as we go around he's it's overtaking them nicely it's not worried about them because they are in their bike lanes it didn't show her until very very late interestingly enough as my favorite saying apparently is into actually I say it so much now I think about it I say interestingly enough so so much so it didn't pull us off by itself there we did have to do that pull off by ourselves and again we're coming up to a big roundabout and then we're going to be able to turn on navigate on autopilot so the car slowing down nicely and again I think it might be slowing down because of the van on the right but it definitely won't stop at the end of the road so we're gonna have to take full control of it here all right autopilot on we're going down now so this isn't a motorway this is the a38 but it is navigate on autopilot worthy and let's just see how well it does confirm lane change to follow routes confirm that lane change for the car set it to 70 and there we go it's pulled on to the 838 really really nicely and we are now on our way out of Plymouth and a way across so there we are let me know what you think how well did that do did it beat expectations I think it did well on some areas and some areas it didn't do well at all it's the same kind of hit and miss scenario I'll give that one a 7 out of 10 but I like the roads and I liked the the tightness of the sea area I definitely will be coming back down here to test that out once we get a later update and maybe once we get the city update or they can update that's a lot more confident in the city this is going to be a really good one to test it off so daily and you want to support me make sure to become a patreon it does all wow that that actually felt like the car was trying to go down there for a split second but it corrected itself whilst last minute let's try a lane change really nice picking up lots of pillars in the middle of the road there as well which look pretty cool yeah doing nicely thank you all for watching don't forget drive safe
