You're watching Weeekly's first
album cover shooting! Let's go right away! There's gravity over here
as well as over there This set expresses
the twist in time and space (Billie Jean is playing from somewhere)
It's something new that I've never tried before So it was really hard (Billie Shin appears) But everyone complimented me (Jiyoon was happy) [Soeun] The door... is on the ceiling It's upside down I'm doing a side plank right now Contract your core muscles (Shin_Jiyoon's_Specialty_Push-ups.mp4)
Aren't I good at push-ups? One million and twenty-one! (First_group_pic_in_space.mp4) (Another_group_pic_with_the_planets.mp4) Thank you for your hard work Thank you! I still can't believe that this was the cover shoot for our debut album But it was a very fun
and special experience It was great (Applause) We did the shooting inside a room
where gravity and time and space were all tangled together It was very unique and fun And it was also a great opportunity
to exercise our muscles I really hope you'll look forward to Weeekly's pretty album and photos We were Weeekly! Thank you!
