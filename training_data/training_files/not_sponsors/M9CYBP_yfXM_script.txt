coming up the bad guys have your password should you panic we'll talk about blackmail well black email next on ask the tech guy this is Troy's ask the tech guys brought lastpass.com slash twit to learn more [Music] [Applause] ruchi writes I've been listening to you for a few years now enjoy the shows immensely thank you now to the question just today I got a strange email it said one of my accounts had been hacked via my browser and gave me the password what spooked me was the password was right however I hadn't logged into that site for months also the activity they were blackmailing accusing me of was not true of course they want a payment in Bitcoin and threaten me if I ignored the email which I will I deleted the account from that website instead of just changing the password I also sent the website an email telling him their database may have been hacked should I be concerned if the password had been incorrect I wouldn't have been what should I do to make sure the rest of my logins are safe sincerely Ruchi Ruchi I've got that email many people listening have got that email it's a very widespread blackmail attack and here's the good news pretty much there's nothing to worry about so here's what's going on in fact Brian Krebs has written about this and his Krebbs on security blog he has a copy of the email that's exactly the same as I got it had my password an old password I thought it was a little suspicious in the subject line that sure got my attention we know your password is it this I've gotten it twice with two different passwords remember there have been a lot of password breaches a lot of them in fact if you go to Troy hunts incredible have I been on calm have I been pwn IDI calm you can enter in your email address and see if anybody has it and has passwords associated with that email address in fact it has a very nice feature it's a kind of buried on the site but click the passwords tab and you can actually enter in that password it's safe to do that by the way he's using some very smart techniques to keep him from getting that password but you can enter it in its process by JavaScript on the site on your browser and then the hash is passed to the site and they say yeah this password has been breached I guarantee you the password and that email was in a breach that's how they got it so the these passwords these breaches go out there put out on the web people buy them and then they create these blackmail passwords blackmail emails a mindset I know your password it's this I used it to get into your computer I recorded you visiting a porn site yes I have a video of the porn site and a video of you watching the porn and I'm gonna give that video to all of your friends unless you send me Bitcoin and if you don't know what Bitcoin is it had a link for how to find out what bitcoin is how to buy it and how to send it to me I completely ignored it first thing to do go - have I been pwned calm you'll find yes that password is out there even if you're the only one who ever used that here's there's a couple of things to worry about and this is really good advice in general for password security do not reuse passwords so it's not a big deal if that passwords out there if you know you use it on one site in particular just go change it on that site do that as quickly as possible it's a bigger deal if you happen to use that password as by the way these were old passwords for me and I haven't used them on many sites now you have to go to each site you use that password on and change it because the bad guys do have that password and one of the first things they do when they buy a giant trove of passwords is they go out and try it on all the sites not just that one site that was breached but they go use your email and that password on every site they can find to see if they can get your Twitter account or your email that's even better so if you're reusing passwords stop it start using LastPass or sponsor or any password vault let it generate unique passwords that are long and strong for every site you visit you can let it remember them you don't have to but you shouldn't reuse passwords that's the real problem here you can ignore that blackmail though because the chances are very good that none of that is true they just got your password and email in a data dump from a breach from long ago they sent out emails to every litter lees millions of people in that database all with the same you know story and I bet you a few people panic and send them Bitcoin no need to panic I Brian says ignore it I ignored it I received that email twice with two different passwords no nobody's ever got a video of me doing anything unsavory well except for this show and I hope you enjoy it if you want to ask a question just email ask the tech guy at twit TV I would love to get some emails from you and we can answer some more questions in subsequent weeks ask the tech guy at Twitter TV our show blackmail emails you may get them that you can ignore thanks for watching we'll see you next time when asked the tech guy stumped on a nasty tech conundrum email ask the teka at twit TV [Music]
