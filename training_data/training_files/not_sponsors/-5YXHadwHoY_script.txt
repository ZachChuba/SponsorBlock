believe in silent letters anymore if you're gonna put it there i'm i should say it cheesy pies thank you for the two months whoop two months it's always awesome to watch your streams while working and i love chill truck it's great to listen to while drawing there's about valentine's pronunciations thank you [Music] oh okay okay i wasn't able to do the wipers because uh the car wasn't on let me try hamburger that makes sense okay all right here we go i i think this has vr support i'm not sure i have not tried it i've not tried it all right what a hamburger wait i got it did i leave the oh no i think i left i left the truck i didn't actually pick up the truck so i gotta loop around i guess i thought that they would just give me the truck did they not used to just give me the truck american is only really different in euro truck 2 by the location i think they also added uh did euro truck 2 have weight stations they added weight stations or checkpoints something like that but for the most part it's it's the same so i think at least for now just just for reference for anyone uh listening i suppose i think i'm done [Music] with twitter like it's it's early to say it's easy oh it's easy to say that you're done with twitter i'm trying to be done with twitter so don't look don't look at twitter if you're looking for like updates i think i'm finally ready to just be done be done it's it's mess it's feel like it's just really messing with my head and i just want to make a hamburger so away it goes [Music] so i'll be posting stuff to uh my website and then i got the discord i'm trying to be more active in the discord [Music] um and then streams i mean i'm trying to stream more i think that's a good time to get updates i think i talk about you know i talk about what i'm working on and stuff [Music] tim tim timber spawn tim timer spawn thank you for subscribing oh you're subscribed to the rss feed of my webs i didn't even know that that was possible how do you do that i thought i had to have a button for that no i probably won't announce that i'm leaving twitter i changed like my my description to be like uh find me elsewhere or whatever [Music] they'll figure it out it's not like i post very much there anyway the only time i ever really post is when there's a new video or like a stream or something oh my god i keep hitting the camera button oh my god i guess i could have like stopped off-roading thread the needle here we go read the needle [Music] okay i don't want to delete the twitter uh just because it's very final and also that would like free up my username and i know people are going to look for it anyway [Music] i just want to stop being on it i'm not even opposed to using it for updates that's how i've been trying to use it but like just having access to it for updates is too much for me i can't stop myself i was good for like a week for not checking it and then slowly but surely i started getting on twitter again getting on that getting on that scroll machine so i can't like i can't fight it unless i just blo i'm blocking it on all my i'm using cold turkey to just block it from all my all my apps and stuff yeah that's that's too that's i mean that's some extra steps that's fine i think as long as i just can't get access to it it's fine it can just it can just die it can just sit there maybe i don't know who knows maybe one day twitter will be better but that's just a heads up to anyone who relies on twitter for updates and stuff it will be unreliable going forward i do use epidemic sound that's what we're listening to right now uh cheer a ledge thank you for the three months weird i shared my oh wait no wrong message thank you for keeping me sane during work uh at home and now furlough time hey uh not a problem i'm at least right there with you at work work from home it's strange how like i've worked from home for a really long time but still affected by the the quarantine still driving me a little crazy i flew off the handle there for about three weeks or so getting it back together [Music] i'm happy to be streaming again having this schedule has already been nice it makes me feel like at least i can update i'm considering doing a hamburger maybe some blender streams at some point i've been in blender a lot working on stuff and sometimes i just feel like i want to blend mastodon is a decent alternative now yeah no i don't i don't i want to do another social network right now will it blend will ian blend [Music] where are we in the game we're in washington somewhere i'll look for a road sign i could pull out the map but i'm driving thank you vic vicovsky i started to use i might have talked about this last stream i don't remember i started to use trello anyone use trello i'm trying to use it to stay more productive and keep on on top i got it specifically for my big video it's there's so many parts that it feels overwhelming and getting to break down the work into little tiny cards that you can move around has been super help helpful trello is like i don't really even know how to explain it's like a productivity like i said you break you can break down large projects into tiny steps it's almost like an advanced checklist if checklists really work for you um it's worth looking into it's not exactly what i wanted i was looking for i want like a social network where like all you're allowed to talk about is what you're working on i just want i just want to follow people's projects almost like patreon but not really [Music] linkedin okay you guys know that's not what i want kind of like deviantart it's kind of like all these things but it's not quite what i have what i want in my brain yeah kind of like a productivity discord maybe not on discord though in myspace cat daily tv thank you so much for the 33 months weird i shared my sub streak already but apparently it didn't load anyway told her you're my favorite content creator hope i didn't take a wrong turn which is why i'm still around keep it up buddy thank you so much cat daily always good to see slack i don't understand slack i looked at slack before i tried uh trello i don't get it i don't i don't understand it uh i just slack his work discord that doesn't like that doesn't say anything to me similar to discord so it's like an irc but for work where is it different from uh discord that's what jobs use for well okay yeah yeah is it like is it like virtual cubicles it doesn't sound that doesn't sound fun but that's the closest way that i could describe what i was looking for like virtual cubicles because i have all these like colleagues right creative people that are working on creative projects but we're all doing it separately and nobody's really keeping people posted so it's very isolating so it would be interesting to feel more like colleagues with virtual colleagues i've been in a couple like creative discords but they always die so i don't think discord is the solution is slack does slack do that [Music] i can bypass the nearby i thought that was something i thought that was like my phone well maybe i'll look harder at slack the other side is that i have to convince friends to use it i gotta be like hey join my slack group so i can bother you about projects right now i'm just relentlessly bothering people i just message my friends hey what are you working on tell me what you're working on i want to know and you know what that's working that's that's working right now it's better than twitter so i'll take it suggested discord maybe i'll just keep hitting people up it's good to like connect with people i think i think that's something that social media made me bad at was like just reaching out and being like hey what's up because i'm one of those people that's like oh no i'm i'm gonna bother i'm always i'm a bother i'm always bothering everybody we're just driving along well we're hauling something i actually don't know what we're hauling we are hauling uh limestone from grand carly washington all the way to salt lake city but you put a sweatshirt on oops like spending time on yourself that's totally fair like some people when they work on projects uh they just want to like dial in focus and that's it i'm someone who really vibes often other people being creative like if a friend of mine has a really out there idea i'm all about that tell me what you're doing that you haven't done before uh i love that [ __ ] it makes me want to work on different stuff and especially when i'm like stuck in a rut it just makes me feel like i'm wasting time it really motivates me to see other other people you know getting [ __ ] done [Music] thank you so much for the bits do you pronounce both os in moose or is one silent uh you pronounce bo i just abbreviate them a little so you you can't really hear the full thing but it is uh it is pronounced moose sure incredible kelly thank you for subscribing tora84 thanks for subscribing tapiocaster thanks for gifting that sub call me ally thanks for the prime sub uh desert silo thank you for the prime sub go let's get hit the road again and casual zelda fan eight thank you so very much for the three dollars ian i've been obsessed with your music stuff recently got any new music projects brewing love your stuff keep doing you thank you so very much i do you know interesting that you say that because i am very uh i'm feeling very motivated to work on music lately i have not i did start this i started this year with a uh a music goal which i guess should still be meetable i'm not sure if i will um but definitely more coming along the line right now it's like trying to let myself make time for that you know that's another thing on my mind is patreon i don't know you don't know about patreon i feel pressure from patreon i know it's not intentional i know nobody donating to me there would intentionally put you know want to put pressure on me but it's carries some type of weight daisy's ufo thank you for the 100 bits this is the first time i've been able to catch a stream live love your vids and the few art pieces i've seen by you what's your favorite video that you've made thank you so much daisy what's my favorite video that i've made um [Music] that's tough especially as i've been like including personal issues not issues personal my life in videos a bit more like my move my cross-country move is a very special video to me i i watch it that's one that i'll go back and watch to feel sad i'll go back and cry watch my road trip video televoid's always going to have a special place for me oh no am i supposed to i'm supposed to get off here i think it'd be easier to find videos that i don't like or mystery tapes i i really enjoy i feel like i did you know i'm doing what i want to do with that show i don't know if i have a favorite coin game on stream next i'm not sure whenever i'm in the mood i definitely want to try the survival mode i just got to be in the mood you know a lot of people mention my collabs with chad i really want to do another we were going to we were going to record one like last month or something i was talking to him about recording one and then i just i lost it i just lost it for a little while so that didn't materialize but maybe soon because like this big video thing i'm still filming it i think i mentioned that my my filming sections have been broken up into like 20 different sections and i'm about halfway maybe a little past halfway on filming the big video so i think once i'm done filming i might take a break and do something smaller movie review with chad might not be a bad idea that's something that i don't have to write which would cut down on work the video is gonna be big it's gonna be big it's gonna be huge will it be worth it no but it will be big i'm excited i'm still excited for it that's just been me lately the last past few days maybe a week or so i'm trying to get that creative energy going feeling good about making stuff glad you made it publish dragon [Music] how's it going with the blackberry it's you know the blackberry is going all right i had to get another one um so the first blackberry i got uh didn't work it worked fine but like with calls it would not hold a call even on wi-fi calling it would not hold a call so i ordered another one i actually ordered a different like serial number i'm not sure if that had anything to do with it or not but i ordered what i thought was one that was more intended for the states and it's been going just fine it sometimes has problems getting reception in a building but i got i got the working one from ebay i just bought it on ebay definitely do your research don't go out and just randomly buy an old phone do some research there's people out there using those things that'll tell you what you need to know um what models to pick that kind of thing but i'm thinking of sending back my samsung galaxy i haven't used it in i don't know a couple weeks mj update mj's great mj is great um she probably won't come in here today um but i will i will pass along the uh the concern oh i need [ __ ] gas uh okay well keep keep an eye out for gas maybe should have gotten off there log hat v thank you very much for the 200 bits if you could have one super power what would it be i could have one super power i would i would want to be like um slow down time man uh i would love to have more time to do stuff work i would love to have work uh more time to work or a super here we go a superhero ability to focus that would be a good one i could put that one to use yeah i don't know [Music] i just want to be more productive so any any superpower that would make me more productive or maybe the super hair the superhero ability to like be healthy without having to try that would also be great yeah blackberry still makes phones but all they're like current phones the one i'm using is an old one with a keyboard one of these guys here i go off the road um all the phones look the same like they're big slab phones they're like a giant screen phone i actually think they may have stopped are they still making the key too is that the one they're still making it's just so sad when you go to like i used to look at phones all the time even when i had a phone it's not the bold but it looks like the bolt it's the blackberry classic

simulator games is there an objective yes there is so currently we do not own our own truck we are just a single person taking uh trucking jobs and earning money as you complete jobs you earn money you can buy your own truck you can buy a garage you can start hiring people and eventually run your own trucking company we have never gotten that far i have gotten that far uh playing myself alone like forever ago when i used to play this game all the time we were getting there and then for some reason i had to restart you can crash i mean it's no burnout crashes you just kind of bump into

never did um i'll give it a try i've tried a couple farming games and for some reason or another i i just don't follow through with them but i'd give it a shot at some point [Music] do you have to

screen right now it's me the screen and a chat room filled with uh ai ai chat bots nobody's real no new art right now i haven't drawn in quite a while i'm working on uh i'm working on blender stuff so my aside from video work and stream work which i'm pretty vocal about my side projects currently have been learning blender and then i've started to learn very very early started to um learn unity there we go [Music] uh worth the kids i'm not sure uh i've definitely watched a lot of blender stuff lately the only i think the only channel name that i remember is uh blender guru but i know i've i've watched other people so it's very possible i use adobe premiere for my video editing what other parts of the world would make for an interesting iteration of the truck simulator series where would i want a truck if i could truck anywhere that's the thing is i would i'm so nostalgic i want to i want to explore places i've already been so that's boring um i don't know it'd be interesting to put this uh like this engine in a fictional world let me truck around places that don't exist um maybe a sci-fi trucker maybe that could be their next thing oh what if i could drive trucks through people's dreams that would be interesting i don't know what i would be delivering what do you deliver as you drive trucks through people's dreams nightmares i don't know i don't know what you would deliver but it would be interesting sand oh there you go you could be the sandman i like that i like there's a lot of people that sleep you would need a network of people to deliver all of this uh sleepy sand that's not bad that's where i want a truck yeah yeah that's kind of what i'm feeling like a soda simulator like let me truck through something look that looks like a cosmo d game or something that'd be pretty great do i have cruise control on because if i do i have no idea how i turned it on and i'm like flying up this hill okay now i'm slowing down i'm finally slowing down ooh liking that even going back in time trucking through time would be interesting if i could truck to the future [Music] i like i like driving trucks through dreams i think i'm gonna pitch that one i'll uh i'll let ses software have that one and they only have to give me half of the proceeds i'll i'll loan that one out generously just give me half of your money so generous i love this little creek no

know when i'm gonna go to the thrift store again i'm glad i didn't bank too hard on the treasure hunt concept because that would be pretty much impossible right now [Music] once we're you know over

happening kid funky fresh thank you very much for the 20 moose love your content uh don't know how you don't have more youtube subs thanks for the high quality videos thank you very much kid funky fresh it's mostly because i don't upload very much i think are you kidding me go go is it because i'm slightly in the way like ever so slightly oh my god oh my god you know subs don't even really mean that much anymore i mean they mean something but not near as much as they used to it's way more about view count you'll see a ton of channels with way less subs to me with way more views and a ton of channels with way more subs and way less view uh i can if you ever want to know what song is playing it's it's just stock music but if you ask me while the song is still going i can let you know it just switched over to something called own eyes by pan panda panda raps and gustav see this isn't this isn't really the jazz that i'm looking for this is this sounds like loops you know i want yeah

channel i did try and make you know i've been making videos forever um i think i did one more online effort before them but it was very it was like one video and i posted it on some forums and got roasted so i stopped [Music] so i did psychic to tef psychic detective was a good one even though i barely remember it at this point it's been a while i just remember really enjoying putting it together the game stuff i'm iffy on like looking back on it oh my god [Music] i need to go back and watch it since i haven't seen it in a while i don't really appreciate that era of my videos very much i kind of see it as like amateurish and like formulaic which i mean it was that doesn't mean that there's you know nothing not anything of value there i failed to stop at the weigh station but it's definitely not you know what i'm trying to do now wheatley hastings thank you for the two months love ooh ian may all of your crisps be cosmic and all your texases yum yum thank you very much wheatley some nice sentiments there [Music] town with no name still gets like respectable views which is surprising to me [Music] i still value my modern warfare 3 video oh yeah as a starting point yeah if i didn't value those videos they they wouldn't be up at all um i've tried to leave you know i've left all my videos up except for the one that got taken down by force but i don't regret any of them i just like quality wise looking back it's like i definitely like to do a uh another thing with chad for sure top five brutal foods filming areas probably the first kitchen man what what doesn't get shown on the brutal foods vizio videos is just how stressed i was when filming them part of the reason i'm on like a break is because i need to i need to relax i need to put less pressure on myself with that kind of stuff because it's off the cuff no scripting and it was fun and then you know it was like all of a sudden my most popular video series i got you know way more views on it than anything else i've ever done and just feeling like there was all these expectations i just started getting really stressed out in my own head about it um so a lot of times filming those weren't very fun for me i'm happy with the result like the outcome the videos all turned out super good but i definitely put a lot of pressure on myself for him um let's start about halfway in probably [Music] hungry meds pretty good see i still want to do fun stuff like that i just need to find a way to do it without the pressure part of the you know that's part of the leaving twitter not not that people are intentionally putting pressure on me but you know unintentionally having you know that kind of constant contact oh i'm happy i made them too for sure no no regrets that just explains why i haven't made one thank you for the 200 bits my name's not shane kidd i remember that remember that at least and fellow [ __ ] thank you so very much uh for the six dollars and change you might need to retake

know what one of my old videos that i do really like still is the pax blog one uh i still i get nostalgic for that one just because it was a it was a moment in my life going to conventions you know people all of a sudden you know knowing who i am at conventions that was it that was a time i 84 earlier this goes straight to salt lake it may be you know they may reroute you because of the weight of the truck that might be why i'm uh not on the highway menace of arabia thank you so much for the 25 months hey nice truck not really i appreciate it it does make me feel better not having our road to hell or whatever that awesome truck was we had before i appreciate it i don't know how much the game is on steam there's dlc you got to get two um because the game is like a base game that comes with like the west coast ish not even the full didn't it just launched it launched with like california nevada new mexico was that it they did not launch with very much they've been slowly expanding it i have a favorite state scenery-wise uh washington probably uh i really like the scenery here i mean you know in certain areas you know washington's a big state but in the seattle area love the hills love the trees it's so very green love the evergreens love the mountains i like colorado a lot for similar reasons um love the mountains mountains are just cool i don't like being freezing but i like getting to look at mountains and i feel like it doesn't get super cold here whereas in colorado it gets colder i don't have many thoughts about ken i've never been to canada it's like right next door but i haven't been if i could make a game out of any mundane task what would it be oh every mundane task like a chore simulator or something oh i know i've been i've been over this i want to do like a shopping game where you're like an instacart instacart simulator shop for someone in a grocery store then drive it to their house repeat um i would absolutely play that game library sim would be nice if i liked books i don't really read i'd feel intimidated by all the books [Music] did you go could you go a little faster than that [Music] [Music] um thanks armored sage appreciate that drink drive love oh wait lose yeah that that makes a little more sense best burger burger place best burger i've ever had in my life i don't know i love hamburgers there's so many different kinds of hamburgers and i eat all like two of them the regular hamburgers and mushroom swiss burgers you know the two kinds of burgers that you can think of gourmet burgers see i like the cheapo ones i like a cheapo burger most of the time [Music] chemical kimmy i'm always i'm always up for uh for suggestions video suggestions as long as they're not demands i'm down for suggestions man i want cheeseburger maybe i'm gonna get a burger or uh oh i guess it's too late for lunch for dinner [Music] damn i might get mcdonald's i love a good mcdonald's cheeseburger like the the regular just plain old cheeseburgers making me think of uh trailer park boys we were watching trailer park boys gonna grow up and be randy yu-gi-oh unboxing vids um probably not a video i would look look out for maybe a stream i do have a number of yu-gi-oh things that i want to open and i think i'm going to do it on a stream uh because the videos i don't think i don't think i care enough to edit all that but i bought them to open for you guys ages ago so i still want to do that [Music] somehow i have not been to ghost aliexpresso since the vid uh everything is closed everything is closed and even with it we're open i'm not going anywhere right now oh wow glittered lights thank you so very much for the seven months your streams always bring a smile to my face and some chill vibes to my day i hope you're doing well thank you very much glittered lights i am i am i'm feeling pretty good [Music] feeling good what's uh anyone working on anything cool who's working on a cool thing right now [Music] tell me the cool things [Music] jackpot there's a place called jackpot that's awesome building a youtube channel that's fun writing a novel that's scary that scares me all those words how far how far along are you in a novel also like having to make a story that's scary stuff that i want to do but uh might not ever do your spine healed that's good that's good to hear did your text oh [ __ ] i have to i have to do taxes today thank you mega man [Music] tech space rpg that's fun see i should be making [ __ ] the one downside to streaming is i'm not i like i like to do the streams i like making it does not scratch the creative edge i don't feel like i'm making anything even if technically i'm oops oops [Music] technically i i'm making uh content i suppose it's not it's not quite the same as making something for me otg marcus thank you so very much for the eight months what a hamburger flower jewelry clay jewelry ebook damn it's been a lot of plates i have not been to germany i have not been out of the country yet where's my smooth jazz [Music] okay back to the classics back to the ones we probably all recognize by now [Music] javascript coding javascript intimidates me i still don't even like i've tried to learn css with html and that's even that's too much javascript so that's a lot need a big brain for that one got too ambitious and locked down and haven't made tons of progress with any of it hey i did the same thing i did the same thing i got very uh you know a month and a half maybe yeah a month and a half-ish month-ish a little longer over a month i was very uh optimistic and working on my big video a lot i had a bunch of projects going and then i just completely crashed the sadness thank you for the prime sup i have not played a computer repair simulator i'm still going though on like the my biggest project for the quarantine i'm still going some other ones are on hold i wouldn't say that i've abandoned anything hit pause on a few things yeah animal crossing came out that was a distraction still still a bit of a distraction if i'm being honest glad you like the next video [Music] i enjoyed making that one that one was a lot of fun i would like to do more i'm trying to take more notes on stuff that i'm actively watching because next was not something i sought out to make a video on it was something i happened to be watching and then when i decided i needed to make a video before the big video was done well what can i do oh i watch a lot of next and that show's ridiculous it'd be perfect so i need to do more of that it's not the first time i've even said this on the stream it's like a cycle i get in this good headspace when to start projects that i work on and then i get bogged down but not anymore not anymore maybe maybe not anymore can i keep going on the street will they let me uh what a hamburger i'm just gonna i don't know if i'm allowed to go through there i'm just gonna go around frisky dingus 89. thank you so very much for gifting those five snubs thank you thank you your boyfriend has a theory that the rhyming of next was stolen from survivor did survivor um i know they used to in their clues like the uh the idol clues and stuff i think maybe they they rhymed in there maybe they did [Music] oh what a hamburger i'm with you hogwarts it's fun to talk about projects i find that motivating i find like you got to make sure you don't talk about it so much that like you trick yourself into feeling [Music] like you're working on it enough if that makes sense i feel like if i'm actively talking about a project to people it almost feels like i'm getting work done just by talking about it so it's a balance between like okay talk about it but also also i gotta you know put my nose down and get work done so i like it in a very what are you working on uh exchange i like that yeah i'm bad honestly the big video was supposed to be a secret i really wanted to just come out with a surprise a secret video but like a giant video but i couldn't do it i just couldn't do it i had i had to talk about it even a little bit vague as possible yeah that's that's pretty much why i'm well part of the reason why i'm being vague another reason i don't want to over promise something but at this point i'm in too deep like it's happening i can't imagine that i would bail [Music] for sure ally cat i was talking about uh how i started using trello recently for that exact purpose breaking down big projects into smaller more manageable bits i also find helpful to talk projects but always end up feeling too much pressure completing them with having shared with other person that i can relate to that i feel that um [Music] i don't feel that in small settings like sharing someone something with a friend and working on it you know if you bail an idea it's it's whatever but talking about it on stream or like i don't know i don't want to mislead people but at the same time just i'm a guy that you know i'll start a bunch of projects and i'll finish maybe one of them and that's you know start out well-intentioned get a little overwhelmed focus on one thing it's just kind of how i operate people ask you where's xyz that's the worst part i'm just trying to put less stock into that like it's nice if people are interested but i'm trying to not put any stock or less stock into like not even demands but i don't know if a project doesn't get finished it doesn't get finished it's not the end of the world uh there are other projects just trying to let myself off the hook for that kind of stuff a little bit more yeah we hauling limestone we're going from uh washington to salt lake city with limestone people asking where's blank for a project is probably like the most demotivating when it's phrased that way at least for me it's so it just makes me not want to do it in a little bit like even a little bit that's part of the reasons i've getting off twitter is because i don't want to see people uh not begging [Music] for food videos but sometimes it feels that way nobody's fault but that's just how the internet goes and it makes me not want to make it makes me not want to make them even a little bit this nude video snoot video would be fun i do love snood just figuring it out man it's crazy like 29 and i feel like i'm only just now realizing and accepting like how i function with stuff like this which is just ridiculous i think that's probably part of just working alone for so long or maybe it's just getting old getting some perspective now it's fine not to get yourself that's a journey it's a big journey i appreciate that chemical kimmy i think solaria starts i really like i'm filming the big video on vhs i like using the vhs camcorder i think from here on out i really want to try and match my at least my aspect ratio to the media i review because i think it's fun and also like when it comes to mystery tapes it just it just seems sometimes a little jarring to go from vhs footage to like hd whatever uh and i'm not using the space like the extra wide screen space i i don't use it for anything so why i don't need it and it's just how i used to make videos like i used to make videos and you know pre-posting them on the internet used to make little movies and stuff just in camera on tape and so it's fun to reconnect reconnect with that that creative you know mind space before like money and people were involved it's nice to get back there somehow and recording on tape definitely makes me feel that way recording on like an hd camera makes me feel ugly that's how that makes me feel now to vhs when i when i was recording uh movies it was mini dv and uh high eight tapes i didn't have a vhs camcorder growing up i think the oldest one i had was a high eight camera yeah it's fun using tapes there's just something physical about using the cartridges and hearing all the uh you know the moving parts in the camera it's very satisfying it makes what is typically my least favorite part of the process which is filming not you know makes it not totally suck it makes it at least fun because i get to use a fun camera go back to filming everything in soft focus part of the part of the plus to vhs man i feel like i look a lot better in vhs resolution fill me with a potato i'm gonna look great uh thank you coffee you gotta use the blinker the blinker is the most satisfying sound in the entire game if you're not using your blinker in uh american truck simulator you're you're missing out i'm pretty sure i'm just recording an sp oops bust out some super 8 i don't have a super 8 you know i bought it oops i bought a mini dv camera but i'm not really happy with how the footage looks it's probably i'll use it for maybe like an out and about camera in a million years when i go outside again angela hondro 64. thank you so very much for the 13 months hiya ian happy to catch a truck and stream hope you have a cool day thank you very much i'm going to i'm gonna have a cool day i'm gonna drive a truck and then i'm gonna blend and uh maybe eat a burger it sounds like [Music] how do i get my tapes it depends um a mixture of thrift stores and ebay i think i've maybe bought some off etsy before which doesn't sound like something you'd find on etsy but i think that i've bought some tapes off etsy in the past [Music] end of your day didn't do half the stuff you wanted to do hey that happens we all got days like that especially when i'm sitting here distracting you taxes don't forget taxes i should leave myself a note i don't have a pencil oh wait i do have a pencil it's right in front of me i'm gonna write myself a note to do my taxes after i uh should i do it now maybe i should just do it i'm just gonna do it now [Music] tax okay put it on my phone i won't forget [Music] any b-movie recommendations um oh i don't know [Music] uh i mean i've talked about i feel like i talk about the really standout ones i don't know that i have any that i would seek out i don't think i have any movies on tape that i would say you got to go out and find this video i think it's more about coming across good stuff by chance let's try and park this one [Music] corn dog one i really want to see uh maybe not really want to see they were talking on a red letter media about a a water park a water park movie where there's there's blades and the the slides that kill people it seemed pretty fun [Music] water slash is that what it was called it didn't sound like they liked it a ton but it still looked pretty good [Music] trying to think of any other bad movies that i've seen lately because i know there's got to be some i'm always watching garbage [Music] watch some movie on pluto called santa claus but it was like claws like a cat claw and it was like cat kit like kittens taking over for santa i mean that one wasn't any good but it was something that i saw i don't know that i would really recommend it but uh it was on it was on pluto i saw it airing again so if you want to watch it it might it might come on pluto again at some point there is a movie i want to talk about but it's the one it's one that i might do with chad so i don't i don't want to spill it [Music] oh [Music] what are my odds here i don't know that i'm liking my odds [Music] i still don't know about killjoy 2. i get people asking for killjoy too but after the last one when the copyright things ah maybe i'll just say [ __ ] it maybe i'll just we'll just see we'll see [Music] uh the copyright it wasn't even real so it was just someone abusing the copyright system uh they they claimed it like right when the video came out and then released it like 30 days later so they got all that all the money basically all the money that the video made went to some uh pretty sure it just went to some mystery version [Music] i guess now they hold funds in the i don't know i don't know it doesn't matter if i want to do kill boy kill joy 2 i'll just do it if it doesn't make any money that's fine [Music] now we're not sweating that stuff anymore we're not sweating it [Music] little sushi roll thank you for the 399 bits i finally catch a stream so have some bits times have been tough and i keep falling asleep to brutal foods and it helps my anxiety thanks moose thank you so much sushi roll i hope things get a little better soon [Music] ooh brink would be good i have brink on vhs let's do fuel now let's do high value let's do fuel [Music] okay well let's go from somewhere else let's uh [Music] start new mexico i can only start can i start here oh i can close to texas i can go we'll go to hobbs oh no jobs from hobbs oh do they all go out if they may all go out of albuquerque [Music] ooh does this one do you go into seattle for this one no olympia [Music] um do i want to do that one i like that route but it's an oversized it's an oversized load we'll try it we'll try why not i can always bail on it [Music] it's true i do i do hit up chad for horror i know he likes the same kind of like cheesy horror stuff that i do what a hamburger i can't even see behind me is the trailer there i have no idea okay it is there okay give me a second where am i [ __ ] stuck oh this is gonna suck this is gonna suck i know why did i take this oh come on [Music] oh come on oh it's right there [Music] this is gonna be uh this is gonna be a learning experience is what this is gonna be oh my god come on scooch it through we're still moving scooch it through just gotta scooch it just gotta there we go there we go there we go [Music] yeah room is still a b-movie um just because a movie finds an audience i don't think that changes uh i think it's more about the production budget and like the people involved probably probably just the budget oh my god this is gonna be a disaster this is good we're never gonna get there thank you for the bits uh the daft hatter 66 and instant classic 257 and thanks for subscribing josh 634 i can't remember if i said that or not so i just said it again this should not be every single turn because every single turn is not going to have like some [ __ ] in the corner that i have to get around please let me turn thank you oh my god i had to drive the moving truck just from the lot to my apartment and that was terrifying i mean i called upon my trucking simulator you know abilities i didn't hit anything but i would never want to actually drive a truck it's too big i have a feeling citizen kane was not considered but i guess i don't i guess i don't it's never been described to me as a b movie what was the budget of citizen kane it had they had to have a budget [Music] top b movies that i can recall genuinely disliking for other reasons into being low budget poorly made [Music] like i don't usually i just don't like if they're boring you know but is that just it being poorly made how else would i what else would i be judging it on the room had a budget of six million i guess i wouldn't uh doubt that because i read [ __ ] i read the disaster artist so i i guess i wouldn't be surprised because it seems like all the movie went into or all the money went into the wrong uh the wrong places glad you like it jeff i like to play the chill ones too i like to just kind of hang out and and chat a little bit [Music] this may be my last route uh could someone give me an uptime oh wait i can see it right there it's an hour 43. i'm not planning on going too long today um because my jaw [ __ ] is killing me it's just i've been filming a lot of uh stuff for the big video lately so i've been like talking and projecting lately and my jaw is just hurting so i need to stop talking for a little while [Music] it is a talking related injury i don't i'm not used to talking a lot so having to talk a bunch uh yeah i think it's also because i like talk out of the side of my mouth i i know my i don't know my jaw is crooked it probably is i think my jaw is probably gonna break it a no talking stream what would that even be like what would i play [Music] what's up lucifer og [Music] work-related injury maybe i know my sister has like uh tmj related issues she's got jaw pain so it's it's very likely that i should get it at least look dad oh wow i just have a hard time like i don't know how to speak and like not tense i just tense up i'm just very tense i just tense uh okay we're just going straight here x mic 20. thank you so much for the seven months you need some jaw strengthening exercises i've been looking up like tmj stretches and stuff i'm trying to do those while i film they definitely help and then like a heat pack helps i just do an asmr stream i just won't talk i'll just make some crinkle noises or something [Music] yes tmj equals the mouth draw it's a medical term that is shorthand for the mouth jaw that's correct favorite pizza place my favorite pizza place is uh right here in washington state i guess i don't know maybe it is also elsewhere but i don't think so not positive it's called pagliacci and even just saying the name oh man it makes me want some pakliachi pizza but i also kind of want burgers because we were talking about burgers chill truck streams always make me hungry we're always talking about food i guess that makes sense you're driving you know you get the munchies on the road i'm assuming especially when you're trucking you probably get hungry ugly bunch of pizza or i'm not gonna eat on stream i got a full meal yeah pbg recently meant i i actually learned about pagliacci pizza from uh austin so that does not surprise me i'm pretty sure the first time i had it was over at his house oh i know you had a slice of pogs i know exactly how that went [Laughter] man i might get maybe i'll get pizza we ju i feel like we just had pagliacci like not not too long i should eat something else i could maybe do a dinner stream if i was allowed to do all my eating like behind a curtain like if we just had like a curtain hanging down here and every time i ate i would just like move over here and i would eat and then i was done i would you know lean back in over here i think that could be captivated only see nose and above no you don't need to see any of my face it's private while i'm eating you don't need to look at that i'll just put stock videos of people eating like over my face when i eat and it'll just be a substitute it would feel weird eating on like unless it wouldn't feel weird eating on camera if someone else was like also eating on camera like i could watch someone else eating maybe if i watched a different mukbang stream as i ate and it would almost be like we were having a meal together that we just our conversation was ridiculous that maybe could work i eat on food videos but those are highly controlled and edited uh experiences oh wow slam j or sam jam slam him my mistake thank you for the nine months good to see you streaming again ian i can't wait for the upcoming long video should we just start calling it the brutal moose motion picture absolutely not i would say no because it's not it's it's very much an extended video uh there's not like a bunch of live action skits or something brutal moose motion picture would have to have some type of story now this is much more like an extended um regular video i don't know what i would do with the movie nothing don't ever give me a movie nobody give me a movie don't let me do a movie no movie i feel like if i had to make if i was making a movie i would like almost have to work with other people uh [Music] and i'm not good at that i i can i can be a good work like a good collaborator but i think more often than not i'm i'm a bad collaborator yeah animated film would be more plausible or maybe a film entirely you know i mean they make major motion pictures shot entirely in front of green screen so if i wanted to film you know an entire movie in front of a green screen i don't think that makes it any less of a film i mean according to you know like hollywood standards [Music] [ __ ] that i could not do stop motion animation big respect for anyone that does stop motion regular animation is hard enough and you're gonna do stop motion could not i couldn't do it i it oh my god what were those claymation videos it wasn't like knox's world or something what were those old it was blue claymation videos uh early early youtube i think it was youtube it may not even have been on youtube someone knows what i'm talking about and needs to speak up because i need to know that i'm not someone made like these was it robert benfer that made those yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so we went by knox back then yeah okay good i'm glad i'm i'm glad i'm not allowed i used to watch those all the time yeah the clay world yeah yeah yeah yeah oh i can pass this one no that that show made me want to do uh claymation stop stop-motion for sure never did it i i just i don't think i've ever had that type of patience i feel like at one point i had one of those lego they made those lego movie maker things i don't maybe i didn't ever have i remember the lego movie maker kit that set you up for stop motion lego uh movies i don't think i had that i think i maybe just remember it i feel like if you got to do if you're doing stop motion you got to like know ahead of time what motions look like which seems like one of the hardest parts about animation to me because you can't if you get halfway through and you know you decide you can't really just you're you're kind of committed with that animation at that point it feels like okay okay someone remembers the lego movie set i don't think i ever had it i'm thinking i remember it i don't think that i ever owned it oh my god storyboarding that's something i need to like take a class on or something you get better at the planning stages i don't think i want to make a movie like i don't think that's in my cards i think the closest i would get to like a movie movie would be maybe a documentary of something that i just happened to come up with enough footage for but i don't think a movie movies uh in the cards i would rather make a game like here's here we go okay so um a brutal moose movie would maybe be like here's a good one uh thrift store road trip just going on a road trip specifically hitting up thrift stores making it long enough to stop at a hotel grab some food record all of that edit it down into something but even then i feel like it would just be an extended video i don't know that to me i don't even know i don't know that doesn't feel movie i don't even really feel documentary to me but it would be close it does sound fun i would make that i've not heard of all gas no brakes working a villain see i don't know i just don't know i don't even really know like if i wanted to do that i don't know how it would come together it's big movie is big movie's big how far can you drive a car inside a goodwill there you go uh lights guy who goes to wacky people and just gets most intensely weird interviews ever i have not heard of that never heard of that should really find some more like quality youtube stuff i really don't branch out that much right now i like the algorithm is not super reliable for finding new things i want to watch more streams too i'm trying to stream more so i feel like i should be plopping into uh friends streams at least see what they're up to especially if i'm not going to be on twitter anymore how am i going to know what anyone is up to unless i just drop in and listen to it who do i watch that i recommend who am i watching right now um i watch like i don't watch anyone i think small that people wouldn't have heard of i you know i watch red letter media i like uh i still like um cinemassacre i like well i like when james rolfe does stuff no offense to his you know his bigger group projects but i particularly like listening to james talk about film i like his the ones where he's just sitting there in front of his computer or whatever just rambling about something i really like those lgr never never stopped watching lgr yeah like uh monster madness i like the he did a video on why is why is there a piece of cardboard in dracula or something surrealism you like his uh the animation one schwankmeyer or something i watched that one started watching i think the the channel i started watching most recently is uh tecmo this is one that i just recently not even that recently like a couple months ago started uh adding into the mix what happened sounds but the title sounds familiar but i don't i don't know exactly what it is i don't know monkey cheese [Music] i'm very i'm very selective youtube when i watch when i'm anxious or sad um i don't know the same kind of stuff i'm listing i don't think it really changes right now i think the people that i watch on youtube are i like the chill more relaxed i like some wacky stuff too but mostly i like relaxing stuff i don't remember if i've seen the digital audio vhs tech mode he does a lot of videos him and tecmo and lgr are like channels that make me feel bad for not uploading more people that can just like get work done jealous i don't know lim limbo i'd really like to listen to some more like creative motivational um talks the problem is i want to listen to it from people that i like already respect creatively and it's not like everyone is you know just doing podcasts yeah see someone i think someone else just recommended lemmy i don't know i don't know let me you know who's done a big turnaround has been caddy his channel is like exploding right now made some changes to his formula it's working for him very impressive i'm passing these people i don't care [Music] nikki jakey is another one where it's like the name i've probably probably seen it on twitter i don't i have no idea um i don't know i think i could turn my brights on somehow but i don't remember or pringle is okay i haven't i played minecraft like barely a week or so ago because they just did the nether update but just haven't gotten invested again um you know animal crossing is seemingly impossible to fully escape because they just keep pushing out little tiny bits of content which is probably uh by design it's hard to really get away from but i do want to play i do know actually you know what there's another eddie burback is someone i just recently found and i think i've watched some other from that like network of people like friends of his just like going on related channels or whatever guys johnson sounds very familiar dan bell is great um would love some more dead malls i do like another dirty room though [Music] people recommend vinnie is that the same line of i thought he did like game stuff [Music] see these are all people that i like know ish i know by like name like i recognize their names i have to check some more people out brutal moose sucks don't watch don't watch that garbage i think that's it though i don't think i can't think of any other channels that i'm oh um same kind of vain as eddie i think uh drew goodin i just started watching his videos his videos are really funny i think that's like the same area curtis connor sounds familiar so i probably i've probably seen if they're in the same network i've probably seen their videos just from autoplay i don't know kick the pj [Music] peanut butter gamers okay i guess guess i mean if you're desperate for something to watch i still watch every pbg every single pbg guys old news dude we're all old news at this point man it's gonna be all the uh the tick tockers all the youtube tick-tockers you're gonna be the new the new news [Music] stepping all over our lawn [Music] [Music] i know of super mega that's another one i know i'm so picky with like youtube [Music] i'm very picky when it comes to videos it's probably part of the reason why it takes me so long to upload something because i'm also picky with my own i'm just bare i shouldn't be sometimes you just need to upload oh my god someone just said technology connections and now i've got uh get connected for free with education connections get connected for free that song is on spotify that's hilarious corridor digital is another one where i know the name i don't know i don't know what they do i have played the euro truck multiplayer mod forever ago it was fun though get connected for free i was talking about the uh because i made a joke about it i think in my next video i was thinking about the jg wentworth ad i don't understand why they don't play that uh 877 cash now opera add more how do they not how did that ever stop running if i was the head of jg wentworth i would be airing that commercial non-stop one of the best commercials i think i've ever seen even if you hate it even if you hate it you know their name you know their phone number and you know what they do it's genius i don't even know what an annuity is but i know that if i ever have one and i need cash now i know who the [ __ ] i'm calling oh i'm just gonna cut in line here structured settlement no idea but if i have one i need some cash [Music] ooh freecreditreport.com was also a good they had a good run merry christmas merry christmas everybody oh empire is pretty good see the empire jingle doesn't tell you what they do though they just tell you to call empire today jg wentworth tells you like their entire company's mission and like forces you to remember it i think that's impressive yeah i know that i know the flooring too but i still don't know do they call them for flooring i think it's like a flooring company zoo books call empire when you run out of floor yeah something like that trying to think of any other commercial i would rank just like effectiveness catchiness freecreditreport.com is very comparable i feel like freecreditreport.com is also just a lot easier [Music] because it's like in the url you could just have someone come on screen and say visit freecreditreport.com and you'd be like okay i get it i probably get a free credit report there [Music] uh gabe lord thank you so very much for the 25 more like brutal snooze i love your videos so much thank you so very much i could go for a brutal snooze right about now go on a snooze cruise roto-rooter was pretty good did they still play roto-rooter commercials oh my god do you or someone you know have mesothelioma i remember those commercials i remember those commercials [Music] very jarring i get a lot of that when you watch pluto tv a lot of those like are you dying you can sue someone now commercials [Music] there's one running on pluto right now at least when i watch it that's like were you abused by the catholic church well you can sue them now so give us a call it's very strange when you're like in between watching like mtv dating shows it's very jarring [Music] yes they're always very loud i agree if it works it works billy mays was great and then they tried to replace him with the guy with the jaw what was his name [Music] didn't he bite someone the shamwow guy the shamwow guy get in the news for biting somebody be wrong about that oh someone bit him okay [Music] makes me want to buy a shamwow that's for sure at least we want to run out and pick up a shamwow [Music] i did not play red dead 2 i i wanted to play it for the multiplayer i liked red dead i remember going to the min that might be the last game i went to a midnight premiere for like to gamestop was maybe red dead uh that that could be untrue that's definitely one of the last ones that i remember i loved the the posse mode like the multiplayer mode i wanted to play it for red dead too but i just didn't end up doing it i'm not like a i'm not a westerns guy like cowboys are also like dirty it's the same thing with pirates where it's like man everyone's just so dirty pirates are like yeah you probably got scurvy and i just have a hard time getting past that [Music] are pirates dirty in a fun way though or are they just dirty [Music] it's a romantic type of dirty okay all right [Music] exactly i want a posse that showers regularly [Music] just give me a western where they just magically have a like a modern day shower somewhere and random times during the days characters would just say i'm gonna go take a shower maybe that would maybe that would help [Music] i'm watching uh i'm watching my boyfriend play through all of the gamecube harry potter games he just finished uh what's the first one sorcerer's stone he just finished sorcerer's stone it was it was quite a ride uh they're like they're cool and then it's like oh you get to run around hogwarts but then they also look extremely frustrating to play i think i did see continues episode on that i need to watch it again i feel like i did see was that fairly recent first one is the worst one well that's good we're done with that i say we like i helped i helped a little bit i instructed the battle chess i i uh got us past the chess game which wasn't actually chess which bothered me [Music] but it's fun seeing everyone's like lumpy model everyone just looks messed up indoors toy mr parker thank you so very much for the 20 months hey ian nice to see you streaming still i had to fly today since i went out of state due to unfortunate circumstances love seeing a chill stream after all that stressful travel cheers hey welcome back indoors welcome back indoors indoors happy to have you here uh if anyone doesn't know uh wasn't here last couple streams or just hasn't checked i'm streaming every wednesday and every saturday in july my plan moving forward is to set streaming schedules at the beginning of the month so if at the end of july i feel like i need more time to work on videos i will probably pair the schedule down but i still want to have one stay regular um because oh look there it goes when i don't have oh there goes a lot when i don't have a schedule a schedule i tend to just not do it so that's the plan i don't know about a harry potter quidditch toy that you control with your brain that sounds pretty cool though oh is there gas i can't see because it's telling me i'm running out of gas is there gas no there's no gas i could have slept though because i need to sleep you're working from home do all days feel the same i would say i don't think that all well yeah it depends like right now yes uh not so much when you can go out like to the store um because when you work from home you're able to be like well i'll go just i'll go to the store on days on weekdays when less people will be there so that helps keep track somewhat but it can definitely be uh one one note it can be hard to know like right now i don't know i know that it's wednesday i think i think i'm heavily uh i'm mostly sure that it's wednesday because i'm streaming and i know that i'm streaming on wednesdays and saturdays so that'll help me uh a little bit the discord is uh sub only though you don't get kicked um when your sub lapses so it's just kind of like a one time so you could use like your prime sub here i think and get in i wanted some type of barrier to keep just anyone from wandering in but uh i didn't want it to be like you have to pay me you gotta pay me five bucks a month to stay in this discord i'm gonna redo the discord that's something that i'm planning maybe i'll work on that today after i finish here it's not a bad idea um i think this is going to be my last trip um this this is kind of a planned smaller stream because i need a break um from speaking but next time we play definitely recommend that because i would i would be down for a pacific coast highway trip next stream i'm hoping to be on the old pc the plan for today i'll just go tell you what i was planning on doing today it might not be what we do on saturday i was planning on playing one of the i spy games um on the windows that's what i was gonna do i i'm thinking about nance but i don't know that i want to get and like committed to a nance game just yet but i am still thinking about nance i think we already did spooky mansion i don't remember we played one of them i'm pretty sure i have spooky mansion i have i've got four i know i have four of them maybe i'll just uh flip through my binder one day i could point a camera at my game binder and we could look at everything that i got or i could write it like a normal person i could put in a [Music] spreadsheet i'm wondering if i have if i've got oh was there gas here i [ __ ] need gas i'm gonna [Music] i need gas so i'm gonna keep driving it i'm gonna drive around and look for gas because i i desperately need fuel yeah i'm wondering if i have enough if i have one of every letter i feel like it would be interesting to randomly choose a letter of the alphabet and commit to picking games or softwares uh from that letter because that could uh go either well or badly which would be fun venomobob thank you for the prime so i don't know how long uh the time and distance is i know that the map is heavily compressed like it's vaguely accurate it's got the vibes of the areas right but it's it's heavily scaled what a hamburger you did it you got a you got a popcorn kernel oh my god look at that little traffic cone guy he's calling me in oh wait no did i miss it he's calling me in for some gas and uh nap what a hamburger [Music] by lover forever thanks for gifting that sub oh no this is going to be an issue okay what a hamburger odin's abode thank you for subscribing and russian caravan thank you for subscribing thank you thank you [Music] okay now i gotta make sure i don't catch the trailer on anything back there oh i almost did i did blackmore manor final scene ghost dogs alibi and ashes [Music] um is that it that might have been it i've only played a handful oh i was gonna sleep in there i guess i'll sleep i guess i'll sleep in here i really should have slept in there i made a big mistake [Music] by not just snapping in there thank you odins i appreciate it happy to have you here surprising amount of people for a for a chill truck stream i'm i'm impressed especially since i'm i didn't tweet it [Music] uh turn off car go to sleep [Music] jump truck is pretty chill i think it's i mean it depends on how i'm driving some days i think it's less chill than others it's not going to be chill if i decide to try and park this thing there's no way i'm parking this oh you got wednesdays off nice popped up on streamers you might like i wonder who gets recommended against my channel you know [Music] no you can't leave the truck that would be pretty awesome though you could just run around merry christmas everybody celebrate christmas a lot in these truck streams it's christmas somewhere you know so the age-old saying christmas somewhere excuse me thank you i think truckers have lonely christmases i guess it depends on if they're driving on christmas [Music] depends on the driver oh thanks for that update been then the mabob i'll update the discord thing i have to connect it it worked on your phone uh i had someone else write up the discord thing ages ago it's very possible that they made connecting it easier i still don't underst like it used to not work very well i feel like i really didn't understand how you made connections on discord so i'll edit that after i'm done [Music] thank you for that update i had no idea dr squidopoulos thanks for the 15 months thanks for all the chill streams ian keep being you i'm doing my best thanks so much your mom has been watching hallmark christmas movies every day this month christmas in july oh that makes sense you know someone asked me about b movies i'd recommend like like a while ago what i should have recommended since i didn't have a specific thing to find on tape i should have recommended a lifetime movie network because i've been a lifetime movie fan for a while but recently they pivoted into like more thriller like focusing more on thriller murdery movies and they're kind of amazing you can find some pretty uh entertaining stuff on lifetime iconic lens flare thank you for the prime sub you watch hallmark all day every day oh right i remember labyrinth of lies wasn't greek play the final scene i thought that you mentioned that one final act or something entertaining good or entertaining bad uh i guess entertaining bad uh it depends it's good it's good to me i would say entertaining to watch with other people lifetime movies are like uh it's like an active roast experience where you roast the movies as you watch them you know i want to be in a lifetime movie life goal lifetime goal right there i'm gonna i'm gonna be in a lifetime movie one of these days i have not done nance on a train what was the one where they were in uh prison mansion prison that one sucked i didn't like that one i'm mulling over some nancy drew i'm not gonna commit to saying that it's happening soon but it's definitely something i've been considering final scene took place in an old theater where you learned about harry houdini oh right right yep i remember that one now i remember that one ooh i like chess my opinion on chess is is positive i like ghost dogs and moonlight legos see i don't know that that might not have been the the game's fault the bug hunt might have been more my fault than the game's fault i just remember when i think of the ghost dogs at moon lake i just think about the stupid bug hunt but i think that might have been my own doing i'm not i'm not totally sure [Music] love the wind turbines in the district this distance [Music] that's cool argason i should definitely do another dance i know that uh the nand streams are popular on the vod channel people like watching the dance ones i just have to when we do the nance i just have to make sure that i'm in a like focused state of mind otherwise it's gonna be torture because i'm gonna miss and forget things i'll help you feel better six one thousand it will soon use a controller to play truck sim i i've used a wheel before i don't really like it it's really not even the wheel that i have an issue with it's more like the pedals i don't like i'm like sitting cross-legged right now you know i don't want to sit like a normal person for you know two or three hours that's hard for me [Music] you know bad game reform it's true well what's the uh nancy uh nancy aficionados what's the next one up what's uh what what nancy drew should i be considering everyone says haunted carousel i think i think that's a big favorite that we haven't done uh no phenomena bob when i run windows 98 games i'm using an old pc um it's it can be really difficult to emulate stuff for windows 98 at least in my experience it's possible that it's been made easier the past few years but in my experience emulating windows anything past like a dos box is just a pain how do i sit cross-legged without my knees hurting i don't um my knees just hurt all the time it's kind of like my back my back just hurts all the time uh it's called not doing yourself any favors [Music] carousel fun a bit shorter than most games maybe that maybe that's what i'll look into actually might be a good idea to tackle a shorter one first because even like the shenmue stream that five hour shimmu stream took it out of me i'm just not used to streaming since i haven't been streaming so i gotta work up to it i like this one this one makes me think of my road trip video i use it in my road trip video makes me sad didn't used to make me sad now it makes me sad i'm not saying no to another 12-hour nance stream i'm just saying i gotta work up to it i'm saying i can't do a 12-hour ant stream right now [Music] just watch the ghost dog spawns i don't have a spot so all my jazz is from epidemic sound it is a stock oh why do i my blinker on stock music i have no playlist i feel like i always feel that way um hogwarts i get i get pretty drained from social interaction that's nothing new to me i'm feeling starved for it right now which is a new feeling for me being like man i wish i could see my friends this makes me sound like a bad friend to say that i don't typically feel like seeing my friends but it's a little bit true i take some convincing you can't kind of have to lure me out of the house but now it's like i can't do it uh it was also like this kind of you know the quarantine and stuff happened you know right not right after but you know i just moved back up here from texas to reconnect with friends and stuff and you know wanted to have people over and that is not now i'm kind of like stuck inside just like i was in texas it's like the same you know same thing exactly we unite when it when it eventually feels right every once in a while i think i might do one more route after this i'm feeling good i kind of want to hit that three hour mark at least i'll do one more round [Music] it's been nice to chill and chat it's almost like social interaction it's uh you know it's a it's communicating oh i'm not parking this i'm not even gonna try i'm not even gonna try i am in a hurry now [Music] no thank you that's true all chatbots but i can pretend you know [Music] and i've had friends been inviting me to play stuff online i haven't really done it because i'm a piece of [ __ ] [Music] i've been playing a little bit of runescape here and there i wouldn't say a ton [Music] okay just the problem is when my friends want to play games it's like at the computer when i'm at this computer i feel like i should be doing something productive i don't i used to like play games do a short one for fun and stuff on my pc but not really anymore this is like it's work time when i'm here i agree cinema bob i like to i like to interact this way do i need to get the i have the truck this time replay norwood sweeter off-peak um i would say there's a possibility i would say specifically with tails from off-peak city when he releases another volume of that i feel like it's likely or at least possible that i'll want to replay volume one before i start volume two [Music] okay we're holland gypsum which i don't know what that is but we're taking it to oregon eugene oregon it's like a mineral that i'm hauling i can't even see the trailer behind me so i don't even know oh look at this damn oh it is a mineral okay hell yeah tales of off-peak is so good all the games that he's made at least the ones i guess i've played three of them i don't know if he's made more really enjoyed i find uh cosmo d's work to be really inspirational [Music] biggest dam in the country is that is that this one what is it what's its name big old dam listen to me drive while while you drive drive better than i'm driving that's my request oh hoover damn that would make sense i've heard that's probably the only damn that i've heard of [Music] is there another dam what's another dam i would know of hoover dam big old dam they have bridges in this game that have weight limits and you have to drive around them i don't i don't think so i don't think the bridge is going to collapse uh i wouldn't be surprised if your routes take you off highways because of your weight that would seem like something you would include in a simulator game but i i don't know [Music] the dim stale dimmer damn [Music] rand coulee dam that actually maybe sounds like something that uh well it's in the past we're not good wherever it is is we're not going i've considered deadly premonition they're on my radar um [Music] i think the past couple years i've said maybe halloween so maybe halloween but [Music] my maybes don't at this point my babies don't carry that much weight i feel like damn is in nevada yeah i have no idea [Music] i think i've seen a brian david gilbert video i know the i know the guy i can't remember which videos of his i've seen i don't i don't watch the polygon stuff does he post him on polygon polygon may be mad i don't remember what it was i think it was their shenmue 3 review something stupid and so i don't go there anymore because i'm i'm that guy i think i've probably seen some of his own his stuff on his own channel it's like me and the like charmin like i won't i won't use charmin anymore because of the stupid bear commercials and it really has no nothing to do with the quality of the product i just just can't the those stupid [ __ ] bears man i just i can't use that toilet paper i won't buy it i mean i'll use it i guess if i didn't know but i won't buy it yeah those stupid bears skipper completely ignore the commercials i've seen the like if they stopped the bear commercials if i if if i saw [Music] like a charming commercial and it was just a commercial of pillows i don't know how you make a toilet paper commercial outside of we make toilet paper put it on your butt that's all you need then i would reconsider but as long as those bears are still in rotation it's not happening not happening [Music] once they did that stupid tiny dance and it was over it was over well they signed up for it it sure seems like the bears don't mind their identity being completely tied to poop i guess i feel more bad for like real bears in general because i don't know maybe someone watches those commercials and is like you know bears poop all the time real real bears they poop all the time and they are always singing about their butt i just don't like bears so that's not fair that's not fair to real bears i just don't like anything it's like the new the new toucan sam commercial like oh my god i hate that toucan sam bring back bring back my old toucan sam [Music] i would i'm not surprised i would not if people like that the design i would not be surprised it's very now that that design is very uh modern and i see a lot of a lot of animations that look just like that so does not surprise me very now style i don't like it i just i just want the old one back he's like a different it's like a different bird and you know i eat so many fruit loops you guys know how i'm always talking about fruit loops and how much i'm constantly eating them i think i think i should get what i want weird kfc ad campaign i kind of like kfc's campaign honestly um i don't know what you're talking about now but they're i like their idea of different people playing the kernel based on the commercial's theme or uh the product they're selling i like that idea they kind of gotten into that bigger trouble for the commercials i didn't hear about it i didn't see any kfc's closed why does who have tea do they do a different kernel one that i don't know about colonel sanders should have teeth oh yeah i remember the the dating sim colonel yeah it's a very uh twitter oh yeah sam has toucan samus teeth now it's true well it's because he's got that uh i don't know if there's a name for side mouth going on where it's not like a real beak it's just like a little cartoony mouth on the side of his face how are you going to do out of that without tea yeah 500 bucks for that or whatever [Music] sonic's got a real mao and i have a side mouth that i know of i wonder how two k like modern toucan sam would look like talking to me straight on is it just like a front side merry christmas everybody don't forget to work on those letters to santa [Music] the quarantine is still going on by christmas do you think there's gonna be like santa practice his social distancing guidelines you should do it are we gonna see santa in a mask it's interesting to think about a hundred percent santa's not he's not coming this year he's just gonna he's gonna facetime you everyone you know what no here it is here it is to practice safe guidelines santa's he's just gonna leave your gifts on the roof so new tradition is going to be climbing up on top

his app he'll have a santa app you can how did i do with my christmas delivery [Music] that's i mean i feel like that's the more obvious santa is magic uh so he does but you know didn't it it might like i'm pretty sure i read that it like came from animals could be transferred i don't know exactly but are we sure that they can't that kovid can't be you know spread by mystical elves are we gonna take that risk are we gonna put a mask on santa and have them leave our presents up on the roof it's the only option that's the only option uh to stay safe presents on the roof i'm calling it this year 2020 is the year [Music] i mean he's like so old right he wouldn't want to endanger himself santa's just sending e-cards this year he's just gonna send you an e-card with like a a free phone desktop background as an attachment for a gift your status on the good list will carry over until next year oh i like that drones they the technology is there man it could be a santa drone christmas [Music] you could put sleigh bells on a drone i don't know if you could hear it over the propellers but you could put sleigh bells on a drone [Music] well here's the thing here's our opportunity we see we're we see the opportunity now and the opportunity is to come up with the what's going to be the classic covid christmas carol it's got alliteration baked right in so what's the song gonna be all i want for christmas is you but from a respectable distance something like that you know that that there's gonna be this and there's gonna be like a lot of it it's fun to laugh about now but when december rolls around and everyone's uploading covid christmas humor it's gonna be miserable oh my god go it's like i'm hauling minerals up a giant hill or something stay another day at home oh yeah snl snl yeah are they still doing snl are they doing like remote snl are are talk shows just happening from people's homes now i don't i don't even know what's happening on tv i know that uh i know that drag race had to do their finale by teleconference i know that it's it's popular to like do like show not revivals but quarantine spin-offs wait so how good how good are maybe i need to watch some uh i want to know how good i am uh talk show hosts are posting from their bedroom is it just them and a camera are they basically youtubers now are they good at it or are they bad at it i am watching drag race all-star what a hamburger well i'm gonna have to look up some clips of that it sounds uh interesting [Music] i could see john oliver still being pretty good there's some people that i think have worked on stuff um that would make me think that they would you know hold their own without an audience but some people i feel like i only know as like talk show hosts yeah like what is jimmy kimmel doing is everyone just lip syncing to songs every time i think about like modern tv what people are doing on tv it's always like lip syncing to songs everyone wants to or it's like a singing thing lots of singing maybe [Music] captain fan fan oh my god i thought i ran over something captain banta uh captain phantom 5 tick oh captain fantastic thank you for the prime step sorry i was just talking about last stream i need to brush up on my lead skills oh that's what tech talk is doing [Music] chemical kimmy thank you so very much for the four months speaking of christmas and bad movies i'd love to suggest bad christmas movies as a video topic my personal favorite is the santa claus 3 the escape claws but there are so many to choose from it's really not a bad idea for a christmas uh thing um i don't know if i would do multiple movies but it would be fun to talk about about another bad christmas movie it depends on if i like if i looked for one and i watched a bunch of garbage and didn't find something amazing then a general one would play better but i'd be interested to find a uh maybe a more compelling christmas b movie that could take up a full video [Music] also an interesting idea would just be to be to like talk about my favorite christmas specials or just christmas specials that i enjoy from shows i have not played the movies yet i own it uh but i have never played it i always wanted to play when i was young but i don't know i don't think my computer could run it or something do i turn here do i go i don't know as i turn here i'm supposed to turn i wish this gps gave me directions is there a car back there like other than a line on the map it needs to be like turn left here turn right here don't you cut in front of me don't you you that's what i would have done that's right [ __ ] now what are you gonna do you're stuck too [Music] that's right you stop you stop go first this is my road [Music] you stay back there i've not seen the year without uh without santa claus can't say i've seen that one [Music] i don't even really remember the santa claus i'm pretty sure i've seen the first one holiday inn is a movie i know it's a hotel i don't think there's a christmas movie that i watch every year i think if if if there was one it's probably a christmas story i feel like i not that i go out of my way to watch it every year but i think i i do watch it pretty much every year that's not really one i would talk about in a video i don't think i like to watch hocus pocus on halloween i feel like i'm more regular with that or i used to be i'm starting up again this year hocus pocus every halloween i think they're working on a sequel final like they keep talking about it i bet it's bad i'll watch it but i can't imagine it's it's gonna be good maybe it'll be good i shouldn't discount it before it's been made i got the original cast it could be okay i don't know scary godmother i know halloweentown i've seen the second one a lot i just i remember disney channel playing the second one way more than the first one so i know the second one is scary godmother like a disney movie what is it what is it cream butter to hot

another uh go-around [Music] hate that you didn't hate it i guess i'm lucky that i hated it then i guess it would have been a much worse scenario to discover that i like twinkie wiener sandwiches and i want to eat more of them probably not a good outcome not been to franklin's barbecue in austin but i bet it's great babish liked it but forgot to dip it in milk did i dip it in milk when i ate it or did i just eat it i don't even remember i remember that i wore a costume that's what stands out to me when i think of twinkie wiener saying i remember not liking it and i remember wearing a costume i did okay oh [ __ ] oh no it's fine i'm just gonna try that's fine i'm just gonna drive over it it's okay don't worry oh anyone question my driving skills anymore uh just don't i'm the best driver get on my level i like to see you guys do that because you can't nobody's got skills like me i thought it was for sure gonna like i could i could not believe that it was going to have me fall off a cliff you know like this game it's all invisible walls you just bump on [ __ ] i thought it was gonna have me actually fall off a cliff oh well i'm glad i did another route that was that was worth the new route on its own i should get money for that they keep taking money for like traffic infractions i should get money for pulling off cool tricks thank you for the bits uh see c3 row see uh cairo set good cause three row how do you say your name how do you how do you say that how would i pronounce that [Music] we will play central high again we probably will never win but we'll uh we'll try it thank you so much for the bits saro oh well that makes a lot of sense that makes a lot more sense than what i was trying thank you cerro sarosaro i was just like last stream talking about leet and how i was gonna speak more elite because uh i don't remember why i was saying that but for some reason i said i was gonna speak more leads and i'm getting tripped up on these names today it's disappointing [Music] so other ian happy you were able to make it here ooh hacksaws oh those were the days were they i don't know they were days as far as the internet concern is concerned i think those were the days at least for me i'm definitely nostalgic for those uh the way the internet used to be was there an ace attorney character that's spoken lead i would believe that i believe though i really wish i'd played more of those games i was so invested in the first three i ate the original trilogy up when i played it on the 3ds and then i just never really kept that momentum going i played a little bit of apollo justice i tried to get into multiple times and i just i just didn't i think it's because i played them while i was if i remember correctly i played those while i was traveling more or i still had a job maybe um and that made it easier because i i have a hard time playing like 3ds games like a story game that i got to focus on i'm usually multitasking unless i'm you know on the go couldn't get into apollo justice i know people are torn on that one but i don't think that it was any other reason for me at least other than i just wasn't committed to uh thank you playing the game so that's the thing is i see people say that they don't get through it they don't like it and then some people say that apollo justice is their favorite one so i really want to i want to play all of it just so i know how i feel about it but i just never did got more into edgeworth than phoenix wright see the idea of playing as edgeworth doesn't um i think that's one of the issues with apollo justice is switching protagonists in a in a series is i guess difficult for me i don't know if i just need to to mentally prepare myself but i'm not interested in playing as really anyone um but phoenix and then don't they like isn't gumshoe not in the i think he's in the edgeworth games but is uh gumshoe in apollo justice is if gum shoes not in it like is it is it really worth playing makes a cameo that's not the same i should try him though i should try maybe maybe one day stream but i don't know i'd be really worried with people helping me with those games that's what i i came to believe was that gumshoe was really mostly featured in the original trilogy and that's it which is fine but it's like my favorite character my favorite characters were definitely gumshoe and old bag is she still around uh because she was hilarious old bag made me laugh like every time same with gumshoe they were just great really funny characters when she has that uh when she's in that space suit or whatever with her little toy gun [Music] missing after the originally original trilogy but heavily featured in edgeworth maybe i need to play the edgeworth ones then if the old bag and gumshoe are in the edgeworth ones and maybe that's where i need to go well that's fun you get to play old bag that's awesome that's a fun idea ooh i remember turnabout big top i feel like my favorite wasn't in three i feel like my favorite case my favorite case was uh oh my god i always forget i don't know any of the case names it's the one with i think it's eenie meenie it's when you when you learn how to do the uh that thing where you look into people's minds with the locks it's been a while um second case of justice for all is that the second or the third game the trilogy is is one game in my mind i don't really know where one big like just in my memory they've all like smushed together second game okay because i played them as a collection and i played them one after the other and it was kind of like just continuing the game chef in the third game oh it sounds familiar but i don't remember well now i want to play now i want to play ace attorney we'll see i'll think about it i'll think about it i would not be opposed um because if i played the tr is this where they want me to go home store if if i played the trilogy i wouldn't like lose it if someone spoiled something for me i would just be you know regular resentful but since i've already played them it wouldn't be like you know you ruined it would i wear a suit if i play them probably not that sounds uncomfortable you know me i want to be comfy i want to wear my cardigans i want to want to wear my uh sweatshirts maybe a lawyer badge yeah i could clip on a lawyer badge all right i'm wrapping it up i went a little bit longer than i even expected to just because i was having so much fun thanks for hanging out and chatting with me i really enjoy these chill chuck chill truck streams um it's fun playing games but it's also if i get i feel like i get to talk more and connect a little bit more which is fun uh we'll truck again sometime soonish eventually because idaho is coming out so there's an excuse to play it i will be back on today's wednesday right saturday i will be back on saturday at some point uh my plan is to play on the lgr machine um something windows 98 didn't work out this time so we will see if it works out next time alright that sounds good i miss this too i miss this too i think i think when i get stressed out i forget that i actually enjoy streaming sometimes it just sounds you know when i get really stressed out about other stuff it feels like this extra weight and pressure but uh i actually like to do it so i'm happy to be back on the schedule what a hamburger uh sh shabu rado shiburato video
