link in the video description so we're here in the LG booth where they actually downplayed the kind of monitor stuff they were showing off they were like oh yeah I don't really know if we have that much this year but some of this stuff even though it's iterative improvements is actually a big difference over what we've seen before so first of all we've got the ultrawide monitor curve for 9 WL 9 v seen it's a lot cooler than it sounds so just like samsung's recent 49 inch very very wide what are these like 32 by 9 aspect ratio yeah 32 by 9 aspect ratio display it's really really wide it's curved and it's optimized for kind of a combination I guess of productivity and/or super immersive gaming but unlike Samsung's instead of being limited to a 1080 vertical resolution which means that the entire image looked kind of grainy LG has gone one better and they've delivered a 50 120 by 1440 resolution on this thing so the image is much much finer now this means for gamers you're gonna have a pretty hard time driving it because this is effectively kind of a shortened 5k monitor but frankly you won't be worried about that anyway because it only runs at 60 Hertz but there's good news I was gonna walk out of the frame but sure we can work with this this is the 38 GL 950 G and this is a whole other ball of wax now I had given LG a hard time in the past for selling gaming monitors that didn't have support for in videos g-sync and here they are their timing is impeccable right as Nvidia announced that regular adaptive sync displays can run G sync now LG's here with the G sync module in their monitor but that's not to say that having a g-sync module is pointless even now because it means that you've got a very very wide variable refresh rate window means you've got support for adaptive pixel overdrive so you're not gonna get more or less smearing depending on the refresh rate of the display and in this case it means because they're using the module they can drive this thing at 38 40 by 1600 which is the same as the 38 inch ultra wide that's on my desk except that instead of 75 Hertz they have nearly doubled that to a hundred and forty-four Hertz native and it can actually overclock to 175 now all of that is with a nano IPS panel that means 98% DCI p3 color gamut coverage like this thing is basically best of all worlds that I can really identify oh and if you're into it it's got this reactive lighting thing that goes on that you can either have sync up with your video or your audio or with the download you can set it to just like some color if you want now it's not coming anytime soon they have no pricing information for us whatsoever but hey the future is now later bringing us somewhat awkwardly and abruptly to this thing so the only notes I have about the 38 CK 950 N is that there's no pricing available at this time that's pretty much all I got I'm gonna have to wing the rest of this this is a weird there's a weird product okay so this is what is it 38 40 by 1600 yeah that's right it's got a webcam built into it right up there at the top it's 60 Hertz so you know nothing groundbreaking as far as that goes so this is just like the monitor on my desk except that it's got a computer built into it so it's got a rise in three APU with eight gigs of RAM 128 gigs of SSD storage and like no OS pre-installed on it it seems to be like kind of a business-to-business play but it's like backwards normally you'd have the system division slap a display on a computer and in this case we've got the monitor division slapping a computer into a display so it's like I don't know let me know in the comments below what is this why do you think it exists I'd love to hear from you there's one in the video description and we will see you guys at the next CES booth hey come on I'm trying to all right I guess there's the gram but there's new grams this one looks pretty cool we're gonna review it really soon our review units like in the mail sixteen by ten display
