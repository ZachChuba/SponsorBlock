haier I come to a new video as you can see we're not at my place we're not in Berlin also not in Germany because we're in Canada Vancouver we are here for LTX 2019 the Linus tech tips convention which is going to be held over there in the Vancouver Convention Center right now it's Friday we're going to visit Linus tech tips studio today just see what we can see there if we can meet some other youtubers maybe just walk around the studio tomorrow so tomorrow Saturday and Sunday we will visit the LTX itself will visit Steve J and all those we will meet we will also do some a funny challenge I would say they will have to do a keyboard puzzle basically I will remove all the caps from a keyboard and they will have to pass it in the keyboard caps but that will be a separate video so today we will just go to Linus and see how it goes [Music] link in the description below unfortunately I couldn't shoot all scenes in German and English that's why I'm just doing a voiceover for this part where we visited the office of Linus tech tips starting with visiting Anthony and he was just working on some stuff for Reisen 3000 so Anthony what are you up to right now right now I'm writing my will actually I've already written it but a rise in overclocking cut as you probably know already there's over cooking is great there yeah but there is a lot to you overclocking horizon yeah I mean there's a lot of things that you can do not many things that actually do anything so did you try CCX overclocking yeah I do it I went for per CC X overclocking I noticed that actually I ran into it before I realize what it was for core overclocking and you set a high core then the lower cores clock down way alert light wind lower because of the divider yeah so per CC X little walking is the the way that I recommend people do it yeah it's just a lot more efficient a lot more likely to bring you better results overall I think so too especially if you have two triplets like twelve core 16 core it looks like one triplet might be better than the other one yeah I mean statistically the I like if you had a single die in your CPU then you go to having two dies then you've actually quartered the number of the chances of you actually getting two good dies yeah versus a single die like it's it's actually quite a stick did like its statistical not an impossibility but it is statistically very unlikely that you'll get two very good dies that's correct that's correct yeah also I think I mean you can tune it more for like gaming where you have one cc X that's clock very high and for the rest you don't have to clock them very high for gaming no no game is going to use - of course yeah especially if you if you yeah if you switch to a single CCD and use something like process class so to make sure that the game runs on that CCD yes and you make sure that the CCD is pocket-sized it'll go you can Clough the other one down yeah exactly yeah so kind of like like big dot little in in smartphones yeah yeah good point right I will leave you in peace ok and 0 and cool see you at all - yes wait you're using scripts yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] - one came one hurricane here we came across the inventory system of Linus tech tips which was really really impressive the way they are sorting and storing all their hardware's in keeping an overview there is this laptop thing next to me which I'm just going to skip that's not that interesting but what is really interesting is how they are marking and storing their CPUs they have a binary system where they mark all the CPUs with different colors and different like a barcode and that's how they can always know who and where the CPU is and who is using the CPU at this specific moment very brilliant idea however this system is just used for the CPUs and the graphics cards just have a typical barcode sticker on them you can see in the shelf next to me they have all the recent reviews like 20 atti 20 80 super 20 60 super going over to this shelf to the site they are storing older GPUs for example I found at one of 10 80s 10 60s and also gtx 280 which is a lot older so really cool to see what kind of treasures they are storing in their warehouse i guess most of you are already familiar with the lines tech tips studio but this is where they are also shooting most of the stuff for the tech quickie youtube channel and now we're just walking through the Linus tech tips studio next to me they built up a very impressive apartment where they have different locations so they can provide different scenes to you which makes the videos overall more interesting if you're just watching all the videos every single day that's something I just cannot provide you always have to watch my boring IKEA shelf which is always in the back of my videos but just walking through the Linus tech tip studio was extremely impressive he was doing some studio tours at the same time so just walking around this corner right here you could see Linus giving a studio tour to some of his fans that's what he was doing on Friday before LTX now visiting in the workshop of Linus tech tips and this is really a grown-up man's playground behind me you can see some stuff I'm not sure about but then on the right you can see small stuff like drilling machines you can see a saw and walking around I also spotted the famous C and C which Linus has been using for a long time to manufacture special stuff like water cooling blocks which they were using for example for cooling in notebooks which is something really really cool and I wish I had something like this in my office now they also have a conventional CNC in a lathe which I think will give them more opportunities to do special videos and provide more cooling gear which they can produce by themselves and also other tools Saturday afternoon I had a meeting read together with Linus at the same time and it was just crazy how many people were lining up just to take photos get an autograph yeah that was really a time I enjoyed and I didn't expect that so many people outside of Germany would really know me now it was time for some Diet Pepsi advertisement because for some reason I couldn't really find Coke Zero so had to stick to Diet Pepsi anyway next to me there was a PC building workshop the LMG crew provided some other cases VGA s main boards CPUs BGA's HDDs and everything you need I fix it toolkits really I can recommend them and basically you could just line up there and visit the pc building workshop and learn how to assemble a PC if you've never been doing that before and I mean it doesn't really matter if you're starting on a PC that's from 10 years ago or if you're starting to build a PC now because everything is still the same then I came across the retro PC gaming area and that was absolutely amazing behind me you could see a PC which was one in Craig 3 and on top of this PC I spotted this box of a 3d FX guru 5508 GP I was just thinking about getting this card for one of my Hardware Legend series so if I should maybe do a video of one of those cards for my hub religion serious let me know in the comments and I might acquire one of them Craig Fiorina is a game I used to play quite a lot when it was released especially together with my brother actually my brother was playing a lot more and then I was doing and I was just watching but I still have a lot of great memories for this game the coolest thing about the retro gaming area is that everything fits perfectly together we have old keyboards we have CRT monitors and of course we have a mouse with a good old ball inside it's a chronometer here in Vacaville [Music] [Music] next to the retro gaming area we also had a retro shop where you could acquire for example t-shirts all kind of a fan gear and also old CPUs for example Core 2 Duo CPUs which people could use for deleting in there deleting workshop and here we have the case toss competition and yeah I kind of failed and sucked at this competition because I threw rather high than far but still was kind of cool to participate besides the activities there were also booths for example from arrows where they were just exhibiting some of the new gaming monitors BGA's and peripherals few hours later the LMG crew had to wrap those cases inside some rep because they were falling apart so many people were throwing those cases that they started to fall apart [Music] [Music] continuing the journey through LTX 2019 they also had some arcade machines for example you could play Donkey Kong on there I saw plenty of people just hanging out there and having a good time [Music] one of my favorite activities was the virtual RC cars I tried to participate three times but whenever I showed up either the car was not working or there were too many people lining up so I decided to skip and just film it but it was really really cool and I think the people who participated had a great time and also MSI was exhibiting some of their hardware like gaming monitors and for some reason they were also exhibiting radio and seven reference design not really sure why you would show that on an exhibition if it's a reference design but anyway I think MSI might have a good reason to show it on here in the back we had the motherboard house of cards and basically there was a huge box filled with old and broken main boards you could just pick the main boards out of the box and build the house of cards [Music] thankfully Linus keeps dropping boards that's why they obviously had this massive box full of broken MAME words thanks Linus for keeping up the supply and I think there were most of them were like from socket 775 area like what to do oh the sockets didn't really look great but people had a great time here for sure [Music] my favorite part was the CPU the living area where people could just stop by and lead their own CPUs which they brought with them and actually stole this idea for games come 2019 keep pushing you have a CPU yeah just going for it a little bit more what is it it's off yeah more more more MORE yeah we'll make it easier for you Oh [Music] in the middle of LTX we found a small booth raikage's sit down and play Mario Kart that's what we usually do quite often in our free time that's why we decided to have a little break and enjoy a round of Mario Kart [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and vulnerable I think it's kind of it's a it's a dangerous I've heard it as much as like that maybe a decade ago but well used to be all over Apple's marketing class and they do [Music] so much about LTX 2019 it was amazing and thanks so much line is for having us thanks for giving us the merge for free what's also wearing you're unaware but don't tell anyone I hope it was okay for you guys that I just did the voiceover for this video because I couldn't really shoot everything twice it was not really possible on this exhibition I will try to do it of course next time but I think voiceover should be fine let me know if wise overs are fine or if I should not do that again in future thanks for watching and see you soon [Music] [Music] you
