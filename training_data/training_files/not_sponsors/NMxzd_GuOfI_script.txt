illinit ii the embodiment of all that is morally wrong in a human being wrapped neatly behind a pair of sweater puppies proudly displayed in front of a million children under the shallow disguise of a gamer girl if you clicked on this video you've probably at least heard her name before but for the purpose of catching up those who are out of the loop as well as to get a clear bird's-eye view of the whole picture today we're gonna dive deep into the mysterious and frequently infuriating tale of illinit II before and let's get back into the video elyda tea is like a raccoon who keeps showing up in everyone's backyard every once in a while it makes you look out the window like she is out there again hide your cats hide your kids and hide your husband's while you're at it especially if they work at twitch um allegedly we'll get to that part in a moment but first let's take a look at some of the more prominent controversies illinit he has found herself in [Music] for a long time now twitch has been the market leader for gaming and live-streaming even today with companies like Microsoft pouring in tons of cash in hopes of competing with twitch through their platform mixer even with YouTube and Facebook adapting their own platforms to take a chunk of the market twitch has maintained the number one spot by a landslide but over the years their reputation has started to dwindle for a number of factors one of them being their consistent mishandling of a phenomenon colloquially known as the rise of twitch thoughts the word thought originated as an acronym for that over there which in association with twitch has become a casual gaming slang defined by urban dictionary as a girl that is using twitch as an ear porn website to get donations from young boys the girl is fully aware of what she's doing but if someone calls her out she's going to defend herself by saying someone is sexist and oddly enough the image they found most illustrative of the term is a picture of illinit II now there's a whole debate to be had whether the gaming community is being sexist or if female streamers really are pushing the limits a little too far because over the years there's been a growing market on twitch for women not doing a lot of gaming but instead luring in a predominantly male audience with overly sexual patterns of behavior living off of their donations and subscription revenue with minimal effort and talent if any at all I think I should mention at this point that I don't object to women monetizing their bodies if they choose to make money that way I think it shouldn't be anybody's business to intervene the problem here is that twitch claims to be a platform for gamers and by not enforcing rules against overly sexual content and on top of that systematically banning people who do far less than exploiting these loopholes they watered down their credibility as a gaming platform elyda tea is a top example for bending these rules I can't show any clips of her suggestive shenanigans because YouTube is far more strict about that than twitch so I'm gonna reenact them myself her moves include but are not limited to stretching adjusting her webcam twerking writing on a whiteboard you got damn it Wilfred get out of the way am I still in focus taking a picture of your own butt that's conveniently angled towards the webcam oops I totally didn't realize and various other activities with a focus on cleavage and aura buttocks now is there a problem with these activities on their own no but twitch has been multiple people specifically men who have reenacted these poses sarcastically that's kind of a double standard [Music] before May of 2018 elyda tea was nowhere near as infamous as she is today she was doing her thing steadily growing her twitch channel without being very visible on the YouTube scene that is until she appeared in a PewDiePie video all right so I tweeted a testing out eye tracker linking me some videos I should watch and they're not gonna win it over me stupid twitch thoughts no oh my god I'm trying to look away I have a hot beautiful girlfriend and I don't need to be distracted by twitch thoughts okay so Peter pie collectively uses the term twitch thoughts solidity sees an opportunity and she immediately jumps on it seriously who's that that the company illinit he works with takes PewDiePie's video down on no other basis then I don't like that he called us twitch thoughts completely ignoring copyright laws and fair use under which PewDiePie's video should have been protected ironically while claiming that PewDiePie was infringing copyright on her content she was doing the exact same thing by reacting to his video [Music] after the whole coffee strike Fiasco PewDiePie's fans started looking around for dirt on a linen tea which ironically was not that hard to find because remember a linen II is a raccoon and raccoons love dirt during a previous livestream elyda T herself told the story of how she committed marriage fraud went to medical school in Colombia and you don't want to be a doctor in Colombia it sucks like you don't make any money you work a lot so I was like no hell no so I married a Canadian and they came to Canada Hey and then I divorced them so there's obviously more to this story you should probably didn't just get the visa and divorce the guy but the whole thing feels scummy anyway if you managed to get a visa and escaped a hard life back home it's probably not a good idea to go around boasting about how you tricked the system I can't believe this is a point that anyone has to make out loud in fact there was an entire petition filed towards the Canada Border Services Agency for illinit II to get deported but once again a little team managed to escape the hand of justice [Music] throughout illinit east streaming career there's been multiple instances of her mistreating her cats due to strict youtube's policies regarding animal abuse I obviously can't show these videos but here's a list of some of them in illustrated forms she wrapped one of her cats in wrapping paper despite the cat being visibly uncomfortable she often sits on her cats yelling at them to give her her chair back despite them not understanding human language she fed one of her cats vodka despite common knowledge that alcohol is toxic to pets she tossed one of her cats across the room because it was obstructing her view and the list could go on upon neither of these actions twitch did not take any action even PETA stepped in and tweeted attention at twitch support take a stand for cats and please removal initi from twitch immediately she's using the platform to post animal abuse which sends a dangerous message to anyone watching her videos cats are not props to abuse for more views now if I were to throw wilfer across the room god damn it you're heavy if I were to toss him over I probably get Ben haven't even been active on twitch for two years at this point but I'm kind of feeling I would probably get a letter in the mail despite all of this illinit e has never faced any real consequences [Music] and finally the latest controversial litany has been in is when she what looks like intentionally flashed her nip to everyone in her chat you can look up the clip for yourself in my opinion she did this knowingly because scientifically if you're trying to put a pillow under your shirt there's no reason to lift it all the way up here now this happened about a week ago as I'm recording this in the same month that twitch came out with an update on there nudity policy stating we asked that you cover your campus we do not permit exposed underbust so many other people have gotten banned for showing far less skin in fact a mail streamer that goes by barstool Big Cat tweeted I was today years old when I learned that I cannot flash my cookies on a twitch stream even though they are mailed doing so can get you banned on Twitch and just a few days later a litany flashed her entire left boob and nothing happens the entire community started revolting like okay she gets away with abusing her cats she gets away with falsely claiming videos she gets away with generally being very unlikable as a public figure at least this time this blatant nudity policy infringement has to get her banned right well it kind of did but she literally had to ask the twitch mods to ban her when people started clamoring for her to get banned just like everybody else who broke the rules before her she tweeted out I hope I do get banned I think it would make my life so much easier reached out to tweets yesterday we will see later on coming back with I'm getting a suspension yes our hard work finally paid off good job guys but that doesn't really solve anything does it in fact it further proves the unhealthy power Eleni holds over the twitch moderators if you have to go to the police and be like guys but mean handcuffs for a little bit so that at least it looks like you're doing your job that's not the same as you facing legitimate consequences for breaking the rules something is seriously fishy about the whole dynamic between illinit II and the twitch moderator team there's been speculation out there that illinit e is either blackmailing the twitch mods or has some sort of romantic involvement with them and keep in mind the people in charge of who gets banned and who doesn't are completely anonymous their lack of transparency makes it impossible for the public to hold them accountable for their bias and if there is indeed some sort of shady relation with illinit e behind the scenes the anonymity of these people makes for the perfect cover-up what actually make salinity so indestructible well so many others are getting banned for days and weeks sometimes having their entire livelihood taken away let me know what you think is going on especially if you've ever had any experience with twitch bands or have witnessed any other examples of unfair treatment by the mods I'm curious to read your opinions on the subject but that's gonna be it for this video as always thank you for watching and we'll see you again very soon [Music] [Music] [Applause] Oh
