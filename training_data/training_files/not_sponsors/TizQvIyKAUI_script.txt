more on that later hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian and today we're going to be examining how Napoleon failed in his invasion of Russia [Music] it is often said that Napoleon's invasion of Russia was unsuccessful merely because of the harshness of the Russian winter however it doesn't take an experienced two-story in' to point out why this statement is highly reductive as with any historical event there's never just one answer and so the question remains how did Napoleon's army the largest and most experienced of all contemporary armies lose to a smaller and less experienced force the story begins when Napoleon seized control of France in 1799 his ultimate ambition was nothing less than to conquer Europe and as can be expected this sparked a string of conflicts creatively named the Napoleonic Wars in which successive coalition's all of which were spearheaded by Great Britain were formed in order to defeat the revolution trance was victorious against almost all of these coalition's but victory still came at a very high price as Britain essentially led all of these coalition's Napoleon decided that in order to prevent any more from forming against him he had to destroy the British war effort in 1806 Napoleon implemented a series of trade decrees known as the Continental system the ultimate goal of which was to ruin the British economy by restricting their trade with the rest of Europe especially with Russia one of Britain's the largest trading partners initially Napoleon only raised tariffs to discourage commerce but eventually all forms of trade were banned with England he expected every nation to comply under the threat of military retaliation his expectations would fall flat however as smuggling non-enforcement and even flat-out refusal were commonplace in the words of Adams Amoy ski author of 1812 Napoleon's fatal march on Moscow calls for peace with France might well have been fulfilled if British trade had really begun to suffer but in the long run France probably suffered more than Britain and Napoleon's continental system as he called it was in effect unenforceable as can be expected Russia was openly disregarding the Continental System by 1810 creating friction between itself and fresh this only served to make Napoleon anxious about his eastern holdings and in 1811 one year before the invasion of Russia was initiated he had already begun assembling his ground arm a a massive force that was composed of over six hundred and eighty-five thousand men and more than 1300 pieces of artillery in contrast the Russian army consisted of around 500,000 men 80,000 of whom were Cossacks and approximately the same amount of guns as the French therefore considering the quantity of troops each side had it seems as though the French held the advantage but as we'll see this was not the case in order to explore how the Grande armée was almost annihilated it is necessary to understand how Napoleon's armies had been sustained in his earlier campaigns how he conducted the invasion and how the Russians adapted to it in regards to the first point throughout his previous conquests Napoleon's soldiers were expected to live off the lands they marched through for the average French soldier this meant foraging the wilderness and taking crops and livestock from local farmers this strategy combined with logistic trains was sufficient in the beginning of the Russian campaign which began on the 24th of June 1812 when Napoleon crossed the river Nieman entering Russian territory after failing to destroy the Grande armée in several small battles the Russians who knew how important foraging was to Napoleon soldiers decided to retreat eastward in order to draw a Napoleon deeper and deeper into hostile territory and overextend his lines of supply and communication this constant retreat continued throughout the remainder of the summer before they would let Napoleon take Moscow however the Russians decided to engage his army in a large pitched battle in order to weaken and deplete it on the 7th of September the Russians and the French clashed outside of Moscow near the suburb of Borodino this battle which resulted in between 68 thousand and ninety thousand casualties proved to be bloodiest single-day of the Napoleonic Wars and although the French claimed victory they were exhausted when they finally entered into Moscow they were dismayed to find the city had been evacuated and set alight by the retreating Russians more than anything the burning of Moscow demonstrated to Napoleon that the Russians were so patriotic that they were unwilling to surrender it also exemplified the scorched earth policy that the Russians adopted in which crops livestock munitions and other resources were destroyed in order to prevent their use by the invaders Napoleon who was becoming increasingly wary of the lack of supplies which the scorched earth policy entailed wrote a letter to Alexander the first leader of Russia imploring him to capitulate however by the end of September Napoleon had to come to terms with the fact that the Russians would not surrender and with nothing to sustain itself the ground armed a began to starve Napoleon left Moscow on the 19th of October on the torturous March back home the grand armies remaining ranks were devastated by typhoid fever starvation and the bitter cold of the Russian winter the organization of Napoleon's forces began to crumble with any stragglers being picked off by Russian cavalry when the French finally crossed back into Poland on the 14th of December only 10,000 men of the original 685 thousand strong grand army were still fit for combat Napoleon was so severely weakened by the failure of his campaign that the nations of Europe including those of which were previously controlled by him formed a sixth coalition in March of 1813 within a year the French army which had never fully recovered from the invasion of Russia was defeated and expelled from the territories it occupied and Napoleon himself was exiled to the island of Elba however the Napoleonic Wars were not yet over description we'll get 20% off of their annual premium subscription
