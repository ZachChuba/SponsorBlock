hello guys and welcome back to yet another video well I'm finally back from holiday and if you want to be spammed by lots of holiday photos feel free to follow my Instagram that's linked in the description below now we've got to open up a package that came all the way from Austria to little old Adelaide in South Australia if you two would like to send me something my Parcel Post address is in the description below it also turns out that only about 15 are subscribed so be sure to subscribe and turn notifications on digging into the box we've got a healthy dose of packing peanuts as well as a letter from Alexander he says the laptop was used for filled service and he personally used it up until very recently the letter also mentions a CPU upgrade as well as a maxed out four gigabytes of RAM first to come out is the rather compact laptop as well as various documents along with an actual docking station thankfully the charging brick was also included with one final layer of plastic out of the way I can see that it is indeed a Fujitsu Siemens life book a brand partnership that I'm pretty sure doesn't make any sorts of computers anymore overall the laptop is in very good condition and has clearly been looked after I'm going to guess that the core to joy sticker was added after the CPU upgrade now has it actually survived shipping I think it's time we power it on and find out relieving Lee it sprung into life with a t90 300 Core 2 Duo processor and 4 gigabytes of RAM both Linux and Windows 7 are installed on the hard disk I'm definitely far more familiar with Windows 7 not so much when it's not in English though the battery seems to be holding a charge and the system functions fun now that I know that it does indeed work I'm going to put in a cheap solder SSD and redo the thermal the first thing that stuck out to me on the base is the ability to remove the CPU dust filter this is something I've never actually seen on any of the laptop with the battery removed and a few Phillips head screws later we've got access to all the components we won that pesky RAM was hiding under this little door another design feature I absolutely love is the easy access to the CPU in most laptops you'd have to extensively disassemble them to remove the CPU heatsink with a quarter turn of the release mechanism I can take a closer look at the processor this has indeed been upgraded from the stock CPU the t90 300 is one of the best CPUs you can fit in this laptop I used some isopropyl alcohol to clean the Dyer which now looks pretty shiny this pace definitely wasn't applied to long ago however I'd much rather use arctic mx4 which I know does a decent job with both the heatsink and CPU cleaned off I applied the new thermal paste perhaps a little bit too much but it will spread thinly over the Dyer once the cooler is back in place next up it's time to replace the old mechanical hard disk this crucial BX 500 will boost the laptops responsiveness and make for a much better experience switching over the drive caddy is as easy as removing two Phillips head screws with a little bit of persuasion the SSD fit in the slot to help remove bacteria I'm going to start with a dab of eucalyptus oil laptops can be deceptively dirty and I'd highly recommend cleaning the surfaces if you buy one secondhand to begin cleaning the display and gently wiped it with an antibacterial cloth with the smudges and debris removed I use some lens cleaner and a microfiber cloth to get the surface looking really clean with a little bit more eucalyptus oil I clean the top of the case aside from some small marks it's held up pretty well for a laptop that's nearly third years old with it all back together I turn the system back on thankfully it still worked and it does indeed detect the SSD now we're going to boot into my Windows 10 installer and you guessed it install Windows 10 with the drive formatted the install could finally begin about 20 minutes later it was done now that we've got the laptop looking a whole lot cleaner puts a new thermal paste on and install the solid-state drive what is it actually capable of Star Wars Battlefront 2 is playable if somewhat choppy running at 1280 by 800 lower settings the Intel GMA graphics are without a doubt the bottleneck with this system the newest graphics drivers I could find wouldn't load any OpenGL applications which sadly means no minecraft this may have more to do with me running this outdated hardware with Windows 10 though a far older title Age of Empires 2 runs great if this didn't run well I'd be very concerned old school runescape is also a great experience back in 2007 this is exactly what I was playing times sure were much simpler back then hello guys and woke my definition youtube playback was nice and smooth it's also fairly hard to film this screen normally I do not have any problems filming LCD displays CPU performance in Cinebench r15 wasn't amazing which is expected it scored 130 for running the test again the CPU didn't exceed 74 degrees Celsius even under full load which means the thermal paste is definitely doing its job for such a compact 13 inch laptop you still got features such as an optical drive 3 audio jacks firewire Ethernet PC card vga under a little flap as well as a slot to put a 3g SIM card in but if that's not enough for you the easily detachable dock expands your options even further perhaps that's a little bit too much expansion not only is this laptop fairly zippy with the SSD installed it's also very compact and really well built for a device made in 2007 I'd say it was truly ahead of its time while the Fujitsu Siemens brand don't seem to make laptops anymore Fujitsu on their own actually do honestly have you ever seen anyone recently using a brand new Fujitsu laptop this German main device is very easy to upgrade and quite functional with a few basic upgrades thank you very much for watching if you've liked what
