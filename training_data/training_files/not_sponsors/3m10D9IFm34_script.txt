we're slowly gaining altitude in our Ferrari here in the Hollywood Hills here in the Hollywood Hills in my Ferrari what I like more than Ferraris solid knowledge Ashley please sign up for all of the things we're pitching hello everybody and lo hello can't tell by the shaking GoPros and the loud engine behind us we're in another very special car also in LA also in LA this is a Ferrari 488 spider this car is so special it is so fast it's so bright red it's so cool just I love have just things to say I love it oh yeah what do you have to say I don't like the red why that's Ferrari and it's whole thing is red why I would get this great what I know what Caron gray know I know I I like I love the chorus performance like that's so much fun but why I don't know I'm not overwhelmed by the paint job it looks kind of cheap honestly like there's no it's like even the BMW's that we've driven there's like a sparkle to it this is just like a flat red that's like Ferraris whole thing it's boring Wow JT hates for are on the record I hate for our JT hates Ferraris in it I like the shade of red they just need to fancy up the paint a little bit it doesn't look like the paint job on a $250,000 car I'm shocked that is so baffling to me because I love the red I love Ferrari red and I love this in red and if you get this in gray you're a boring person and that's just how it is yeah everybody looks at you and they look at you some people look at you in one way and some people look at you in another way yeah look at this yeah it really is one of those - I feel like everybody looks at you with disgust and envy or they look at you admiration wijl admiration and joy I here we go oh my god haha I love it I love it so much so this is much quicker on the uptake than the Lamborghinis rose it goes it just goes yes there still I mean a slight delay as it ramps up but nowhere near as long as the earth yeah now that thing like it soon when you're in like at about like the 2,000 rpm range where I was right there and you hit on the gas it immediately launches and takes you off a rolling start is the way to do it in this car yeah for sure I mean you can do it from you can do it from a light and still lots of fun but if you if you just kind of coasting you're creeping along in 2nd or 3rd and you stop it yeah best Wow that is an experience that really does just like throw you it back into your seat and just give you all the butterflies in your stomach now it still doesn't feel the same as a Tesla P 100 d the difference is with this list you can do that all day except every day you don't have to no internet special it's never gonna overheat you're not gonna like overheat the battery and then you can't do it because you've got to let it cool down yeah you're never gonna do that with this which is why I would take this over a Tesla if I had the money this would take over me I love this car and I also love the Tesla and they're so wildly different they are that's an interesting one I like this more yeah [Music] what do you think about the exterior other than the color that you take really nice yeah I like it very it's very different than Lamborghini that we reviewed last time I thought this is more it's got more sweeping line it's more screws and the Lamborghinis all like angles and stuff but yeah I think I said this about for a Senate earlier off-camera but I'm gonna say it again right now for everybody else yeah Ferraris design language seems to be more about like beauty like beautiful shapes elegance and I'm making like art I feel like a nice swoopy art yeah whereas Lamborghini the designer it feels like somebody's like coked up with a knife and they're just like creating the angles on the blueprint man there's like cutting and cutting and making it like angular sharp and which I really worry yeah historically like in the past I would have said I prefer how Ferraris look but now I've kind of come around I really like Lamborghinis design language that's really interesting is I almost feel like I've been in the reverse yeah I really like Lamborghinis but now I think I prefer Ferrari mode I do I like the more subtle Ferraris I like the California for example yeah or they like the 812 superfast nothing about this is subtle now what do you think more between the front of the car versus the back of the car that's a tough call because for me that was a big debate from the front like a like a quarter angle from the front you see the giant scoops in the sides which I love but from the back man that looks so good I might have to say the back honestly yeah I think I actually agree I love the way that the front looks and I love the side profile but I love the way the back looks yeah that's also cool as you can pop open that back like there's like a hatch you can open up and look at yeah to look at the engine so even in the spider version you can see the engine which I really appreciate a small compartment so you don't see a ton of the ended but it's know you can still peek in there and look at it actually like that's pretty dope you also have like a good from in the front I can't fit in that thing I fit in the front of a Ferrari dalek will show you out I'll show you I can fit in the Frog I think the insight is one of the most unique interiors it probably is the most unique interior of any car I've ever sat in because every single last detail every last thing is focused towards me yeah the drive is all angled towards the driver nothing is at all here for the passenger careful the passenger the passenger does not matter whatsoever in this car I have a vent I had one able to me yeah it is even that one way over there is angled towards me and not you yeah I guess I get a little bit of a cross-breeze but like literally everything here this is angled towards me every single thing it's just like gauges dials buttons which is as a puppy I mean this is a driver's car it is like if you have a passenger cool but it's not that's not too much for but everything is angled towards me it's like wild like the passenger has nothing I guess you have the glovebox you know for that that's all you got yeah all you can do that's my fun for the drive carbon fiber is everywhere and it's the real deal as cargo drivers everywhere we've got the door panels here you've got the center like they've got cutouts here to save space on the carbon fiber that's how much they care about weight reduction the open fire we're here for the center console carbon fiber on the dash carbon fiber on the vents carbon fiber on the steering wheel it's an amazing interior it feels very special it does and it's actually really comfortable like it is basically comfortable the seats are firm and they hold you well the bolsters are just right yeah but it's not uncomfortable you're not like sitting on a plank or anything yeah it's not bad I mean we're just driving through like random kind of like suburbia we're trying through suburban streets right now in this and it's it's alright yes it's not a bad Cruiser yeah it's less harsh than the Lotus Evora less harsh than the Lotus you've got the bolsters are much more pleasant than something like an Alfa Romeo Giulia yeah it was definitely a cramped this is over more room yeah like you can slide to the sides and then not come out whereas the Juliet like you can't even slide because they're so aggressive yeah and they didn't need to be so if a Ferrari can do bolsters right come on alfrid man yeah okay so one thing I want to point out that's kind of interesting like just in keeping with the theme of everything being driver centric everything you do is on the steering wheel even like the turn signal I love that you use your thumbs to use the turn signals you never have to move your hands off the steering wheel yeah you can completely keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times there's never any reason for you to take it off everything is just right here like it's the whole reason the horn is like little rotors I love it by the end of your hand you can just press you eat now you don't even have to move it the handling is our size precise [Music] the automatic is good too and it will if you heard those beeps it's telling you to shift yeah which is it's kind of cool you've got shift lights built into your steering wheel yeah up in a little bar it goes through a sequence of lights and then it starts beeping at you if you're not shifting it's really cool I kind of wish it wouldn't do that in automatic because that's the cars job is to shift for you yeah it's say it will shift for you it'll still do it it just beeps well it does yeah even when you have the top up on a hot day like this all you need to do if you really want to hear the engine is you push this button right here oh yeah oh look what just happened they got a little magic window they have a little magic window that opens behind you and then [Music] that is so good there's nothing really behind you except there is like a cargo net for you to put stuff if you have like keys cell phones yeah that back there differently maybe a purse or something for the interior cabin storage space it's a free it's not much space it's not much but it's a decent amount you could fit five Duraflame logs back there yes so when you're venturing out to Home Depot in the winter and the dead of winter and your Ferrari to get some Duraflame logs you can fit five of all the things to say oh you have a five turf lamp lofts yeah I don't know if you can even fit a Wendy's jr. cheeseburger in the center console though the center console is pretty cool that is like a teeny-tiny oh also I don't think there are any cupholders anywhere in this cabin no I don't like there's not a single couple during the whole car correct I don't think the driver side has this but you do have a small side pocket on the passenger side which is big enough for phone yeah the driver side has this - yeah it's got a little little cubby good space yeah so you've got like some storage like very very mild stores now if you have the phone as well as a Ferrari you can bring it with you Wow look at this guy practicality owns a phone and a Ferrari moneybags [Music] the mpg does 15 miles per gallon city okay and 22 miles per gallon on the highway Wow which is actually not as horrific as I was thinking it well that's better than the Earth's and so the engine you have in this is a it's a 3.9 liter v8 3.9 yeah you're right right yeah you're right point nine liter like does a twin-turbo I believe it's a 3.9 liter twin-turbo v8 oh we have to go over these slowly and I'd an angle even though those casual speed bumps yes people so the archenemy of super car her paddle shifters are giants they're huge and they're so nice they stay right in place they don't move the actual killer on the column they don't move with the with the steering wheel I love that and they are response they're instant like as soon as you click the shifts that ships that are shifters I have experienced the precision is so insane yeah and you expect it because the base price of this car is $250,000 we're a million bucks and that's base that's with no options with nothing else we were told that this one ran about 320 actually that's a house that's a nice house yeah so this is about a $320,000 car with all the options included that we're currently driving right now man I was gonna say one interesting thing about this and I will say this is I'll put this in the grippe category the air conditioning there's like nothing between no air at all and gale force winds yeah I have noticed that all sicknesses out of 4 on the dial here if I turn it up to 4 suddenly it's like really loud yeah still ramping up that's what you get so I'm sure you guys can hear the bellowing of this air could be and I turn it down one notch and you can't even feel it yeah or re just give us on and off if that's what it's gonna be ridiculous a little bit of trivia here do you know why it's called a spider no I don't because spiders spin webs and webs don't have roofs Wow that's smart that's totally false top tier right there I will say what's cool too is that this model doesn't have this one on the new for a de tributo which is Ferraris replacement of this you are not I don't know just their successor yeah a little bit maybe it's a special edition they have a screen that's right here on the passenger side where the passenger can do some stuff like it shows you like g-forces and like how much g-forces you're experiencing while driving let's be a co-pilot yeah and it also shows like your revs and your rpm and like how much help your speed and you can also adjust the music okay on here which is potentially a bad thing yeah because again partially why you get this is because you're a really selfish driver and you want to control everything and you want your passenger just be along for the ride that's all this is yeah the couple of interesting things I've noticed while driving this to this car is to get it started rolling you have to give it more gas than you'd think but then to get up to the speed limit you need to give it a lot less than yeah it was like even the barest amount like I'm at the speed limit and it was effortless whereas other cars giving the same amount of pressure to their gas pedal they're gonna be way behind yeah it's fascinating it really is fascinating it's a great fun car this is the flashiest car we've ever driven on the show I would say so I mean the i8 is pretty flat this is more I think so definitely I mean this is more it's more colorful it's a drop-top it's convertible you definitely get more attention in this than in the IAA that's really it's a heck of a lot louder - it's way louder and way faster so you will draw more attention this thing definitely definitely you're going to get more attention in this than in any of those other ones yeah how fast did you get up to earlier eighty Oh what about you 140 are you serious you had 140 we took it out to 142 oh my gosh that room the where are the leaves of the canyons alright starting us off it is performance its slammin it's great you have zero to sixty is three seconds the manufacturers time that's what Ferrari claims handling phenomenal yeah absolutely precise I really don't have any complaints with the performance at this car I don't either like I'm tempted to honestly go with the ten i'ma go I'm going with the ten I'd give it a nine point five why because there's a little bit of lag at the very beginning and when you stop it in a supercar you want a lot we haven't tried the launch concerning launch control would be a little different I think it would fix that problem for me yeah as of right now given the performance just driving around is phenomenal but there is a tiny bit of lag right at the beginning yeah I got for me bumps we're gonna go with the time because I still think it's rising alright practicality it's not as horrible as you might think it does have a front which is a little time just think you can apparently fit a JT and enemy it's not super practical obviously it's a supercar what he is baby you got like a net here we also didn't mention that these visors are like paper yeah these are the see misers they literally are paper basically yeah it's like a it's it's almost like they took like a sheet of cardboard yeah and they're just like a ratchet eclairs yes that's all that is I can't give it more than a three yeah I think three is my score on practicality here yeah I'm gonna I would agree with that honestly I'll come for me [Music] well the practicality doesn't matter when you can do stuff like that who cares yeah and that leads into the fun factor argument which this is gonna be contentious so it's gonna contentious yeah this is fun don't get me wrong though what are you about to say what's stupid things are you better say I prefer a big dumb stupid muscle cars so let me ask you this do you think the Lamborghini eros is more fun than this I do disagree I fundamentally disagree with that I understand this is a bit of our percent a better car it's faster it's more driver oriented it just more responsive it handles better but you got two seats it's a supercar you get what you expect yeah and it's great it's it's linear it's fun it's precise yeah but it's not a big dumb stupid SUV that can carry five friends like yes I would have so much more fun and in a ridiculous SUV like we were driving the Auris and somebody pulled up next to us and yelled it's a Lamborghini and started laughing because I'm so stupid and that is what's fun to me like I love driving this I have a blast but I know I might get what I paid for with this and that most people that's like yeah that makes sense why wouldn't you like that I guess well it's funny is like the Lamborghini is a lot cheaper than this yeah yeah I mean fifty thousand dollars cheaper fifty thousand dollars cheat day I mean that's a lot yeah I would buy a Lamborghini Oris over this car man that being said is still a blast to drive I'm gonna give it an eight yeah I think this I mean I think an eight is harsh honestly oh really oh yeah I think it's a ten Wow i straight-up think it's a ten on fun factor that's interesting I think this is the most fun car I've ever driven in my life Wow straight-up like I don't think I've ever driven a car that I think is as much fun as this thing alright then cool factor which is you can't deny it it also contentious is it for me is it the paint is exercise well this is util thing if that's cool but everyone else in the universe thinks this is cool yeah I guess JT is a boring person like cool cars this one is just like it's a tire better that's a tire design to me I think yeah cuz Ferrari I mean this looks exactly like a four five eight spider we really Italia yes it's yes when you see D like a Ferrari but it's over art well if it ain't broke don't fix it that's fair that is fair but it's like it's old hat at this point I like seeing new designs on cars every redesign I'm like that's cool even if I hate it and like yeah good for you for doing a redesign of what has worked in the past harsh word I'm gonna say it's a seven and a half Wow man yeah I think you're being extra harsh here I mean think about seven and a half is it still a good score yeah I I'm giving it a nine yeah I think like it's very cool I think the only things that could be cooler than this is stuff like a Bugatti like the bugatti chiron or a Pagani or a Koenigsegg I guess the only thing the bizarre hyper cars that you Nancy those are the only things that go up to the ten this is like almost is so close to that level I don't say if 4c is cooler than this what yeah what did everybody else was here that let's like rewind back to that I play a 4c is cooler than this I think an Alfa may have forces she's a four cylinder engine that costs $50,000 yeah is cooler than a mid-engined v8 yes that has more than double the horsepower and is a convertible and is a hardtop convertible readers ought to push a button you think this is less cool than that yes astonishing ladies and gentle let me know in the comments of you banished from the show for this is astonishing this is absolute lunacy so let's go on to quality honestly which is excellent and I'm glad that you finally agree here this is a fantastic cut I wouldn't buy it it's excellent quality so okay let me just go back to the Alfa 4c so this are you telling me if this was the same price if this and the 4c were both let's say $60,000 you would take the 4c over the well then now we're talking about performance stuff because this is vastly superior in terms of performance so but you just said that the 4c is cool I think it's cooler I don't think that hasn't has anything to do with performance all right what if this was a hundred thousand and the 4c was fifty thousand did I take the 4c interesting yeah okay and I take a Jaguar over this to take an SAT bar there you go everybody your opinion is wrong and I hate not so here we go I'm John on to quality what do you think I mean carbon fiber is exits it's exceptional yeah the oh it's like the only issue I have with this is the same issue I have with the Lamborghini where it's excellent it's perfect but long-term reliability is probably suspect yeah and I've given an eight I'm gonna go to seven point five seven point five because I mean this thing is all about theatrics and and yeah being beautiful and over-the-top and this looks boring this is like a 1990s car right here in the center I guess that's true sure but it does have a backup camera yes it works it does have a backup camera does have parking sensors it's it's alright yeah and then we move into value the last particle here value for that good girl but usually this is so hard but value has tested this is over $300,000 car I could never that didn't say that just big money yeah this is the most expensive car either of us have ever driven in our lives yeah I'll probably remain that will probably remain that way for a while I assume it's hard to justify this car yeah I think is yes you can get cars like the 4c which I admit are cool yeah that's cool I'm putting the top up I'm risking it here yeah I'm gonna see if the the light turns before I think we got that we got it it's pretty quick it's getting really hot anyways we can't see us from the Sun this was a good idea yeah it feels so nice and it feels much nicer with the top up I don't know 4c is really cool and those are only $50,000 and they justify that well you can kind of get your spouse on like a mid-level man midlife crisis yeah that's where I thought you were going or if you make we make one hundred and two hundred thousand dollars a year basically justify that even if I made enough money like hypothetically if I made enough money is where I would ever consider buying a $300,000 car I'd have a hard time justifying it for me yes I would rather spend $300,000 on like a house and like Renton's and they have money off of it this I know is gonna depreciate so bad and it's gonna like tank and value it was not an investment I have to give it probably a four yeah on the value I'm gonna give it a four and a half wow you actually rated that a little higher yeah cuz I'm trying my best to keep in mind that this is not for us no it's not and it is like insane like the performance and everything is so out of this world bonkers lunatic lis insane yeah straight up you are throwing away hundreds of thousands of straight up yours or in a lot of money way and honestly there are super cards you can get for less money that have about the same or even greater performance than this the things that come to my mind i mclaren 570s yeah you can get used for one hundred sixty five hundred thousand dollars last year and this it's half price yeah the Lamborghini Huracan is actually cheaper than yes by fifty grand but fifty grand the Lamborghini Huracan is cheaper than this and you get as fast almost as good performance it's just as cool-looking it's arguably practical arguably cooler looking I would say so and the average rating is a 42 Wow 42 out of 60 this is definitely lower than the harass and I think the reason why was mostly just because it's the practicality and your hater I absolutely am I am a hater JT is a Ferrari hater and the Lamborghini first had a lot of practicality going for it which is why we rated it a little higher on that those marks I'm not a hundred percent a Ferrari hater though I do like the f12 Berlinetta I do like the California but I like them all in grey do ya just you're literally Squidward I I love this car but man I would never buy it and even driving it around now I'm like this isn't as fun as a Corvette why okay let's not start a whole word we're not gonna open this can down everyone it's a Corvette one of these days we're gonna get a bunch of cars we're gonna get muscle cars hot hatches super cars we're gonna put them all out on the track and we're gonna try them all and determine which is the most fun 100% this no question I don't know I can't believe this everybody have comments are going to be tearing you to shred down I think there are some smart people out there if this is your first episode we hope you stick around and we've got a very contentious hh-he's so keep it about don't hit his died opinion right is in an opinion donate his dumb opinion thank you guys for watching we'll see you in the homework I'm working on it but see you guys [Music] give it a try by signing up using the link below we promise you'll love it
