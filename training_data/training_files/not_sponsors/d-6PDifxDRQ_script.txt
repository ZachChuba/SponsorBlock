queen the queen they're forever being at war over who is the real queen and who deserves the title but today i want to put their rivalry to rest and help them join forces and prove that there can be a world in which there are two queens and i intend to do that by playing queen songs for the queen now unfortunately the queen has not actually invited me to play queen songs for her so i'm gonna do the next best thing and play queen songs outside her house aka buckingham palace her majesty the queen leads the members of the royal family onto that famous balcony of buckingham palace now the other permits i'm probably not allowed to do that so we do have to be quite quick but also not too quick because i'm very wary of the fact that the piano is essentially a large wooden box and moving at top speeds towards buckingham palace is maybe not a good idea so i had to come up with a plan to get the piano outside buckingham palace while attracting as little attention as possible okay boys so here is buckingham palace but down here there's a little side road where i think it's kind of not too conspicuous and i think we can get away with offloading the planet just down there so then we can just walk the piano all the way around up to buckingham palace oh i see the gates you can see the gate i'm trying to not look suspicious i want to look happy and not terroristic i want to play it right here because i think here we can get away with playing i don't think there'll be as much police presence or guards as there will be over there so i think we can maybe get away with playing and hopefully i'll be able to finish a song we're going all the way to london so you can hopefully play a single song yes i'm very sorry about that yeah and you're telling me that they before i'm telling you the day before oh yeah i forgot to mention i had less than 24 hours to plan and execute this entire video because the lockdown had just been announced i've just realized i'm not sure i've even mentioned this the plan tomorrow is to go to london and back uh yeah sorry about that one which meant i had to assemble a team at the last moment which consisted of cameraman adrian my friends taran my mother and my friend dom now dom would play a small but crucial role in ensuring that i had maximum amount of time before i got stopped and he'll be waiting outside buckingham palace with the piano stool gopro and microphone all set up so once we got there i could start playing immediately [Music] but then at the last minute the spielberg in me came out short adrienne and decided that the shot wasn't good enough and that we had to scrap the entire planet so he could move the piano closer [Music] i'd finally got the piano outside buckingham palace but after wasting all that time i had one question left to answer could i get through a whole song before i got [Music] stopped [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] can't set that up and we're about to play here i'm just trying to play some queen songs for the queen i was hoping the queen maybe the queen will stick her head out the window it was a disaster after all that planning and with the big team i still had not managed to finish a whole queen song and it was my own fault we packed up the piano and left feeling defeated it's fun while the rosters but then as we were walking away i remembered something which taran had said to me earlier now while that definitely just sounds like a load of useless waffle about a flag it actually changed everything see usually above buckingham palace they fly the sovereign flag aka the royal standard but when we filmed this they were flying the union jack and they only ever fly the union jack if the queen isn't there i don't think she's actually there hold on can i give you this so thanks to tyron's incredible britishness we realized we've been wasting our time and even if i hadn't been stopped i wouldn't have been playing queen songs for the queen anyway which begged the question where was the queen where is she then what does that mean is she on holiday well maybe mission is not failed who knows it turns out she was at windsor castle where she'd been isolating since the start of the pandemic okay how quickly can we get to windsor castle so of course i got my mum to floor it to winter castle so we could have one more chance [Music] i'd made a quick plan on the way there but to make sure everything went down smoother than before i went and scouted ahead with adrian there's no one here it's actually closed but unfortunately that plan didn't last long there's a slight problem in the sense that there are police officers just do a quick little zoom police officers right behind us and this is where i was oops where i was planning on playing the piano and if they are there i probably can't do that so instead i decided to take the piano a bit further down the road where i'd be just out of sight for them i can just like park it right up here and then we have until the police get from there to here to stop castle's still in the background still i'll still be playing queen songs for the queen this might be even dumber than the last one this might be even dumber than before yeah so with the new plan in place we gave dom another five minute lead you got that burned into your memory and then took the piano to the castle we've got everything we need yeah i think haven't we [Music] not back this way this way okay okay so i think i've got to get going really quickly before they stop me again but before i do that i should very quickly tell you about the sponsor of today's video which is skillshare now if you haven't heard of skillshare it's basically a massive online learning community where you can learn just about anything they have courses on so many subjects like writing design music production film production you name it skillshare has got a course on it and of course one of the things they have lots of courses on is how to play the piano so i went through all of skillshare's piano courses and tried to find one which was taught in a way which i agree with and i found one by a guy called arthur bird and he teaches it so well he doesn't go too fast he doesn't go too slow he's such a good teacher and if i was learning piano from scratch i would want to be taught by arthur byrd now if that sounds like something which might interest you you're in luck because skillshare is giving away premium subscription to the first thousand people who sign up with the link in my description and after that it's only around ten dollars a month now of course you don't have to use that link just to use the piano course you can learn anything on skillshare with that link for example i'm using it to learn how to use adobe illustrator with a course by a guy called daniel scott so yeah go and use that link thank you very much to skillshare for sponsoring this video and yeah i think i've got to get a move on before i get stopped again [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] we play queen songs for the queen there we go actually it happened this time actually managed to make it work i'm surprised i haven't been stopped to be honest i think we should push it and try to go even further closer yeah yeah mission successful i've played queen songs for the queen finally i'm just gonna trust that she popped her head out the window at some point and heard a little bit of that um this video took a lot of effort to make we've been driving around all day to london from bristol and all the way all around so if you did enjoy it please do subscribe to show some appreciation um we've just reached 3 million subscribers so we're starting the journey to 4 million so if you could help out with that that would be greatly greatly appreciated thank you very much for watching and goodbye
