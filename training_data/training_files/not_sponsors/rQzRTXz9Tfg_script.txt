I guess I got to my channel so first of all I just wanted to say that today is probably going to be a long day with low fractions so please bear with me they're going to be probably a bit later than usual since I'm going to be no editing them Excel ryan takes time so yeah please bear with me hopefully there's not going to be any issues with the rendering etc but yeah I just wanted to let you know ahead of time and I'm gonna start today with Sunmi with board up beep um I love those titles that I just can't I can't pronounce I'm so sorry Pam is like night right um I don't know what IP that Pitt is like oh is it like purple light night is that what it means damn I it's been a while since I've you know gone back on my Korean lessons etc so yeah okay so unfortunately there are no English captions with put up beep um let's just go ahead what I love about Sinise that I never know what to expect with her like that gives like you know those horror movie vibes with a camera and everything a while [Music] if you like a siren that you know know okay okay oh that that sounds like her that's a her song yep [Music] like who music videos always so like creative she's giving me like what is it Sailor Moon I love the color scheme honestly the that purple you know what I mean like she has a slide to her that is a lot more like insane I creativity-wise I'm tipsy this also gives me wait sure Wonder Girls lies because of how retro it sounds like oh that breeze back is that dancer she's giving me retro queen I love it [Music] they I wouldn't mind her and her you know that dancer together I don't know where the music video is going like what is going on [Music] this is so freakin old-school honestly she's one of the only artists that can make this sound work now [Music] like I'm honestly having trouble finding anyone else like her right now [Music] then what a night she spent for her to end up on the on the shore like that on a freakin mattress hello what happened as I said in the beginning you never know what to expect truly from her coming in a music video because she always brings something so fresh it might in my opinion like she truly has her own universe of like creativity and like a little bit of craziness to it but like you know like psychotic almost and like looking back at her previous music videos there's always something that makes me uneasy and I can't really pinpoint what every time for this this eerie vibe that she gives out in every of her music video I like most of her music video maybe not all of them but like I don't know just at the very beginning of this music video there with the camera and everything I don't know I associate this with like horror movie in something that's gonna happen you know I like the color scheme the purple that purple stunning on her the music video aesthetic is also really cool as always now this song is not my favorite it gives me strong as I said like Wonder Girl vibe because I could I could see them you know with our instrument and everything absolutely killing this song I would oh my god she makes retro modern if that makes sense like as I said I can't picture anyone else at the moment doing something like this and do it as well as she is doing it now as I said might not be my favorite song of hers but it doesn't mean that I can't enjoy they say I could see myself listening to that it's not I'm not going I'm probably not going to be reaching up for it that much but I would listen to it if that makes sense also one thing that I want to note is that she looks so freaking amazing like I don't know what happened she is absolutely you're like glowing nowadays like on her Instagram and everything I just find her so I don't know there's something just so gorgeous about her and yeah I mean I'm kind of in love with her but that's okay anyway so channel I know II see in the next video bye bye
