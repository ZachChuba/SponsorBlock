[Music] rap at its core is an expression of many connected yet opposing aspects of our society indulgent consumerism versus hopeless poverty beautiful romance versus emotionless sex social harmony versus gang and drug violence spiritual awakening versus blind hedonism all of these and more our central themes in contemporary hip-hop genre that exemplifies both complex socio-political commentary musical experimentation and entertainment aimed at the lowest common denominator the only constant factor is the most very basic definition of rapping as a form of music in which rhythmic speech is performed alongside an instrumental accompaniment and the current dichotomy is rigid to say the least rappers who are too sincere we call them corny rappers who don't say enough we make fun of them too but what happens when you can barely understand what the rapper is saying at all that's where young thug comes in as one of the most bizarre interesting rappers to ever pick up a mic he practically invented the current sound of Atlanta hip hop he's been featured at some of the biggest art events in the world he defies all hip-hop norms wearing a dress for the cover his Geoffrey album that same dress ended up in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts bugger is one of the single most influential rappers of the last decade but despite his high art meets low art aesthetic despite his reputation as an unpredictable industry renegade who constantly innovates on his own terms he's not nearly as successful as his peers his own unoriginal of protegees regularly outsell him is it mismanagement is it a case of being too weird for his own good or his thugger perhaps content to just do his own thing and not worry about the numbers in the same way he does with his music creating on his own terms with no regard for the status quo let's understand young thug understanding young thug is brought to you by Skillshare everyone to click the link below can get two months of free tutorials on almost any creative business or tech subject you can think of young thug whose real name is Jeffrey Lamar Williams is only 27 years old he's younger than his peers like Travis Scott and cueva but his career has been both much longer anymore packed with content than either affairs he released his first mixtape in 2011 at the age of 20 but first let's jump even further back Neph Jeffery was born in Atlanta Georgia in 1991 the tenth of eleven children he was born in Sylvan Hills a neighborhood located in Atlanta zone 3 Atlanta contains six zones as part of a police patrol classification system that almost makes Atlanta sound like some dark rundown metropolis out of a futuristic dystopian film of course it's not actually so bad Atlanta doesn't hold a candle to the poverty in danger faced by people living in much denser areas up north like Baltimore Philadelphia but Atlanta did experience a kind of musical explosion in the latter half of the 2010s and the city's almost military sounding zone system plays a key part in how rappers identify themselves and their communities Jeffrey is from the same zone as older musicians like Ludacris 2 Chainz and Waka Flocka Flame younger rappers from the zone include rich the kid and thugger himself zone 3 is well known for its heavy trap presence and many of its musicians came up associating with drug dealers or dealing themselves and what the way to do gel with your wife goes but many of his peers Jeffrey was heavily affected by an unstable family environment and an insufficient public school system his mother had difficulty providing for all 11 of her children and because of their financial troubles many of her kids turned to crime to get by Jeffrey saw his older brother get shot before his eyes and he has another brother who's in jail to this day after being accused of murder and despite his good grades Jeffrey was expelled in the sixth grade for breaking a teacher's on he later served four years in juvenile prison so you grew up to read music I I heard that you had like a big family a lot of brothers and sisters how was it when you were kid so hard it was so hard on you I don't even got you got to talk about it was hard yeah struggle and so the music helped you to escape yeah to escape to that crime what was now I don't make me they don't help me escape because I did I stayed in escape I still was there so it just it just helped me deal with it you know the paper helped me escape me out after getting out of jail Jeffrey picked up gambling from his brother's gambling led to gangs drugs and later on organized crime at the same time Jeffrey was also experiencing fatherhood for the first time his child was born before he was 16 and more would come so after his around this time that Jeffrey recognized his talent for music and decided to start rapping rapping is an important part of the Atlanta trapped lifestyle young men in the ghetto make music to shout out their neighborhood highlight the hustle and increase the reputation and young thug was no exception where his music now is often boundary-pushing experimental hip-hop his early work was instead heavily inspired by industry legends like little Wayne it was only after years of work that plugger discovered his own unique vocal style pluggers first mixtape i came from nothing sets him up as a fast rapper with a crude sense of humor it couldn't be further from what he's known for now but honestly out of all the early mixtapes i've listened to from kendrick to j ID pluckers early work is probably the most well put together of course like many artists his early music has almost nothing in common with his current sound but it really wasn't that bad his rapping was fast and technical and his rhymes were clever especially for our 20 year old I can only tell that he would eventually adopt an expressive singsong style because I'm here in 2019 looking back at dozens of projects that showcase his evolution in 2011 there was almost no clue that huggers unique expressive creativity would eventually be known throughout the world well for the next couple of years slugger grew his reputation step by step he kept releasing music regularly never taking a break longer than 11 months and slowly but surely his reputation grew at first he made a name for himself in his neighborhood then it spread to all of zone 3 before long all of South Atlanta knew his name and eventually his songs were picked up by the DJ's downtown young thug had joined the highest ranks of Atlanta street rap community all while his flows fashion sense and persona just kept getting weirder and weirder released in 2015 barter 6 was the Gers first big commercial project it was of course his 11th mixtape in four years but it was his first to chart on the Billboard Top 200 nothing about the music was crazy different from his previous mixtapes of course he had already been developing his signature style for a few records at that point the production on barter 6 is cleaner than on previous young thug mixtapes but again not a huge step forward the real factor that propelled young thug into the mainstream in 2015 was controversy you see the mixtape was initially supposed to be called Carter six as a parody of Lil Wayne's the Carter series of course Lil Wayne didn't take huggers parody very well and immediately initiated legal proceedings to force a name change rather than be sued or have to delay the album flicker instead renamed it to barter six but of course the controversy didn't end there just days after the release of barter six young thugs tour manager was arrested after he fired more than 20 shots into Lil Wayne's tour bus while driving on the highway whether or not young thug himself was involved in the shooting was never proven but the manager was sentenced to 10 years for the shooting flicker denied having any part but he did decide to host his first live show promoting barter 6 in New Orleans Lil Wayne's hometown young thug released two more mixtapes in 2015 one right after the other slime season 1 and slime season 2 are still considered by fans to be some of his best work 2016 was again packed with music Pfleger released three commercial mixtapes I'm up slime season 3 and perhaps one of his most controversial and iconic works Jeffrey Jeffrey besides being a huge jump for thugger as an artist features him posing in a periwinkle dress designed by alessandro tran cone an italian fashion designer whose work focuses on expression unrestricted by gender the cover art was of course hugely controversial it didn't help his situation when he told GQ that he wears women's clothes ninety percent of the time you know exceptions being underwear and t-shirts the public reaction to this was disappointing but somehow not that surprising but controversy aside my opinion Jeffery is one of the best hip-hop albums of the last decade the instrumentals are great and Fugger's vocals are effortlessly smooth he moves between squeaking like a seal on RiRi crooning incomprehensibly on Harambee and radio-friendly sings on rapping pick up a phone it's all different it's all unexpected but somehow it all worked and I think the reason why it works is the same reason why the dress on the album cover works despite receiving the resounding hatred from every single hip-hop all dead on the internet and his uncle Jeffrey just doesn't care one of my favorite interviews with him shows exactly what I mean by this Yeah right I am rotary ever you know you won't ever see a young thug paper piece of paper though with no songs on I never wrote I guess have to I guess I really came from destruction so I guess I am right about it nobody have to write a form you need it was just like later beat I'm gonna talk about what happened yesterday maybe I'll tell you what and I think above his vocals above the bizarre gender-bending visuals what really makes young thug Niek is the fact that he just doesn't care there are a lot of young thug clones and a lot of them are selling way better than he does from little baby to gonna to little keyed they all got famous by biting off his vocals lyrics and persona but what any of them ever write an Instagram caption that says [ __ ] daddy would any of them ever wear a dress for an album cover shoot would any of them ever proudly declare their appreciation for women's clothes no no and no and that's why they sell better than young thug they recreate his style in a domesticated mass-market way the singsong rapping is an experimental anymore because young thug in a way blazed the trail that so many rappers are now taking for the sake of easy profit [ __ ] next mixtape after jeffery beautiful Pfleger girls took a different approach to his music beautiful Pfleger girls was originally marketed as an album but after it failed to sell more than 40,000 units in the first week huggers label instead changed it to a commercial mixtape Pfleger girls was a huge departure from Jeffrey's previous work there are tons of genre crossovers from R&B and dancehall to country of all things Leger's singing is soft and emotional the instrumentals are often acoustic with trapped flavouring Geoffrey kroons sings and raps over instrumentals that are both more acoustic and introspective than you'd ever expect young thug to be capable of there are honestly a lot of genuinely introspective moments on beautiful thugger girls but despite its interesting boundary-pushing qualities as a trap record it barely sold 30,000 copies in the first week and that's where we are today sucker continues to release interesting music that builds on his previous work but it's just not reaching as many years as his peers or his copycats his 2018 EP on the run experimented with a number of different styles and it was honestly an excellent record but it failed to sell more than 30,000 copies and peaked at just number 17 on Billboard ultimately it's tough to tell if Pfleger cares about breaking through into the a-list he's been on the cusp for years he said in the past that he wants to be as big as Michael Jackson and he regularly collaborates with pop mega stars like Camila Cabello post Malone and ariana grande he even won a Grammy for song writing on Childish Gambino's this is America some of his best moments have been features on Travis Scott songs a megastar rapper who he's been cloaking some of his best moments have been features on Travis Scott songs rapper who he's been working closely with since the early days of his career and for a while it looked like Travis and thugger were going down the same path straight towards superstardom some of the most beloved songs from Travis's early mixtapes and albums were only made possible because of Leger's unique vocals but as time passed Travis's popularity grew and grew while huggers stayed the same he's yet to drop a project that sells more than 50,000 copies he's outsold by his own copycats despite his cult fanbase he's outsold by his own copycats despite his cult fanbase Slugger has been completely unable to reach the mainstream some of his fans wish he would find a new release strategy or maybe even switch management but in the end will that really matter when it comes to his legacy plugger has already reached artistic Heights that most rappers could never even dream of from serving as a stylist and mentor at New York Fashion Week to having the gender-bending dress from his jeffrey album cover featured at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts legarre has made his mark as an artist and he did it all while being one of the most eccentric figures in modern hip-hop making music completely on his own terms with no inhibitions to speak of not bad for a kid from a burned-out ghetto in South Atlanta for completely free [Music]
