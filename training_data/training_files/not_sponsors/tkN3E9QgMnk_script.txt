Hey so I heard you can me up with a ground yeah yeah yeah no doubt no doubt dude uh-uh I'm what you want hey gran 17th LG gram 17 the world's lightest laptop now with the 17 inch display that's a gram that's a grab dude okay thanks I guess yeah no doubt yeah cool cool cool like I didn't pay me but you know who news offer code text when t at the link below to get 20% off as with every gram notebook ii you pick up the LG gram 17 for the first time it is shocking how light it feels like it's gram cousins it ends up feeling a little like those plastic device replicas that they have in retail stores so that they're real ones don't get stolen now with that said this gram is much bigger than the previous ones at 17 inches and tips the scales at two point nine five pounds for about 1.3 kilograms so they're really pushing the limits of the Grand category here but it's still closer to one than it is to two kilograms and regardless of the numbers most of the big screen laptops that we deal with are gaming machines so being able to carry around a notebook this size without having to remember Nick V's lifting tips it's just great unfortunately one of the things that comes along with lightness in a machine this large is some loss of the stiffness and the sturdiness that we were so impressed by on the most recent 13-inch Graham now to be clear it's still made out of the same metal alloys nano carbon with magnesium which sounds really fancy and high-tech but it feels a lot like plastic and that means it's still pretty fingerprint resistant and durable enough from my experience daily driving previous grams but the display in particular is definitely wobblier than I'd like and like if you press on it in certain spots it kind of feels hollow which I guess makes sense since it does have hollow spots to save on weight design-wise the gram 17 is still great if you like your notebooks plain and gray but to be clear I'm not knocking that it's clean looking so it'll perfectly match your boring briefcase and it's highly functional while the webcam still kind of sucks the i/o is a great mix including full-sized HDMI and Thunderbolt free with charging support there's a fingerprint sensor in the power button you get a full if slightly squished number pad and the super thin bezels frame what is in my mind the most potent feature of the gram 17 it's utterly massive display well what can I say about this it doesn't have HDR just sort of a drag and touch support is gone unfortunately but it's still got great color accuracy and viewing angles thanks to its IPS panel and the resolution has been boosted from 1080p to 2560 by 1600 which yes is a sixteen by ten aspect ratio for those of you keeping score at home this gives both professionals and creatives a little extra real estate to work with and while the pixel density is a bit lower than some other high end laptops in my opinion 4k screens on portable devices are mostly wasted anyway everything from a premiere time line to an Excel spreadsheet looked nice and crisp not to mention big on the gram 17s display on the subject of premiere internally the gram 17 is a little more ultra than LG's previous ultrabooks the processor got bumped up to an Intel Core i7 85 65 you with four cores and eight threads running at 1.8 gigahertz which means that combined with its 16 gigs of DDR for memory and 512 gig and the 2 SATA SSD this machine packs way beefier guts than its weight would seem to indicate easily powering through regular office use and even holding its own for photo and light video editing now one of the three 18 inches main strengths in fact it's the feature we liked most in our review last year is its battery life so then how does the larger display and faster processor affect things on the 17-inch well the last time I checked eight is not equal to or greater than ten so there was definitely an impact but honestly that's still a really solid result and other features that continue to rock on mcgrann include the keyboard with a nice tactile feel and despite the short travel distance and the trackpad which is quite good even if there's still room to make it bigger opening up the bottom by removing the rubber feet and these annoying little plastic sticker things we find the reason for the reduction in battery life this seems to be the same 72 watt hour battery as the 15-inch we wouldn't have minded seeing that bumped up a little bit in here we've also got an extra m2 slot for expansion and then that's about it you think LG might have added another Ram slot larger speakers or even more cooling to fill out the extra space a bit but then again I guess if it ain't broke you don't fix it and the Graham neither thermal throttled nor got loud throughout our testing so should you upgrade to the latest and largest Graham well for the same price as this thing or even less actually you could make any number of compromises on internal specs build quality and most of all wait if you were to go with something else but the fact remains that this notebook is the lightest and most portable 17 inch are ever so for people who take their laptop anywhere and everywhere it's a winner as long as that anywhere isn't an alley fight it won't make much of a makeshift self-defense weapon off your first purchase so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if
