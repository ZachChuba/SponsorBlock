[Music] welcome back to my channel if you are new here my name is Caitlin and I played a whole bunch of different types of videos on this channel mainly surrounding true crime and psychological cases as well as a little bit of fashion and lifestyle sprinkled in where I can well today I'm back with another case description box below so you can go check that out for today's video we're going to be discussing the case of Garrett Phillips and the main reason very well and it's definitely worth the watch I would also just like to say before I continue onto the into the video I filmed kind of the main content of this video on another day so I'm gonna look different in a second to apologize about that don't fit one annoy you too much so yes if you do want to hear about the case of Garrett Phillips then keep on watching and if you do want below in the description so this case takes place in the year of 2011 on the date of the 24th of October Garrett Phillips was a twelve-year-old boy living in a place called Potsdam in upstate New York with his mother and his younger brother Garrett was known to be a joker and had a habit of being quite a rowdy young boy playing practical jokes on all the other children he did have a number of friends at school however at school he was known to be particularly restless and he drew a lot of attention to himself during in his spare time he liked playing sports he liked fishing hunting racing around on quad bikes he was all around a very adventurous sporty lively young man on the afternoon of October 24th and year of 2011 Garrett had been the only one in his family's second-floor apartment on Market Street in Potsdam New York his mother Tandy Cyrus had headed out with her youngest son Aaron to take him to basketball practice the plan had been forgot to join them at a later point at basketball practice after he'd finished his homework where he could see his brother and his friends before Tandy drove them both home at around 5:00 p.m. Garrett's neighbors in the small apartment bill they heard a loud crash like something falling down immediately after they'd heard the moans and something they described as either a child or a woman's voice crying either no or help a young couple who were in this apartment building had heard this noise they decided they would go and check on it and see if maybe someone hurt themselves everything was okay see what the noise was that was coming from this apartment they haven't known exactly who had lived in this particular apartment although they had admitted to seeing Garrett and his younger brother riding around their bikes playing outside in the hallway in the garden or things like that so they knew that in all likelihood they lived in this apartment they just didn't know them on a personal level Marissa Vogel who had been one of the neighbors that had heard this and decided to go and check on the noise she knocked on the apartment door and listened for any sign of anyone inside to see if anyone maybe had hurt themselves and needed help and at first all she heard was silence after she knocked but as she listened closer she heard the very very distinctive sound of the doors lock clicking now according to her this noise had concerned her even more when it was combined with the crash and then this faint noise of someone saying help or no and so at 5:07 p.m. that day she decided to ring the police and report what she'd heard around ten minutes later an officer arrived to carry out just a welfare check on whatever had happened inside the apartment just to make sure that if there was anyone in there if they had heard correctly everything on it was okay but when he knocked on the door himself he had no response either all he heard was a very faint noise of footsteps coming from inside the apartment when he heard these footsteps he decided to stock once again but this time there was no noise and once again he knocked this time yelling please just to allow anyone inside of his presence you know if someone was hurt or someone was scared maybe for his child inside and they didn't want to open doors strangers he just wanted to make sure that they knew it was the police at the door but no one answered he decided his best port of call was to get into the contact with the man who dealt with the building's maintenance to see if he had a key so that he could come and let him into the apartment just to carry out this welfare check the maintenance manager had been out with his family at this point but he told him that he would head straight to the building after he dropped his family off so that he could let them into the apartment and in the meantime the officer decided to take it upon himself to go around to all the neighbors that were in the building at the time see what they'd heard speak to him or see if they knew who lived there all that sort of thing basically collecting as much information as he could this is when he learned of exactly what noise everyone had heard as well as the fact that they were aware of the two young boys living there with their mother many of the neighbors had said that despite the two young boys often making noise as two young boys would do in their apartment the bang and the moment that they'd heard struck them all as unusual building managers swiftly let them into the apartment and this is where they came across Garret Phillips lying on the floor on his back in the master bedroom of the apartment at this point they haven't known exactly who this young boy was but they simply placed him as being around 10 years old he was wearing a t-shirt and blue and white checkered shawls at this point the boy had no pulse and he wasn't breathing and the officer proceeded to attempt to carry out CPR on the young boy paramedics were very swiftly called to the scene and continued the officers efforts to keep this boy alive and soon placed him in an ambulance and drove him straight to something called the accountant Potsdam Hospital which was located nearby doctors there had been able to keep him alive for a very brief time but sadly at around 7:20 p.m. that evening 12 year old Garrett Phillips was pronounced dead the immediate factors that were considered by the first responders by that point was just exactly who this young boy was where his mother and brother were as well as who would have been in the apartment with him at that time in a different bedroom of the apartment to the one in which Garrett was found offices discovered a window that had its blinds and protective screen completely damaged and wide oh and it was soon speculated that if there had been someone in the apartment when all this occurred it may have been a point of exit for them Garrett's mother Tandy had been informed of what had happened while that her son's basketball practice and her first port of call had been to cool up a man named John Jones now John Jones was an ex-boyfriend of hers but he was also the local sheriff's deputy when she'd been told that something had happened she had immediately called John Jones and told him that she wanted him to meet her at the hospital where Garrett had been taken so that he could be there with them and help them throw of them and make sure that she knew what was expected of her at the time of Tandy's arrival at the hospital her son had still been alive sadly didn't remain safe for long examination of the remains found no signs of bruises or cuts but it was ultimately ruled a homicide investigators determined that Garrett Phillips had died as a result of strangulation and suffocation and so the hunt for his killer began in order to understand the route of the investigation into Garrett's murder I'm going to just very briefly go into a little bit background into his mother Tandy Cyrus and you kind of understand why very very soon so Garrett was born in the year of 1999 and he was the firstborn - Tandy and her husband at the time Robert Phillips when Garrett was just three years old Robert had a brain aneurysm and sadly died as a result a few years later Tandy then remarried and this time had her second son Aaron but this marriage didn't survive much longer past there during this time Tandy had been training at a local police academy and soon graduated only to decide that she didn't then want to pursue a career as being a police officer she worked two jobs to support her son including working as a bartender in a local bar during night shifts it was working in this bar that she met a man named oral Nick Hilary he was a bit different to the men that she might typically come across especially working in this bar he was Jamaican and he was also particularly in shape who's very well-spoken as it would turn out he was actually the head coach for the Division three soccer team at Clarkson University nearby Nick we would stay up at the bar talking to Tandy for hours even after everyone else in the bar had left and she was getting ready to close up she learned that Nick had three children himself but he at that point was with their mother but wasn't planning on staying with her for very long and the pair spoke of their dreams of leaving Potsdam and pursuing successful careers in nicer places the pair began to date officially and before long that they moved in together along with Tandy's two sons Garrett and Erin as well as Hilary's daughter Shanna Kaye his two sons would also spend some nights in the week staying with them when they weren't staying with their mother and so they had a particularly busy household on a lot of days in the summer months of 2011 Tandi learned that her son's one actually happy at all with the living arrangements in the sense that they found Hilary too strict on them he was a very authoritative and very disciplinarian figure he would refuse to let them watch any TV on school nights he would make sure that they were disciplined correctly so they didn't like the way that he was treating them and they didn't want to live with him anymore so they told their mother that they wanted him to move out so that they could live alone with her and so Tandy decided that what she would do keep her son's happy would be to take her two sons and move out just the three of them while her and Hilary remained a couple and this had seemed as though it was a successful plan as Hilary had been seemingly supportive he even helped them move in and it all kind of just seemed to be going okay like it was a good idea at some point after this though it is known that the relationship is said to have ended I couldn't find exactly like why or how or when it ended but it just seems to be as though it kind of like fizzled out I don't really know there isn't a lot of like solid evidence to suggest why but they were there were according some sources allegedly some incidents in which that she would find Hilary inside of her apartment because he still had a key I don't know how plausible these are I don't know how reliable these sources are but some sources say that because he still have a key there was a couple of incidents in which she would come home and find him there and she wanted him out of the apartment after this she demanded that he give her his copy of the key and this is what happened according to her the last time that she recalled him being in their apartment was at the end of September of 2011 at a very early point in this investigation police investigators appeared to have focused their efforts on proving the guilt of Nick Hillary as I said he was born and raised in Jamaica and he served in the US Army before he then started his career as a soccer coach Nick Hillary was informed in person of Garrett's death on the same night that it had actually occurred by a lieutenant and then he was called in for questioning in the days following when he was taken down to the station just for some questioning the police chief had allegedly just completely refused to let him go and he wasn't allowed to work he was told he was even strip searched so he had all of his belongings taken off them he was completely strip searched and everything was taken photos off so they took photos of him without his clothes and they took photos of all of his belongings they took his phone everything they even read him his Miranda rights even though he wasn't being arrested but he was in there for a long time I think he was held there for about eight hours or something ridiculous like that while they just questioned him over and over again and if you do watch the documentary which I do highly recommend they do show clips of the footage of him being inside the police station at that point and some the questions and the conversations they had and then strip searched and came and it's all very very very brutal considering or so early on in the investigation it does just give you the impression that from a very early point they were adamant that he had something to do with it two witnesses at this point had allegedly told officers that they had seen Hillary near the apartment building not long before Garrett's death someone also claimed to have seen his car a few blocks away from the building and Garrett's uncle even said that he had seen Hillary driving in the area at around 4:30 p.m. that day according to some sources investigators had checked through Hillary's phone records and they found that exactly 48 minutes after the emergency services call was made around Garrett's apartment so when the person had found Garrett and the emergency services calls made exactly 14 minutes after that Hillary had placed a call to his lawyer Hillary had also been coaching a soccer practice that same evening and some of the people there had allegedly shared how they'd noticed he was acting a lot Kharma than usual like I said he was a bit of an authoritative figure very disciplinarian and since he was such kind of a strong disciplining figure at that point some people said it was allegedly quite strange that he was very very calm at that point the following day he also coached this team during a game against another team obviously and even though his team won two nil he remains still the majority of the time allegedly and showed little ZnO enthusiasm police lieutenant even claimed to scene with a distinctive limp on the very few occasions during that game that he did move and he immediately considered the possibility of whether this could have been an injury that may have been occurred so whether this was the injury or someone could have obtained a similar injury if they were the perpetrator of Garrett's murder if they had hastily jumped out the window as though they'd assumed so yeah as I said while he was down in the police station they literally searched and they stripped him took photos everything took all of his belongings they fingerprint him they read him his rights even though he wasn't actually arrested and then he was allowed to leave he was told at first that he couldn't go to work and then at around 7:30 or something like that as well eight hours later he was allowed to leave it was wearing a hazmat suit the alleged sightings of Hillary his apparent injury and the stories of his and Garrett's previous issues in terms of their living situation all seemed to argue the likelihood of Garrett having been involved in the attack for weeks the investigation continued with no arrests and despite them all having Hillary's belongings and all of his movements to aid their investigation they seem to be making no headway Tandi herself had allegedly made a statement that Hillary had always seen Garrett as a reason or a cause for their breakup that he was kind of why she ended things with him or their relationship didn't work as he allegedly made it clear that he thought that she allowed her sons to make all of her decisions for her the year after Garrett's death when there had been no advancements made in the investigation Hillary had filed a lawsuit against those who had been carrying it out claiming that it was unlawful all of his rights had been violated he was held unlawfully by these police officers this was basically based on the fact that he'd had his whole house his person sir his property was taken from him without them issuing a warrant and he had been held for hours and read his Miranda rights even though there was no arrests and they didn't really have any reason to hold him there he was just been taken in for questioning and in this case began to kind of gain even more momentum when it became involved in a political campaign relating to a woman named Nicole today who had been campaigning to be elected as the st. Lawrence County District Attorney she had directly introduced Garrett's case as well as a couple of others as a statement in her campaign saying that she wanted these cases to be self that she was going to do everything to make sure that these cases were solved and that their family would get justice and I think the main issue with this was that as much as people agreed that all of these families did deserve justice as well as the victims it was also a bit of a hit-or-miss reaction people either agreed or they really didn't with the fact that she'd directly named the case in her political campaign some people think it was a good thing because it means that it was gaining more reaction and people were seeing it and was gaining more awareness all others argued that it wasn't really the right thing to do to involve it in your political campaign but obviously that's completely down to a matter of opinion I just thought was kind of an interesting point to discuss she'd made promises that this case as well as the others named would see some form of final sentencing in relation to the suspects that the investigators had deemed as guilty and so as a result of this reanimation of the focus on these cases Hilary was indicted for a second-degree murder charge in 2014 in July of 2014 he entered a not guilty plea but no matter the outcome of this trial his life would be changed forever the case had gained so much public attention by that point and people have kind of already made up their mind some people the public even thought he was guilty completely or people it was innocent no matter what happened the public already knew about it and a lot of pinions had already been formed so by this point you know he'd already lost his coaching position job at Clarkson University there was just a lot and sadly his life was forever changed no matter what the outcome Hilary was released on bail following this and then a few months later the next occurrence in the case came about when the judge working on the case stated publicly that he believed Deut attorney who had been looking into the case and questioning witnesses and things like that had intentionally badgered and bullied Hilary's daughter during the investigation process and that this should be dismissed the district attorney then decided that her next port of call for the case was to take it before a grand jury which once again saw Hilary be indicted at the start of 2015 for this trial a jury was built from the surrounding area as it typically would a bunch of regular mundane everyday people being called in for jury duty however one of the main issues with this and regards to like this case in particular was that it becomes so widely known and publicized it was covered by loads of media outlets and like I said a lot of people had already formed their opinions it would be virtually impossible to find an entire jury who would were able to be completely impartial who who could perform on this jury who could be on this jury without acting in any form of bias and this is exactly what Hilary and his team had realized when the jury was created and so Hilary himself ultimately decided that he wanted his child to be a bench trial meaning that the judge would be the sole decider of his verdict as opposed to a jury there was a lot that had occurred during the course of this trial regarding the evidence as the defense will obviously arguing that Hilary was completely innocent and that the real perpetrator was in fact someone else while the prosecution was obviously arguing a completely opposite a complete different fact they were saying that Hilary killed Garrett the prosecution introduced a witness who had been one of the neighbors living in Jarrettsville building who'd heard the noise on the day of Garrett's murder and he and his girlfriend had been outside the building just stood outside changing a tire on their car I believe when they heard this noise now if they've been stood where they were where they were changing the tire they would have been in direct eyeline and so we've been able to directly see the window which would ultimately be found to be broken as though someone had climbed through it this means that if they'd stayed there even after the noise had occurred they likely would have seen someone climbing out of it however when this noise had occurred they decided to go inside and see what was going on meaning that someone could have quite easily escaped through the window without I'm seeing this particular witness was called in to provide a statement in which he said he'd seen a shadowy dark figure of an adult male stood in the window of Garrett's apartment just before the noise has occurred in the documentary you'll see the discussion in which they say that they were given the impression that he was very very sure of the sighting and he might even have said very confidently that he knew he'd seen Hilary specifically in the apartment however the main dispute regarding this was that his girlfriend who had been with him at the time like I said they were both outside changing attire when she learned of this she provided a completely different statement suggested that his statement wasn't in fact may be exactly accurate that it could have in fact been anyone in that window if they had seen someone seeming as though that his sighting may have been influenced by the media coverage or his own personal opinion it just really seemed to place like a strong doubt hearing his girlfriend's side of the story and what they could and couldn't see and thanks to this significant doubt in this statement it really started to become clear that the prosecution's argument was particularly weak and it had very little support by this point everything that they kind of had to offer was based entirely on circumstantial evidence one thing that at this point hadn't really been explored have been the potential involvement of John Jones who had been the sheriff's deputy and tandi's ex-boyfriend from what I can gather there isn't really any immediately convincing evidence that makes it like obvious that John Jones should be a suspect that he he was the person who killed Garrett and but I think the point is more that there wasn't really any necessarily convincing evidence the Knik Hilary was guilty and yet he was immediately seen as a suspect it is discussed though that John Jones would have had just as much of an ability to have been the perpetrator as Nick Hilary had due to a number of factors including his house had been located exactly halfway between Garrett's apartment and Garrett's school where he was last seen alive on CCTV footage leaving the school the argument was then made in the trial that it would have been entirely possible for Hilary to have seen Garrett walking home from school and followed him but this could have also been said for John Jones or even anyone else for that matter and there are a lot of people out there especially if you do do an online search of this case who do agree that John Jones was not investigated nearly enough considering at the extent to which the investigation of Internet Hillary especially when the argument is made regarding how his and tandi's relationship ended towards the end of Tandy and John's relationship she had met Hillary while working the bar luck explained so this had been while she had been with John Jones and the more that they kind of talked and seen each other and met up and you know had these conversations the more Tandy and John's relationship had suffered and ultimately ended so it did seem as though it was kind of a likely an impact of this kind of occurrence that his ego panned bruised that maybe he wasn't the biggest fan of Nick Hillary maybe his reputation was dented a little bit because he was known in the area and it had his girlfriend almost like stolen from him by this this unknown man so there's all these potential potential motive that some people have argued the result of the trial of Nick Hillary saw a not guilty verdict having been given by the judge who decided that the circumstantial evidence had not provided a strong enough support for the prosecution's argument as well as the means in which they had collected and investigated the case had been verging on unlawful this meant that Nick Hillary was from then on a free man but one thing is clear like I said is that his life would have been permanently changed from that point despite the fact that he was declared as not guilty his life was changed forever and it did in addition to this Garrett's family still didn't have any justice for their sons that's the main reason this case remains so big to this day is purely around the discussion of the means in which the investigation was carried out from the get-go as it seems as though the investigation immediately focused on Hillary being a suspect if not being focused on him being guilty many have argued that it just wasn't a fair or just investigation and a lot of it can be down to the all forms of prejudice that may have been formed by a number of people directly involved in the case as well as the sheer fact that just didn't seem to be any strong or clear evidence in the case against him to be married however there are a number of people out there who do feel as though Hillary is guilty and that he's managed to get away with murder while others believe that the person responsible could have been john jones the scorned ex-boyfriend or even just someone else completely different that hasn't been explored thank you guys so much for watching like to see both sides of the case in so much debt so please please obviously it's my favorite part about doing these videos is when I see your guys's discussions down below so please feel free to stop this discussion on your opinions down below like I said it just seems to really really divide
