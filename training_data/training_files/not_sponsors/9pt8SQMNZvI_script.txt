hey there it's Adam here from Tesla Australia welcome back to another video well I've just gotten back from the well I'm actually on my way back from the Tesla owners club meet but I had a bit of an idea for another video to kind of shoot on the on the way back and to be honest I've actually been meaning to do it for a long time but because I've had such big issues with autopilot which you've obviously know if you've been following this channel for a while I've just never been able to get it to get it shot and and it's really been kind of frustrating me that at the time I actually wasn't able to kind of go through and actually shoot the video so I thought now that auto parts fixed and working I thought it might be a really good opportunity to to actually shoot this video that I've wanted to do for quite some time so what I want to do today is is I'm heading back home I'm travelling along the Pacific Highway probably about I don't know five minutes or so away from from entering the motorway but for anyone that knows anything about sort of autopilot and navigate on autopilot specifically that I guess the sticker on the box is that it's meant to be able to drive from freeway on-ramp to off-ramp sort of unaided I think most of us that have had navigate on autopilot from the beginning here in Australia have have kind of gone through some struggles with how it's worked in many instances it kind of originally it couldn't take exit at all and it was having issues with Lane changing and it would it would kind of move out of the exit lane into the right lane towards the end but I think now Tesla's had a really good kind of amount of time to go through and actually improve autopilot here in Australia we've had I've lost count of how many software upgrades since we originally got navigate on autopilot but all that a screen shot actually of kind of the software updates that I've had on my car since I've since I've owned it but it's been many so today why not give that a test so what I'm going to do today is I'm going to literally turn on autopilot on the entrance way to the m1 motorway as the as the sticker on the box says and see if we're able to go the entire length of the the motorway to my exit without having to override or or deal with the car whatsoever now note I will need to adjust kind of speed zones that that won't sort of happen automatically unfortunate this point in time hopefully as Elon mentioned not too long ago when not too far away from from that happening with with I guess automatic speed sign recognition but I will have to make some sort of minor adjustments to to speed zones just because of the way the motorway works and some road work zones and and kind of reduced speed limits etc so I'm really hopeful that the car can do it so join me on this video and we'll we'll see how far we can get with the car on autopilot okay here we are entering the m1 motorway now I am going to just wait until this merge area has ended which there's no one coming now but I'm not sure why it does that silly indicate as the as the car gets on the motorway but here we go we have navigate on autopilot enabled right now we can't actually change lanes just because of the the solid unbroken line so the car does want to move across which now we can actually safely do so which that's done that really really well so I guess a I check in the box for freeway entry that worked really well without issue [Music] okay we're just going to adjust the speed up now because we are out of the roadwork zone so we've now got 110 km/h I would expect the car to indicate to move over which it has done and that also worked really well [Music] another lane change which was good moved out of the passing lane without any issue whatsoever all right approaching probably close to halfway along the m1 my M kind of cutting the video just because you probably just don't want to sit here and watch me driving even if I do kind of speed it up so I am kind of cutting it into relevant segments just to just to kind of show you what's kind of going on obviously if I have to jump in and and kind of take over or make any sort of massive changes I'll let you know of kind of what happened and certainly why but so far all's been really good I mean this afternoon the weather's cleared up really well it's a gorgeous sort of wintery afternoon sun is shining and it's really really nice a really nice weather to be out and driving in but but so far what our pilot is doing everything has advertised it so it's working - working really really well so let's keep going on the homeward journey so I just wanted to jump in with a bit of an update maybe just more of an observation in terms of something new that I've kind of seen in in maybe this version of software perhaps maybe even 20 2016 I found it the cars a little bit more patient in terms of when it wants to change lanes so those of you might remember that navigator auto pilot if it detected a car kind of a slower than you that was in front of you it would kind of just indicate and want to change lanes and if there was a trail of five cars in the fast lane then you just sit there with your indicator on it and kind of look like you want to come across what I found in in this version and again maybe 20 20 or 16 as well as the card seems a little bit more patient so I just had an instance where by I was in the middle lane navigator all the part was on a car in front of me was traveling maybe three kilometers under the speed limit and I slowed down to kind of match their speed but at no time did the car indicate that he actually wanted to kind of chain planes into the fast lane to to kind of overtake or or move past them but what happened was when the two cars that were in the fast lane were kind of further ahead the car then indicated that it wanted to move across and pass them so I think I think there is something in their software whereby again the car is kind of realizing based on the on the on the camera on the side of the car to basically just wait if there's a stream of cars and then kind of don't be impatient and kind of want to move across so just a bit of an observation I'll keep a bit more of an eye on it but if you've noticed that on your car maybe comment below and let me know what you kind of think if you've if you've seen that behavior as well in your Tesla with navigating on autopilot I'd be very interested anyway about 20 kilometers to go until we go off the exit but so far things are amazing working really really well all right we are about two and a half kilometers away from my exit and I guess those of you that have seen my previous videos you will know this exit this is this is the one I normally go to on my kind of tests after new software the car right now is indicating that wants to move a cross into the left lane with about two kilometers to go which is really good and it's moving across now which is perfect in my opinion I love two kilometers out a lot more than then kind of one or one and a half so really good job there that worked really well I guess the next test is going to be the exit now traditionally this exit like I've said to you before has kind of taken a little bit rough I have had some instance instances where it does take it as a lane change which is somewhat smoother but the car does get confused at the start when it does choose to do that but when it does take it as an exit it does generally take it quite rough and it is quite a bit of a jerk off to the left and then kind of a re-centering to to kind of get back into the lane so not sure it will get today but we will give it a crack we're just a couple of hundred meters off should see the indicator gone in a second and yeah pretty much pretty much the same maybe slightly better than what I've what I've seen in the last couple of tests but overall pretty pretty damn pretty damn acceptable I guess it is a it is probably a little bit of a hard thing to do when you're thinking about kind of AI and models and things like that and plotting user data into what is kind of a what is kind of a lane change but uh yeah I guess not too bad not too bad what's gonna disengage here to go off the actual exit itself but yeah that was that was pretty good so I guess was was the was the car doing what it says on the box when it comes to navigate on autopilot well absolutely yes it did work very well in no instance at all did I have to jump in and and correct anything that the car did it just continued to do its thing and work like I said I did make sort of manual speed adjustment changes when we were in kind of road work zones and things like that but that was the extent of it I didn't need to do anything else when it came to controlling the car I didn't have to jump in I didn't have to brake I didn't have to handle any specific lane changes either so really really happy with how that works oh and the thing is is this is only going to get better the the software is only going to continue to improve as it gets more and more data so I think we're in for a really good show when it comes to autopilot in the future so what did you think I'd love to see your comments in terms of that that little test now again I did kind of cut it again I didn't want to kind of pace the whole video and kind of just have you watching skimmed up content but hey if you want to see that type of content you want something unedited and uploaded obviously sped up we know I'd be more than happy to do it if it's something that you all want to see so as always if you like this video of watching my content so I really do appreciate that as always again thanks so much and I will catch you on the next video I look forward to it bye for now [Music]
