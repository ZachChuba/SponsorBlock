code SGR for 10% off with free worldwide shipping I've never played a Pokemon game well actually that's a lie I completed pokey on snap played Pokemon ration for like a week played quite a lot of Pokemon go but proper Pokemon games no they just never grabs my attention I'm more than arcade like gamer and although I do plan to play Pokemon one day leave a comment below on what game you think I should start with I do understand Pokemon obviously know what Pokemon is all about but it's well it's just not for me however with all that said one thing I do love is the history of video games and it's literally impossible to talk about the history of gaming without this cute little face popping up constantly and that's fine but hey at least you know that this list of Pokemon facts isn't gonna be filled up with the origin name of this Pokemon or hidden content found on a certain cartridge no right now those sort of things just don't interest me for me someone that's not played a proper game in the series the sort of stuff that interests me is the really really weird stuff that you don't need to be a fan to understand and guys the more I look into this the crazier it gets so please make sure you subscribe and maybe leave a comment below on some of the ones that I've left out in this video because I may make a follow up to this one but for now let's get right to it hi everyone I'm Daniel Robinson aka DJ slopes from slopes game room and this is six disturbing Pokemon facts oh yeah and a quick word of warning please please please don't be offended by anything in this video if you are easily offended you might not want to watch did you know that in Saudi Arabia quite a lot of things are banned or at least at one point were banned for example red roses on Valentine's Day women drivers Harry Potter and doing this I'm so cool but for this video the one band thing worth talking about was no it was obviously Pokemon wasn't it now I'm not talking about the videogame that in fact was actually distributed very early on within the arab world however the card game and TV show didn't truly hit saudi arabian shores until the late 2000s and shortly after the highest religious authority in the land issued a fatwa quite literally a non-binding legal opinion of islamic law to ban pokemon completely this ban was then quickly adapted by lots of other highly ranked religious individuals in egypt and before you know it Pokemon was gone not just the show card game merch and soft toys but also the games too this was due to higher-ups believing that it was a form of gambling and that it helps promote Zionism the nationalist movement to create a homeland for the Jewish people in the Land of Israel in case you didn't know but reports suggested that this ban didn't actually last all that long not for the original gamers at least and they soon found their way back onto shelves but sadly due to the disappearance of the show merch and most notably that card game which was obviously the biggest offender it's sold quite badly originally that was until the last few years when a resurgence of interest emerged and local dealerships finally started importing the trading card game once again in the mid to early noughties now guys at the beginning of this video I did ask for you guys not to take offense to anything you find in this video this segment in particular yes whilst that's fresh in your mind take a look at this pokemon card yes this is a real card that was sold obviously in Japan and that well that is not what it looks like but I'm not blaming you for thinking otherwise you see in Japan this symbol can be found quite frequently in Buddhist temples maps and during 2006 was actually the most frequently used slang word and symbol by teenage girls bringing new meaning to what it actually represents but as a Western um it does feel odd to show so many of these symbols in one of my videos but please understand in this video it's not a bad thing these symbols are literally etched into the history of Japan as well as plenty of other cultures around the world too and although it can mean quite a few things it's simply a symbol of positivity peace love worship you know all of those good things as stated young Chinese girls have gone crazy adding this design into everything that's kawaii and turned into essentially the Japanese version of that weird s-shaped thing that we all know how to draw however it just so happens that a mirrored version of the same symbol was used during World War two which is what it's known as today by the Western world just not in Japan now having a symbol of worship in one part of the world and using pretty much the same symbol for what one of the very worst events in history is a tough one to tackle for Japan and has stated these signs of goodwill are literally itched into some buddhist temples so it's not like japan can simply wipe it from existence without wiping out parts of its own history and this topic has reared its ugly head several times with some people claiming that westerners should just learn to understand its meaning whilst others think it should change so that it doesn't upset people and potentially lose tourism and one of the most recent examples of this is the upcoming 2020 Olympics being held in Tokyo where they've actually gone to the trouble of changing this symbol to the more obvious looking temple logo on maps still watch this space my guess is when that event does draw nearer there'll be plenty of crazy and scared tourists now with all of that's out the way this card is obviously not meant to be offensive of course it's not it's a pokemon card but still it gained quite a lot of backlash understandably I suppose from upset parents and members of the Jewish community which resulted in a slight redesign for the majority of the world that knew no better hand guys which that was the last example of this sort of thing because in Pokemon Diamond and Pearl this little fella also got changed for Western world's yep as did this particular scene from the cartoon yeah let's move on rather quickly shall we in 1997 Pokemon wasn't just big it was huge pretty much the height of its popularity and if you're like me you will remember just how crazy Pokemon was back in his heyday but let me tell you something it was nothing compared to how big it was in Japan according to reports because honestly I've never been to Japan especially in 1997 Pokemon was astronomically massive back then not just with the games the cards all the endless amounts of toys and plushies but probably most important was the TV show now to get even more specific of December 16 1997 at 6:40 p.m. the popular TV show was airing on Japanese televisions and the premiere of episode electric soldier porygon was being shown for the first and only time in the episode the typical crew gets sucked inside a computer where they meet this little fella that's porygon and some random story happens where the computer virus protecting the software is attacking them and Pikachu ends up electrocuting these missiles which obviously causes quite an explosion but it was a very specific type of explosion however this explosion that showed up on the screen constantly flashed between blue red and white this very unique and extremely fast flashing of colors was seen by over 4 million children who were no doubt so excited with the episode that their noses were literally inches from the screen and out of the 4 million plus people that did watch it 685 of them that's 310 boys and 375 girls ended up having epileptic seizures and going to hospital now to be fair most were let out fairly quickly however some kids ended up staying in hospital for quite some time claiming that the frantic seizure was giving constant headaches blurred vision or worse complete blackouts now obviously you guys are seeing a lot of steals in this particular video and there's a reason for that I'm obviously not gonna show you the clip I it's calling to the Pokemon shock if you really do want to push it then maybe you can go and find it yourself I have seen it I don't suffer with any kind of epilepsy or anything like that so it didn't have an effect on me but what I will say it was incredibly uncomfortable to watch anyway after this tragic event as you would expect Pokemon became toxic for all kids news outlets took this let's be honest very serious but probably very honest mistake and ran with it and the show was instantly pulled from the air and the next time it was aired this message was shown to all our viewers we are sincerely and deeply sorry for the high numerous reported cases of adverse physical effects suffered among those who watched last week's Pocket Monsters the show continued to stay off the air for a further four months until this dropped there be no mango Mina come back jo kara anime poked at the most and a whole song mata has American in an investor the

famous yep the world of animation and TV in Japan was never the same Frank so the infamous Pokemon shock and the episode electric soldier porygon that was never ever aired again this is a Defense Intelligence reference document from the US military is a Declassified document from the Army's national ground Intelligence Center now apparently according to the wired article where I found all of this information what you're looking at is type all types of weapons that would be using electromagnetic pulses apparently these pulses could cause a disruption of voluntary muscle control which let's be honest doesn't sound all that nice does it there's plenty more in here than anyone with a sick twisted mind would get a kick out of especially the desired weapons section that goes deeper into detail about these electromagnetic pulses one section reads application of electromagnetic pulses is also a conceptual non-lethal technology that uses electromagnetic energy to induce neural synchrony and disruption of voluntary muscle control again I'm not gonna try and pretend I understand what all of this is about all I do know is it doesn't sound very nice does it I mean who the hell comes up with this stuff who the heck thinks up this sort of stuff who the hell research is just sort of stuff well allow me to continue it is thought that by using a method that can actually trigger nerve synapses directly with an electrical field essentially 100 percent of individuals would be susceptible to seizure induction the photic induced seizure phenomenon was born out of demonstratively on December 16 1997 on Japanese televisions when hundreds of viewers of a popular cartoon show were treated inadvertently to photic seizure induction and there you have it was this weird desired weapon ever actually developed no but what I do know is that this new non-lethal desired weapon was indeed experimented with and harshly tested however it wasn't actually developed regardless it wouldn't have been thought about if it wasn't for a fight between a Pikachu and a porygon [Music] along with cooking mama mama kills animals super tanuki skins hoody and super tofu boy pizza aka people for the ethnic treatment of animals created a flash game in an attempt to attack Pokemon yep parroting pokemons black and white games they put up pokemon black and blue got a free em all as battling pokémon grew in popularity generations of children were growing up believing that pokemon exists for no other reason than to be used and abused by humans children learned about dominance instead of compassion while Pokemon faced the worst abuses children also started bullying each other until one Pokemon decided he'd had enough so basically because you capture Pokemon train them cage them and fight them Peter saw Pokemon has essentially car tuna fide cockfights now to be fair that previous sentence alone is enough to really you know upset quite a few people you literally do train cage and fight these Pokemon so I can see where they're coming from but may even someone like me that doesn't really enjoy Pokemon that much I understand there's so much more to Pokemon than literally training fighting them and caging them and this game that was designed to be played by kids obviously ended up being a joke instantly because those kids understand Pokemon way more than the average parent that knew no better still this didn't stop he different releasing this and even no Nintendo did respond with Nintendo and the Pokemon company take the inappropriate use of our products and intellectual properties seriously nothing got done can you imagine if Nintendo tried to sue a charity obviously they didn't and this resulted in another game pokemon red white and blue this time not only taken a stab at the fact that Nintendo essentially released the same game twice which they do that they released pretty much the same type of game every few years which they do but also taken a stab at McDonald's too as the partnership between the companies came about to promote the latest Pokemon game yeah it's essentially the same game again but we've added McDonald characters to look I see what they're trying to do but honestly this is just stupid they may have made a quick splash in the headlines but the overall outcome is being included in videos like this and making PETA a charity that should be taken very seriously actually end up becoming a bit of a joke now I'm not really sure what route to take this particular segment down it's a pretty crazy one so I'm just gonna give you two numbers 18 and 16 why because there has been 60 injuries regarding Pokemon go and 18 deaths making Pokemon code probably the most dangerous video game ever created it's a crazy world we live in where people get shot playing Pokemon go at night people get run over by drivers who are playing Pokemon go and people are actually breaking into houses to get rare Pokemon and then being murdered for doing so seriously guys the list of weird deaths and injuries coming from this game definitely in its heyday is astonishing they're just virtual pets people stop putting yourself in danger to go and get them also and perhaps you shouldn't go here either also whilst we're on the subject of Pokemon go seriously this whole video could be filled up with Pokemon go segments ever heard of the tumblr pokey peen no well unlucky for you because I'm about to destroy your childhood yes I've had the sense of this thing it's ridiculous because he's essentially Pokemon goat pics yep this was a thing that became so popular that people were obsessed with submitting Pokemon characters in the augmented reality sections of Pokemon go next to or on their junk it's super effective anyway guys that's the video I hope you enjoyed it and has a little special treat I'm going to leave you guys with Stuart ashens who's going to do a fantastic reading of the main theme tune from the Triple X porn parody stro c'mon you're
