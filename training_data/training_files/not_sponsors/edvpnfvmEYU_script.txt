MICHAEL: If you crack that in half, all your shit will get so fucked, it'd be incredible. JEREMY: Can I axe kick your desk? GAVIN: You wanna kick my desk? JEREMY: Really bad. MICHAEL: You wanna kick it? JEREMY: I wanna put my leg into the air and then heel down, and I bet it would go through. MICHAEL: Dude, if you chop it in half... fucking amazing. GAVIN: Yeah, I think you could do it. JEREMY: There's way too much expensive shit on it. GAVIN: All right, I'll hold it. JEREMY: No! MICHAEL: Let me put this into perspective: Gavin himself 'the breaker of everything,' he was afraid to stand on the desk 'cause it was gonna break. GAVIN: No, I'm not afraid to stand on it. MICHAEL: You were afraid to jump on it? What are you afraid of? Matt: Put both feet on it. GAVIN: Jumping on it. MICHAEL: So you won't jump on it, but you want Jeremy to fucking axe kick it? GAVIN: Yeah, because, that will- JEREMY: I don't think that will do it, actually. Seeing that makes me more confident in that desk. MICHAEL: Do it, then. Kick it up, man. Kick it down. MATT: He won't put both feet on it, though, Jeremy. RYAN: Don't break your foot, by the way. JEREMY: I won't break my foot. RYAN: Let's Play Live is like, the end of this week. JEREMY: So, my plan is to just come up and go "bang" down on it, like that. RYAN: Okay... GAVIN: If you go through, I'll catch this.
JEREMY: Alright. Jeremy: Alright.
Matt: Will you??? JEREMY: It won't go through. It's not gonna go through. RYAN: This is a blanket- *RYUSOKYAKU* K.O! Lil J Wins!!! MATT: You didn't catch it! MICHAEL: Remember when I said it was gonna break? RYAN: What I was about to say: blanket forgiveness for anything that happens. You should've let me finish. MICHAEL: Remember when I said it was gonna break? GAVIN: Oh, my God! How did you do that?! MICHAEL: That... is fucking... insanity. GAVIN: Oh, my God! Look at it! MATT: Hey, hey. Xbox didn't turn off. It's okay. RYAN: Now, Gavin, here's the upside: It still works. You can still use it like this. MICHAEL: Hey, Jeremy... RYAN: It's just like the Shenanigans. MICHAEL: Remember when I spilled Coke on your desk? RYAN: All right, we're gonna need a desk... probably tomorrow. MICHAEL: Holy fuck, it all got fucked! (Yelling) How did you think that wasn't gonna happen?! You didn't want to stand on it! You weigh 150 pounds! Of course it was gonna break! I put a fucking hole through the center of it already! It was weak and he kicked the weakest spot on the entire desk! GAVIN: I am blown away. MICHAEL: It was like fucking paper!
GAVIN: Look at that! JEREMY: I'd like to reapply for my black belt. MICHAEL: It was like PAPER! RYAN: That's why, MOVE the stuff. MICHAEL: It... folded immediately! Lindsay: God damn... MATT: What's the shit inside it? MICHAEL: *voice breaking* Well, what the fuck?! MATT: That's-- that IS paper inside of the thing. MICHAEL: Well, no shit, it's fucking cardboard! There's cardboard in the middle of it! RYAN: That's the- oh, we should probably find the keyboard, before it- It's deleting shit or something. *laughter* MICHAEL: Hey, I don't know that we're gonna fucking film tonight. What's shattered in there? Ryan: Here we go. RYAN: There we go. MICHAEL: There's so much glass in there. RYAN: Oh, yeah. That monitor's done. JEREMY: We need...
Ryan: So we need a monitor and a desk. MATT: Hope this video gets a lot of views. Some shit to replace. JEREMY: Um, that's a gif. [OUTRO]
