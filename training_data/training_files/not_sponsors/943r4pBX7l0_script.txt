hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with a short little bonus video for garlic scape pesto which is one of the most interesting and delicious alternative pesto's will ever taste and the recipe itself is super simple and really the only challenging part might be finding the garlic scapes themselves but if grow your own hardneck garlic which i do when they mature and get about this big this really cool looking goose neck shape sprout kind of pops up in the middle and it sort of looks like a leaf but unlike those which are flat this is round and to harvest them all have to do is pinch them off right where they come out of the plant and that is it and that slightly thicker lighter part that's actually the part that with flour and by the way if you're not able to grow your own garlic can often find these things at farmers markets this time of year so call around and if there's any local farms that grow garlic they should be able to get these for and then what we'll do to make pesto besides washing these off would be to give them a rough chop with a knife to make things a little easier for our blender or our food processor and this is exactly why I tell everyone need to have a bench scraper nearby since I could have transferred all those last bits in in a few seconds instead of picking them up one at a time but anyway we'll transfer those into a blender and then to that we will add some freshly squeezed lemon juice and I'll be doing one entire whole lemon here and then for a little extra Sidda tea we will do one tablespoon of white wine vinegar we will also of course need a generous pinch of salt as well as about a half a cup of oil and I'm using a blend of half our oil 1/2 canola oil or could just use all olive oil as long as it's a very mild variety and then last but not least we'll throw in a handful of lightly toasted walnuts and that's it we will simply blend or process that into a paste as smooth as we want which for me was fairly coarse mostly because I was blending such a small amount and I really didn't want to dilute it by adding a splash of water which would have made it come out smoother so this is what I came out with and it really was magnificent ok as far as the flavour goes it's not super easy to describe but I think it tastes sort of like a mild version of garlic cross with a very very mildly flavored green bean and whereas in a regular pesto we have the garlic and then we're getting that green vegetal flavor from the basil well here the garlic scape is actually providing both and while it is a very similar experience it's also quite unique and unlike anything you've had before and as far as using it goes it is as might expect really really good on pasta like this bowl of linguine for example I mean just tremendous and I'm actually not a huge pesto lover as far as pasta goes but I will leave this stuff anytime oh and I should mention when it's heated through like this the flavor of those garlic scapes kind of mellows out and some people think it even tastes a little bit like asparagus although without any kind of bitterness and it really does still taste strongly of garlic but not overpowering Lisa and yes I was having a little trouble eating around the camera and I probably should have twirled it in a spoon like a real Italian so that's one fantastic way to enjoy it but let me show one more and that would be to use it as a condiment on top of a beautiful pan fried steak oh yeah that is gonna work really really good and don't even get me started on how delicious that was with those roasted potatoes and peppers but anyway that's it just a little quick and dirty video on how to make garlic scape pesto okay try to plant some hardneck garlic if can and harvest your own or like I said check out your local farms and markets and if can find some I really do hope give us a try soon so please follow the links below for the ingredient amounts a principle written recipe and much more info as usual and as always enjoy
