[Music] this is my time to get one solver kill it's either fishing xp by fishing the scales or it's combat xp by killing zolora so i'm gonna try one kill just for shits and giggles without a guide uh just see how intuitive intuitively good i would be at zora so let's see how this is going to go probably terrible i don't know what i should put my quick prayers on to be fair all right this is going to be hilarious tank man here we go guys let's see how this goes oh melee do i need to step back or something right oh i guess i'll run to the other side now or something or do i just attack him i don't know ah it's not ideal is it [ __ ] i need to be on the other side don't i oh no i don't i don't stay i don't know where the safe spots are oh no my guy's always all the way over there oh i'm on the wrong side [Music] you know what i might have to do a guide guys ladies and gentlemen i introduce to you palestine do i instantly pray stand down a little bit yeah there we go boys when this is done uh you see the first pillar walk to the first black dots you see from the pillar no there no here nope this side yes stay there stay there all right now we wait again right i forgot what happens now to be honest nice to the bottom of the same site where we started oh yeah nice just pray and eat like literally pray to god himself walk all the way to the other side pretty much we got it boys easy z thank you man oh my god year all right enjoy the video i'm on the herb lower ground right now and we all know all i can do is wait for my herbs to grow i could also do brutus victims but for now while we're waiting for our crops to grow i think it might be a good idea to finally start doing construction we've been postponing this for so incredibly long and i promised everyone that i would do it when we got a farming under herbalores or a herbal or step now i can train my construction up to 88 because that is the requirement for monster clue stashes i don't know how much i got banked but at least i can start upgrading my house now because that thing is looking like an absolute ghetto all right so i got my shopping list let's spend some money on marbles blo marble blocks and golden leaves for the gilded altar in the portland portal nexus yikes all right i think i'm taking deathly his deathly mansion it's from the halloween event yes dude all right i'm excited but first i'm gonna buy some bad trees oh my god yes this horse decoration is sick oh man i don't i have no idea how to do the house dude 200k i need to upgrade it so you mean that's eight marble oh my i'm getting [ __ ] robbed here so the gillette alter a bowl of cloths i keep forgetting this is like a childhood dream come through this is building a gilded altar in your house look at that one do i make the torches i'll never have to train prayer anymore anyway so it's purely aesthetic uh let's build the first pool and then start upgrading stamina pots and prayer pots all right rejuvenation pool and i'll probably upgrade to towards the next one with a boost there it is the portal nexus and now i just gotta check what i put in there to be fair anything that is not on ancients i would say because when i don't want ancients it's the worst to get around i don't know why i didn't have a glory mounted probably because i was too arrogant and i had way too many glories already in the house i have still about 60. brother this is so incredibly expensive yes yes it says make it what do you mean two four six don't drop don't drop don't drop don't drop don't drop don't drop don't drop never knew making a house could be that stressful and i was right on time too i think i'm done with the house i mean it still doesn't look the best but it looks better let's see in non-building mode cause it might look a bit ugly still with the grass i mean this looks a bit ridiculous doesn't it i might just have to delete this entirely oh wait i'll switch it with the menagerie that's actually a good idea i'll move this somewhere there so we don't see it but it's not a waste of money and then we'll move the menagerie closer and um yeah we'll see if i put my pets in there i like having my pets in the bank but at least have the thing there so log out i mean get out of building mode and there it is yeah the house looks at least a little bit better all right in one last effort i will try and boost for the fancy region of pool it's also a plus three i should have done it in one go but i was too stupid plus i didn't have the inventory space so can we get lucky okay we got one more chance ah come on come on come on come on come on plus three oh it's a plus six i made a plus four there it is the region of pool yes dude what a beautiful thing now the house is done for now that's really cool [Music] all right boys the last lap the last lap and we got the 82 herblore finally 82 boosted up to 87. i will passively keep doing my herb runs so i can actually get that 87 eventually but i'm so glad that this is not gonna be going on for any longer because it's such non-content just waiting for your farming crops to go it's just really really boring so without further ado we need a couple more tiger berries and then we're ready for this boost that's coming up i did grow a cat because like unfortunately my um hellcat passed away i don't know how that happened i guess she just got hungry in the bank and she disappeared i 100 did not let it die on a rat that's not what happened anyway i got a new cat we got 82 our bloor let's boost and let's get this step over and done with and boom 87 that's it that's it yes hey look at this thing an anti-venom baby let's continue with the monster step this was step number four so we're going into five now and let's get back on these i really wouldn't mind doing bandos i'd prefer the bandwidth boots over the god sword but we'll see sherlock i'm done i am absolutely done new clue casket maybe yes is this 18 it's 19 already always nice to be rewarded after a semi-big grind with a casket camelot lucky place not really we haven't gotten much here but come on boom that's a lot of purple sweets holy [ __ ] it's not a horrible casket it's 400k but i've seen more beautiful things in my life in my time all right back after scotizo got a couple of monsters and elites i mean hearts and elites to open again are we gonna get lucky oh no that's beginner those are for later here we go two elites five hard clues start with the hearts [Music] nothing new though we got two more elites one in five for a monster clue come on it's a mimic yes oh it's been so long yes dude i'm still [ __ ] at mimics but let's go alright mimic time baby will you fight it yes i hate when it comes this close bro it's so [ __ ] to walk through him too it's going better than it used to i think let's just eat all the way up and then finish him see i don't even know if i can wear them through or not this was a way better kill than uh all my other ones but i'm so bad at it that's the new personal best five mimics decent amount do we instantly open i guess we do right open the mimic one extra item yes a monster baby yes that's what we want mimic didn't do much to that oh oh fallow instant fallow oh god luckily it's just an ob mall i should have all the chaos runes in the bank boom there's the kid home very easy and we also have the ornament kit for wait where is it there it is boom to zarkadom ornament kid dude now this is very swaggy uh i kind of wished it wasn't the casket because i want to get a new step but we did get the 20th monster clue casket uh that means tomorrow we're going to finish our scotiso totems and do another way of getting clue scrolls but first we got to open the clue oh we still have an elite we could actually get a new monster too let's open the monster first oh torture ornament oh don't tell me that's a dupe that might be a dupe that'd be so [ __ ] oh no oh yeah tormented and oh yes that's really good actually that's super good torture and tormented if in the end game we decide to go for all the items we have ornament kits for that's two zenite jewelries really sick all right let's see if we can get another monster oh my god double unique one of them is unique this one we already have but hey i'm happy with the mithril dragon mask that's new very good opening holy [ __ ] what wait what oh come on how rare are those they're one in 128 okay it's not that bad okay i mean i mean i'll take it i mean i don't have the bank space which kind of sucks but i mean sure and that was the very last scotiso kill and i'm so happy that i got an elite from that but we're officially out of totems i don't really remember what we started at something like 60 58 something like that and we're finally out boys finally we have to find a new way to get clues and i know the perfect way but first let's open these heart and elite clues without further ado two elite lose three heart clues the very last ones from scotiza after this we're going to the ham members for easy clues because i feel like i have not done enough easy clues compared to my other clues so we're starting off with the heart clues and another enemy of glory t that'd be sick for my hardcore well then again i don't really use a glory anymore can we get another monster clue this is a very weird clue nothing we need though oh this is bad yo this is bad all right two more elites please basically 50 chance of getting a monster clue those are basically the two same clues and they were terrible to the hand members we go it is time to get our easy clues up i want 500 by the end of the week that means i want the large spade milestone reward very very soon now how many easy clues have we done we have done 358 that needs to be 500 so that's 100 16 42 i do math we're opening every 10. so are we going to get a cape of skulls or a new master club monster who's 1 in 50 boys here we go these are oh my god i don't really remember how good easy clues are i think they're really bad but um yeah this is not looking too great is it i should open these in my house there's gonna be a lot of new uniques because a lot of them um are gonna be pre-collection log all right these are looking not too great i'm not gonna lie and the last one is also trash i'll see you with the next 10. all right ten more are we finally gonna hit mega rare table on this account maybe a little team cape maybe a capus culls oh [ __ ] we got a monster yo i didn't expect to get it that soon from the yeezys yes dude let's bank the easies yo we just got the farming step right as i'm here 85 farming oh i have look how many u seeds i have i've got 104 u seeds i should actually train my farming finally and meanwhile i can just stack up some keys for the bryo fetus step i think oh we can do a sporey true i got a couple of hispories i don't have a lot i only have seven hispories but we can 100 plant those so let's get prepared actually because this could be really cool for the account yo i am rich look at the seeds i have man 24 palm six dragon fruit 18 magic uh the 100 and something used we got mahogany's on deck eight of them 33 teaks yeah this should be over very soon to be very fair holy crap that's insane is this my this is my fourth history ever i think i don't know how i don't know where those other three histories came from but maybe we get more lucky than the hardcore iron man and we actually get the bottomless compost bucket on this again i swear to god if this happens i'm gonna be so pissed you see it again that's not bad and chrono seeds so i can uh make my stuff grow faster that's good i'm gonna instantly plant plant that here we go boys this is the one if this eclectic implant wants to run into my arms tonight is that a song i know you want to give me that level that i've been waiting for for like i don't know how long we've been sitting on 82 hunter before a while oh areas come on of course the pathing is gonna just completely screw me up no don't go back dude come on are you really gonna give me this much of an effort okay i'm catching this essence i'm playing i don't care they also drop medium clues there we go 8300 we can now catch dragon implants if we see one flying around we have a chance of getting an elite clue right now one in 50 i think so we can now get elite clues from him imps that's actually pretty sick we're just trying to kill some times while time while growing crops and stacking up some new clues all right one game of tithe farm is all you can make me do i hate this place with a burning passion but we're 1.4 k away from the goal so eight of them should hopefully be enough for 1.4 kxp oh just about 82. let's head to the farming guild boost with a farming with a garmin garden pie and get this monster clue progressed there's the monster clue there's the garden pie i got a spade with me oh this is a very first step okay so we can still get a massive grind on this monster it's far from done so let's see what we get hopefully this this garden pie doesn't run out anytime right before i got a dig or something all right we've done it that's the step done oh right on time too all right combining into a badness bootstep puro puro i know that plays very very well been there for the past couple of days while we're stacking up clues while waiting for the farming crops to grow so a barrow's chest plus a clue completion any ferrex helmers oh man i'm never getting enough eric's helm back i swear the new step is hopefully not the same step all right you're all good chance on the dark mayor step again no yuri has a [ __ ] right hook dude now give me the casket and let it be something beautiful there it is lads casket number 21 any uniques i think we got fourth so far maybe three whatever anything that's a standard monster clue we do have a couple things in the bank now to open being 29 easies and 25 medium clues and a hard clue um so i guess i'll start with the hard clue real quick we'll open that because there's nothing going to be in there okay there we go get the annoying thing out of the way because that's the most disappointing thing and now we got some easy clues but the surprise i'm gonna drop into the top 100 clue scrolls right now with all these clue scrolls in the bank i'm easily gonna drop to about place 95 so that's actually a pretty sick milestone on the account finally we are getting kind of respectable we're getting up there on the ladder without further ado we are snacking up easy clues just because i want the milestone reward of the large spade it's 500 easy glues total and right now we have 370 so let's open some of these maybe finally hit mega rare table holy crap these are bad i'm actually just going to drop this stuff that might be unique actually i'll just move on there it is a monster clue that was cl that was very quick all right what step could this be step number three that rhymed so i'm an mc i'm gonna stop because i'm cringy okay i would like the bandos bootstep i'm feeling some pvm i'm kind of done with the skilling steps the purest is on the ground does that indicate a room crafting step uh oh sherlock could really give me a skilling step and as i said there's i think two more that i can get which is the roon dart and the pickpocket and elf if i get the roon dart one it would set me up for good on this account so i can make bolts etc etc you guys have heard me say this million times before what is it oh it's 80 agility i forgot about it 80 agility oh my god no agility content man ah brother if only we had the dark matter step so we could do sepulcher i could finally get into my alc tab i told you guys i was gonna dive into this tab when i got the agility step well there's a lot to alk and here it goes the very lost alk the dragon mace down the drain and now we can just train agility without alking but look at the cash stack in the bottom of the inventory man if we add this up into the poh or into the bank i mean we have 30 mil hard cash we also have 90 marks of grace and we can just bank everything uh what is something fashion escape that could wear while running around i guess i'll get the the shadow sword out that's pretty sick all right let's keep training agility worth 73 and a half almost 74. this is going to be 74 agility and not only 74 agility we are also going to get 125 million total xp which is kind of kind of cool hang on i completely missed it there it is 76 agility we can do the monster glue now i was com like i was just brainlessly doing agility and suddenly we're here suddenly it's done we got to do the relic of course summer pie in hand and let's continue the monster clue uh let me eat a summer pie let's get up there and complete this challenge this didn't even take that long this took like four days pull up in each agility course is pretty decent we got 76 because now we can do the zorber shortcut for clues when i get to step again i will go for all the way to 80 i do want a min max this account eventually but because i've gotten so many skilling steps and i kind of want a pvm step i'm just boosting a lot right now but eventually we will get these levels though so i've never gotten this step before um i do need to make this death tiara here and then i can instantly do the clue step so that's really nice uh let's get yuri out of here wait i don't have prayer oh crap this might actually be not too great major tag bonus godwards dungeon and biblia perfect no problem there whatsoever all right boys here we go this is casket number i believe 23. it's 22. damn it i always overstate my cost kids but nevertheless after this monster clue we have a bunch of mediums and easy still to open i'm excited about those but first can we get another monster clue unique any bloodhound pets okay this is the worst monster caskets i've received ever we got a bunch of mediums and a bunch of eases we'll do the easies first am i gonna get any mega rares probably not but hey who knows i still want that easy milestone reward which is 500 easies i think we're far from that oh there wow that was a quick monster clue and the first new monster exclusive this is one in 50. is crazy how fast i'm getting these that's the second one from easy clues too first step is spined chaps i think i have those otherwise i gotta make them i know i alked them back in the day when i did dk it's really dumb because i'm gonna have to kill some dk's right now because i don't have the the hides for that all right ziggly make my hides please diagonal spined armor i would like the leg armor thank you yes and that's it i've been streaming the witcher for like the past five days and i'm really enjoying it it's the first playthrough ever so we'll see but uh yeah it's 8 p.m i haven't eaten still so we'll see how far we get with this why do i talk to her and then get heated back to this guy [Music] here it is again boys here it is again the one step the very first monster step we ever got and i asked for some bvm and you know what i'm super happy about it i'm super happy about it we can go back to bandos hopefully it's not too cluttered i know it can be the only problem with this step is the shards i think the shards are more rare than the hilt and obviously i could go really dry on the shards but we have a new era on the clue scroll account the bando is god sword most of you will remember it the bandos godsword step it's a step that we started at the start of this year it's kind of poetic 2020 started for us with the banter's god sword step then we alked it because it was too difficult throughout the year we got a bunch of upgrades and at the end of the year we just get the step back and this time there is no chance i'm alking it i want to thank you all for the incredible support you showed me throughout the year thanks for commenting thanks for liking thanks for subscribing happy holidays and i'll see you guys in january with the bandos grind again peace out [Music] you
