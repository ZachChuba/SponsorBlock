if you saw my last video you know that we have some pretty big things happening in the shop lately and it's time to upgrade my security i have a few yuffy smart cameras around the property and they've done a pretty good job there's no wiring to deal with they're all battery powered and communicate through wi-fi which means that there's also no monthly fees which is a pretty good deal the issue though is that i do have to charge them up about every five or six months which isn't a deal breaker but it is something that i have to do on a regular basis today though yuffie a branch off my channel sponsor anchor just dropped a brand new camera a 360 degree security flood light i have an old school flood light that i'm going to be replacing with this new upgraded high-tech version this does need to be hardwired which is a little bit more work up front but saves me the hassle of charging up every five or six months like my other cameras and they'll still all work together in the same system i'll leave a link down the description so you can check out the current pricing as well as a 50 discount code if you get one within the next 30 days it's time to wire this up and see how it works let's get started super important thing to remember before you work on electricity is to make sure there is no electricity i have one of these little tools that can tell if electricity is running through a wire without actually plugging anything in these wires right here are the ones heading up to that light fixture that we'll be working on and as we can tell they are currently powered so we will flip the breaker where those lights are connected to and now we're safe to start working taking down my old light just has one large screw in the center and three wires underneath connecting it to power with the old unsmart light disconnected we can unbox the smart light inside the box we get the uv 360 camera along with the built-in multi-directional led lights these can color change from warm white to cool white to kind of match with the sunsets the camera can be mounted on a flat ceiling or folds out at 90 degrees to mount on the wall which is what i'm gonna do setting up the camera is easy enough just like all the other uf cameras i have i'm gonna plug it in temporarily and take a picture of the qr code underneath the camera then once the light is blinking red press the sync button in the back and it's connected to my system along with all my other cameras it doesn't get much easier than that setup was successful wiring the new ufe light into the existing socket is actually pretty simple obviously if you're not comfortable working with electricity make sure you hire someone for this part a professional i'm just going to connect the green wire to the ground the black hot wire to the other black wire coming out of the house as well as the white neutral wire coming out of the house i am using wire nuts to connect these wires together just extending the stranded wire from the uv light slightly above the solid wire so that the wire nut grips onto the stranded as it's screwing down into place holding everything securely which allows me to then lift the light into place with the one large bolt in the center all in all the installation took about 20 minutes and just like that with the breaker flipped on we have full access to the camera kind of fun that it has full motor control capabilities right here from the app as well as the ability to turn the lights on and off which reminds me we'll have to test the lights out more tonight to see how motion activated they are as well as the camera quality but let's check out the motion tracking right now during the day here's some actual footage from the camera 2k resolution gives you plenty of pixels to work with and the ability to crop in after the fact the floodlight cam 2 pro does have motion tracking up to 40 feet away with a 360 degree pan and tilt it can track as i walk across the field of view and then turn around and walk back the other direction the tracking happens automatically there is internal recording storage built directly into the camera enough to record for 5 days continuously or 30 days worth of event recordings it also has built-in audio so you can communicate through the camera if for whatever reason someone decides to steal your ladder and waltz off into the sunset and here's what the footage looks like at night i have the lights set to turn on when i'm about 30 feet away and then once again the camera starts recording and tracking me even though it's night time it does a good job of keeping track of people who might show up to measure your driveway in the middle of the night it's nice to have some documentation those three adjustable light panels surrounding the camera have a total of 3 000 lumens and are compatible with google voice assistant and alexa just depends on how integrated you want to be overall the yuffie security along with that 50 discount code if you have any questions leave them down in the comments and i'll try to answer them as well as come hang out with me on instagram and twitter i have a couple videos showing off what we're doing here in the garage coming up really soon thanks don't for watching and i'll see you around
