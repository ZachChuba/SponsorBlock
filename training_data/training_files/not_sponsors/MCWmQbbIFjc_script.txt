it's a browser what's gamer about it it's for playing farmville on Facebook it runs better it's got how do I turn that on that's important and the UI is just of course probably thick gray it's the most dark mode II I could customize the browser raise your chroma what I can move it anywhere I want believe you can't see for you little bit well that's good you know castles crypto JavaScript O's Ram limiter Oh as I can tell it no don't take my RAM good gravy this is awesome Wow very excited to not install this at home the video game industry is now bigger than both the film and music industry so naturally everybody wants to cash in there's gaming chairs gaming desks and even gaming socks for pete's sake and now finally we've taken it to yet another level a gaming web browser that is no kidding what opera GX calls itself and no actually it is apparently not just for playing the most demanding browser games on neopets it comes with a ton of features that opera claims are designed for hashtag that gamer life like a CPU and RAM limiter the question is is this as stupid as it sounds and looks and the other question also is can you trust opera because the companies allegedly been doing some pretty shady stuff lately yeah who's not shady though our sponsor rich wallet stop carrying around pointless cards like old hotel room keys and spent gift cards bridge wallet helps you keep your bulge down and when use offer code blindness you'll save 10% and get free worldwide shipping at the link below [Music] what are we looking at here on a very basic level opera GX is a custom version of the chromium based Opera browser and it actually launched last June but we're covering it now because frankly speaking we just didn't notice which kind of make sense I mean I know we joke about no one uses Firefox but nine percent market share looks pretty great compared to operas one point four six percent which doesn't mean that opera is bad it differentiates itself by having some features baked right in that you would normally have to add with extensions an add slash tracker blocker screenshotting tool messenger mini apps and even a cryptocurrency wallet and a VPN it's a sake VPN both because of how it actually works and because opera might not be who you want to trust with your data given their recent predatory loan related scandal but we'll get to that more later for now just know that this is essentially opera as you may or may not know it plus some additional features and aesthetic tweaks for gamers now the aesthetic side of that is obvious here because we've got a lot of angular lines and dark color schemes and even Razer chroma RGB synchronization and that's all without messing with the rendering of actual website content here's a neat site lgt store.com look at these great and fashionable clothing products also in here are a few options for the default background including some animated ones which is kind of cool and then there's like some baffling stuff like an option to change the animations for the speed dial shortcuts I guess is fine on its own but then they also have their own associated sound effects that are composed in collaboration with sound designer Reuben Rin Khan and the bend Berlin 'test who recently received a nomination in the BAFTA games awards for the original game soundtrack to Gris they all kind of sound like wishes to me but okay as for the features with some more substance the main attractions are the limiters clicking the speedometer icon in the sidebar will pop out a UI where you can monitor and a cap on how much network bandwidth RAM and CPU power opera GX is allowed to use we tested this by playing city skylines which is very CPU intensive with 50 tabs open in the background just to see if we could observe a difference between opera GX and chrome and in terms of frames per second at least we didn't but that doesn't mean that the feature didn't work as intended and that you won't see a difference we did notice that task manager consistently reported Opera G X's CPU and RAM usage as a bit higher than what opera said it was using and our machine equipped with an 8700 K was powerful enough to chug through our workload regardless of limiters but Chrome ended up using measurably more resources than opera GX did once it had those features enabled so obviously whether this has a noticeable impact on your gaming experience depends on your situation but I really can see this being useful if say you're downloading a game through Steam and you want to limit your browser's bandwidth so it comes down as fast as possible or if you've got an entry level system and you want to keep a bunch of tabs open so you don't lose them but you don't want your browser to hurt your gaming performance the other main cool feature in opera GX is the pop-out video player which lets you resize and place YouTube twitch or other web videos overtop of anything else on your desktop this seems especially useful if you're running low on monitor real estate allowing you to keep watching something without having to resize an entire monitor window and be left with only a tiny sliver of actual video it also stays always on top of all of your programs including games which is pretty awesome for single monitor gamers if they happen to be gifted enough to be able to simultaneously watch a video and play video games I mean nobody does that right ok no that is a gist and more importantly it is a dead meme Twitter said so and Twitter knows and there's some more little game reach weeks that might make this attractive to a certain audience a twitch sidebar shortcut that notifies you when streamers you follow go live as well as GX corner a regularly updated page that keeps back of upcoming game releases news and deals although I guess they're still working on the deal section because it's not there right now so he started out with this video thinking this was just gonna be like a rant about how stupid it is but it ended up not being that stupid which doesn't necessarily mean that you should use it here's where we get back to the whole Opera non GX the browser has a long history having been originally built using the proprietary presto engine back in 1995 it switched to using chromium in 2013 and then in 2016 Opera Software was acquired by a consortium of Chinese investors known as golden brick capital private equity fund limited partnership I mean with a trustworthy name like that how could you not sell to them right things actually seem to be going pretty smoothly for the most part until just recently when hindenburg research published a report alleging that four of opera software's other apps were doing some sketchy stuff that was in violation of Google Play Store Policies these apps apparently were targeting people in India Kenya and Nigeria with predatory loans offering APRs of 33 percent when the actual rate was as high as four hundred and thirty eight percent the report goes on to suggest that opera was resorting to these shady practices in the face of a drastic drop in their user numbers and revenue and also remember that sucky VPN we mentioned so it's not actually a VPN it's more of a proxy service and it tanks your network performance while having a suite of benefits that are dubious at best on top of all of that the current opera CEO is allegedly involved in another Chinese lending business that was accused of fraud and illegal lending practices so here we are then opera GX the product actually shockingly not terrible but it still doesn't seem like this is the best time to support this company even if it might make it easier for you to watch your anime music videos while you wreak filthy casuals in Cod speaking of casuals what do you get when you casually drop this segue to our sponsor honestly these things are freaking sick so thanks for going on this adventure with us gamers if you're looking for something else to watch check out
