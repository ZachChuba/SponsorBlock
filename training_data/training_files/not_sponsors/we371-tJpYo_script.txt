this video is sponsored by brilliant Hey so cancer is a scary thing and it seems that these days you can't like look in a magazine or read a paper especially the Daily Mail without seeing something that is now being reported as something that causes cancer it's all don't listen to it really though don't listen to it just let it go but there are things that we know that do cause cancer and I'm going to break it all down for you a little bit so I'm gonna go with like the five main things that do cause cancer that we know that it's just undisputed it caused the cancer so not gonna be in any order but I would say the number one thing that you just you just can't deny it that causes cancer and that is smoking I know right everybody knows it I don't need to tell you that it is the number one cause I think like 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking of course if you smoke you can smoke all your life and not cancer but it is going to increase your risk by a crap-ton percent so don't do it it's on the little like cigarette boxes and everything like you can see what your lung could look like your lungs do go black may not cause cancer but it looks gross number two is gonna be this isn't in any order by the way up like severity or increased risk but number two is gonna be excessive alcohol consumption and already this is becoming a list of how to be uncool I know I'm sorry but it is what it is so act excessive alcohol consumption it can cause a big ton of different kinds of cancer including colon cancer stomach cancer mouth cancer throat cancer all the good GI tract cancers can also cause breast cancer in women this is because there is a link with excessive alcohol consumption and an increase in estrogen and as you may know estrogen are increased in eastern levels can cause breast cancer and then we have number three which is definitely a continuation of my list of well this is now just a list of how to be uncool that is unprotected sex yes sex can cause cancer in particular I can call cervical cancer and this is through infection with HPV or human papilloma virus it's something that oh there is a vaccine against it I just remember there is a vaccine against it and this is offered to young girls hopefully before they've started you know doing it hopefully young enough but yeah so you can get infected with HPV hey just because you get an infection doesn't mean you're gonna get cancer but it is something that does cause cervical cancer type 16 and 18 are the most common types of HPV infection that can cause cancer so HPV infections are quite common apparently eight out of ten women in the UK have had HPV infection at some point in their lives I probably have maybe hope not but you can have like no symptoms at all and it can go away by itself so it's kind of something not really to worry about but also just be safe yeah I know I'm like you're uncool and don't drink don't smoke don't have sex don't have unprotected sex you will get pregnant and you will die number four on my list of how to be uncool is of course don't sunbathe don't look beautiful in town don't look like a goddess oh so beautiful yeah I don't really agree with I was reading on Mike Mullins website let me just go back to it they said where is it where is it where is it where is it take care of the Sun my ghrelin doric have said they've got a little um how to reduce your risk of cancer article that I will link down below but they've got a section on take care in the Sun it says spending some time outside in the Sun helps you stay healthy our bodies use the UVB rays and sunlight to make vitamin D and you do need vitamin D and you do need the other types of vitamin D but be safe with that like I said you don't wanna get HPV infection right so this is important for bone health right and reduces the risk of many illnesses including cancer but it also is important to protect your skin from burning as this can increase your risk of skin cancers and now this is the bit that I don't really agree with if you're gonna be out in the Sun for longer than a few minutes a few minutes use a sunscreen with a Sun Protection factor or SPF of at least 30 I don't know anyone who's gonna bother doing that I don't know why you would bother advising that because everyone's different everyone's skin is different the amount of time that someone's day in the Sun is different without getting burnt also I'm not gonna spend a lot of money on covering myself and looking like Casper with factor 30 and sticky and unnecessary a lot at a time but just be safe put on I always wear like SPF 15 on my face every day just cause it's like built-in into my moisturizer anyways I'm lazy like that but I always put on like 30 or 50 on my shoulders and anywhere else that's like super exposed when it is really hot outside and I know I'm gonna burn if I don't so just be just be smart about it you don't have to be uncool just be smart about just be smart about it and then number five is going to be a funny one because I just spotted it on the Macmillan or website and is it again I'll remind you is like how to reduce your risk of cancer article and one of the biggest risk factors it says is age and I how can you do anything about that Macmillan I'm sorry but stop it it's just a list of it really is a list of like how to be uncool now or just a list of things that uncool people or r2 don't smoke don't drink don't have sex unprotected sex don't go out in the Sun and look like a beautiful goddess and also don't get all you can do now don't get old Jesus Christ cool it's a hard light okay so it is a hard list it's a hard list of things to follow I would say number one don't smoke try not to start I know it's really easy for me to say you shouldn't smoke when I'm not someone who smokes and I don't know what it's like to quit but I don't care try for Jesus Christ's sake try for yourself and your own health and well-being number two drinking you don't have to do it excessively I know that it's kind of hard not to drink in a society where it's kind of like frowned upon if you don't drink and it's like you're really weird and uncool if you don't drink so I do have a drink every now and again just because I don't really like it I don't like the taste of it I just do it because everyone else does it and I'm an absolute sheep like that but sometimes I'm just like no I don't know I got work tomorrow no I'm drinking that's oh nice I'm driving driving there's a bit excuse not to drink if you go to like publicly friends and you're like don't you feel like drinking tonight I don't really want to spend crap loads of money on drink just like you're driving you go there even if it's like five minutes from your house just say oh yeah I drove here done sorted yeah so just reduce the amount of alcohol you drink you don't need it in your life you really don't you can trip there's a whole time punch there's a whole bunch of other drinks that you can have when you're out and about doesn't have to be alcoholic it's bad for you it's a little literal literal poison on your liver will thank you for it number three was oh yeah poking unprotected ly unprotected ly don't poke unprotected ly that is my message for my PSA today don't poke unprotected ly tell your friends number four just be safe in the Sun if you know you're gonna burn put on sunscreen you don't have to look like crazy person with the big hat and the like white linen clothes that you see sometimes just safe and number five don't get old okay sir thank you
