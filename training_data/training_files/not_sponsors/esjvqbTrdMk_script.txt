welcome back to new rockstars I'm Eric Voss and ro1 is a Star Wars story that oddly gets better and better with age largely because it celebrates everything Star Wars fans love incredible visuals deep cuts to the lore actual wars a Darth Vader who's really scary again and a plot so straightforward it could be summed up in a few yellow words ahead of the rise of Skywalker I'm going to comb back through rogue one to find all the new details and Easter eggs that we miss back in my 2017 breakdown back when our work space was haunted with random ghosts who popped up in the background and before we begin and places anyway let's start at the beginning of the rebels mission to steal the Death Star plans that mission began with a prologue on the planet lamu now there's no classic opening crawled of rogue one instead director Gareth Edwards cast a shadow on the planet's rings creating this grey triangular shape that evokes the opening image of the original Star Wars which opened with Vader's Star Destroyer the Devastator chasing down the ship that ends this film the tanta for it is on lamu where director Orson Critic finds Galen R so forcing him to finish the building the Death Star killing his wife creating an enemy in the Imperial ranks that would later become the Empire's fatal flaw we can see this as task one of the rebels mission because without Galen none of this would be possible they're actually more cool Easter eggs here meant to evoke the original Star Wars moisture vaporators and blue bantha milk both paralleling Luke's moisture farm on Tatooine and critic is dressed in white with his death troopers in black meant as a reversal of the opening shots of Vader in black flanked by white strong troopers and we move on to tasks - of this rebel mission with casseon and or receiving Intel and k2 a so breaking Galen's daughter gen or so from prison on a planet whoa Bonnie an anagram for obi-wan also bueno notice that the rebel calls her by this alias the name Liana is actually reference to the alias given to Mara Jade by the emperor when he introduced her to Grand Admiral Thrawn in the dark force rising book now on to task 3 casting in bringing Jenna to gavin for to brief her they recreated the rebel base set perfectly and they filled it with cameos by gonk droids and astromech droids I think you can actually see r2 this early in the background mon mothma is played by genevieve o'reilly who played the character in the deleted scene from Revenge of the Sith along with Jimmy Smits coming back as Bail Organa general Jan tadhana is also present he's now played by Ian McKellen II from Game of Thrones now task 4 of this plan takes them to Jenna to find Sagar era in his group called the partisans among them are the brothers Ed Rio and benthic two tubes actually before joining the partisans benthic was previously part of the cloud riders whom we saw in the solo movie also in this group is this little guy we team QB he's played by actor Warwick Davis continuing his tradition of playing characters with w names in the Star Wars movies like wicket the Ewok wold and weasel from Phantom Menace and wall oven in the force awakens throughout the Jetta plateau Jin and cassian past a bunch of Easter eggs including an imperial probe droid and these two fellas dr. Cornelius Amazon and Ponda Baba you remember these two d-bags is the ones who picked a fight with Luke and obi-wan and Maz Eisley that did not end well for them there's actually a whole removed backstory with these two being tracked by another character Tampa's 'la and Kayson bog we saw the two of them and one of the trailers for rogue one case involves one of Emma's ons Dee crane eiated surgery experiments gone awry this case would have ended with their deaths in the cantina in-laws Leslie the de created was actually later used on Dryden boss's yacht in soloist our story Ginny Cassie and also meat-based Albus and Sharon M way described as the guardians of the wheels guardians of the Wills referencing the ancient storytellers the Wills in George Lucas's original framing narrative in an early draft of his Star Wars script in way says may the force of others be with you which is actually from an early version of that Star Wars script which is later changed to may the force be with you before Lucas decided to capitalize force and make it old thing which would later have medic lorian's is tasks five of the rebels victory is more of a long game of playing the Empire's bureaucracy and middle management against itself a well-known tactic of outgunned resistances against occupying regimes in this case it's Galen or so using Bodhi Brooks defection to drive a wedge between rival Imperial officers critic in turkan in the Star Wars scene where Vader forced choked Admiral mati there's an empty chair at that table which presumably belonged to critic critic has to answer to Vader in his castle on Mustafar the planet Vader fought obi-wan on in Revenge of the Sith his castle is based on old Ralph McQuarrie art for the original trilogy designed to parallel the structure of a Jedi Temple except now it's kind of a dam for lava which feeds its negative energy there's a brief shot of Vader in a back to healing tank edwards said that he wanted a similar moment of vulnerability as the shot of the back of Vader's head that we briefly saw an empire task 6 of the plan is to make contact with Galen or so on yeah do even though castings plan is to assassinate Galen his overall step of the journey is to confirm that the flaw he designed into the Death Star is real the character of Galen is based on J robert Oppenheimer one of the developers of the atomic bomb who later lamented over his work in his famous speech called the destroyer of worlds the destroyer of worlds was actually the working title for rogue one in the story treatment Lucas Films John Knoll used to pitch this story and when the film was finished its reels were shipped out under the name Los Alamos which was the city in New Mexico known for its atomic bomb testing sites but back on the Aven for task 7 is to regroup with rebel forces and convince them to fight general Marek leads the x-wing blue squadron a detail taken from the original Star Wars which had to change the x-wings from blue to red squadron because the blue screens used for the VFX Force the color blue to need to be d saturated that's why our twos blue paneling came off as a dark grey color during the trench run scene the blue squadron makes it through the scare of shield gate and that base gets blown up by the Death Star explaining why the blue squadron is not around for the Battle of Yavin the rebel Navy is led by Admiral Radice leader in the last Jedi the resistance names their flagship the Radice after this war hero also during the sequence you can hear a voice over the PA ringing out this is a nod to hera syndulla from Star Wars rebels her ship the ghost can be seen among the rebel fleet throughout the film as can their astromech droid chopper now a small group of rebels splits off to take action and bode identifies their call sign as Rogue rogue one thus providing the origin of the name of the rebel Rogue Squadron in the original trilogy now there's a tiny moment between Mon Mothma and Bail Organa that more or less connects this whole movie's plot to the prequels and the original trilogy you should be well doing the Clone Wars it is lived in hiding it's the empress purge yes I will send for you need someone you can trust I would trust her with my life captain Antilles they're referring to obi-wan Kenobi one of the few Jedi who escaped Oda 66 and Revenge of the Sith now hiding on Tatooine though more details of that story won't soon be explored in the Kenobi series and Organa is going to send his adopted daughter Princess Leia whom he literally trusts with his life when he dies in Alderaan's destruction and II Captain Antilles he summons is Ramos Antilles his pilot scene at the end of Revenge of the Sith and the end of this film now task 8 of the plan leads the crew to scare off' where they must infiltrate the imperial shield gates sneak into the Citadel Tower and find the Death Star schematics and the archives they use the old Star Wars strike of masquerading and imperial uniforms in as they sneak in we get the Star Wars trademark line I've got a bad feeling about a few more Easter eggs a mouse droid buzzes around and k2o so hacks another Imperial droid with the same kind of rotary style stomp link that r2 uses on a door lock in the Death Star outside two stormtroopers chitchat stormtroopers every similar conversation about t-17s in the force awakens in the archive room Jen reads off the file names systems this detail became a major plot point in the last Jedi hyperspace tracking was how the first order was able to follow the resistance fleet even after their hyperspace jump and then the battle heats up and we move on to task 9 of the mission which involves the rebel forces directly engaging the scare of base confusing the Empire forces long enough to bring down the shield and allow the Death Star plans to transmit through the rebel fleet includes the ghost from rebels a nebula B escort frigate which we saw in the final scene of Empire and the Battle of Endor GRS 75 medium transports which we saw from the retreat from Hoth and Empire as well as the Mon Calamari cruisers and during this battle they slipped in our kite footage from the original Star Wars of gold leader John Vander this is gold and red leader Garvin grace this is red leader and they also point out this specific pilot this was the original red 5 and now that he's dead it leaves the bread 5 position open for Luke Skywalker to take it in the Battle of Yavin now they're finally able to open the shield gate with a hammerhead Corvette which knocks one Star Destroyer into another and both crashed into the gates that plus bodis patch and cherry flipping the master switch allows Jin and Kassian to transmit the plans up to the rebel ship and that takes us to task 10 the final step handoff the plans and escape Vader now the Death Star has wiped out all the heroes on the Scarab surface and now Vader's ship the Devastator has arrived turning rogue one into a story about Darth Vader and these stolen plans themselves and just a violent game of keep-away between these two things now check out another video I recently did breaking down why this sequence is my favorite / fate or moment but essentially it's a highlight reel of Vader using every attack we know he's capable of using the Force to jam that door and lock these rebels in a kill box all the while a slow down coral version of the Imperial March squeeze down over them and it all ends with the plans handed off to the Tantive 4 from Captain Antilles - Princess Leia but right before ITA's that he orders prepare the escape yeah one last detail connecting this all to the opening of Star Wars because it is those escape pods through which r2 in Threepio slip through Vader's clutches with these stolen plans and there you today and give it a try now again I covered even more details in my original rogue one breakdown how all the battle imagery was based on famous war movies and
