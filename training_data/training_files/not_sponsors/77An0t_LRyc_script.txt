this video was sponsored by audible and this is an incredibly good feeling I don't even know what the yes button is is plundered the yes button is that thank goodness so we've completed our hermit challenge of playing in pirate language for one entire episode a lot of you were saying that I wasn't quite priority enough but that wasn't the challenge all right all I had to do was just read out the item names in pirate style and play with pirate language and iskele has has kind of completed his hermit challenge he gave me 12 bamboo which if I just do a little bit of removing I have I have turned into a suits so he did probably the talent you know he gave me the twelve bamboo which is incredibly valuable and I do now have my suit back kind of it's made of bamboo but it's it's kind of back so all in all I would say that round of hermit challenges has been a great success of course we'll meet up with SQL at some point to ring the bell and do everything like that but in today's episode I really want to work on the base you know in the previous one we did a bunch of work to the exterior we managed to get everything sorted all the way up to this level here so the outside is now is now pretty much done up to this level which is fantastic and we also came up with a grand grand concept like an incredibly grand concept my base is going to be a Life OK it's going to be a living thing that we have to try and keep happy so you have to we have to feed it we have to keep it satisfied we have to we basically have to tend to all of his needs I'm sure this isn't gonna wind me up in the slightest as if Korean wasn't needy enough I now have a base to deal with - now of course this build is going to require a ton of engineering and work to actually work well and I've just thought wait I'm in my redstone testing world I'm fairly certain the hermitcraft season there it is so as I said in the previous episode in hermit crab season 4 and she did something fairly similar to this with this guy right here and the redstone contraption is still working and amazingly he's not it's not even dead yet but that's the thing that we need to fill him up with but all the item frames are missing I guess the entities got deleted in some form minecraft up there but amazingly he seems pretty chilled I mean he's not happy but he's alright but essentially we need to do all of this but on a much larger scale and in a much more complicated fashion this is going to be interesting first things first I've traced out the air that we actually have available for this thing so see I don't want to build something too big for my base and then as I was doing this I kind of came up with a way that I think I could build this redstone contraption efficiently and that is to make it modular so each one of our health bars will actually function on its own it will have all of its own timing sockets it will have all of his own redstone clocks the counter will be inside of each modular circuit and then it will just have a couple of simple outputs that will run into like a central processing Center which will then send the output from that output into whatever we're going to have at the top of our build I still haven't decided what I want to do up at the top I don't know if I want to do a face with emotions there are a few cool ideas down the comment section we have like different crystals and things that could be interesting I don't really know just yet have a progress update on by an hour into this process I've managed to sort out the redstone lamps so gosh I've just broken something now as you can see as this thing begins to use up its resources the redstone lamps will begin to count downwards francelli and then we can restore these redstone lamps by activating this dropper on the other side I also now have the redstone clock system which will gradually deplete the redstone resources I'm working on an item detection system so this is an item sorter that is going to detect the item that should refill all of this it then needs to send a signal to refill all of the redstone lamps and also shut off the redstone clock so that we don't lose any redstone lamps immediately after refilling them all of this sounds a lot more complicated than it is I promise you another hour into the process our single module should now will be designed I've got the outputs sorted I've call the input source and I've got the timings sorted I've got the item collection system sorted and these orange lines here represent the three different stages that I want our processing system to recognize so I've got full it's full to the brim happy and then I've got the middling one which is kind of like alright and then down at the bottom here I've got debt that dad's obviously a problem now I didn't feel like it's worth mentioning that this of course is just one of eight modules that we're going to have I've got space for another module here and then obviously we're going to have two modules on each of the corners of my build so this is going to be a pretty gnarly redstone project I have to say and now I think I've got the final phase worked out so these are the different emotions that our thing can show off happy and sad I've decided I kind of on my face to die regardless so it's just gonna be an upset base and if I play around with these levers right here we should see that the emotions will change so right now it's happy and then it is in the middle and then there is the sadness and we can kind of flick these around and toy with the emotions essentially cool I think we've done it I think we've designed it right let's Bob onto the homograft server and I guess what we should do is probably get ourselves set up with actually a good-looking design for where these redstone lamps are going to be going I've been fat about a lot with this thing I've been going back and forth with my designs I have really been scratching my head quite a bit on this one but I'm hoping the this setup right here should end up looking pretty good this whole area is so deadly and you know what I only go to sleep so I can actually see it in the daylight because there's always a better representation good nights sleeping next to my own head it's kind of strange can you think of anything more creepy to be asleep let's have a look then I was really confused because I thought it was still dark and forget that I let you put the roof on this thing alright let's fly around and there it is so that is our little redstone counter system that looks pretty cool doesn't it I mixed in the black stone that looks pretty cool and it still needs ruinin so I guess let's construct that on all four sides but first a quick message from our and let's get back on with the hammer craft episode now I thought I'd do a quick time-lapse of me building up the other segments and I'm quite glad that I did because I think it's quite a satisfying time-lapse to watch and I've also been enjoying doing time lapses recently you might have noticed that they've been creeping in and out of my videos you know that tends to be what happens I'll kind of flip-flop sometimes I'll really go off of time lapses and I won't use them at all I'll just be purely cuts other times I'll be all for them but I think one thing that time-lapse is do incredibly well and it's a bit obvious but it's actually showed the time you see that took a right amount hour and 45 minutes to build up those things which isn't a crazy amount of time but I feel like that would have been lost in cuts people wouldn't have seen that time going in whereas with the time-lapse you can see it hence hence the name yeah I'm everything I'm saying right now is incredibly obvious isn't it let's move on shall we yeah let's just get off that subject I don't know about you guys but I think this has made a huge huge difference to this build it looks so much more solid now and I know I keep saying that but just seeing this thing come together I mean it really is this now looks like an actual structure but we are not quite done with the construction just yet there's still a few things that we need to do we need to do some ruining and I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to do it maybe just add some notches into the sides of these things so kind of dirty those up a little bit and then I guess just start chucking some leaves around I suppose now I tried adding in the leaves and it looked a bit rubbish because there's not quite a big enough space to actually have the leaves so they kind of look like small dots I think I might have to go to like a scar school of ruining cuz he does I mean look at the leaves that he's done back there he just think he knows how to do it so well I might have to get some tips from him anyway a lot of people have been asking what this sign says it's actually just a scale pointing out the size of his place so now answers that one anyway let's get the other three sides all ruined up and I gotta say I'm really really finding this sort of thing satisfying minute but I'm heavily enjoying building and just trying to make the build look cooler it's it's weirdly therapeutic because normally I'd find this sort of thing really frustrating you know as I say building does not come naturally to me in the slightest and that's why in a hermit crab season seven I've really tried to focus on my building job to make you say it's a skill that I actually have you know because I I don't want to be limited in Minecraft by my abilities I want to be like a well-rounded minecraft player and I don't want to be put off from doing a large-scale project just because I don't feel like I can do it so that's why I'm tackling things like this on a completely different note why do I keep forgetting about scaffolding I have so much scaffolding and I love scaffolding at a minute yeah I keep not using it I'm back to my old ways and I'm just checking out scars tree here he has he's he's he's ruining on all sorts of different levels here you know he's got he's got bamboo with string on top of it so it doesn't grow any higher it's got all different types of leaves I mean it's so fancy anyway well mine mines done my buildings done forget about this beautiful nurses it's cast their eyes over to this monstrosity I'm kidding of course I got I'm happy with this thing I think it's looking cool it's it's all coming together very very nicely I can't wait to get the Redstone and this thing and I still don't know what I'm going to do with the tower I also still haven't quite decided what I'm going to do with this top section up at the top here you know I mean there is space for ahead there's crystals I mean I all the ideas is still whizzing round in my head I still haven't quite pulled the trigger or any but this is looking seriously cool this is looking so much better now that there's some texture in there it looks really really good and I stand by the fact that black stone is my new favorite block I just it's it's such a nice texture I've just flown over to the industrial district to gather up a few more firework rockets and I see this thing hello sir since your gold farm is so great here is golden present of Doom PS pull lever okay so those dole blocks I'm kind of worried that it's going to blow me up him showing off how good his gold farm is but he can just dispense : we didn't put that much in our we come on is gal you know if you're really gonna flex they would be gold blocks and there would at least be a full inventories worth I can't imagine that was more than 32 my gold farm so good that I would be able to do a full I'd be able to do two droppers worth of gold blocks I reckon right now I really need to remember to cut this out of the video because my gold film isn't quite as good as it scales and I could really do with these gold blocks the fact that these pickling trader farms allow us to get another quartz and now I can just easily get one full stack of comparators this is big news I mean it's not exactly fresh news but it is so cool that that has been introduced I never thought I'd see the day where we could get a renewable source of this nether quartz stuff so that's fantastic anyway I'm just in the process of fitting up my redstone resources that we can actually start building up the brain of this thing why is gran hid what he has a bed he's making a base he's taken all of his things off kilt gladly absolutely gladly and again I mean this is this feels cruel again more MORE well that was incredibly satisfying I mean you know yeah I guess that gets him back for stealing my door I suppose I invited to tell him to steal my door so maybe that's not kind of merited but well that was fun I think we might be good to actually start constructing this thing so I suppose I mean we get the ball rolling by linking up all the redstone lamps and at the minute I'm absolutely loving building this redstone contraption because so far it's very very survival friendly in that you can actually get around you know I often my problem is I design redstone contraptions so compact that it's often impossible to move in them where is this look at there's kind of almost I mean I can kind of drop through I can make my way around so with all of the connectors done now it's time to actually do the resource counting circuit and that involves just a handful of droppers it's all quite simple really all of these timing circuits and things are a little bit more challenging than that I mean that was just I won that was I won coherent circuit you know it was just a sequence of block placements where is this this is a little bit more fiddly but now working on the item pickup system this is going to be detecting the items that get thrown into the machine and it's going to be sending the output from that into this so that we can then replenish all of the redstone lamps [Music] Billy's on the roads and it's worse than I thought because I've actually built it all the wrong way round so I've built I've built this right-hand side unit as if it's a left-hand unit so that means that look all of the redstone and things it goes over the central line we actually can't fit the left-hand one in so I need to tear all of this down stop I can I'd like mirror it it's funny isn't it you know things take so long to build and yet they're so fast to take down and now I've got to rebuild it which is not that fun about one hour later here it is and I'm in much higher spirits now because this thing is all constructed I've tested it it's all working we've got ourselves 1/8 of the entire system and I have to say it looks really really cool doesn't it imagine how cool this place is going to look when there's like interconnected wires and things all running through it there's the item system that's going to go from the bottom all the way up to the top that's gonna be the head that up at the top we're gonna have to deal with that I mean it's just it's gonna look nuts but for now I'm going to keep building up the other half of this what I really want to do is get one full quarter all completed and ready to go because then we can basically do a trial run of one quarter of the system we can see what it's going to look like from the perspective of the outside it is so much nicer building things when you've already built them things are going so smoothly I think I'm at you on the last bits so if I place in this redstone torch here and then a redstone torch here yep that should be everything so you've got the slowing down circuit we've got the timing circuit we've got the output up to the droppers we've got your output from the item sorter to the other dropper with the observers oh I need to put I need to put the pulse extender in there it is very 2010 little post extender right there just gives us five minutes of cooldown time where the redstone clock doesn't count down and that is as everything in place and it's also all been lit up so it doesn't become a complete mob hell because that's what the rest of this build is currently and I'm gradually gradually trying to light up any weight let's grab some items and we'll actually start some of the droppers in this thing so you can start seeing the redstone lamps turn on because because as all I want to see I just want to see what this thing's going to look like from the outside so where are I just need some non stackable items I guess just some shovels let's grab some iron so if we fill in this one side here I think it needs I seem to remember it was is it seven if I remove one okay yeah that turns off the redstone lamp so we need seven seven things in each one of those droppers just completely ignore me falling there you know that didn't happen I know it sounds so simple but I just want to see what this looks like with the redstone lamps on and it looks cool it looks cool so I've done a mock-up okay I've removed some of the items that we have some of the lamps turning off man I love the idea that my faces alive my base is a living thing that we need to stay on top of and it looks even cooler at night yes I did stand here until it got dark it looks wicked it looks seriously seriously good I'm pleased you're pleased I hope if you're not pleased I apologize but there are still things that need to be done I actually need to work out what attributes these redstone lamps are going to be counting you know because so far I mean in my head I've got I've got food worked out but there's seven other things that we need to be feeding into this system to keep the almighty happy and I said Almighty because I have no clue what that thing is actually going to be just yet I still haven't worked out so I think it's worth popping in to the redstone testing world and just trying to map things so as I say we've got food seven clear spaces I would say feeding it diamonds it seems pretty cool actually now that I think about it I mean a music this could be that would be a pain in the backside but could be quite good giving it something to drink would be cool and I think I should be able to detect a water bucket we're gonna have to do some interesting redstone there an apple to stop the almighty from getting sick because everyone knows an apple a day keeps the doctor away obviously a little bit redstone dust so you can do this redstone work a book to read to keep itself entertained a little bit of coal for fuel and finally I have poppies because I really like the idea of guten flowers to my bass to keep it happy with that being said this selection right here is just initial ideas so let me know down in the comments section if you think there are some two ones because you guys are smart I'm sure you'll come up with something so with that done it's now time to wrap something up obviously I'm wearing my bamboo suits is Cal has completed his challenge I think I completed its Cal's challenge you know we've all we've all managed to sort out everything so I think it's time to summon s Cal and I think I'm just going to do that by going like that hopefully no I mean you know I imagine he twirled normally when I just send messages out the blue that doesn't make any sense he's going to assume that it's harm it challenges in fact actually before he gets here let's hop on a call because I want to hear his reaction it's my bamboo suit what did you use to make the tie I honestly there's a very good question I didn't even think about it all right I just said I sent the twelve bamboos off to a tailor all right and and I've come out with this and I I think we could all agree I think it's staying this might be the permanent missus than you look yeah that's true yeah no this it's it's gonna be stayed for quite some time so I'm gonna be rocking this for a while but it's it's nice Oh brilliant that is does that mean that you officially accept that I did my challenge then because I was a little bit you know I tried to find your yeah yeah I mean okay the twelve bamboo is incredibly valuable all right so basically you bribed me off and then I've converted arrived into a suit but that's it's fine yeah I mean that's creative off you let me let me just let me just explain one thing you do not want to know what I had to go through when I searched for for for your suits I found things that doesn't make any sense okay yeah I'm just that's all I'm gonna say I'm not gonna say that was quite it was quite a day I try and find stress alright okay Oh we'll just leave that we'll leave that as is I won't ask any more questions because it seems like yeah you maybe don't want to talk about it all right okay well I gotta say III haven't seen your episode being parity but I did have a treasure map yep and you are the master of of couse yes sweet sweet that you would just travel off into the distance and lava I did that I'd that for for about an hour ah and then I read the note again I was like mumbo I also have a sugarcane farm yours is not sweeter than mine oh so you thought I'll see doesn't that's an interesting that's an interesting perspective to think sweet that makes sense that was very very clever and I found the thing and didn't have the greatest content that it's not gonna lie it was one of those treasures where I don't know when you were little if you ever had a Christmas where you were like you were looking for so much too oppressive and then it turns out to be socks it was like oh no I was expecting my shoe back and I got the top bamboo I guess okay so I I did do I did do my episode in pirate language I referred to for example the bamboo as being Bamburgh that's what it was and there was there was I think there was bombs are plenty of my fireworks and I have like Blackbeard's helmet and and forget not to forget Hamas stand right there yeah not to forget the one thing that I actually saw because of a sign which is hardly challenged that was a very dramatic a very dramatic production of yeah ya know so III would say I would say I did a decent job a lot of people in the comments were a little bit disappointed that I didn't put on that accent for the entire episode but I think that might've worn off salty sea dog ocean would have been about four percent people watch four percent of the video and just be you know got better things to do now I get it alright well that means this time we click the better click the button yeah yeah anyway cheers for that dude I guess this isn't a 2pcs there's no extra challenges so ok I'll see you again how much I'll see you later dude I love that suit that suit is awesome thank you appreciate it you paid for it right with hermit challenges are all done and dusted and with mace looking all fantastic and partially alive I think it's time to end I really do hope that you've enjoyed this homograft episode it's been action-packed there's been all sorts of things going on it's been a really fun one to create so I hope you enjoyed and I'll catch you in the next one see ya it should be so hot in my room right now it should be so hot it's a boiling hot day Sun is out it's blaring right into my window but I am at a cool 19 degrees it's actually too cold it's too cold I'm actually too cold right now but I'm enjoying bids you cold I'm freezing I'm shivering but I'm feeling good because I've got air conditioning
