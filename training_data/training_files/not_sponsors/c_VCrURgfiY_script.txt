hey what's up guys this is Bri Hart welcome back to my channel or if you are new here welcome for the first time today I'm gonna be reacting the ayahs one's brand new music video story of the Swan and I'm so excited to check this out if you guys are like me you're probably waiting for this video drop I waited til 2:00 in the morning my time here in California and then the live performance came out and not the music video I haven't seen it I haven't heard it as always I'm gonna do a full vocal breakdown from my perspective as a to get to 3,000 subscribers I think we can do it and yeah with all that being said I've got my caffeine I've got my kpop any k-pop let's be in the video oh my gosh you guys I love the energy that this track is going the outfits are so pretty so that was a cool little extra okay so right off the bat I just want to jump into the vocals here I hear a lot of really cool things happening the beginning of this song and something that I really like about this track is that it actually has this sort of rappy melody it's very very syncopated there's a lot of repetition and I think the girl that started off this verse are doing a really good job adding that playfulness back in with their vocals so really really into this okay let's see where this is gonna go let's go okay to contrast what I literally just was talking about we were doing this like rappy fun syncopated thing and then they open up into this like bell to your part which I just think is really fun and almost unexpected like I was not expecting that much power to come from the girl that was doing that belting line and sorry you guys if I don't know their names I'm actually really really new to this group so if you guys could break it down for me let me know who is who down in the comments it's really really helpful for me when I'm getting to know a group and kind of understanding each of their vocal profiles and it's just really fun for me to kind of like explore and learn who each girl is as we go through the song so I'm gonna try and pick a bias by the end of this video I have listened to one of their other tracks and I think it was I think you guys told me it was your that I ended up really really gravitating towards so maybe it will be her again we'll see alright oh my gosh this is so catchy okay seriously you guys this song is so catchy I don't know how you listen to the song and just walk away not singing it and I love that the words that they put in English are Swan Swan Swan because that's like super easy for me to remember so I know I'm going to be singing this for days also I just think it's such a fun melody in the hook like it's so bouncy but anyway so much contrast happening vocally I really really love how the girl that was doing the rap part is aggressive very assertive her voice carries and it's womanly I just think it's a really fun play between the lighter voices and the darker voices and just totally it's just really really interesting to me so love that and also so many cool visual is happening here like all the different colors and the FX and everything it's just super super whimsical and just sort of draws you in and I'm just really into this music video if you can't tell I'm also getting really hyped on caffeine which by the way it's time to caffeinate again so hold on real quick okay let's go [Applause] I love that line it's just how catchy that melody uh the blonde girl I think is that Yuri let me know down the comments because I remember pointing her out last time I was listening to one of their tracks and I was really really drawn I think it was because she was doing all the fun cool belty notes so if that's her gonna be really excited because my bias then has stayed consistent between their different tracks so let me know down below if that's her or if I'm getting her confused with somebody else but anyway she's just so resonant and supported with every note that she sings and it's in that higher part of a register but she's never straining you can totally tell that there's this good technique underneath the vocals and she adds in these cool cries and it's just like I don't know it's just like it hits me right here in my heart here right here okay anyway oh my gosh you guys seriously that scene that's totally my aesthetic like I love all the different colors and the clouds and just I want it I want to live in that world can can I just live there please like just for one moment let's come oh I like this sort of like ethereal change that they're doing her oh my gosh I love that trail yes oh my gosh that belt notes so beautiful you know me I am such a sucker for really really strong supported belt notes like there's a right way and a wrong way and whenever you do it right it just like hits you in your soul I felt it I definitely felt it when I heard her sing it we have one more minute left let's get back into it so one thing that I haven't tapped on yet because I think I've just been very very focused on like the vocals and the visuals and everything else but their dance moves are amazing and I thought it was really fun like that one little zigzag thing that they did it was just cool how it sort of synched up and hit on all the hits in the track and super super cool I wish I could dance like that definitely cannot I love that see there's that bouncy melody I was talking about so good oh my gosh okay so that's it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed it as here on this channel and I'll see you guys next time bye
