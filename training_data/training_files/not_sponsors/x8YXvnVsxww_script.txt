now we're about ready are you good with what you working on Oh Jim I just want this intro to be really special what's kind of doing a George Carlin seven words you can't say on television kind of thing but I don't want to get demonetized for curses in the first 60 seconds of the video and you know it's just frustrating that's a lot of pressure George Carlin bit we're just talking about curses and dungeons and dragons you know like when you cross a hag or you know like yeah today's out you won't regret it link here and in the description so Jim let's talk about curses whether they be item whether they be agreement yes they be object I mean any I mean curses it's just one of those things like whether it's a tomb whether it's a book whether it's gold you know curses should just be everywhere right but you would think right they seem to be like all in the inspirational literature that Dini grew out of and has influenced and vice versa and like curses or part fairy tales and and wicked magic and almost the archetypal you know dark magic that's drawn about that mm-hm right like yeah just like using using your magic to impose something terrible and long-lasting on a you know on a person or their descendants or or any number of things just iconic and and to me it's like if you think about this you're using this to like fuel your your campaign prep or you know something that you want to do with your character or something and then you turn to like say the mechanical options for curses and you might find yourself a bit underwhelmed i I know that I often to to the extent that I don't really dispel bestow curse that often because it's like that's a souped-up hex it can do some things but when I think of curses I think of that very small paragraph in bestow curse that's not necessarily helpful because it doesn't have any guidelines but it's you can think up another thing that sort of fits you know another curse that fits these four parameters which are like you know disadvantage on checks or disadvantage or certain saves or taking extra damage then you can with your diem diems help and it's like can I get a little inspirational list you know like I can think of some weird curses you might want to pull on somebody and so I just it's it's a type of magic that I think number one is is very amorphous in the ill-defined curse what is that you know there's a lot of spells in the players handbook that that are not labeled curses you might think of as a curse it's also sort of antithetical to the way that a lot of magic works in fifth edition which is like short term temporary has to be like focused on by the caster to keep it in effect whereas when I think of a curse it's something that's like oh no this you you fell into a very particular trap yeah you know they someone didn't just cast a spell on you they did a working they did an undertaking and you you fell for it and now you have gotten yourself in meshed in this magic this spell that consequently you can't just remove with another third level slot and not having to do anything about goodnight II like at the heart of it it's the fact that bestow curse and remove curse or is it the light switch that you flip on and off and it doesn't really do anything interesting it's just kind of there and I I want something more like a full-fledged you know triple a stadium lighting situation I want strobe lights fog you know I want people to have to go to the hospital afterwards when they see it or question and their belief in God or something yeah like that's what I want after they deal with the curse definitely a part of technics in there anyway a lot of things too close to an open flame yeah I mean I would be hyperbolic all day long I want it to drive the campaign I want it to be something that's not just a combat debuff that's thrown on a generic warlock number four I want it to be like no this is the curse of campaign villain it does these specific things like these are the specific ways that you have to get rid of it like that is an adventure you know that's a that's an experience you're gonna remember something like that yeah yeah but so when it comes to that yeah you know you want something more than the light switch and you want it to be part of the the campaign and drive adventure and everything but yeah like how deep and how far and how far-reaching should it be is there can you go too far with it I mean I certainly think so right like you can think of something like say the death curse from from tomb of annihilation and when you're like start thinking about that and you start thinking about the implications that it has for the whole world and the fact that it affects people not just who've died and been resurrected but like new souls as well yeah yeah and like you really start think about that and it's like that wow that that's kind of a big deal for the world and and I know that there are some concessions made because you have to find a way for the players to be the heroes of that story but again I don't usually that's not my preferred method of the running games but you can't take it too far I think it's like the implications of the curse are so great that it alters the tone and theme of your game you've taken it too far right or if the implications of a curse like mean feel like the players can never overcome it or that they've had the deck stacked against them so much that they can't do anything about it oh yeah knows they're situations where you may have taken a little bit extreme I think in a game you should be able to reverse a curse certainly doing a stint yeah yeah unless it's like one of those like it's a very subtle thing it only affects like you know maybe like when you're dealing with money or something or something kind of like Kellum for but you don't turn into a werepanther gurps this would be you know that you design a flaw that had like you know the frequency of how long often it's gonna come up ya know you can probably the same thing with like curses like is this an every session thing is this an every encounter thing is this uh once every few sessions thing you know that there's a lot of different ways that you can interpret it and like you're saying like it comes up maybe in specific circumstances and specific instances and you can learn to live with it you know you could even just be like something like you're always driven to wanna want to pay for the stuff when you go into town yeah but you're always trying to negotiate a good deal and you'll even maybe like try to slip slip some fake gold or whatever yeah even when it's just something just simple you're just buying some rations for a few copper yeah but still you're like try to stiff them to copper and it's like yeah but you can't help yourself get those sort of subtle curses and generational curses in the case of Kellan borer are something that I don't think currently with 5th edition rules it's that easy to to represent you're gonna have to homebrew something yeah and similarly I feel like you really would want a homebrew something that prevents the removal of it from being a spend in action spin the slot now it's gone you know that's my problem would like him to be and werewolves and all other kinds of lycanthropes is that they're interesting monsters I love this idea of the animal side taking over and producing this physical change in a person there's a lot of really cool we're creatures out there to use and like a third-level spell takes care of all of it and and our lycanthrope episode we kind of touched on this as well in ways you might not necessarily have that happened I think of a more is like a special form of magic Forgotten Realms has the myth alls other other worlds have you know epic magic or Archmage level magic or something and curses could maybe be at the opposite end of that spectrum a kind of magic that's open to everyone mmm a form of magic that's very specific unique to the individual or very you know highly personal and that might mean that every curse has its own you know condition for removal and that even they remove you know the way I might handle it as like yeah you still have to do these things that allows you the opportunity to cast the spell right like the spell has a variety of conditions on it in which it must be cast and one of those is that you have fulfilled the condition of the curse you are trying to use remove curse on and it's only at then that you can imbue those actions with magic in order to get rid of the curse that that that's even possible well I think that's kind of how I would do it sort of a compromise but maybe you have to go to a specific location maybe there are creatures in the world that you have to placate who can either remove the curse for you take the curse and give it to someone or something else you know that's always the best way yeah to have those stipulation they removed like you don't get rid of it you got to pass it on you got to pass it on I got a trick something else to take it it follows it's probably yes that that's like the perfect movie yes kind of thing absolutely right like it's got this element to it where it's a living thing the curse is alive you can't just dodge it you can't just get out of the way and something like say razzle sin you know as I looked at looked back on that campaign actually played it one of the first things that I would do if I run it again is like razzle sin has a hand in the use of magic in this part of the world you don't just get to come in here castra smagin willy nilly beyond a certain level like she knows you've done it she knows and not only that but she siphoned off a portion of it for herself and in the context of how I would use it a second time around those those that store of energy that every time the players cast a spell they're giving their villain a resource that's a part of the curse in in the context of that game you could go visit certain people and they could protect you or you could visit certain places and while there you would be protected from that effect you could attempt to resist it yourself by maybe I think at the time I'd say maybe like you can spend an inspiration and that gives you the opportunity to save you know like that's how old her magic is you agreed to the terms of this agreement by just walking here and it allows her to do all kinds of metagame stuff that I otherwise you know wouldn't be able to do use layer actions outside of her layer have certain spells have different effects whenever she uses them and it was kind of like an intersection between a lot of custom rules that I otherwise would have not provided a justification for but instead in this case went like oh wait like the curse of razzle sin is that she has this power over this region like a do my god for this place that's kind of an extreme situation and in that sense I would definitely tell the players out of game ahead of time like hey there's a meta game mechanic going on and like when you cast certain spells or spells of a certain level you're gonna give me points you know whatever it is curse points whatever we call them you know and they're gonna let me do all kinds of weird and nasty things to you that way you are giving the player the choice to dig their own hole it's the same with a car shove it with a curse show oh speaking of cursed items is like I like to do cursed items in that way as well thank you in in that like just a minus one to something or like you know when you hit an opponent you deal half damage to yourself as well I find so many cursed items just they're either gotchas in which case it's like all right like now that I've got a bag of devouring and don't have any of my stuff like oops like you know like what was the point of that other than the dungeon master getting a bit of a kick out of like fooling a player which is trivially easy because I like a bag of a devouring because it's like you get it it happens to you if you're not paying attention yeah and then it becomes that item that you try to use and do others be honest yeah certain with it so really it's just that like you so you can't identify cursed items through the identify spell you will really only identify a cursed item when you try to use it and it reveals the cursed nature of it and are like a backbiting weapon a backbiting weapon stuff there are some really neat ones in the lost laboratory of koala sh adventure like the gamblers blade is one i think is really cool where you pick one through three that's its bonus but then that's also a corresponding penalty you get four death saves I think and then there's another one I forget like the medusa sword or something where it's like if you fumble you run the risk of a petrifying yourself cursed artifacts or items that have enough of a benefit that the player who has it is gonna consider this as an asset but enough of a drawback that they will be inconvenienced sometimes you know III don't want something that like completely makes the character unplayable but I might have something like you know for example you you pick up a sword or you use the item or the ring or something and you know you maybe can feel that there's something going on at first maybe that's the power of it making our Connor check just to see what your character notices and then it's only over time as they use it as they come to rely on the item that you revealed no this thing is like developed a parasitic relationship with you once you're in too deep is when you realize that you that you've fallen for a trap not this you know Oh as soon as you pick it up no no you can't put it down kind of situation even though you did basically jet to me with the ring I mean I did write like that that was that was a that was a while ago though writes a while ago yeah but I don't think I'll be forgetting that II I don't seem so either yeah I will say the reason I won't forget it is because we did talk about it once it happened yes I remember you saying like if you don't want to do this we don't have to do this yeah but I was like now it'll be fun and it was one of the most fun campaigns it was a very small one was just two players and he was the DM but like going through and getting trying to get this ring and get Soraka or whatever his name was out off me yeah you know it's a deal with the devil like literally where it's like yeah I'm gonna need to use your abilities that you give me but the more I do the more hold you have over me yes for when I try to deny you and so like playing that that that game of give and take and and and knowing how in in in debt with the house you are so to speak yeah it's kind of an important part of these curses if that's the way you're gonna go with it yeah and I don't like changed your character and you know I was thinking more like cosmetic changes but you can even have cursed items where it's like yeah you're changing personalities I Neal's beliefs you might be getting different change my alignment does your lineman takes all kinds of different things about your character because they like it that's how powerful the magic is possession as you're talking about is another interesting one that can be a part of cursed items whether it's like a spirit of an intelligent weapon or or a ghost of a former user or something it doesn't necessarily have to be like a curse in that control is taken away from your character but it could be a case of like well there's someone else living with you in your mind or there's a there's a presence that's not your own that produces in literally intrusive thoughts yeah short sort of sharpness is what I'm thinking of from the Driss novel oh sure he wants to be with the strongest person yeah and kind of changes category over time because it wants to be with dressed things like that like yeah is it subtly altering your behavior and these are things that like you're gonna have to break down that wall between DM and player and collaborate more because the Dungeon Master's gonna be like hey here's my intent for how this curse should work or how other people say in the world to deal with it you know you're free to deal with it as you see fit or any other kind of creative way but you do expect it to be accounted for and I don't think it's unreasonable for a DM to say like yeah you've been cursed or as we talked about in other episodes like you've got a form of madness or you're overtaken momentarily by fear like it's okay for the DM to say these are changes you need to make in how you portray your character but that needs to be accompanied by here's how you can reverse them even if you keep the specifics secret and you don't like you know you make the player kind of work for it a bit because you know you just don't give the information away like that you can at least tell them I anticipate this is gonna take three to four adventures maybe longer if you know it's just handled as a side quest or something yeah or if it's something you really want to get rid of then let's schedule a couple of one-on-one or small group sessions specifically to deal with it and like it's an opportunity for the character to like grow and change and do something interesting and a chance for the Dungeon Master player to do something different that they might not have before and you just got a sort of trust that that the dungeon master is not out just completely screw you over and is trying to do something to make for a more interesting game yeah because let's face it you knew the place was cursed that you were going into so it's the place that's trying to screw you over absolutely yeah how many times in movies TV books or whatever you need you go into place this is you know the old mummy joke this is curse that is cursed the cursed goal the curse to whatever our literature and our stories are rife with these things these places that you're not supposed to metal yeah because of the the detriment I mean there's there's something good there that you want if you don't mess with it because it's a sacred you know bear site or something yeah and there's a lot of of different myths and legends and cultural values surrounding the dead and what you are and are not supposed to do with them this is really one of those things where it's like is there a belief in our own world in our own history somewhere that someone thought this stuff was magical or supernatural then why is some variation of it not in a DND world where this supernatural stuff is real yeah I know maybe burying someone with their grave Goods is how you prevent them from coming back as a ghoul you know and if you take them then you're you're both cursed in sort of a sense that you're marked by a monster and that monsters coming for you and yeah what are you gonna do you stole it like if you steal someone's stuff that's how they become a ghoul certainly yeah now they're after you the curse gold from say Pirates of the Caribbean or the cursed mummys treasure it's just you don't mess with it and because it runs counter to what a lot of players expect they should be able to do it creates for moments of tension oh this is a big pile of treasure well yes there's also a really clear sign right here that if you take it you know it's all it's on you what happens next yeah you see a bunch of skeletons that look like they were trying to take treasure out of this room but they're all look like they died horribly while carrying said treasure right but I'm gonna go try to take it anywhere try to take it anyway it's that sort of one the desecration of tombs or burial grounds but just like a generic death curse is another there you might encounter this like it's an idea from Dresden which we like to draw from just go yeah a lot of good ideas there but that idea that you're with the last of your magic you utter a curse upon the being or entity that killed you well the fictional world of Dresden it keeps things more copacetic between wizards and those who like them because there's always that last retaliation a beast might know that it can kill a wizard but it still has to live through its death curse yeah you know they may not have much magic but having it all unloaded at once you know that can I can strip your your your resistances your your immunities away oh yeah and then you're just that's you for the rest of your life you know yeah like a duel between two wizards that you know that it might be kept non non-lethal yeah that fact so having that kind of thing there is a way to enforce certain types of behavior so you can say like yeah anybody that breaks this taboo suffers this curse and because you're dealing with with game worlds where magic world-spanning magic magic that affects everyone or whatever is common or at least plausible you can set things up in your world so that the mechanical elements that you're using to like reinforce a certain you know genre or theme or tone maybe also have magical elements in the setting that reinforce those things yeah so it's a kind of a dual purpose what is the monkey's paw look like indeedy if it's an item where you have to use it right you've got this thing and it manifests your desires and sort of the worst way possible yeah or interprets them and one of the worst ways possible then I can almost see it working like it's an off-brand wing or ring of wishes right I could almost see it working like subconsciously like you don't even you know maybe that's part of the curse of it is it I mean it's not sinister maybe it's just overly pleasing I'll do whatever you want you know I'm a spell a magic item I'm only here to fulfill a certain purpose and oh what is that okay and then the magic just goes off or you can even fully form it and that's why you get those weird inconsistencies yeah the too much of a good thing too much of a good thing I mean that kind of raises the point of like you magic magic curses magic items that are curse things it doesn't have to be like malevolent it could just be really inconvenient yeah it's just like I just don't want this oh yeah rid of it yeah definitely especially becoming like a sentient item a good inspiration I draw from is altered carbon yeah the PO the proprietor of the Raven hotel which is an AI and AI in this world are like clingy crazy ex like oh yeah yeah just they want to do everything and they end up in your room all the time and they're like and it's like okay you need to back off but but it's yeah it's never like overly malevolent it's just very annoying and inconvenient yeah yeah yeah so you know maybe the curse is actually like in some sort of like extra planar entity or something that's with the character and creates effects and the like for them that they think are being helpful but it but it or the curse is actually like a magic disease or something like that it doesn't respond to normal medicine it doesn't respond a regular type restorative magics there's something else going on and it represents both a like say spiritual condition as well as a physical ailment there's there's a ton of medieval myths that link like spiritual health with mental health and yeah and like the you know if the king is diseased of mind then the country will be diseased and it's its body politic kind of thing and so you can make those connections there like that or it's like oh you're hurt you know like you broken our social taboos you're cursed how do you see this this these mechanics playing out disadvantage is nice a disadvantage advantage is probably one of the better parts of fifth edition but it being the only significant source of penalties or boosts is really limits things and I get why you know I understand that and I think that like disadvantage on ability checks or disadvantage on certain saves is a good place to start but I do think that where curses shine mechanically are where they encourage or sort of like reset the boundaries for what is acceptable behavior from the players and vice versa from from the NPC's and and so anything that affects why you would take certain actions the kind of actions that you do take or would like affect the way people react to you those are all great avenues for curses so an example of that might be you are cursed with whatever comes out of your mouth the other person hears it the worst way possible you know that's your curse and that might be expressed as disadvantage on all charisma based checks yeah but that also doesn't seem enough - yeah and so it might just be that you're not just have disadvantage but like the difficulties that like the difficulty class that you have when dealing with anyone is gonna be different yeah maybe the base difficulty for any social challenge and for that person where the curse is 20 and it just goes up from there and if you're not optimized for you know social interaction from a mechanical sense then everyone who listens to you just hears a raging screaming [ __ ] who makes everything personal whereas you're just over there like why won't anybody I'm not you know listen - why is everybody treating me like this you know maybe it's it's cursed with your hair falling out or your fingernails falling out or you're cursed with scabrous growths or yeah there's a lot of things that have no mechanical impact on the game other than how the DM should treat the character from there in BC's yeah yeah oh yeah oh yeah cursed cursed with seeing you know undead or ghosts everywhere but they're not really real but they're not real fake booze maybe it's auditory you know experience auditory hallucinations cuz of a curse from the mechanical perspective it's disadvantage on certain perception checks or you might even just flat-out say like occasionally tell that player like hey you think you hear in a monster or an enemy or something and yeah you know and maybe sometimes the whole table gets it maybe they don't like you you keep them guessing by inconsistency with a hidden consistency like that might sound like it might sound like stupid and like Jim what the hell you're talking about you want to hide the pattern basically you want there to be a pattern that can be discovered because that is an enjoyable part of these games and they might get a kick out of it but you don't want it to be so obvious that you might as well have just handed them a remove curse spell and said get oh you know yes minor inconvenience you have any mechanical stuff for what how you treat curses or just detrimental magic effects things like that guess spell yeah also because I mean that is a curse yeah yeah in a regard you have this thing and if you don't you are cursed basically right so looking at that like where when you violate to the tenets of the curse if that's what it is like yeah you know if you do if you do this certain thing you're not supposed to yeah you know for temporary maybe you're maybe one of your stats is is halved or reduced certainly or something like that but it's only within the bound temporary like it's temporary right right you know I mean like your Constitution is reduced for a bit yeah you're weak for a little bit clumsy yeah I for messing with player stats I know players don't like that and that's it's a thing that is fallen by the wayside his additions have gone on taking experience away negative levels things like this ability score damage yeah but to me like that's a deterrent and that is that other than hit points it's a way to make players think about their full character yeah and care about their full character yes and screw your dump stat like if that's how you you know I mean everybody's got one I guess but you know or they don't have to yeah and you can with those kinds of things you can sort of like target other areas of weakness or the characters and you know if it is a a particularly strong fighter or something maybe they are cursed with weakness or cursed with clumsiness or cursed with like never being able to remember any of their their martial training or something and so they've got to temporarily find other ways to get around their problems if they ever make the killing blow they won't remember the fight yeah something could you think about in that curse for a fight yeah I really though like that idea like sort of an everyday style curse what you know one of the things that that struck me you know whenever I was studying Roman history was they find these spells and prayers were just written on like usually like sheets of 10 or something that's like durable and you just to me it kind of like surprised me and was a humanizing moment in studying ancient history where he's just like here's a bunch of people were just like mad at their neighbors and you know like just they've got regular people problems they've they've been driven insane by the people who live and are obsessed with stuff or someone hurt them and they they felt the need to like write out a prayer of cursing and you know to you know ask Apollo or Hera or whoever to to strike down their enemies and like that leads me to believe that things like curse words in a D&D world are not just social taboos that they are things that have a magical effect and you don't just throw a curse word around lightly you know it's a big deal just playing in a world where the magic weave is so it's almost tangible you can almost taste the magic in the air it's just a readily available folk magic that doesn't require spell use you know it doesn't require the incantation of things it's just like what do you do you are you really mad then make an oath to the Furies are you grief over something then call upon this thing you don't need any magic other than the power of your experience as a yeah person the release of your your anger your whatever emotion that you're feeling but yeah when you say damn your strength damn your your backer you know whatever is and and a peasant just says that to an adventurer and then you go off adventuring and all of a sudden you know every time you crit there's no extra damage there's actually yeah you just like something like that because you yeah you pissed that personal affection and turn them against the evil eye come on but that's the kind of thing right like that is why you have these you know myths and legends our own world of why they say the evil eye is so common in certain parts of the world and why you see it invoked as as sort of a token against dark magic as it's like yeah we're gonna ward we're trying to ward this off of it it ties into that everyday folk magic in a world that is not necessarily the kind of magic that pcs are gonna come across like and use personally but they might see it being used in the world and that's gonna tell them something about the people here are the people here known for just uh Turing hexes and curses and they just have a a low-grade you know kind of a power like that or or tapping into it does that suggest something about the place that they live the history of the the location or anything it might could you could tie that into your adventure it's another way to link them all together and have something really cool I've come across this mechanic a couple of places and not always in the context of a curse but it's usually usually you roll a die to sort of refresh a resource right so sometimes you might see this as you know you have a torch roll this die every you know time interval to see if it goes out in alien that alien RPG we played oxygen tank would be like that and so this one instead goes you've got a cursed item some kind of weapon let's say and it carries with it both a benefit and a drawback and there are different levels of it right and each level is assigned a die size so if you're familiar with also say like new maneras artifact depletion kind of works similar to that so let's say we start out with a cursed sword that you know your fighter liberated from a White's tomb or something and when you first use it you know holding it for an extended period of time or maybe just sort of notice it after a fight that your hands kind of Numb whenever you yeah you know but it cuts like you know nothing and and it you know it also like it's really hot out and you feel kind of nice and cool while you're waiting on it but when after a fight or after a critical or after a day whatever interval your DM decides you roll a d-10 let's say you roll one on that d-10 you've now entered the next step of it and your die goes from d-10 to d8 and now your right arm is covered in the frosty layer right you know just like when after you're wielding the sword you've just you've got ice flakes frost on your hand it made me start to get uncomfortably cold at night around you and it's like as this goes on and on and on you slowly become say like an ice cool and you know wield this blade that is infused with the spirit of this white or you can seek a way to curb your influence over the weapon or the weapons influence over you try to break that cycle but the idea is that it's in the player's hand how often they use this they're told you that when you use it this is the condition under which you roll this what's called a cataclysm die and as you get further and further down like we get to a d4 and you roll one you're done this thing has taken you over you know you're a high school now and you're a puppet of the frozen Lich King and so it's like that you can use that mechanic for a lot of different things it doesn't have to just be curses and like you can use it for events that are happening in your world or other kinds of like doom countdowns but I've seen it in the context of magic items and it's a way to like help reinforce the sort of cost benefit you know this this this magic item has a price while putting more agency in the players hands and also like gradually introducing the doom you know they can stop at the d6 level oh really [ __ ] I'm you know I I don't want this anymore but I've enjoyed the benefit up and then to now up until now as opposed to some other cursed items which are like all or nothing yeah pick it up you use it once you're done and you're cursed this is more of a gradual and each step the condition to get rid of the item becomes harder and more difficult yeah it's impossible you basically get to contemplate cutting your own arm off maybe it's a ring maybe it's a crown that has you know cursed spirit in it all of the Ice King or maybe it's anything maybe you went to the wrong place you know you've stumbled in the wrong patch of forest or you pissed off the wrong spirit there's a lot of ways you could use that mechanic for your free games yeah I like an idea of a cursed mine ring of mine shielding since it has that oh yeah yeah if you die it traps there they're lined in there so what if what if they were casting a curse when they died they died carried the curse into the ring with them or they want to like switch their mind with yours kind of thing they're already on the inside there they don't yeah yeah I like any kind of like a Wizards consciousness is trying to come back wizards are a curse in and of themselves but that's that's a that's a show for another day if you place thanks for watching [Music] [Laughter] not straight up from back in the day you kick your ass dude oh my cousin that had Mickey Mouse's laughs but nobody would ever tell him that kicked the [ __ ] out of you
