hello this is chef john from foodwishes.com with loaded butternut squash cordon bleu that's right there are so many amazing things people do with butternut squash they roast it they make soup they well actually that's pretty much it which is why i'm so excited to show you this and by the way i'm burying the lead here this video is actually serving as a test for a new studio i'm going to be filming in so if everything looks different it is and i was not working with my full setup but despite that this came out incredibly well and to get started let's talk about how to choose the right butternut squash for this recipe and that would be one where the bottom in the top part or neck are about the same size okay the bottom is always going to be a little more bulbous but if you can try to find one like this where that is not so pronounced and then once we have our squash the next thing we want to do is cut it in half lengthwise without losing a finger and for that we will start our cut going through the top ideally cutting through that really hard stem right through the center and at no point during this operation should your other hand come anywhere near that blade and then once that's been accomplished we'll use that as a guide to cut all the way to the back of the squash although definitely not in one big grand cut okay we want to go slow and just do a little bit at a time which i do with a combination of a rocking motion on the knife as well as for the thicker parts giving it a little pound with the other hand on top but again at no point is our guide hand anywhere close to being able to go under the blade and eventually especially if your first cut was nicely centered you should be able to split this in two very uniformly and that's it we now have two halves and at least ten fingers and then once we have that split we'll go ahead and take a spoon and scrape out the seeds and one of the main reasons i want you to buy a squash that's not overly curvaceous is because you're going to have less seeds and more squash okay so please remember that old rhyme if the butternut squash has a large ass you're going to want to take a pass but anyway we'll go ahead and scrape out those seeds as shown and then so these sit nice and flat i think we should slice off about an eighth of an inch from the bottom right not too much just a little bit so they lay nice and flat and that is going to be it for our prep we'll go ahead and transfer those onto a foil lined baking sheet at which point we can transfer that into the center of a 375 degree oven for about an hour and a half or so depending on the size or until they are beautifully tender but not falling apart and of course we're going to test that with a tip of a knife and you can see here some old scars from previous testing and then as soon as those are cool enough to handle what we'll do is scoop that cook squash into a bowl but very important we do want to leave about a half inch attached to the skin so i'll actually use the boundary of the cavity at the bottom as a guide and then we'll go around scooping getting most of it but like i said we do want to leave some attached so this doesn't fall apart since of course we're going to use these as shells to stuff everything back into and if we end up scooping all the way down to the skin these might sort of collapse when we cook them and they just won't look as nice and then to our scoop squash we will add some salt as well as some freshly ground black pepper plus a nice big spoon of dijon mustard which is absolutely critical here okay we really do need that to balance the sweetness and the richness and that's it we're going to finish this step up with one beaten egg at which point we'll take a nice big spoon and give this a mix but also a mash right if you want okay if you want to leave this nice and chunky that's your business i mean you guys are after all the lords of your loaded gourds but personally i do like to smash mine fairly smooth and then what we'll do once that's been all stirred and smashed together is toss in some sliced green onions followed by because we're calling this cordon blue some diced smoked ham and a lot of it as well as some greer cheese which is the classic cheese used in cordon bleu but i think a nice sharp white cheddar would also work out beautifully here and that's it we'll simply give this a mix until everything is combined and as you might have noticed i actually diced the cheese instead of grating it since i think texturally those bigger pieces are going to work better in this okay i think if the cheese is grated it sometimes emulsifies right into the squash instead of having hundreds of little pockets of cheese here and there and also i forgot to bring the cheese grater to the chute and that's it as soon as that's mixed we'll go ahead and fill our shells as evenly as possible which is a classic example of a super obvious instruction that nobody ever needs but always gets okay raise your hand if you were going to put a lot more in one than the other see i didn't need to tell you that but what i do need to tell you is that once those halves are stuffed we'll go ahead and top this with a little more cheese and i'm actually going to use a potato peeler here to make nice long thin slices which i think is going to look a little nicer than if we used a grater which of course coincidentally i don't have and just to bother some people i did one haphazardly and then did the second one in a much more orderly fashion probably to prove that once they come out of the oven they're going to look the same and that's it once those have been cheesed rando and crosshatch were ready to transfer into the center of a 475 degree oven for about 15 minutes or so or until they're beautifully browned and look like there's a green onion on the table man that's annoying anyway where was i oh yeah or until they look like this and i know it is not normal to get so excited over a squash recipe but i really was since this looked and smelled so amazing and then i went ahead and transferred those onto a cutting board for service partly because i didn't have a big platter with me but also because we're going to slice these into sections when we serve them anyway and that's it i went ahead and finished up with some sliced green onions and then i relocated to our new quartz countertop since i thought it would look nicer for the pictures since as i mentioned this was a test for getting a feel for the new studio and we'll do a full reveal at the appropriate time but here's a little sneak peek at the range island okay that's enough but anyway i grabbed a knife and sliced in and loved everything i was feeling and seeing and i couldn't wait to grab a fork and dig in and that my friends with some incredibly hammy cheesy butternut squashy goodness okay extremely flavorful as well as fairly rich and decadent but not overly so and a lot of that comes from the gruyere cheese which is very buttery and nutty and that's why it works so well with this squash and of course smoked ham is never not great with these ingredients so i don't really feel like i even need to mention that and i'm not doing a very good job of showing it but the still attached squash does come off really easily from the skin okay i was just worried about hitting the tripod it's not really that hard so yes this was quite lovely right off the cutting board but i did go ahead and plate up another portion next to a salad which i think for something like this is a very necessary pairing right not only do we get a temperature and texture contrast but an acidic dressing will help cut through the richness we spoke about earlier and i know you're probably thinking that all sounds great but please for the love of god can you eat that piece of diced ham off the top it's been sitting up there way too long don't worry i got you and while i'm definitely presenting this as a main course i think this could also work very nicely as a holiday side dish although i would probably switch out the ham for some caramelized mushrooms which i'm thinking would be very very nice but whether you make this meatless or not or you serve it as an entree or a side either way i really do hope you give this a try soon so please follow the links below for the ingredient amounts a printable written recipe and much more info as usual and as always enjoy you
