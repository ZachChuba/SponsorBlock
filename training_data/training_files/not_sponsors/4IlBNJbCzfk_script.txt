Light is a wave, and as it travels it does
its "waving" along a certain direction - its polarization. Polarization, among other things, heavily
influences the way light bounces and scatters - that's why horizontally polarized light
reflects off of a lake or car windshield, which in turn is why sunglasses with a vertical
polarizing filter can block that light. And in the hot plasma of the baby universe,
light was bouncing off of electrons left and right - until the plasma cooled enough to
become transparent so the light could start traveling through space. But before heading out on its 13+ billion
year journey, this light bounced one last time off of the plasma, and the direction
each photon went was influenced by how its polarization interacted with the precise temperature,
density and motion of the plasma. So if we measure the polarization of light
coming from this cosmic background radiation, it can tell us about the big bang. The details are complicated, but roughly speaking,
clumps in the plasma of the early universe created polarization aligned along or across
the direction from hot to cold, while jiggles created polarization at 45Â° angles to the
hot-cold direction. And by jiggles I mean the stretching and squeezing
of space due to gravitational waves passing through. Anyway, starting with the results from the
BICEP telescope at the South Pole, we see that while a majority of the polarization
came from clumps in the early universe, about 15% of it seems to come from jiggles. And these jiggles are a big deal - they were
caused just fractions of fractions of a second into the life of the universe by quantum fluctuations
of the gravitational field, so not only does their discovery mark the first confirmation
that gravity is indeed a quantum mechanical phenomenon, but it also opens the door for
us to look 380,000 years farther back than ever before, into the very birth of our cosmos.
