before we get started I just want to make it clear know this person is not a troll no this is not a parody you seriously feel like I need that disclaimer in all of my videos conserva pedia was not a troll the [ __ ] Church of witchcraft was not a troll the woman who said being straight as a choice was not a troll this unfortunately is just the world we live in today so I actually found this person because they have been literally harassing a youtuber Calvin gurrah going on to his Instagram and telling him that he's a traitor to womanhood for being a trans man yes today we are dealing with a turf wait I'm sorry that is a slur a trans exclusionary radical feminist if you don't know what a turf is check out my video on turfs linked below she's got incredibly hot takes like this one saying you're genderqueer saying you go by they is not a secret trapdoor out of identifying out of your oppression if you're a female in this world you cannot be identify out of your oppression genius but today we're not focusing on her opinion of trans people today we're focusing on her opinion of Shaving oh I see because I like the feeling no you [ __ ] don't you say because you learned to like the feeling because you're probably traumatized as a child hurting our mother earth completely unnecessarily by supporting the razors industry by buying razors you idiots stop and on that note I could not think terrible people if we shave shall we you are literally physically less of a woman if you shave your hair takes up space it weighs it has weight you're literally physically less of a woman for shaving [ __ ] all y'all I see your hair is not down to your ass ma'am did you perhaps cut your hair Wow everyone check out this less of a woman over here it's also a lot of the time of compulsion it's obsessive compulsive disorder and you're only making it worse by continuing to do it [ __ ] if I may interject I actually have an obsessive compulsive disorder I have had trichotillomania since I was 11 years old I cannot control my OCD I can however control shaving I want to show you my legs I was wearing tights earlier but so I'm up just so y'all could see my hairy ass lights and I want to talk about the argument I hear all [ __ ] time from all these limbs from hops lib fins hops hops what's a hub we should look up what a hop is hop is a handmaiden of patriarchy and let's just see quick if you are one okay let's see if I am a handmaiden of the patriarchy do you wear slave paint is this question one slave pain is also known as makeup the more suitable term for it it's late paint oppression smear yes I wear slave paint oppression smear do you practice self-harm by forcibly removing your body hair yes I shave is men shaping their face self-harm - or do you wear rape shoes I'm sorry rape shoes rape shoes this is it this is the walking breathing living stereotype of feminists I swear to God Turks were grown in a lab grown in a test tube to specifically amuse me I refuse to believe that an organically grown human being calls makeup oppression smear and heels rape shoes I refuse if you answered yes to any of the questions my condolences babe you're a Hopf do us all a favor and cut it out stop being one you look like such a fool and your rape shoes and your slave paint you look like a goddamn clown on stilts like I don't care come at me Hobbes Thanks so now that we know what a hop is let's get back to that other video they choose to wear makeup and they choose to shave so that choice should be honored well you dumb [ __ ] colonized [ __ ] I'm gonna tear that [ __ ] down in front of your face I hope you like it guys get ready for the concept of human beings having harmless individual choices to be torn down in front of your face also hold on rewind well you dumb [ __ ] colonized [ __ ] colonized [ __ ] colonized who is colonizing us is it men probably men women ah you know like to pretend that they have the choice not to do these things that it is their choice to do these things and that's not true it's not [ __ ] true so you shut the [ __ ] up before you say it's my choice I choose to wear makeup I choose to shave Oh No the eyeliner it's heading straight for my eyes the invisible hand of the patriarchy [ __ ] what this right here perfectly demonstrates the different branches of feminism the lip Femmes believe that every woman's choice as long as it empowers her is fine and good and cool and fresh that is the least annoying thing about liberal feminism the radical feminists like our friend here thinks that every woman's individual choice brings down all women as a class who would win five hundred seventy million women one little to be boys shaming your armpits causes breast cancer so if you shave that you're creating all these wounds and then if you put antiperspirant deodorant on it your those are like getting siphoned right into your breasts and it's gonna cause breast cancer so [ __ ] stop shaving your armpits you dumb [ __ ] hot [ __ ] the notion that deodorant and antiperspirant can cause breast cancer has been widely circulated on the internet and specifically states that when you shave tiny cuts in your underarms allow cancer-causing chemicals to be absorbed there are however no at the demo logic studies showing this association to be true shoe on head destroys feminism with facts and logic be a woman cuz you're i sorry i really think you're a woman if you shave your armpits i love how in this woman's mind a trans man can go on testosterone grow a beard grow muscle change his name look act and sound like a man but they are still a woman yet if a woman shaves she's no longer a woman I used to wear a nail polish after I had my dog I was still painting my nails very frequently I thought I was this kind of dog mom because I paint my nails I was like oh I'm gonna paint my dog's nails I had him in the bathroom and my darling baby he had he let me like hold his paw and as I was doing so he caught a whiff of that terrible [ __ ] smell and he sneezed really hard and I felt so bad if you're not gonna do it to your dog maybe you shouldn't do it to yourself so this woman this absolute anomaly painted her dog's nails with non petsafe nail polish and now has it out for old women who paint their nails I work at an office I don't know why it's the policy dress code to allow women to wear heels and makeup to work in this specific place she's not even mad about like a dress code being forced because some places have a strict dress code of heels and makeup she is angry that there is a choice authoritarians not even once it's just so inappropriate to wear slave paint to this job and mostly women work there at least 60% female if not 75% female so it's like why why are you wearing that [ __ ] wow it's almost like not all women wear makeup specifically for men you cracked the code in fact I just learned that in all female prisons women go through great lengths to get their hands on makeup we like our goddamn makeup I shave my head bald a few years ago and I will be ball again one day wait wait so shaving your head is fine but shaving other parts of your body is bad welcome to radical feminism nothing makes sense and the rules don't matter your body hair is there to help you balance and you need it oh my god what this is like Olympic level mental gymnastics don't shave because you can't balance what slave Fame there's enough to be said against that [ __ ] you don't need to spend money on that [ __ ] that teenagers wear to make you look like a child or make you look like an idiot wearing it find a different hobby oh I'm just a big dumb girl and I wear makeup therefore I have no hobbies except makeup isn't this like an ironically an incredibly sexist mindset to have about women am i a non feminist a better feminist than this radical feminist horrifying the reason this is so crazy to me is because like five years ago I used to be like haha stupid feminists not shaving haha hairy feminists bad but now I'm like hey if you don't want to shave that's your personal choice that's fine this person is the complete 180 i shamed women for not shaving and she's shaming women for shaving both of these mindsets are incredibly cancerous let people do what they want as long as it's not hurting anybody who cares why is that such a difficult concept for some people to grasp why so before we go do you have any closing statements human goodies return it she's mentally [ __ ] I'm not [ __ ] kidding you he's a [ __ ] he says nothing but dumb [ __ ] she worships you dick right
