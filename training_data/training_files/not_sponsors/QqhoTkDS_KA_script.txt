project pinky in color starring Nick Blackhurst also starring Richard Brunning and Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln tonight's episode ring of fear [Music] coming up in episode 27 we call our antipodean friends and they fly us over a special guest to lend us a hand however even with Alan's help we fail to get it stripped down for paint but we get an awful lot closer at the end of the previous episode we pretty much finished the chassis side wiring made a filtered fresh air inlet for the heater system built a strut brace to stiffen up the front end along with sorting out the bonnet release catch and completed a slightly unusual exhaust manifold that now seems to have disappeared for some reason well come back to that a bit later right now I need to deal with it dipstick sometimes it's just too easy but of course I'm not talking about that one I'm talking about this one which needs to go down the front here where of course everything else is and go to a hole in the bottom of the front of the block the dipstick and tube that comes with the original silly car engine is quite a long rigid thing that press fits down into the front of the block so we're going to get rid of it and swap it for this much shorter one off the sw20 mr2 because it's got this little rubber o-ring on the bottom that fits into a cup which should give us a lot more range of movement and make this a bit easier to fit all we need to do is find some space for it and make a bracket regular viewers I'll say regular but we're one of the most irregular channels out there will not be surprised to find the bracket starting out with the grinder before swiftly moving on to the pillar drill for the addition of a couple of holes [Music] the bender is the latest piece of equipment to be employed and if the TIG welder is next for some captive nuts and I think we've covered most of the bases yep I thought what might happen mix nothing if not predictable and slightly mad the bracket is destined to live on the thermostat housing and we'll bring the dipstick tube in front of the oil filter but behind the cooling fan the simple little standoff means we can swing the o-ring tube round the opposite way was designed to go and slip the graduated dipstick in the only space had available when we put the radiator back on can see how little room there was to work with right now for something completely different [Music] whilst we've got access to this deepest darkest recesses of the engine bay and I want to go back and revisit the gearchange cables yep they've been fitted to the car for quite a while now and they work but I'm pretty sure they're gonna wear out really quickly or get sticky because of the long and convoluted route that they take to get where they're going essentially really real problem with them is that they're too long we could easily get some custom cables made up to the right length but I think we can successfully modify these ones they should do the job fine so that's the next task Shawn these cables without ruining them them with the cables out of the car and on the bench we can take a good look to see what the best way forward is it'll be tempting to just hack the end off with the angle grinder but to avoid the expense and arse of getting new ones made I think a more considered approach is necessary here when we could I suppose hack the end off with the angle grinder right so that in he's just unceremoniously parted from the cable he's chucked up in the lathe and the old bits of cable out er that are still crimped inside of drilled out leaving us enough room to push the shortened outer cable into and crimp it up again you'll see what I mean in a moment here Nick's marking the correct length for the cable outer before surgically removing the surplus part with the grinder and a craft knife the old cable end is then wound onto the outer then the hydraulic crimpers are deployed to fix the two parts together permanently before we go any further it's wise to make sure that the cable inner goes through and is nice and free I'd say that looks ok I'm now worked out how this cable was originally put together and unfortunately to replicate it what I'm gonna have to do is crimp the end back on here then cut this end off and recriminate involved in so it will have to come up with another way of sorting the inner K black but that sure that least give us an excuse to do a bit of an upgrade from this original worn-out rubber Bush the upgrade begins with a piece of all thread [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] a quick flick of black paint and the newly shortened cable is pretty much ready for reassembly the protective boot goes on first and I see that Knicks whip touch of flush cutters can obtain your appearance then the lock nut is spun onto the threaded bar before the upgraded rod end is screwed into place and there have it one shortened adjustable improved gear change cable trouble is of course we need ooh brilliant I know what you're thinking you're thinking I'm not sure that solders gonna be strong enough well I think that proved the doubt is wrong me I was hoping he'd fall flat on his coccyx because it would have been funny but alas he was right anyway the cables are back in for testing and that seems to be pretty much spot-on that's much better and I think it should last just fine now the reason we were down in this area in the first place is because we were trying to find room to make the fuel filter now during the course of those proceedings it's become apparent it's just not going to happen so it's back to the dipstick who's got a better idea as NICs filled the engine bay with all that superfluous stuff like power steering air conditioning and an alternator and nothing to do with the fact that I've chosen the biggest fuel filter I could find we've had to come to the back here to try and find someone to fit it should be a nice easy job because hopefully it comes with its own bracket [Music] but fear not because the only place we can fit it out of the way is up here under the parcel shelf the bracket needs a bracket this will take the form of a little 10 millimeter standoff with two captive studs made for not an offcut piece of inch box and a couple of m6 by 16 mil bolts the supplied bracket comes with some weird sceptic sized holes so I'm taking them out to a proper metric measurement of six millimeters with holes all drilled each time to turn my hand to the TIG and get the fasteners welded in the sparks are the bolts zinc coating being burnt off here's my little bracket ready to go on the car but does the fuel filter fit yes yes it does it's time to break out the MiG to weld it to the parcel shelf and there it is with a coat of H primer so that's the first part of the install finished this hose went directly to the fuel pump with a straight connector but now I'm changing it to a 90 degree swept tube which will connect to the outlet side of the fuel filter just like that in fact I've got a straight connector on the end of this hose and screwed it on to the pump and now I'm just working out how long it needs to be to get to the filter before lopping it off on the fan saw [Music] these aluminium aan fittings are dead easy to assemble cut to length slide the nut over the hose first peel back the stainless steel braiding from the PTFE tube so can get the olive SAP mostly over the end slide your fitting into the tube as far as it'll go and do up the nut tightly the final part of the fuel filter installation is to join the pump to the filter with our new hose and that's it a rebuildable High Flow fuel filter in a location we can actually get to easily happy with that back in the engine bay and I've got to finish mounting this bracket because at the moment everything that fits on it just hangs off these two bolts down on the gear change now I did design more support into it but nicely fitted it and got carried away with something else and then forgot a lot about it which almost never happens yep he's right I can't recall the time where either of us did half a job and then moved on to something else ah yes well anyway back to the job at hand and the first of the supports is going to be attached to this gearbox mount fixture a little l-shaped tab was made and it's now being made onto the plate and if were thinking it wasn't going to have a captive nut well couldn't be more wrong the plate is now bolted back onto the gearbox and we can reveal the new support in all its glory that's right a small L bracket nice the captive nut makes it easy to bolt down and the new L bracket is thick enough to accept tapping so the other bolt goes in from the backside of the alternator mains that's taken care of side to side now we need to worry about forwards and backwards so to do that we're going to utilize this stud hole that already exists in the top of the gear box mounting which is supposed to be for a braced bar that goes back to the gearbox here because obviously the other four m10 fasteners just aren't enough we decided that Toyota were being overcautious and deleted the gearbox day to use it as an aircon pump support instead I mean go turn into a captive of this beefy box section is the ideal material to use to make another of his little L buckets now with the holes drilled and the excess trimmed off it can get bolted to the car yep I've turned the aircon pump into a stress member just like the oil and Formula One car and if it's good enough for them it's plenty good enough for me so we'll call that done and move on to the next thing towing ice they never really get a mention because on most cars they're just there this of course isn't most cars it's a mini and all by the very very late ones don't have one at all which is why often find them with bent front tie rods and bent rear subframes so for the minis managed this long without them why bother on this one well it's four-wheel drive it's a lot heavier it's generally a brilliant idea and on a lot of track days it's actually mandatory to have a towing eye so we've got to have one but where to put it well on this particular car the best place will be to tie one into this transmission cradle here unfortunately we can't do that because we won't be able to get asset when the number plates on and if we could any attempt to tow the car with a number plate on would result in a broken number plate so we're stuck with this front crossmember we're going to run into exactly the same problem though unless we come outboard of where the front number plate is and that as a problem this is just not strong enough see we've got quite a bit of experience of cars in gravel traps causing ditches cause upside down in fields cars down embankments in forests and in all of those situations the winch cable gets attached to the towing ie whether the structure behind it is up to the job or not can imagine the carnage when it's not now I don't really want that for this car so our job here is to design an attachment that's strong enough to pull the cars weight whether it's got the requisite number of wheels on it or not that sounds like quite a challenge so when it gets on with that I'm gonna get the funk out [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] part of the brief was to try and keep the fixing hidden so can see it with the front on barely and the car is much higher than it will be on its wheel so I reckon that's fantastic we're using a towing eye from the peugeot citroen stable and because never know which side is going into the ditch we've built one for the passenger side too many of these OBM eyes have odd threads more like an Acme thread than anything else but these are a bog-standard m12 by 1.75 which meant we could use these joiners as the basis of our fixings and they were put to good use again on the rear where nick is adding two more towing points in case we go nose into the ditch or gravel trap these towing eye points are being welded into the end of the chassis legs which come all the way down to the rear valance and now it's finally time to close off that hole in the end of the chassis leg left open some five years ago specifically so we can do this job the outside of the valence needs a bit of a lineage back to clean off the weld marks and after a quick coat of H primer the towing eye is screwed in for a test fit in addition to pulling the car out of uncompromising positions these towing eyes can also be used to tie the car down to a rolling road so they really are multi-use well now that he's out the way I'm going to make a start on tidying up the inside of the boot the idea here is to make a couple of panels that close in the areas behind the real lights of course it started with a cardboard template which is then traced onto some suitable aluminium sheet and then the shape is cut out on the bandsaw [Music] I might not be eligible for a funk montage yet but figured I could sneak a 10-second Rock sting in there while he's not looking anyway with the panel sorted I need something to bolt it to this will take the form of three little tabs with captive nuts hewn from a piece of 50ml wide to mil thick steel strip leftover from when Nick was banding the wheels from 5-inch to 7-inch it's been kicking around the workshop for a bit and while 2 mil is overboard to bulk small Ally panel 2 made the job dead easy and fast after a little shaping on the rotary sander the tabs are ready to be welded to the body shelf with the tabs welded in and that was Nick on the MiG I can now screw the panel into place not too shabby the job was the same on the driver side with the exception of this rectangular hole to house the interior light pretty much the entirety of the inside of the boot is destined to be trimmed in black carpet so all these flat surfaces should make the job reasonably straightforward all I think that's gonna look great but at the moment there's still one area of the boot that is letting it down so to finish the job off I need to make an aluminium trim panel that encloses and covers the inside of the boot lid as usual this starts off with a cardboard template 20 quid sometimes I think deliberately make things more complicated than they need to be this should now be as easy as Mark out all the hole positions drill a pilot hole in each one and use the supplied fasteners and cup washers but of course it's not that easy due to Nick's pathological hatred of self tapping screws I'm having to revert all of the fixings to accept an m5 fastener and as he doesn't trust Riv nuts either I'm adding a dab of Loctite to all of them FML these are just stunt fasteners and are in no way indicative of the final look once again this trim panel will be finished in black carpet probably not unlike shag but more of a scratchy mat but I reckon the effect will be good and the rug will really tied the room together while I was messing around in the boot NIC has taken the opportunity to redesign the camera mount it's now a sculpted block of black nylon with a pocket in the back to contain the GPS or power module it's now a shedload easier to fit to the rain sensor has been relocated and nixed drawn on the area needed to be painted on the new screen before it's fitted he hardly colored outside the lines either good job following the triumph of the trim panels in the boot I've been tasked with making something similar for this area under the seats this gap is big enough to lose a badger in so we need something to close it off and make it look neat [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] when it's all trimmed and carpeted this is going to turn into a bonus storage pocket which is plenty big enough to get a couple of lemon squashes in I've made another trim panel for under the front edge of the seat and this neat ins up the whole area I've done the same for the passenger side too however it's not all good news when we put the seat recline mechanism cover back on it fouls the companion box when we push the seat back this is not good what we need is a man with a grinder and a will to use it you've probably got a pretty good idea of what's occurring here Nick's cutting out some relief in the companion box that he's just gonna plate over some of are probably still wondering while we're hung up on all these little details well if we don't do it now it's never going to get done and once the shell is painted we absolutely do not want to be cutting grinding and welding our way out of problems we should have attended to before the car was blown over after a little like limiting some edge primer is added to protect the bare metal one question does leap out and that is does the seat belt assembly still fit and thankfully the answer is yes yes it does time to test the cutout core that's good happy with that we're slowly ticking off all those little jobs that have got to be done before it's stripped down and sent for paint but it's still a few left so let's carry on in the last episode we managed to sort out the main bonnet catch what we didn't do however was install the secondary safety latch this is that latch and it fits in this incredibly sturdy bracket up here and then latches underneath this bit of a front panel down here only it doesn't because some Bell end cut a radiator in the way it should at least be a fairly simple fix does it involve a grinder of course it does to whiz cool that should do for the latch however both it and the main bonnet catch are attached to this front panel which do to the whole bell end radiator situation is now as flimsy as hell so I think the next job is to put a bit of reinforcement back into that the stiffener is going to take the form of a piece of steel with two bent returns and three rather attractive dimple guide speed holes this is then plug welded in between the top rail and the bottom lip of the front panel as well as looking sleek the speed holes are there to aid air flow at the moment we've got these vent holes in the scuffle panel and an open seam here where it meets the wing so next up we need to do a little bit of water management [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right we're getting close in fact I think there's only one job left to do before we can strip this thing down to a shell ready for paint and to be quite honest I'm not really looking forward to it but can [Music] [Applause] [Music] tune in next time for another exciting episode from the files of project binky [Music] [Music]
