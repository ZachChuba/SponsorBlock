why build a creeper PC in absolute secrecy well here's the thing we heard celebrity PC builds were the new hotness but we didn't want to fall into the classic trap where you promised someone something really cool and then you take a freaking year to deliver it so anyway PewDiePie started playing Minecraft again so we're gonna build a king kleiner I don't know three or four months ago back when we initially conceptualize this so we were like heck yeah let's do the greatest creeper PC build that's ever been done but then now we're finally finishing it and then the word on the street is he's quitting YouTube but then he says he's not quitting YouTube but then the last time he uploaded a Minecraft video was like three weeks ago you know what doesn't matter who cares we're building the and exciting products so go check them out at the link in the video description [Music] so let's go through how we made it starting with the hardest part which is the case the skeleton was designed in fusion 360 over a span of about a month with a couple of main design goals one was we wanted there to be enough cooling for top spec hardware I mean the last thing you want to do is send someone a cool custom PC that ends up being a downgrade from what they're currently running and we also wanted no cheating compromises to the creeper look we weren't gonna allow ourselves to like oh well you know we need to extend this leg in order to bigger graphics card or something like that so I started with a rough concept for what I wanted the creeper PC to look like and once I figured out scale by taking the form factor of an M ATX motherboard and plugging in into fusion 360 and just scaling of creeper shape around it then I could start building the actual frame from aluminum extrusion so after I had the actual frame built and scaled properly then I can skin it put all the components in it and pray it all fits together as a bonus goal we wanted the head to pop off like kind of like a you know like boom you know explosion moment with the press of a button which I actually have right here but I can't do right now cuz this head was by far the hardest part of this entire build it went through like three design changes so how it works now is there's two solenoids latches that are like four gate latches that clip into little tabs that I take welded into the bottom of the creeper head so these guys you can just come down and they'll pop right into place like so and now it's latched and active so once we give it power off comes the head initially it didn't have enough support the head is just a little bit too heavy so for the first time I tested it oh we have footage of this actually the head pops off and it just it flops all the way down we can't have a flaccid paper no no classic creepers so there's limiting straps that I installed on each corner to keep it just floating just so and without it falling off of the support axis in the center it was also really challenging getting the string from the spring just right because that jack-in-the-box effect requires you to get it balanced just right I think you nailed it Gomis so this is it we just start building now right yeah so for our power supply we actually didn't end up going with a full sized ATX unit even though we possibly could have I guess this saves us a little bit of space where we could have mounted a hard drive in the front and emergency but other than that is there any rationale behind the 800 watt Silverstone SF XL no it's just a really nice little dense power supply it's easier to fit so mounting for this pretty straightforward we've got some double-sided tape on the bottom here but that's not actually what holds it together what actually holds it in place is this bracket on the back here which is a bent piece of sheet aluminum and this looks like it was quite the little piece to get right well thankfully I didn't have to make it ah our friends at proto case Friends of proto case it's good to have friends and fabrication places sure is so do I get to do most of the building you've already built it so it's really important we get this first little drop right because once that tape goes down it's not coming off a little lower there this it's really nice working with proto case on stuff like this too just because they specialize in PC stuff so you don't have to explain to them things like you know why the spacing needs to be just so on a power supply Mel yeah actually use their template designer which is really neat it has cutouts for most of the stuff I used here being able to just draw in a motherboard and have all the holes be in the right space was fantastic push that down power supply is in I think you're supposed to hold this tape for about 30 seconds GPU we can do it so how the GPU is mounted is we have a little bracket I machine yep we have cable mud to thank for these cables see how flat those are oh okay it fits to within an eighth of an inch wow that's really tight okay so how does this go in here this just like goes under there and that sandwiches it down and that's it that's it that's it before we tighten it yeah it's best now to do the power supply cables so that it hold on a second we better do this peel - that's a really unsatisfying peel this is a really cool-looking card though so it's got a triple slot cooler we weren't sure how much airflow we were gonna be able to get into this bottom foot so it was all about making sure that our card has a really really good cooler on it but this is an RT X xx atti so basically as good as it gets for Minecraft with RT X let me give you a a good angle on it here and then I can just drop it right into place basically this is the spot and I can crank it down now then right yep that's the only thing holding it in place I do I'm actually a little bit worried we might I've seen things in shipping that would make your blood curl curdle blood curdle hair curl if we put like a u-shaped foam piece at the back I'd feel a ton better and just glued that in the vibrations and drops so a lot of this mass there's a lot of leverage here yeah I think can actually rip the PCI plate right off the card I've seen you've seen that I've seen it I've seen PCI Express slots ripped off motherboards and the PCI Plate ripped off F some choke just just you know shipping to Alberta from here how difficult would it be for us to fabricate a hold down strap for this as well it's it's taped it's not going anywhere you'd have to be really trying to have that dislodge I have seen power supplies ripped out of like standard cases like the screws sheared off in shipping and banging around inside them I love tape as much as the next person but because this whole thing is held together with tape think about it a little right I just have to put it on a pallet yeah I wouldn't all box this okay all right so that's in we can put the heart in so which way does it go on standoffs here okay and then for standoffs where the Oh fantastic so is this motherboard tray custom yes Wow did proto case make that first as well I designed it proto case cut that that's actually steel so it's a little bit more rigid nice that's a good call so in terms of the hardware we're using we're running a Maximus 7 gene so we went with em ATX so that we could have a little bit more expandability it's only got a single PCI Express 16 that slot but if you wanted to add 10 gave it networking or whatever or they else down the line we've got another 4x slot up here it's got basically everything you could want built-in onboard AC Wi-Fi USB 3 you know type C blah blah blah etc etc and more importantly because we're not putting a hard drive in this it's got a ton of em to expansion so we've got a 2 terabyte NP 600 in here we've got room for another one here and then this thing columns holding this is their latest BIM dot 2 goes in here and holds another 2 m dot 2 drives so that should be that should be enough plenty of storage yeah those are some big ol screws so we went pretty basic in terms of cooling I'm not expecting him to overclock or anything like that and given that we're running a 99 hundred K a single 120 millimeter a IO with a replacement fan we went with a knock to a fan you want the whole system to be nice and quiet seemed like a pretty good bet now I'm sure there are many many of you that are gonna be like he had its video why didn't you go AMD the answer is that we started playing this project like four months ago yeah AMD didn't have anything that was taught to your for gaming at that time what do you want from us which way do you like the twos oh I have the tubes sticking out just like that way oh yeah that should work so what's really cool about having the cooling configured this way with our thick rad and our 120 millimeter fan actually pulling air and then blowing it out this way is that the exhaust comes out around the head so it's nice and dispersed there's not going to be like a hot zone near the computer and the intake for this fan is going to be drawing fresh air from the bottom over the m-dot to the slots the V RMS and all that stuff so it's gonna stay nice and cool and it's not just this fan there are actually two eighty millimeter fans that are going to be pushing air up from the center crotch cooling TN so this was one of our challenges right now felix has 64 gigs of ram in his system according to the information we were able to find we didn't talk to him about this because we wanted to be a surprise now this board in spite of being mitx only has two memory slots because it takes up so much room for all these MDOT twos so we ended up needing to use these special try to z DC series memory modules so these are basically like two sticks in one so each of these is 32 gigs for a total of 64 gigs of DDR for 3,200 CL 14 that should be plenty for our Intel platform $1500 ish not for 1 for 2 and of course there are GB completely hidden this panel is gonna be held on by magnets so we actually can't have anything pressing on it there we go so you can see the crotch is more than just cooling there's actually room for cable cutouts and PCI Express and stuff like that to run in between them so that you don't really see it but it's I mean it it has to run there there was no way to be true to the shape of the creeper without having a little bit of cheating in between here so that will go in probably last yeah if we want to post it we can just plug it all in and make sure it functions we can verify that the header jacks I ran all of these runs with string before I order the cables ok it's got to be an easier way than that mmm not that I'd found so this is the head ejection system so what we have here is a remote relay these are really cheap I think it was like $8.00 runs on 4 to 12 volts but one of the problems I encountered with the solenoid system here is that when the spring force is pushing up on the latches here there's so much spring force that you can't actually eject the head yep so what we have here is we have 12 volt then being sent into a boost converter which helps this to like 18 and a half-ish volts then that trip that over volts these solenoids enough enough and it works plugging in the power supply and BOM Jayanti sings friggin heavy dude and I don't even have the panel's Oh watching you lift my project scares me and lights hey how are we do we have a monitor or anything oh yeah I can pull one over all the Keystone's oh yeah we've got like 1 2 3 unnecessary connections all good just had a cable and a fan there that click by the way was the solenoids getting power you can do the honors and we're posted with all 64 gigs of RAM very nice okay so we have no more components to put in it so we want to deal with installing all of the buttons and stuff in our panels sure and then the panels go on we vinyl Dover all these mounting holes for the rear i/o so this is our power and this is gonna be DisplayPort but I'm gonna need to just make a little hole it's really tight with the vinyl in there okay need a nut that is how finished it's gonna look from the outside of that that looks great so this is this one then it's correct you we're definitely gonna need to adjust the position of the motherboard a little bit then so we're gonna move it up with the main fasteners on both the rails yeah and then over will be with the PCB fasteners yeah so let's do the vertical adjustment first sure which is you can just do that with a rubber mallet right absolutely yeah percussive maintenance send it no really no bad Linus oh you know what what are we running into here I think we're running into I need to tap it no it doesn't make sense this should just slide there like locking themselves yeah okay we want to come down about an eighth of an inch that's bang on tap it I might have found one other small oversight this nut interferes with this goof that seems you know Remmel fixable well not Trudeau was notch it out under normal circumstances you would never grind metal creating metal fragments inside a computer that's already built but we feel like we've got everything masked off well enough yeah it's got to come up a little higher I can see it through here a little more yeah I see it yeah actually a lot of the build was like this you put everything in place and you can design as as much as you can and CAD but when it all goes together sometimes parts aren't the same size as what the CAD drawing is or any number of things we got it this time yeah it's flush okay awesome I know that I know you want the finish to be similar I can sleep soundly tonight now DisplayPort power rear i/o done I think we're actually ready to really close yeah we just start peeling panels and sticking them on holy smokes well not before we put the PCI Express connector back in uh huh we should do any final cable management okay well the lynchpin in this whole shebang is this middle panel okay so the cut outside here yeah that's over we do that first I don't know we gotta just fit before we take off the adhesive oh okay 24 8 and 2 PCIe I'm just worried about cable lengths they'll be fine honestly okay all right I have done every surface on my side here I'm just gonna finish this this VHB tape is like super list sticky so we don't want to be pulling things off once we've applied it because we could end up bending it what's that it's a razor for pulling the VHB tape off now so this side is the PCI side huh snuck that LTTE logo in there we have a little bit of a cutout that totally planned and not done after the fact yeah to give a little bit of clearance for ribbon cable that 120 millimeter fan is gonna take care of intake for our graphics card which does it have an exhaust or is it just pass through so all the exhaust comes out the foot at the bottom so they're elevated up on these little bumpers okay perfect the oh oh I didn't take the adhesive backing off at the very top okay all right yeah everything's clear up ribbon cables a little stressed but okay oh yeah it's quite contacted yeah well yep that one's on for better for worse I need more oh I'm good everything's fine so that's on there this way these cables can't come loose and stick into the fan or anything nasty like that that would be a real pain to diagnose and fix all right shall we line up the other side I think we should just stick it and then run the cables sure yep okay you do bottom I'll do top but I think that's a lot better than the last time we should have done that last time that's like perfect reliving we're learning and it's worth noting I haven't seen it with all the panels on it either that's just bubble wrap nice okay that looks pretty clean because the 24 pin covers everything else now yeah what do you get a guy like PewDiePie for Christmas someone asked me on Twitter it's like what do people buy you for Christmas and I said socks I actually truly the greatest gift well the fans on the bottom are hooked up they're both into a single header that should have easy software control okay do you want to come back on this side and stick on the head ejection system okay here we go this is a sick build thanks sure do can I actually get another one of those two Ltd store.com mmm that's a new store to come I noticed that the power supply isn't plugged in yet oh wait if we grab the belt sander see if our shaving our connector oh nice man no problem so that's plugged in now I mean do you want to do that one for weight also though we do not I don't know if I shaved it enough to fit through here there we are professionals oh so I wanted it as far away from the PCI Express extender as I could get it oh you think power like the frequency will I don't know for sure gosh what I know is that I don't feel like dealing with it oh that is a problem me neither yeah also I'll line up the bottom again and you line up the top okay I think I'm good as we're gonna get Wow what we do next - why don't we close up the feet I have a image of a creeper because I want to make sure we get the panels on in the correct orientation so you want to get the actual like pixels yeah pixels in the correct spots oh we're going for accuracy here right all right all right a dark corner goes towards the side yep yep now seems like a good moment to shout out proto case with their fantastic high precision laser cutting they actually made all these panels for us before we had them sent off to the vinyl wrapping shop this head is a piece of art it's all aluminum and it's well that sharp edges and you can't weld it too fast otherwise it'll just melt so they're like slowly dabbing well we'll put in some footage of this it's incredible so going on you better believe it these are different yeah we don't have this is why is the left different from the right one small error all right so I'll just put it on a random way then yep okay oh no that's too far off okay that's gonna happen a lot all right I'm calling that good enough I'm sorry if it's not good enough okay so what's the foot is that the foot that is the foot so we still end up with about a millimeter of gap on my side I can take a little more I think we're gonna have to live with that yep like that looks pretty darn good alright should we put a big panel on wait no this isn't the same this is the front that's the back minor problem we put double-sided tape on the front piece and magnetic strips on the back piece just kind of take all this off how those really no good anymore yeah the adhesives toast okay and that's it's literally on there okay go ahead okay those cables will never be seen you know very good I like cables great so we've now got magnets on the back of this panel yep but this is an aluminum chassis so it's aluminum I've made four neodymium magnet stacks and I've counterbored half inch holes which fit these so we just give this little tap and will deform the aluminum around the magnet and it will hold it in place no okay hey nice that is quite flush sir and then you're gonna want to do probably six or eight all around the periphery and it's dead can't make it worse all right are you doing that by hand mm-hmm oh it's a spring-loaded thing you're not doing it by hand boop boop all right so now we put the front on that yeah oh wow yeah nailed it to the edge it's done oh wait it's not done huh should have done this earlier wait no this is no problem cuz we thought of this Oh gorgeous monitor keyboard mouse water keyboard mouse let's do it this thing seriously does look like just a computer graphic brought to life like it's crazy should I power it on I'm so happy with how well that head retains itself like getting it to latch and release every time perfectly literally took four days if you were him do you leave it down so that you can like do this on a whim or do you leave it up so you can just no I totally leave it up you leave it up we gotta like game on this thing darphus a microscope it actually works yeah worst case scenario head down head down yeah so I'm gonna hit the GPU with the msi combustor built-in stress test and I'm gonna hit the CPU with a blender classroom render excellent so we are turbo into 4.7 gigahertz all course our CPU is sitting at anywhere from 80 mid to 90 low remember this is under an all core load while stressing both the CPU and GPU our GPU is sitting pretty darn healthy actually around 60 to 63 degrees I think it's safe to call that a success I mean we're gonna want to leave this run for a little bit make sure that it actually holds at these temps but it seems like it's actually doing a perfectly good job of getting rid of the heat yeah great job Colin white really does just look like like a like a piece of video game just sitting on your desk doesn't it what just happened it turned off I was trying to troll James I was asking him how it looks up close and I tried to trigger the head while it was under load current spike current spike how power-hungry is that it's pulling like four amps at 12 volts so like 48 watts it's only 50 watts it's an 800 watt power supply maybe don't stress test it and hit the button I mean that's kind of funny okay we might have to live with this particular little design flaw it's a feature let me see if it happens again let me see what happens again full stress I couldn't send it I think the odds of that happening are pretty slim yes I have my job for another day oh 66% chance mm-hmm so then outside of a couple minor finishing touches it's done it's playing Minecraft it looks like minecraft and it may not be the world's first creeper PC but you know what I think it's the best one so come at me bro I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you like this kind of hacky project D type stuff you might want to also check out our series on the hack Pro the Mac Pro hackintosh competitor to Apple's real Mac Pro we're gonna have that linked below and I guess Expo 2020 is online only don't worry oh good I can't believe we don't get to keep this now I'm only gonna get to play with it a few more times it doesn't crash when it's running minecraft no you sure I'm just positive okay good cuz I'd be super awkward try it one more time one more time ready that's good right good
