hello and what is going on you guys it is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new video for you all today so today after a long week off I bring you guys loot from 1000 serac nests released into the game July 4th 2019 this is still a relatively new boss and I was surprised that not many people have made loot videos on this boss before so first things first my gear choice for this video I did go with a basic full Carol's setup at first and then shortly after that I did swap the Carol skirt for Bandos tassets for that extra strength bonus it did help me out much more over time so I do recommend a little bit of Bandos if you can't afford it but just make sure that you bring a Carol's top or something that's gonna be able to deflect some magic attacks and I will explain why later on in the video for the weapon choice since the rack miss is weak to crush I did go with the abyssal bludgeon I could have used the sight for this video but I wanted to make sure that I would make as much profit as possible so using a bludgeon saved me a ton compared to what a sight would have cost me with all the blood runes and whatnot and the inventory layout also changed a little bit over time at first I thought that Sarah Bruges would be a pretty good idea and then I realized it just kind of cuts down on the profit as well so I went with 4 super restores one super combat and then of course just anglerfish for my food now as it goes for the rune pouch I wouldn't say it's necessary but I did think bringing vengeance would be a good idea just in case I messed up on one of the prayer switches and took some damage at least then the Vengeance would give back some of that damage to serac nassif I got hit or something but again it's not necessary to bring that it just speeds up the kill a little bit in my opinion now your choice of a special attack weapon is completely up to you if neither of your two weapons are able to cut through webs though make sure to bring at least a knife because there is a lot of web state you have to cut through in order to reach this boss room I was just bringing tracking claws and luckily they are pretty pointy so I was able to cut through all the webs that you do have to go through in order to get back and forth when you're banking also highly recommend an imbued heart if you can't afford one the reason for this as well as the carol setup is because while you're fighting Sir Agnes there is multiple spiders that do spawn during the fight and some of them do use a magic based attack which does seem to be pretty accurate and hits you a lot so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but if you do have a higher magic level you seem to take less damage from a magic based attack so therefore the imbued heart plus the Carol stop really did come in handy when having to deal with all those spawns and for those of you who enjoy boss Slayer tasks Arachna s-- is considered to be a spider boss assigned by dura del neve tyrell and cone are you do receive 430 Slayer XP per kill and if you are a lower level and you're afraid that you might die luckily for you you can always bring a friend or a team with you since this is a multi combat area and your kills will definitely speed up if that's the case another tip for faster kills which is something that I didn't actually do the spawn time is 30 seconds per kill on sir agnes so after every single kill you can just instant hop worlds and just start right away on the next one as soon as you finish your last one but you might accidentally crash someone and that can get annoying so that hopping option is of course just kind of up to you and how efficient you really want to be and speaking of efficiency if you guys are curious as to why sometimes in these clips the graphics may be a little bit more HD than clips before or after it is because I was using rune light on and off during this video since I got so many clue scrolls elite and hards you know rune light was almost absolutely necessary to do those clues much quicker than I usually would have but towards the halfway point of the video I just switched back to the normal client the way I record with Camtasia it's a little confusing to explain I just always seem to miss click the client itself and drag it somewhere else and then my aspect ratio gets all messed up and this actually ended up being like a 52 clip video just because I kept messing up so many different Clips so yeah don't mind me I will try to master it eventually but nevertheless I do hope you guys notice the difference in this video and two side notes that are worth mentioning is the first 500 kills were all live streams on Twitch so don't mind these gods sword clips this guy good friend of mine just wanted to do a giveaway for my stream just figured it'd be a neat little clip in the video and the other side note being that I did actually get an XP milestone which I rarely do get in this loot series and that of course being 100 million strength xp pretty much all gathered from Peavy aiming and a little bit of nightmare zoning through the years yeah we are officially halfway towards our first ever 200 mil on this account whether it'll be strength range or HP I'm not too sure which will be first but it was fitting to get that just around 2 hundred a--casey overall and also a fun fact pretty sad fact actually I did start this video at five Casey and I actually ended it at 1000 Casey you see that's the problem when you have a bad memory and you take too long on a loot video you forget things like that so yeah when you guys get to the very end of the video and you see that I ended it at a thousand kills I guess you could technically say that was 995 Casey but don't worry don't worry I did kill five more and didn't really make much of a difference so there's kind of a spoiler alert there that you know not every video can be a hundred percent perfect I do have my flaws so getting back on track here you know there is a decent amount of people that do kill this boss I did see a lot of iron men and a lot of lower levels around the combats of eighty to a hundred so you don't have to be maxed or have high budget gear especially when I saw people bringing anything from like a leaf bladed battle axe to a cudgel to an elder maul godsword really so many different weapons that you can use here no matter what your budget is since her weakness is crushed really gives you a lot more options than usual bosses do and I just want to give another shout-out to a rune light you know this was the very first puzzle box that I did on the rune light client and I do believe that this puzzle box took me less than eight seconds usually it would take me anywhere from I'd say three to six minutes so yeah it's really remarkable so the drop table of this boss is definitely interesting as I'm sure you've seen by now it was getting tons of Clue Scrolls with the rate of the hard clue being one in 40 in the rate of the elite being one in 60 I did do every single elite that I got and I almost did every single heart as well but I did fall a little short on the hard clues just because this video is taking so long to do I think I just ended up matching the elites and the hearts and I ended up getting 11 heart caskets and 11 elite caskets so nevertheless at least we get a nice comparison from both of those casket tears and other than the cool scrolls you can expect a lot of gems luckily they are noted as well as a lot of ores a little bit of seeds great amount of coins anywhere from 17 to 25 K can't forget about the high tier runes and nice alcohols that do add up for example the rune plate body the rune two-hander noted battle stabs which is really good for iron men accounts as well and the rare drop table is pretty interesting I mean the valuable rares would definitely be the serac 'no skull with a drop rate of one in 384 and occur in grand exchange price of one point seven mil is the most expensive thing that you can get from this boss as of right now and a fun fact about the cudgel is that it's actually going for much more than one point seven mil this is because of yesterday's new update featuring at the nightmare boss that boss is actually also weak to crush so the cudgels apparently used for that boss as well which made the price just skyrocket so it looks like I chose a pretty good time to make this serac nice video and for those wondering when loot from 1090 hate to break it to you guys but I got to go charge 25 thousand glories and then plant 100 thousand mithril seeds and then I plan on doing 1000 corporal beasts so I get back to you like a month but yeah don't worry that video will happen over time we got all the time in the world after all other rares though including the jar of eyes which is one in 2000 does have a price of about 1 million and of course the main rare of them all the main goal for this video would be the sriracha also known as the pet which is 1 in 3,000 now ironically the very first loot video in this series was actually loot from 1000 vin in Addis which is the only other spider boss in the game and of course it can be found in the wilderness the drop table on that spider is so much more profitable than this one and unfortunately in that video I did not get the spider pet that I wanted so I am hoping in this video I can redeem myself and finally get a spider pet in my name but we will see no luck yet and speaking of luck though the tables did turn with our very first rare drop a Sir Agnes cudgel and again if I am mispronouncing any of these words I really do apologize I know that can get annoying but yeah 673 kills and and as I mentioned before this was much more than 1 point 7 mil luckily I did record selling it so you guys will see the actual number that I did get for it yeah nonetheless it was a pretty cool drop to get especially seeing it on the ground for the first time and some other facts about Sir Agnes in general you know it is the mother of the temple spiders which you guys will actually be seeing loot from 3,000 temple spiders in just a few days from now and of course the temple spiders and Sir Agnes herself all can be found in the fourth dose dungeon and Sir Agnes specifically can be found in the former burial tomb south of the Spider Den and if you do happen to accidentally leave the lair while killing Sir Agnes she will rejuvenate all of her health so make sure not to do that there is one really cool drop that I did like on this drop table and that is the jaw an egg sack this giant egg sack is one in 20 and it is valued at 27 K in the G but actually sells for 84 K the reason it sells for 84 K's because luckily this sack holds 100 red spider eggs and since these spider eggs are used to make super restores they are a pretty good drop to get especially for ironmen accounts and the reason that I didn't touch too much on the grubby key drop is because I am actually working on a video in the far future just about grubby keys so you guys will hear a lot about those in the future and after a long three weeks here we are loot from 1000 sir agnes has been completed or at least so I had thought again I have to kill five more but don't mind that we didn't get the pet or anything and those five kills kind of a spoiler I think we made like a hundred and six K between those five kills so once we sell all these items on the grand exchange because the price check is one number and the grand exchange price is a different number we're just gonna add an additional 106 K and that will give us the exact number all right so let's get this started enough rambling so we have all of the runes the ORS the gems all the alcohols and as well as 13 crystal keys over 1000 red dragon hides very first price check coming out to be just about 23.8 mill we will go ahead and round up to 23.9 now we have the second price check you can't expect just over 1 million coins from 1000 serac nests at least and this was the seeds as well as the herbs all these items coming out to be just about 8.2 mill so just based on the price check numbers we are looking at a total of 32 point 1 million and at this point I did decide to go sell everything in the grant exchange to see just how much I made exactly and I did decide to keep all the pages that I did receive from the spider they are valued at just about 1k each you can trade them in and I think I'm just gonna keep those for now you know I was collecting them from the undead druid video so we'll see what I do with those in the future so as you can see the giant egg sac although valued at 27 K it does sell for 86 K a piece so that is a really good drop that you can expect to get here and a cudgel although I put it in for 1.5 mil did sell for 3.7 mil that was much higher than I expected and again I do think this is just because of the update yesterday just had good timing I guess so that was a nice improvement on the price check you know I was doing a giveaway for you guys if you checked out my latest YouTube post I was in Walmart one day I go there quite a bit I was bored so I bought a 3-month runescape membership cards so I figured whoever was the closest to guess the exact number that I made from all of these 1000 serac nough skills I would just give you that membership card and over 2,000 people did post their guesses and you know obviously that's why I had to kill those extra five to make sure I get the exact number now this number does not include the losses that we did take on supplies which was just about eleven point nine mil rounded up to about twelve mil and it didn't include the loot that we got from the clue Scrolls as well this was just the serac no suit so before we open up the clues if you guess thirty-six million five hundred and sixty six thousand three hundred and eleven or something close to it and congratulations you have won we will get to that in just one second opening all these hard clues you know haven't really seen too many rewards above 100k always slacking on the clues scrolls I tell you one of these days one of these videos we will get Third Age but it looks like we got absolutely nothing from the hard clues so now let's go ahead and open eleven elite clue Scrolls see what we can get from that looks like every reward so far has been over one hundred and forty K so at least we're getting something consistent did also get a master clue but I'm gonna hold that for my loot from one hundred masters which you guys will hopefully see in the future far future I did actually get a mimic chests as well which is the second time that I've gotten this on this account and I was rewarded with unfortunately no third H but an extra six hundred death runes that really helped out that clue and looking at all of the other caskets you know I did manage to get a Ranger's tunic leg which was like six hundred K as well as a fancy red hat which was about two hundred and fifty K definitely made just about three mil total from all those clues scrolls that we did open so that wasn't too bad I mean that will obviously help kind of take care of the supply costs at least a little bit so thirty six point five mil in serac nice loot another three to four mil and clue scroll loot and twelve mil spent on supplies overall averaging just about thirty five to forty kills per hour not sure this is the most profitable boss in the world especially depending on what weapon you use but it is pretty simple it does come with a pet and it's different so needless to say I did enjoy this at times not the whole time but at some times and now it is time to see if anyone guessed close to the overall number thirty-six point five million let's go check out the comments section alright so I had a fast-forward this next part cuz 2600 comments was quite a bit but thanks to ctrl F I can tell you guys that there were six people who were close Ryan V Travis Ben justin Kim we dem boys are K and the wolf you guys were all pretty close you all guessed around thirty six point five mil closest one who actually got it was a guy named Travis Ben he guessed just about five point eight K away and the person who was in second was the wolf who guessed 6 K away so the winner of the three months of membership is Travis Ben congratulations you will be contacted shortly and yeah guys I really do appreciate you watching the video I'll see if I can't do that more in the future with some different price checks but until next time guys thank you so much for your continued support I will see you in a few days with the new upload until then mr. no sleep out
