now look everybody just calm down there's no need to be scared of tech news you just have to stand up straight look it right in the eyes and show it who's the Alpha you gotta show it who's the Alpha well no wait I'm not the Alpha after they were already leaked to the moon and back Samsung finally took the wraps off their newest flagship phones the Galaxy Note 10 and 10 plus starting at 9:49 and 1099 respectively both phones are powered by the seven nanometer Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 rather than the Exynos 9825 that Samsung just announced for some reason maybe Qualcomm was like holding them hostage with patent lawsuits or something I don't know but here's the rundown the note plus gets a few bonuses other than its slightly larger nearly bezel a six point eight inch display including 45 watts super fast charging over USB type-c 12 watt wireless charging 12 gigs of RAM and a slightly larger 4300 milliamp hour battery Samsung apparently did go through with their stupid decision to remove the headphone jack and I'm gonna get right back to crying about that after we finished filming the camera has some interesting new AR features including the ability to scan physical objects to create a 3d model and AR doodles which is kind of like Google's tilt brush VR but in a phone app and the S Pen now has gyro sensors to go along with its wireless charging and stuff so you can use motion controls with your camera remotely in addition to just using the pen as a shutter button like we used to be able to do back in the old days samsung also talked about the galaxy watch active to the tab s6 and the snapdragon 855 powered windows 10 running galaxy book s but frankly those are all far less interesting and I'm done talking about them now nope I'm done I'm done toshiba has unveiled a new form factor for nvme SSDs called XFM Express it's like radio but not like radio at all it's actually a more like an SD card than it is like radio but unlike a microSD card these new SSD will not be hot swappable instead they're gonna have a specialized mount with a metal cover which can only be accessed by opening up the system that the card is installed in so these XFM Express cards could theoretically have a band width of up to four gigabytes per second with the next-gen units expected to reach eight gigabytes per second so that looks pretty cool but I seeing as toshiba is rebranding their storage division to kkeok sia this fall they might want to take a second look at the name of the cards because I look at it and I just see like X F NX f NX no yeah Radio turns out putting internet connectivity and every do hookie that we own from lamps to baby toys might not have been the best idea Microsoft says that they have detected attacks on common Internet of Things devices like printers and office phones by hackers that are allegedly working for the Russian government according to officials from the Microsoft threat intelligence center the hackers apparently are using these IOT devices as an initial point of ingress from which they can attempt to gain further access to other devices on the network oh the joke's on them because I've got all my stupid IOT devices segregated on their own network and I'm just gonna disconnect it from the internet as soon as they break in there and then they'll be stuck they'll be stuck inside my IOT network yeah it's like it's like a special hell of baby monitors and doorbells now it's time for the quark both their products Adam on through the link below Clark bar set sounds nasty intel has released a bunch of details about their 14 nanometer Cooper Lake server processors which will have models with up to apparently 56 cores now that was also true of its predecessor cascade Lake ap but whereas those processors were soldered to the motherboard Cooper Lake will be socketed and will even be able to accommodate future ten nanometer ice Lake processors on its LGA 4198 socket when they launched it in 2020 I wish I could say that AMD was shaking in their epic boots but they don't we're but I've never seen dr. su wear boots and if she did wear boots I'm sure they'd be made for walkin and that's just what they do watch out SpaceX has gotten a lot of praise for landing and reusing their rockets so another spaceflight company rocket lab is apparently gonna try their hand at it I'll be it with a slightly different approach as the startups rocket re-enters the atmosphere it will deploy a parachute which will then be hooked by a helicopter that comes out to meet it the chopper will then return with its low present and yeah that's a little jig here but you know what I say whatever we got to do to make our way to building a real Millennium Falcon you know so stepping-stones couple more years and oh wait really another spectreville durability is not what you should say because apparently Microsoft already patched it one year ago BitDefender identified and reported a serious flaw in all Intel CPUs since 2012 and now that the flaw has been patched they are announcing it to the public so if your Windows PC got the July security update you're protected and the vulnerability is apparently unfeasible to exploit on other operating systems plus you know max don't get viruses so Nintendo reportedly isn't stopping at the switch light or the rumored switch Pro according to The Wall Street Journal the company is planning even more switch models down the road I think they're gonna call them switchbacks because it's down a road you don't worry about it these future switches may come with sharp XO displays featuring resolutions higher than 1080p and we can only hope that they come with some exciting new code names as well like switch heavy switch extreme the mega switch and in a games industry infected with mystery loot boxes Nintendo Sony and Microsoft have announced in partnership with the ESA that they will now require games to disclose the probabilities of obtaining randomized items from such boxes the rules are expected to be implemented in 2020 and rocket league developer psyonix which is now owned by Epic Games has gone one further saying they will face out mystery crates completely by the end of the year there's hope you love rocket League there's hope for the system why did you want to burn the whole thing down and it's time to burn down this episode of tech linked because it's over buy a shirt subscribe come back on Friday so you don't miss any tech news how else will you hear about your tech news but they have blogs written articles that still exists you mean where I like just have a nap wait
