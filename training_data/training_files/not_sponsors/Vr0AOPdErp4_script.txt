battle lines for the iPhone iPad and Android devices so what I want to do here is have a discussion about the various cosmic entities of the onew all different mobile prime universe starting with colitis and what I'm hoping is that at the end of all this you'll have a strong understanding of his character relative to the number of issues that we have as well as how his involvement in the new universe actually helps us to understand how things relate to the pre secret wars universe so the all-new all-different Galactus comes to us as part of Al Ewing's all-new all-different Ultimates and while I will have a video on that team as part of a lead-up to Civil War to what Al Ewing does here is actually really interesting to sidetrack for a second when Galactus first debuted in the original Marvel Universe well he wasn't provided an origin in his first few appearances the explanation of his existence came by way of Thor vol 1 issues 168 through 170 originally established as being a universal Explorer named gallon in the earth Co continuity at the end of that universes life Galactus remained the sole survivor merging with that reality's version of eternity during this birthing process Galactus had fashioned a vessel for himself allowing an incubation period of several million years where he gathered his energies constructed a suit to contain those energies and emerged as a Galactus that we all know and love consuming planets to sustain his life now all the reasons for Galactus being a cosmic necessity have changed over the years ranging from a meta commentary on his representation of life death and rebirth as well as a physical force whose death unleashed Abraxas who threatened the multiverse on the whole a Ewing does not actually provide us with an expansive origin and the Marvel prime universe while there are different explanations that could be offered for this and truth I would surmise that with Galactus being such a well-known character even if his origin is only slightly understood by casual readers it's still understood and so the information provided actually just gives us a one-page synopsis sticking with a classic story of Galactus hailing from the earth zero continuity and that said because the Ultimates exist to in threat to the universe but to also boost an anticipation for the start of the series the first being encountered by The Ultimates came in the form of Galactus taking place in issues number one and number two in November in December of 2015 as the official launch title and a self contained story what we're told is that from the perspective of blue Marvel and black panther Galactus is hunger is not a requirement for him instead this is a byproduct of the incubation period meaning this process could be reversed now somebody take note of here is that al Ewing is taking certain liberties and that as far as I'm aware the hunger of Galactus is an intrinsic part of his character and no one had ever created a story where his hunger was depicted as something that could be cured the only exception to this that I can think of came in the first six issues of the 2003 Thanos solo series by jim Starlin which depicted Galactus as hunger as a multiversal entity working through Galactus and attempting to consume realities however because this story arch stretched the limits of credulity even by comic standards fans don't generally consider it to be canon or in existence now in terms of The Ultimates after putting their efforts together black panther and blue Marvel reasoned that if Galactus is hunger emerged following his time in the incubation chamber the hunger could be reversed by forcing Galactus back into the chamber to this end the Ultimates BACtrack Galactus his time as a devourer of worlds eventually arriving at our key Opia the first planet Galactus it consumed after emerging scavenging the dead world and reconstructing the incubation chamber the entirety of the alter including Carol Danvers Monica Rambeau America Chavez and Black Panther combined their powers in an effort to force Galactus back into his chamber emerging as a life bringer at the conclusion of issue number 2 valuing established that instead of consuming worlds and ending life Galactus now functions as the source of life creating and healing worlds he had previously consumed beginning with our key obeah following this and going into the next five titles leading up to issue number seven as the most current release the Ultimates line served to provide to plot the first following the Ultimates themselves and leading into civil war two for the second following Galactus and an explanation of the all-new all-different marvel prime universe picking up an issue number four following the Ultimates attempts to understand the space-time continuum in the post secret wars continuity the likeness himself was contacted by eternity who advised of the ultimate actions and that they could not proceed visiting the team amidst their journey into the previous realm of the beyonders which now exists as a void of nothingness al Ewing begins the first steps of referencing the pre secret wars universe where Carol Danvers offers the explanation that the team sought to understand the space-time continuum Galactus provides her with a glimpse of how he sees time establishing that were model had never officially provided an answer the fact remains that secret wars was not a reboot instead the events that took place in the earth-616 universe still happened but secret wars allow for reshuffling of characters in realities this comes with the fact that as Galactus shows us the death of the original Captain Marvel the Iron Man armor Wars and the onslaught saga are memories that he still maintains at the same time he also makes reference to Marvel sliding time scale and the idea of retcons to sidetrack with marvel's publications it was standard practice for them to include dates and references to presidents throughout the 1960s and 1970s but with the 1980 seeing their final reference to a concrete period in the real world from that point going forward all absolute dates of reference were eliminated what this meant was that instead of saying Civil War happened in a certain year and during a certain month instead the event would take place with future stories referencing it as a year or three years ago as a result between 1984 and the current day everything within marvel comic's is assumed to have taken place within a 10-year window in addition to this Galactus states that the past is never concrete and then it can always be changed now this is really more of a meta commentary on retroactive continuities and the idea that various writers will alter the history of models past in order to suit an existing story or to introduce a character as an example within the Marvel Universe itself blue Marvel did not exist until 2009 when Kevin Bravo had created him and altered the history of Marvel to establish that Adam Brashear was Marvel's first black superhero now while I do have a video explaining these concepts in more detail for those who still find them a little confusing with a Galactus forcing the heroes to sleep and returning them to the main universe he's called before eternity who reveals that he's being kept in Chains and was placed in this position by an unknown being now something actually want to do here is I want to step away from this for a minute and I want to have a discussion on the role of eternity in the new Marvel prime universe within the old universe eternity existed as a singular being and a physical manifestation of each universe that existed however because doom had created battleworld during Secret Wars while the planet was composed of different realities instead of battleworld having a version of eternity for each territory the whole of battleworld combined to allow for singular entity who was kept under the control of dues power now this is particularly important due to the fact that the fan community was largely split over the idea of a multiversal version of eternity existing under the Living Tribunal and serving to represent the multiverse itself holding it all together while the idea of a multiverse eternity was alluded to but never really confirmed prior to and during Secret Wars with Al Ewing's Ultimates his information reveals that after the destruction of battle world and the creation of the multiverse by Owen Reese Franklin Richards and Reed Richards a multiverse whole eternity came into existence holding the multiverse together under the New Living Tribunal and spawning the cosmic entities and so with a multiverse itself in Chains Galactus was tasked with discovering who it was it did this and how to restore things to normal picking up with issue number six where Galactus continues his quest as it was assigned by eternity during his travels he encounters master order and Lord chaos as the representations of order and chaos work against one another and maintain universal balance through their conflict because galactus had previously been known as the world devourer to the mind of lord chaos Galactus represented destruction and catastrophe but for master order the destruction of Galactus was part of the cosmic order allowing for the death of planets and the balance of the universal population and but because he has vacated that role and stepped into the position of the life bringer Lord chaos is no longer satisfied due to Galactus failing to inflict destruction the master order is unsatisfied due to Galactus stepping away from the status quo to this end the entities transported Galactus to the SuperFlow which existed as a space between realities with the intention of forcing the lactis back into his position and however because master order and Lord chaos exists in such rigid forms with Galactus maintaining free will the two entities are completely overpowered and forced to retrieve after which Galactus is brought before Owen Reese the molecule man now for this bit of the discussion what we have previously engaged in a bit of meta commentary the conversation between Galactus and Owen Reese is extremely important due to the fact that molecule man will actually address the reader base directly and the community's view of the all-new all-different universe while molecule man gets extremely wordy and goes as far as to use a modified version of the Schrodinger's cat thought experiment the long and short of this is that molecule man addresses the issue of model existing in a state of flux to sidetrack here the thought experiment of Schrodinger's cat is a concept in quantum mechanics offering the idea that if an unobserved action occurs any and all possibilities of that action are available however once that observation occurs an absolute answer is provided and the question is definitively answered while this may seem a little confusing to simplify things molecule man is saying that the problem with the current universe is that it was rebooted but it wasn't rebooted furthermore there are some beings within the universe who do not remember the events of the multiversal collapse and seeker wars but there are also some who do as a result there are those who believed that the multiverse did collapse and was recreated but there are also those that don't and what al Ewing is doing here is offering a statement to us and Marvel saying that you can't have it both ways you can't shuffle some characters around introduce new teams and our conflicting memories all while calling it a reboot if you haven't actually rebooted anything either it's a reboot or it's not what I want to do here is I want to talk about The Ultimates more specifically this second storyline basically focuses on two aspects it focuses on the return of Thanos and it focuses on Galactus creating a new Herald and so I'm still not sure which one of those titles I'm gonna pitch but the idea here is that for those of you guys who don't know with Marvel Comics The Ultimates are like this this multiversal group they're like the avengers on a much grander scale now The Ultimates don't exist in the multiverse it's not like you know the members hail from different universes and the Marvel multiverse they all hail from the earth-616 universe but the idea behind this is to have them face threats from across the multiverse that threatened the main Marvel earth-616 reality the issue with this is that there there is much a defensive measure as they are an exploratory team and so the goal here is to to basically face off against threats that most people can't deal with that's one of the reasons why we have such powerhouse characters that's what we have Carol Danvers that's why we have the intelligence of Black Panther that's why we have Adam Brashear we have spectrum we have America Chavez we have some really really powerful beings here and the idea is that again they're designed to step up against multiversal threats now we had talked in my video about the all-new all-different Galactus that their first task was to basically eliminate the hunger of Galactus due to the fact that by Galactus traveling around the universe and consuming worlds that he and of himself was destructive the issue with this is that a Ewing I imagine would have in some form or fashion whether he knew about it through a retcon or whether he somebody just didn't know about it or didn't care it begs the question how do the Celestials fit into this because those are guys who don't know in Marvel Comics Celestials quite literally plant eggs in worlds and they will emerge after some million years or however long it is but Galactus running around and consuming worlds is just as much a safeguard for the universe as it is for him consuming his own hunger because if he wasn't consuming worlds then it would result in these and Celestials running rampant throughout the cosmos so the idea is is to basically keep things from going insane and having said that because this second volume is part of the civil war too event one of the interesting things about this is that the tie-ins they're a little lackluster but it's also a good way that Marvel has done it instead of tying them directly into Civil War two which would mean no that we will basically have to hold off all the volumes until Civil War 2 comes out instead they basically just reference the events of Civil War 2 but things are still going on in their individual stories and so in truth the Civil War to tie ends are really standalone stories you don't really have to read the main Civil War 2 story in order to read the the second volume of all these different publications x-23 and Avengers and so on and so forth it can't hurt you know to read civil war 2 as it goes on but it's not a requirement and so what ultimate what this second issue does or I guess the second run does is it initially picks up with a character called the infinite now we don't really know anything about this guy but what al Ewing does is he initially jumps back to 1998 with Adam Brashear working alongside as his son Kevin now Adam Fisher of course we know is a genius-level scientist his intelligence isn't necessarily up there with black panther but he's not that far off and so his son Kevin had very much followed his footsteps in terms of pursuing you know these paths of science and now the result was that it seemed to be these these incursions or these many a temporal wakes that resulted in some being trying to enter the Marvel earth-616 continuity and so because this has been going on for decades I don't brush here alongside of son had been working to try to prevent this from happening now the other half of this though is that an embrasure son Kevin had at one point vanished which is one of the reasons why we hadn't seen him for so long during the early issues of his run in Marvel Comics with Mighty Avengers and so on and so forth he was eventually brought back but he wasn't he didn't quite operate in the same capacity that he did in this but again this is really just a Ewing setting things up but because of the fact that this highs into Civil War to the main event itself focuses on a character named Ulysses who is an inhuman with the ability to predict the future now as we discussed in my Steve Rogers Captain America video these predictions are not 100% accurate but they're close enough that Carol Danvers is willing to gamble on the accuracy of these in order to basically stop crimes before they happen or to stop incidents before they happen now because of the arrival of Ulysses it's to turn the tables on how it is an Adam Beshear views these temporal risks with regards to this info not trying to come through but previously it seemed like it was a threat instead and Anna Brashear begins to look at it as the very basis behind the Ultimates charter in the sense that their exploratory their investigators their problem solvers and so with the initial idea here is that this machine is being developed with a combination of the ultimate steam as a whole in order to stop this danger Adam Brashear realizes that it's actually to figure things out and so what happens is that when this rift opens up they basically reach out to this humanoid being to the infinite and they bring him in and Adam Brashear states to everybody that the case with this is that he's basically just a scientist as a scientist from another universe that was exploring the multiverse and the Ultimates can learn just as much from infinite as infinite can learn from them and so because of this is really not a danger but it falls in line with the ideology of The Ultimates in terms of looking at problems and trying to get them figured out finding solutions as over here we jump to Connor Sims now for those of you guys who have seen my video on atom brashears character with his first appearance as it was written by Kevin Griffo the experiment that gave Adam Breshears powers also gave Connor sims's powers the difference here is that for all intents and purposes when it comes to just sheer raw power Connor Sims is pretty far beyond Adam Brashear Connor Sims has the ability to manipulate antimatter which is the opposite of normal matter but it still allows him the ability to manipulate atoms on a subatomic scale and so he's basically a character who can warp reality the issue with this is that counter Sims was eventually what or at least was initially believed to have been destroyed during atom brashears first encounter I guess the the story the final encounter with him but it wasn't until a Ewing came back and wrote The Ultimates that he revealed that Connor Sims was alive he was just out in space somewhere and no one knew about it but Connor Sims himself didn't really know what was going on now the reason seemed to be based on the idea of seeker wars when Reed Richards had restored the multiverse that Connor Sims memories were wiped but then we learned that Connor Sims did remember everything he remembered all the things that he had done but he had also come to a realization and the realization he had come to was that eternity had been chained at some cosmic force out there which seems to be more powerful than eternity had chained all of reality or chained the universe itself and the idea of Connor symbols that it had driven him insane by knowing this or at least not traditionally insane but in a driven him to the brink of madness in the sense of his mind couldn't quite grasp it because he had come to the realization there's a being out there of such incredible power and it's not a being that's kind it's a being that is dangerous it's a being that seems to be evil and so because Connor Sims doesn't see the world the same way people do the thing that we normally do because he sees the world and atomic particles he sees the world in terms of its molecular structure and matter and energy and so on and so forth he basically came to the realization that there's like a giant barrier around the universe that they can't get out of and so someone is basically turned the Marvel earth-616 universe into a giant prison and he's trying to figure out a way to get out but he's also overwhelmed by this and so what happens is that while he is you know being held at confinement of his own free will due to the fact that he's afraid of his power sort of just breaking loose in an unbridled fashion he's immediately met by the arrival of Thanos now the other half of this is that in the events leading up to civil war to Thanos had attacked the planet Earth in pursuit of the Cosmic Cube that had been created by shield which is what led to Avengers standoff and the recreation of Steve Rogers past again we have that in my video on on Captain America Steve Rogers but Thanos had been captured by a combination of the Avengers and The Ultimates and had been held prisoner under the Ultimates base of operations which is called the Triskelion and so because of this when Connor Sims had arrived and Thanos had come to the realization of just how powerful Connor Sims is he began to devise a plan to basically manipulate Connor Sims and not only freeing him but then turning hunter Sims into a puppet for his own goals and so while Connor Sims is dealing with his own you know emotions and the overwhelming nature of what's happening with things Santos appears to him and begins manipulating him now this is when al Ewing starts to incorporate a lot of things in terms of what's going on with Thanos right now because all we really had with his reimburses was that he was just there he was looking for a cosmic cube he was defeated he had killed James Rhodes he had injured she hook and then he was taken prisoner and that was it we didn't really have anything to go on here we knew that because of the fact that mistress death had barred him from the realm of death it basically made him effectively immortal that when the restoration of the multiverse happened by Reed Richards at the end of secret Wars that he was just thrown outside of all reality he was thrown into the realm of nothingness basically and that's when he really didn't really know anything else besides that and so what this did is this turned into a question of what happens next what happens with Thanos now and this is what we get Thanos basically says that over the course of his life he had fallen in love with mistress death that was that was his big claim to fame that was his huge staple before Secret Wars it was his pursuit of the affections of mistress death it's why he gained the Infinity Gauntlet and wiped out half the life in the universe that's why he pursued the Cosmic Cube is what he did all these things because he wanted the affections of mistress death the other half of this was that when he was outside of the multiverse he basically fell in love with a what it seems to be an entity called nothingness now we know virtually nothing about this I mean we don't know if nothingness is even an entity or if it's just the idea that Thanos has just fallen to the point where he's just in love with the idea of destroying all things in existence we have no idea what direction Al Ewing is going with this but basically Ewing has taken Thanos and removed him from his love with mistress death and so while this is going on all these go to encounter Sims we ended up finding that the ultimate in and of themselves are fighting one another and the reason why is because with Ulysses predicting that a briefcase the contents of a briefcase was going to lead to a massive amount of destruction that Carol Danvers had organized the Ultimates and pursuing a woman named Alison green now this is basically Al Ewing or at least it seems to be al you ain't telling us that Connor Sims is not always right and the reason why is because while there's some disagreement while the soldiers of Carol Danvers are a little more harsh than they need to be and it creates a little bit of rivalry between the Ultimates themselves when they get the briefcase back and they open it up they realize there's nothing there and this just creates a huge amount of backlash in the team it really leads like the destruction of the team in traditional means because of the fact that no one agrees Carol Danvers says hey look like we're trying to stop crimes yes they haven't done anything now but a guy who says he could see the future and he's been accurate so far so it means that if he says they're going to do something then they're likely going to now what's interesting about this and this is one of the reasons why like a lot of fans at the moment hate Carol Danvers because in the face of a briefcase that's empty in the face of the fact that Ulysses was wrong she refuses to accept that she simply just says no no he's right it's just you know he was talking about a different briefcases all it was he was talking about something else but he's been right 90% of the time and so even if he's wrong 10% of the time it's better to lock up innocent people than to let guilty people go free and that's basically what she's saying here that's the cases she's making that yes innocent people will go to jail but it's a lesser of two evils it's worth the risk and so because of this Wallace thanos is quite literally showing all this infighting to counter sims because connor sims is of such a mind right now because of the things that he's done he's convinced that no one will believe him and Thanos feeds on that he says look I mean they're fighting amongst themselves they can't even agree on how to save the world what makes you think they're going to agree that you're telling the truth about eternity being confined in Chains you know and so Connor Sims again is a little unsure about a situation but he says Santos is the only way for them to know the truth it's for you to show them the truth and so what happens is he basically escapes from his cell and he allows his power to just explode not in the sense of you know of maximum capacity if he did that he would probably destroy the universe but he allows his power to explode to an extent that it basically overrides the energies of the Triskelion basically shutting it down all the reason why he does this is because this cell that he's confined in was designed explicitly to keep his powers in check the issue with this is that no one knew how powerful he was when Adam Brashear had faced off against an T man he had an idea of how powerful he was but he was really fighting an T man on the atomic level as opposed to fighting him on the level of power that he possessed and so because of this we didn't know what it was that he was capable of and with an embrasure not knowing the full extent of Connor Sims powers it came to fruition that counter Sims just broke out of his cell and so because of the fact that he broke out of his cell because of the fact that the confinements of Thanos were no longer powered he was able to break out of his containment unit and basically start wreaking havoc within the Tris kinda this is one of the best parts of the whole story this is amazing because this is classic Thanos I mean when people think of Thanos this is what they think of Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet school Thanos with you of cosmic qubit school the best Thanos is Thanos when he's cornered is when he when he basically has to fight his way out that's the best Thanos not only because of the fact that he's so capable in terms of his abilities but because of the fact that he is he's ruthless and he's intelligent and so again he basically begins to tell us here or at least when the ultimate show up he goads Connor Sims now a couple things to point out here is that the powers of the ultimate complement one another what I mean by this is that at one point in the history of her character a Carol Danvers went by the name of binary whereby she was able to absorb cosmic energies or absorb any kind of energy and then channel those back out as cosmic energies now in truth this was just Chris Claremont's way of trying to reinvent her character Thoreau on the x-men team and hope it would boost her popularity it really didn't hurt her comics were just routinely canceled and what we're seeing right now with all-new all-different marvel is about a successful as she's been since her run and Marvel now where she officially became Captain Marvel but before that she really was not a very successful character people knew who she was but she couldn't hold a title to save her life and so what ultimately happens here is Adam Brashear uses his energies to manipulate positive matter channels them into Carol Danvers and she basically now has cosmic level powers the kicker about this is that it doesn't matter with a nose Thanos is still able to take her out not only that she's able to use her energies to channel them into spectrum in order to allow spectrum who is basically living energy to go into the mind of Thanos and try to override his - it was a little bit like a chain reaction Adam Brashear feeds Carol Danvers who in turn feeds spectrum but when spectrum enters the mind of Thanos she realizes that his mental energies are way too much for her to be able to cope with they're beyond a level she can even begin to comprehend and that's true this character oh you ain't snot retconning anything here it's always been that way Thanos his mental energies his mental powers you know not necessarily telepathy different things like that but just the abilities he's capable of by using his mind have always been his greatest feat his intelligence so on and so forth when spectrum goes into his mind she's literally overwhelmed and he in turn takes the energy that was being pushed into him by spectrum and sends that energy back out and shoots it at Adam Brashear so it's like this giant circle you know Adam Brashear charges Carol Danvers who charges spectrum who forces her energy zonda Thanos who in turn takes those energies and shoots Adam Brashear now the reason why this is an important thing when it comes to Thanos is because he always is at the top of his game when it comes to battle and so because of the fact that he realized that Adam Bashir was the one who is making all of this possible in the first place taking him out means that Carol Danvers would not be in her position of binary and it also means that spectrum wouldn't be nearly as powerful now the funny thing about all this is that T'Challa is watching all this unfold now in terms of his intelligence T'Challa is pretty smart and I would say he's probably smarter than tano's just because of the fact that when it comes to the top you know five smartest people in the Marvel Universe Thanos ranks it like number six or number seven while Panther is in the top three as far as I'm aware so because of this Black Panthers just kind of watching things unfold but even while The Ultimates are doing the best they can to face off against him danos is just trashing him he's trashing them all one by one and this just shows you how capable he is that he's going against America Chavez who can open portals she can feed off energy he's going toe to toe with Adam Brashear who's literally a guy that can manipulate particles you know he's going against Carol Danvers who striketh is on par with the Incredible Hulk in arrested form I mean he's going against everybody and doing his own and so because of the fact that the charla is so intelligent he comes to the realization that they can't fight Thanos with brute force there's no way they're going to stand a chance if Thanos can stand toe-to-toe with the Incredible Hulk they can't beat him and so the only way to defeat him is to use their minds to use their wits and do the best they can and so what happens here is they basically shut off access to his mind they more or less use a mental projection or a user use mental energies the kind of energies that were designed to keep Connor Sims contained and they in turn project those mental energies and Athan owes and quite literally sever the I guess electronic synopses they basically shut off his brain's ability to function is essentially what they do now under normal circumstances in T'Challa tells us this under normal circumstances shutting off the brain of Thanos would have killed him but as we know he's been barred from the realm of mistress death and so he's basically just in a catatonic state now this is al Ewing saving Thanos this is basically him just saying hey we're going to use him later on we're not gonna remove this piece from the chessboard yet because he's too good you know he's not necessarily the queen but he's certainly a bishop or a rook and so we're not going to remove him yet because he's a guy that we need to use later on now this will probably feed into some massive crossover event because as most any Marvel fan will tell you for those of you guys who were new as most any veteran Marvel comic fan will tell you if there's any one person in the cosmos to have on your team when it comes to matters of intelligence Thanos is one of the guys that you want in your corner I mean you know perfect case scenario you've got Thanos and Galactus and all the cosmic entities you know but if I had to pick one Thanos would be my guy just because of his experience because of what he's capable of and so because of this you know the The Ultimates initially go back to bickering with one another they go back to arguing with one another but following Thanos attacking The Ultimates Roo prior to him attacking the ultimate Connor Sims had just taken off and so we didn't really know where he had went to we didn't really know what had happened with him but then what we do is we transition to him as things begin to wrap up and we find that he had just kind of traveled into deep space and he's taking some time to think about everything that's going on but he's also overwhelmed by the gravity of things because in the mind of Connor Sims civil war 2 is happening the superheroes are fighting on planet Earth because some inhuman can see the future but for him he's like there's much bigger things to worry about like there is a threat out there to the universe likely even to the multiverse and so it was like why are you fighting over this this is more or less the civil war - equivalent to annihilation from Civil War 1 and what I mean by that is those two guys who don't know while the Civil War one event was taking place with Captain America and Tony Stark fighting one another the villain Annihilus had discovered the negative zones equivalent of the power cosmic the energy that Galactus wields and Annihilus had invaded the earth-616 universe and was literally petting a swath through the universe I mean just wiping out planet after planet this is wiping out life all over the place it was really like guerrilla warfare tactics it was last battle at the Alamo it was the the various cosmic forces doing the best they could to just survive and the heroes on earth were fighting about superhuman Registration that's basically what's happening with this story right now or at least that's what al Ewing seems to be leading up to that's one reason why I love the ultimate so much because it's a huge cosmic event that's going on out here while they're just fighting about civil war - it's really setting the landscape for much bigger things and so as it begins to fall through these dimensional doorways he begins to recall on things this question is what happened here what being exists out there that possesses such incredible power that they're able to completely take over and to chain the universe itself because in the mind of Connor Sims with his experience throughout the multiverse his experience traveling outside of all space and time the only people capable of doing this are like The Living Tribunal and the one above all but apparently not apparently somebody else is able to do that we know it's not the molecule man Owen Reese or at least a business seemed to be that way but as he continues to fall down through things because his power is on such an extreme degree if there was anyone that could face off against this multiversal being that's capable of attaining eternity it would probably be Connor Sims but Connor Sims going outside and battling this this entity would Polynesia in the destruction of the multiverse not only that galactus was tasked by eternity to make sure no one knew what was going on now why attorney who did that we don't know and so in response to Connor Sims falling through you know these dimensional barriers and falling outside of all existence Galactus retrieves him and Galactus transforms him into his new Herald not only that what he also says is go get the Ultimates go find me the Ultimates because I'm going to make them heralds as well and this is basically just Galactus building an army for himself using his power cosmic is him creating what looks like it's going to be six different heralds for the purpose of leading a campaign against whatever this multiverse allure this omnipotent being happens to be that managed to chain up eternity okay so I absolutely love Ultimates like it's it's I think really one of the standout titles and all-new all-different marvel and Marvel now 2.0 the sad thing is that like not a lot of people know about it or they don't know what's going on in it and so because of that they're just like missing out on this amazing stuff so I'm really hoping this video will serve the purpose of letting you guys know what's going on and you guys will go out and buy it because it is an awesome title so for those of the guys who were curious about like cosmic Marvel about like eternity and Galactus and all that kind of stuff this takes care of all that Ultimates covers all that we've covered all the ultimate stuff up to this point but it covers all that but the big question that people have had is who chained eternity that was the big question we saw in all-new all-different Ultimates that somebody had basically put eternity the living embodiment of the multiverse in Chains now what Al Ewing is doing here is actually offered a little bit of a change with regards to the Eternity concept and we'll get to that once we get further into this video because what we're basically going to get is the origin of everything that's ever existed in Marvel Comics from the time the very first universe took form up until the collapse of the multiverse now and what not really what happened but in terms of some of the history of the various different multiverses that have existed in between so it'll all make sense by the time we get to it I won't be confusing in any way but the idea here is that we initially pick up with Adam Brashear with blue Marvel officially it is kind of like you know staring into and trying to figure out what's going on with everything because remember the Ultimates basically disbanded during the events of civil war - when carol danvers was using the ultimate as a way to basically carry out her goal of keeping crime from happening before it happened of course you list these and all that kind of good stuff but because of the fact that a lot of people hated civil war - but what a ewing ended up doing was basically bringing the ultimates back together to answer the question of who chained eternity and it was only when the Ultimates had learned this had happened they began to ask the question of what was going on now from this point we transition over to over to Monica Rambeau and the funny thing about Monica Rambeau is spectrum is that historically she's played a lot of different roles I mean she's been captain universe I believe I want to say she was Captain Marvel at one point um but the whole idea here often she was captain universe I think she was just Captain Marvel um I think it was on confusing her with the girl from Hickman's Avengers of New Avengers the random chick who was in a car wreck and and suddenly saved by the Cynthia's of the universe and became Captain universe well cover that next year but Monica Rambeau is played Captain Marvel for a time and and the whole idea is that she was always kind of considered to be a throwaway character by a lot of readers in the sense that she never really received her time in the Sun and the cool thing about this is that she actually gets it because what al Ewing has really been harping on with her character is how powerful she is that she is in effect pure energy that the physical body that we see is not her true form that Adam Brashear looks at her and sees her for what she really is which is basically just pure energy in the form of a human meaning she can basically do anything now we kind of knew that with her character to a degree in a sense because she was able to manipulate all facets of the energy spectrum she could turn into anything any form of energy she could use any form of energy that kind of thing but I mean she can't like warp reality on a universal scale like she can't manipulate molecules or anything like that she's effectively just a giant battery and so it's really really cool to see what kind of limits her powers can be pushed to but again in the midst of all this what is it up happening is Monica's basically just kind of whisked away and all of it seems to have been done by Connor Sims now again Connor Sims as we know him is basically an T man of course we covered him during the the origin story of blue Marvel but he had since been turned into a Herald of Galactus and the reason why was because Galactus realizing that eternity had been chained but not knowing who it was that did it basically said if there is a being out there that can chain eternity then I need a new Herald and that Herald is going to go to the ultimate breathe to me and make them my heralds and so the idea of Galactus was to use the ultimate asses heralds essentially functioning as protectors of the universe the way it existed now and that's exactly what happens the various Ultimates are basically whisked away by Connor Sims to a Galactus ship tattoo and they're met with America Chavez who basically says look there is a mass of a massive threat coming and we have to find a way to deal with this now America Chavez is one of these characters who's only ever really as interesting as a story that she's in she's not inherently interesting by herself we know this because ultimate like America number one came out sold really well and then America number two tanked so she's just not really an interesting character but for what she does here in the ultimate this makes her interesting and that's what I say and Marvel Comics a lot of the characters are not inherently intriguing it's the events surrounding them that make them intriguing for example Captain universe is not an intriguing character but it's Hickman's Avengers and New Avengers that make make a Captain universe intriguing the same thing with star brand and night masks and a lot of those characters it's the events going on around them that make them interesting as opposed to just the characters themselves now of course America Chavez being here is basically saying there's something wrong with the multiverse there's some threat out there in the multiverse that's screwing everything up and we are going to have to try to find a way to essentially fix it now of course the other half of this is that a Galactus encounter Sims basically take off and they actually end up meeting directly with a lady tribunal and master order in Lord Chaos now the reason why this happens is because of the fact that we'd seen this before in the previous discussion of that the previous videos that we've done that the first problem the ultimate solved is basically solving all the problems in the universe the first proud a major problem they solved was Galactus they looked at Galactus and they said him being the devourer of worlds is a threat to all life in existence what we're going to do is we're basically going to evolve him into his perfect form and make him the life bringer now the reason why Galactus being made the life bringer was such a huge deal in terms of the contents of this story is that from the perspective of master order and Lord chaos they represent opposing size right I mean we've had this discussion countless times and we'll have this discussion again when we basically remaster Infinity Gauntlet and when we do infinity war and all that cosmic stuff next year the whole idea is that the universe is basically in balance there is order and there's chaos and you can't have one without the other a perfectly ordered universe would look crazy a perfect the chaotic universe would look just as crazy jim Starlin showed us those two things when we basically went inside the minds of Thanos and Adam warlock to see a perfect universe in Adam warlocks mind and a chaotic universe and Thanos is mine so because of this they basically work in unison the issue here is that in the mind in the perspective of master order and Lord chaos Galactus is supposed to be the devourer of worlds that's his role in the universe that's the role that he plays in the same way that master order are an order and Lord chaos play the role of two opposites with the in-betweener being the reconciliation between order and chaos in the same way that eternity plays the role of being the living embodiment of the universe and so on Galactus is supposed to play the role of the world of our now because of the fact that he's not doing this they end up invoking the Living Tribunal because remember the Living Tribunal is basically the judge whenever there's a cosmic disagreement the Living Tribunal is invoked and the tribunal will determine whether or not the actions of a being is are basically in violation of cosmic order which is to say if there were a being that were nigh uncatchable would say this person is not part of the cosmic order they're an aberration they're a screw up that was the whole thing with a character a protege who basically copied the powers of everybody that he saw and it made him Bert virtually godlike to the point that even protege was able to go again go toe-to-toe with the Living Tribunal and so the idea here is to basically have Galactus on trial and say Galactus is supposed to be the devourer of worlds if he's not doing this he's not part of the cosmic order he's not maintaining his rule he's going against cosmic law ultimately the Living Tribunal says no if this is going to be the case with Galactus then this is basically his perfect iteration this is his perfect form he has moved in the direction moved into his next stage of evolution he's not violating any laws now the issue that's made with this is that the Living Tribunal also establishes that because of the fact that the all-new all-different marvel universe and even multiverse is still new that the cosmic law is still being made the hierarchy is still being constructed so for those of you guys who are asking for a new hierarchy for all-new all-different marvel a new cosmic and power hierarchy we can't do that yet because we don't know what the hierarchy is and this plays out when master order and Lord Kaos kill the Living Tribunal now again because of the fact that they kill the tribunal and essentially take his place what they do in turn is they on and say we are going to impose our will we're going to impose our order on to everything we're going to make the universe bend to our will it's going to be how we believe it should be it's going to function the way that we think it should now in the midst of all this we end up coming across some sort of crazy enigmatic kind of energy that makes its presence known to the ultimates now of course as this energy has fought by The Ultimates as his energy begins to coalesce we end up finding out that this energy is the shaper of worlds now this is really kind of cool because the shaper of worlds is basically a cosmic cube that went crazy now the funny thing about this is that the shaper of worlds cannot really do anything on its own because it's a cosmic cube a cosmic cube is basically bound to the intention of the person who wields it and so it would be like if I gave you a pencil all right the pencil can only do what you do with it the pencil can't draw by itself the pencil needs you to pick it up and draw something on a piece of paper and that's how a cosmic cube works the cosmic you can't do anything on its own this shaper of worlds is the exact same way now what the shaper basically tells us is that when it came into existence in the Marvel Universe before Secret Wars that it basically functioned in all the ways that we saw it do its whole thing that would be a villain it would show up it would do some crazy things here and there but when the collapse of the multiverse took place the shaper of worlds was effectively assured outside all space and time and when it did it saw something out there it's off force out there that nobody knew about and so because of that it basically confined this confined him down to it to a singular point where a more or less drove him insane but it also made his energy signature you know incorporeal and so what it's been doing is basically reconstituting itself down to a recognizable form which isn't you know that in turn harnessed by Adam Brashear and The Ultimates more or less for safekeeping and so because of the fact that the Living Tribunal has essentially been killed the first step of master order and Lord chaos is bonding themselves into the being logos and then to also try to basically force Galactus back into being the devourer of worlds in terms of them individually they're not able to force Galactus back into the position of being the devourer of worlds and so for the most part they launch an attack but nothing really happens Galactus just fixes himself and then he calls it a day but what al viewing also does here is he invokes a guy by the name of Jim Henson now Jim Henson is a new creation he's something newly introduced by Al Ewing and so was a lot of the stuff that we're going to see with a group called the Troubleshooters and these are basically of recruits that have been organized under Jim Tinson for the purpose of operating us like a black ops team or like a recon team and intelligence team now initially Jim Tintin is contacted by Phil Vaughn of course we know him as the governmentally the liaison who's been tasked with monitoring the Ultimates of course the reason why the government did that is because of the amount of power the Ultimates possess and the idea that they were basically running around in space without anybody keeping an eye on them and so what this does is this basically reveals to us that both Phil vaad and Jim Henson were part of a group called the first Eternity battalion now we're not gonna learn a whole lot about them but we're gonna learn a little bit more here in a little here in a little while just enough to kind of give us some context and that's really about it and it makes sense just because these are characters that are being introduced it would really be way too much information if we got origin stories for all these guys over the course of a six-issue story which is it'd be way too long the way too convoluted way too confusing anyone throw everybody off and so we're basically just kind of given this a little bit of information about Jim Henson but the idea here is that from Phil Watts perspective Jim Henson as well as this guy Simon rod skoe which will we'll learn about him here in a minute um the idea is that because the Ultimates are more or less running around with any without anybody keeping an eye on them and because of the fact that they basically disbanded and then reformed against the wishes of the federal government the Troubleshooters are being sent in to monitor the ultimate secretly to investigate their base of operations to make sure they're not up to anything nefarious and to also essentially bring them in and say you guys are not supposed to be banded together you guys have to answer to the government in terms of why you're doing this now jumping back to master order and lord chaos again because of the fact that they failed in their attempts to to force Galactus back into his normal state we end up having Connor Sims whisked away by Galactus as soon as the Living Tribunal died basically the like just said okay these are popping off things are going crazy get out of here go get the ultimate to tell them what's going on that was one of the coolest moments was really basically just kind of whisked him away because that's when you know that things were getting incredibly serious and that's the coolest thing is because Galactus is such an imposing character and Marvel Comics such a powerful character and Marvel Comics that when he's with his Herald and things begin to sort of panic you can almost kind of see him looking at the situation a little fearful and just kind of whispering - Connor Sims look man go tell the Ultimates what's going on before things are too late and like whisking the ultimate you know whiskey way to go find the ultimate so it's really cool because it's a great way to show us the gravity of the situation now because master order and Lord chaos were unable to force their their power on to on to Galactus they travel to the in-between and remember the in-betweener was created by master order and Lord chaos for the purpose of basically having a balance of physical representation of the balance between order and chaos but by absorbing the in-betweener into them and then with with master order absorbing you know Lord chaos into himself what basically ends up happening here is we end up having a new leaf or a newly created being formed called logos and this is really kind of a cool idea because now what it gives us is a new cosmic entity and it's actually pretty interesting because the first thing this cosmic entity does is it looks around and it says all these Celestials and so on and so forth they're all aberrations they're all things that do not need to exist they're held there holdovers from the way things used to be a new order must be maintained a new universe has been created and the cosmic landscape must reflect this new universe and so what happens is logos obliterates every last one of the Celestials save for one and the one celestial that is saved is essentially the one above all of the of the Celestials now this brings into sharp relief the question of the one overall head as a function this is a super simple answer there's two versions of the one above all there is the god of the Marvel multiverse the one that we tried to kill and failed and then there's the one above all celestial they're two distinctly different beings don't worry people get them confused all the time so it's cool don't don't sweat it if you're kind of a little thrown off by it you're not the only one a lot of folks kind of get thrown off by that but we'll just call him the top celestial just for the sake of keeping things easy even then this is really the only time we see him but top celestial is basically saved by the never Queen now the never Queen was actually a dance lock creation as far as I'm aware and she originally appeared in Silver Surfer but the never Queen was really more of like a plot device that Dan Slott made but because she was established to be a cosmic entity she's basically been ruled over and all the other stories that involve cosmic entities but the never Queen basically exists outside of all things that currently exist and she represents things that could possibly exist so again we're really getting into the realm of hypotheticals so on and so forth but because of the fact that everything happening in the universe is taking place in the present she's always one step ahead she's always in the future she always represents the possibility of what could be so the never Queen is composed of the possibility of you going left instead of going right that never Queen is composed of the possibility of you waking up instead of dying she's just composed of all the possibilities that could exist that's what makes up who she is so again it's kind of crazy but it but she fits perfectly into the realm of abstract characters now the problem with this is that in the midst of the Troubleshooters residing inside the base of operations for the Ultimates their presence culminates in the Ultimates arriving to see them there and so what is up happening is the Ultimates face off against the Troubleshooters and it's kind of a cool conflict to see it's not wildly significant but it's cool to see their various counter balances but what is up happening here is Jim Henson keeps tapping it as something called the sigh force now we don't know a whole lot about what the sigh force is we simply just know that it's there but the big guy who's really important to focus on here is Razvi this guy initially goes against a blue Marvel Adam Brashear and then easily overpowers him and the biggest question to ask here is that if Adam Brashear is one of the most powerful beings in existence in Marvel Comics then how much more powerful could Rosco really be if he's going to overpower Adam Brashear in his entirety so again what seems to be the indication is that this Rosco guy is a guy who's not supposed to be here ed he's someone who's a bit of an aberration he's a guy that's not what he appears to be and so again in the middle of this battle between The Ultimates and the trouble shooters logo's returns to Galactus and forces him back into being the devourer of worlds and when I first read this I was just like wow like it blew my mind because logos is basically like you're going to go back to being who you were whether you want to be or not and so it's kind of this impurity that spilled all over Galactus and one of the final words he says is I hunger now the depiction of Galactus as he appears here in terms of how he's drawn is designed to be that way he looks screwed up he looks wrong he looks corrupted that's exactly how it's supposed to be that's how he's supposed to appear simply because of the fact that this is not his normal state he's being forced back into an artificial state because remember he basically evolved into his next stage which was the life bringer basically the ability to create life as opposed to destroying it though what also ends up happening here is that Rosco emerges in the midst of this fight with the ultimate and basically becomes this sheer wrecking force absolutely decimating every scene member of The Ultimates now of course Galactus basically teleports back to where everybody's located at what almost immediately Falls and so what we end up finding out is that with regards to Roscoe being here with regards to you know all these different things that are going on with logos with master order lord chaos all of this has basically been implemented itself by something called the first firmament and this is when we start to get into the timeline of things making sense now it kind of boggled me a little bit because up until this point in the story things seem very disjointed all over the place and it was a good read well I would rather have this timeline you know at the beginning of the story that being said having it at the end actually makes it a little more impactful just because of the fact that it gives us all the answers that we've been looking for all this time and so what happens as al Ewing goes all the way back to the very beginning of all things now in Marvel Comics we knew this was the case right like you know before Secret Wars you had Marvel the multiverse all that kind of stuff the universe that you think of when you think of Marvel so when Spiderman first appeared when the Incredible Hulk first appeared Iron Man all that kind of good stuff of course we had the universe that Galactus hailed from the multiverse that I guess really the universe before the current version of the multiverse and then we had you know all these different universes and so on and so forth dating back to the point when the very first universe came into existence somewhere along the line in Marvel Comics what we end up finding out here is that this being the first firmament basically created life as the singular representation of the very very first universe the firmament made a group called the aspirants and what Al Ewing is drawing on here is he's actually drawing on Karen Gillan I think it is his run of Iron Man which was absolutely amazing but one of the things that curing Gillan established was that at some point in the history of the universe that there were a massive number of Celestials but there was a war that had broken out between the Celestials and the aspirants now we didn't know what the aspirants look like we didn't know their history all we knew is that they were just some group with power equal to that of the Celestials and it resulted in the aspirants basically overtaking the Celestials pushing them to the brink of almost complete and total extinction in an act of desperation the Celestials created something called the god killer armor and the god killer armor basically obliterated the aspirants and pushed them to the brink of all destruction now that is the most recent version of the Marvel Universe so we'll call that the seventh Marvel multiverse in this first Marvel multiverse what we're seeing here right now this is basically just a war that broke out between the asteroids and the Celestials which is always destined to do but in this war that initially broke out it led to the destruction of that universe and when the universe was reborn as the second universe the the first firm of it basically spread out and so what we basically get up to this point is that there was a singular universe with the destruction of the of the first universe it exploded into a multiverse and so with the creation of this multiverse came the cosmic entities that we know that eternity and so on and so forth and so because of that in this basically the second multiverse things progressed the wars repeated yet again the war between the aspirants the war between the Celestials it kept happening over and over and over again throughout every single multiverse that was created up to the seventh multiverse which went into secret Wars which went into the 8th multiverse as we have it right now but despite all these different conflicts that had happened the first firmament was always in the back this energy force was just always in the back watching everything unfold and the first firmament was plotting its revenge was plotting its way to basically eliminate all things in existence we take the universe back unto itself and then be the sole universe in existence basically consolidating everything back down and so because of this the first firmament began to launch a series of campaigns aimed at basically destabilizing all things in existence and trying to create aberrations that would make eternity extremely weak due to the fact that following the new formation of the universe or the multiverse eternity was already in a weakened state so it would allow the allow the first storm into basically overpower eternity put it in Chains and then begin the process of destroying everything now the reason why I say that a Ewing is basically going through and offering changes is because historically speaking in Marvel Comics eternity was the physical representation of a universe and so there were an infinite number of eternity x' one for each universe the idea had been toyed with that there was a singular eternity that made up the multiverse but there was nothing to indicate that it was actually true what al viewing is doing here is making it true al viewing is saying now there's a multiversal eternity there's one eternity that represents or is the physical embodiment of the multiverse inside that multiversal eternity are all the infinite number of universes and one eternity for each of those universes so again it's a little interesting you know the but again it basically expands the marvel cosmology now of course switching back to the conflict as it exists right now of course what we end up doing is we end up having Connor Sims basically resurrected by the combined efforts of Monica Rambeau and Adam Brashear and so because of the fact that Connor Sims is brought back a Connor Sims basically containing what's left of the life bringer energy essentially takes himself directly to Galactus and merges himself with Galactus to a degree in the sense that he disperses himself into Galactus as a result Galactus is reborn as the life bringer and then destroys rot slow and in doing so learns everything that Ross foe knows which is basically the first permanent the idea that this first firmament has struck first that this entire event everything we've seen up to this point is the first battle it's the opening salvo it's the first skirmish and the first firmament intends to launch a massive campaign against the entire multiverse destroying essentially everything and bringing all things into existence back into itself and then being a singular universe unto itself going forward okay so getting into this newest story of The Ultimates a lot of people have been asking me to cover this the biggest problem is that Marvel releases their stories monthly so we've had to wait like four or five or six months for this story to finish before we could cover it that's what's so irritating about the way Marvel publishes right now because DC has spoiled me so bad DC releases bi-weekly for like their most popular titles and so by the time a story comes to an end I actually have to go back and read it again because I usually forget what happened at the very beginning but what this story is is basically something called eternity work and this focuses on the idea of what is quite literally a battle of cosmic entities now what this also does is it requires us to understand like the new Marvel cosmic hierarchy and the way the multiverse works fortunately you'll find a link down in the description to that video that I made quite some time ago and it basically runs over the new multiverse and all that kind of good stuff now to brush back up on that for those of you guys who just don't have the time or the inclination to watch it the long and short of it is that Marvel with The Ultimates line of stories introduced something called the first firmament and what they told us is that in the very beginning of all things there was just this singular universe and this universe was sentient every universe has been sentient so if the universe could get up and walk around it would be the first firmament now the first phone had created life in the form of beings called the Celestials and most know who the Celestials are by this point they're just these super powerful beings that are basically responsible for creating life and different things like that but the Celestials that were created by the firmament existed in two forms those who were faithful to the firmament and those who were not those who were faithful were called the aspirants those who were not were just called Celestials now what this did is it basically led to this massive war like this this giant civil war among these beings that had enough power to basically control and manipulate all of reality itself and so like you would expect this war quite literally laid waste to the universe and what ended up happening is like you picking up a glass cup and dropping it on the ground the universe completely shattered now of course what this did is all these different shattered pieces became universes of their own and that was the explanation of how the multiverse came into existence now for reasons that are never explained that multiverse was destroyed and then recreated and destroyed and recreated and destroyed and recreated so on and so forth leading all the way up to Jonathan Hickman's collapse of the multiverse and Avengers and New Avengers and in the start of all-new all-different marvel but what Ultimates does in the all new more on all-new all-different marvel line of comics is it gives us the first firmament as this being Miss basically existed outside of all time and space and is finally making its return but the reason why this matters is because we're talking about a level of power so extreme that the first firmament was actually able to quote-unquote chain up the multiverse now this is when we start getting into like ad abstract things for the most part when it comes to comics things are really easy to understand when people are able to just kind of crack open a comic and read what's going on mostly because of the fact that when the average person goes and reads a comic book it's easy to digest The Incredible Hulk is pissed off Incredible Hulk is gonna smash stuff that's super simple but when it comes to like cosmic entities we're dealing with abstract we're dealing with a level of power so extreme that it can literally result in the destruction of all things in existence and that's what I want you to keep in the back of your head what we're gonna be seeing over the course of this story is a level of power among these beings that's so insane that if one of them were to lose it it would destroy all things in existence well except for the Ultimates we'll talk about them here in a second but that's basically what this is it's a fight for all existence the way this opens up is with Galactus the life bringer now remember if you're catching up on this if you haven't seen any of the Ultimates videos that we've so far Galactus has always been the world devourer that was always his thing he would travel across the cosmos he would consume worlds that were able to sustain life he would keep his energies in check and that was really it with all-new all-different marvel the first thing the team of The Ultimates did was band together and then basically transformed Galactus into the life bringer so that he would no longer be a threat to the universe instead he would be a force for good instead of a force for destruction now of course this Saint Galactus on the path of going through and just like recreating worlds that he previously consumed any number of things that like a superhero with that insane level of power would possibly do the problem with this is that once Galactus learned that the first firmament had basically returned and this being was of such an extreme level of power that it was able to basically chain up the multiverse Galactus panic now if that does not give you an indication of how powerful the first firmament is I don't know what will because keep in mind with the power of Galactus he can create life he can end life he can manipulate the universe itself I mean he's just a being really one of the most powerful beings in existence out there but the idea is that Galactus had basically been trying to fight off as best he can and literally running for his life in almost every conceivable situation because he'd been confronted by these beings that were working for the first firmament that were equal or superior to his own power and so what he ended up doing was actually taking up refuge in a place that was basically rated by the molecule man Owen Reese now remember the molecule man basically sat alongside classic Reed Richards Franklin Richards and those guys and they were the ones creating the new universes in all-new all-different marvel the idea was that because the molecule man was so insane in terms of his abilities he also created kind of like this pocket universe for himself and it was a place for him to just kind of hang out and kind of reside now of course what we're told by Galactus is that molecule man had long since abandoned this place we don't know where he went - we have no idea what ever happened to him he had basically just taken off and so because of this Galactus basically co-opted this pocket dimension for himself and then actually once he emerges he's on the planet of ego now ego is kind of a weird situation because in the Marvel Cinematic Universe which is how most people are being introduced to his character he is pretty different than he is in Marvel Comics in the mobile cinematic universe Marvel calls him a celestial he's actually not he's literally just a guy who had tried to save his planet from a Sun that was going supernova he ultimately failed and he actually merged with all the people on his planet and the planet itself and that's why he's called ego the Living Planet now the funny thing about this is that ego hates Galactus and the reason for this as crazy as it sounds is because when Galactus and ego first fought Galactus actually attached a rocket to his back-end and sent him hurtling through space that's exactly what happened that's when he learned the whole origin story of ego the problem with this is that as powerful as ego is he's only ever really powerful on his own on his home planet it would be like if you had the ability to control whatever was at your home did if your home could get up and walk around control whatever it was you wanted it to do egos like that with his home planet so ego for example cannot control earth with Galactus arriving here because of the fact that he's exhausted with his own energies he's not necessarily able to overpower ego instead it actually turns into really more of a diplomatic mission and the reason for this is because Galactus is travelling around the cosmos and assembling a team of some of the most powerful beings in existence the goal of Galactus is to recruit ego to his side as just one of many people who can pull this off now it's Galactus perfectly aware of the fact that none of these guys could actually destroy the first firmament or defeat them it's just a matter of is it possible for them to so of course this leads to Galactus actually modifying using his powers to modify ego the Living Planet transform him into ego Prime so he's actually a full-bodied entity which is cool because we've never seen this before not only that once ego is taken by Galactus and brought to basically the the Eternity watch is what they call themselves we end up having a lot of these beings who are basically some of the most powerful beings in existence now keep in mind the cosmic entities as we think of them the Celestials infinity these characters they were all destroyed in the last couple arcs that we covered so Galactus normally would have reached out to them but they've all been destroyed and so because of that is literally him grabbing whoever's left now some of these characters are extremely ambiguous like in Phenom for example we don't know anything about it but then there's people like the shaper of worlds and there's the sigh Hawk now sigh Hawk is kind of a weird situation because sigh Hawk was actually created by a guy named Archie Goodwin back in 1986 and a series called ciphers that ran for about three years now the idea is that he actually hails from a comic line called new universe which was relatively popular at the time but never really regained steam eventually Warren Ellis tried to relaunch it with new universal but it's basically as close as we get to the real world if people develop powers the idea is that the psychic the best example I can use here and this is gonna be a shameless example the best example I can use here is like Captain Planet is really yet you know when the Planeteers combine their powers they get Captain Planet when the members of the sci force combine their powers they get SCI Hawk that's it that's really all there is it's just a being of insane psychic power but again you know it's it's one of those weird ambiguous scenarios this is kind of thrown in here and rolled in just because of the fact that Galactus is reaching for whatever he can get and so that's what these guys are they're basically the leftovers that's really the best way to call them they're just kind of you know whatever it is that they can do to try to stave off this conflict but it's kind of crazy because this takes the annihilation / Civil War concept and expands it to a broader scale those of you guys who don't know back when Marvel launched the original Civil War event you know Captain America vs Iron Man that was an earth-based conflict and that was it it was strictly confined to earth but while that conflict was going on this villain Annihilus from the negative zone had invaded the universe and it was the craziest thing because like Richard Ryder who was playing the role of Nova at the time showed up on earth and is like what are you guys doing like the universe is about to be overrun and destroyed what in the world is going on like it was it was one of the funniest things to happen there was really kind of a cool moment but the idea here is it's on a much broader scale so while secret Empire is happening and Hydra Captain America is like I'm gonna make the world a better place like all existence is on the brink of complete and total collapse and so what we end up doing here is we actually transition and we end up finding out that Galactus is not the only person involved here there is another being who is involved in trying to figure out a way to keep this collapse of the multiverse from happening and that this being is actually Reed Richards also known as the maker alongside the High Evolutionary now we'll get into the High Evolutionary Herbert Wyndham here in a second but I want to talk about the maker because the maker is really one of the cooler characters that exists in Marvel Comics but he's also a character that Marvel's never really done a whole lot with outside of the alternate universe in terms of him crossing over and that makes sense because there was never a reason for him to but the idea is of the maker this version of Reed Richards from the Ultimate Universe his origin story is basically what you saw in that terrible Fox film that has a nine percent on Rotten Tomatoes which it rightfully deserves except for Michael B Jordan he was amazing but the idea is that this version of Reed was very similar to his main Marvel counterpart in the sense that he was a genius he became part of a think tank eventually he branched off formed the Fantastic Four so on and so forth the difference here is that in 2009 Marvel launched an event in the Ultimate Universe called ultimatum and this event was basically all of the superheroes in the Ultimate Universe versus Magneto and it was amazing I liked ultimatum a lot of people hated it a lot of people did not like ultimatum at all but I enjoyed ultimatum it was kind of a cool thing but this was one of those stories that was designed to implement a paradigm shift and one of the things that it saw was basically Reed Richards in the Ultimate Universe falling from grace so to speak his marriage proposal being rejected by Susan storm so on and so forth and then eventually becoming a bad guy and so what this did is that he really rechristened himself as the maker now it also led into things like children of tomorrow which is kind of cool and honestly I wouldn't mind covering that I mean I always thought aspect to the alternate universe we're always kind of fun and kind of interesting the problem is that most people on my channel don't really seem to care but it's kind of a cool scenario because he was actually one half of the equation when it came to Jonathan Hickman's Avengers and New Avengers that came a point when ultimate Reed actually joined the Cabal of Thanos in trying to destroy different earths across the multiverse but the idea here is that the makers actually working alongside Herbert Wyndham now the High Evolutionary is actually a guy who basically evolved his own molecular structure he was obsessed with the idea of human evolution now of course modifying in among his own self he gave himself basically godlike powers he is a human being pushed to the extreme of what humans will most likely become but he also just kind of became his mad scientist in the sense that he just kind of hung out in wundagore mountain and he basically just created like all these different things he had like counter-earth so on and so forth and that's actually where these guys are right now they are encounter earth there basically is basically another earth that's orbiting but that's kind of the weird thing and that's the disconnect because you'll never see counter earth any other stories in Marvel Comics you will only see it in this which is one of the big reasons why people are just kind of like ok continuities out the window and marvel because you would think that if there was another earth orbiting around the existing earth then somebody out there would have noticed but it's kind of a weird scenario because what they've basically come to the conclusion of is that with eternity quote-unquote basically being chained by the first firmament their goal is to essentially grab all these different universes and merge them into one now the belief is that it will basically empower eternity it'll make eternity more powerful than it was before remember eternity is a living embodiment of the universe and so the idea is to merge all of these universes into one and then feed that energy directly into eternity giving it the power to escape the first firmament the problem with this is that we don't know if it'll really succeed and of course it does to a degree but the issue is that it actually coincides with the maker in my evolutionary watching all these events on full with regards to Galactus and his and his eternity watch facing off against these aspirants these faithful Celestials to the first firm in itself and of course where they do the best they can to face off against these forces in the end it's really not much of a battle because we're talking about a conflict that is extreme in the degree and so what we end up doing is we actually transition to black panther and to a place called the necropolis now the crazy thing about what Black Panther is doing is he's actually being pretty dangerous when it comes to the various gods and Marvel Comics especially the Panther God the being that basically provides Black Panther with his various abilities the Panther God is pretty selfish and the Panther gods like look you will worship me and no one else now with regards to what Black Panther is doing the necropolis was actually a concept that I believe was created by Jonathan Hickman and it was a way for Black Panther to actually talk to anyone who's ever been a black panther in the history of Wakanda basically him going to those who have greater experience and who were wiser than him but if long since passed away and say what do you guys think that I should do here now that fit in nicely with the Black Panther concept because it allowed to chala to basically maintain the autonomy of what conduct while also seeking outside counsel and so reaching out to those who have basically seen where these things will reside or at the very least who have a general idea of what the best road is to take allows him to basically say look I don't know everything that that's this out there I don't know everything that exists I need your help in figuring these things out again we'll talk more about that once we get into Avengers and new Avengers but the idea is that because he cannot necessarily go to the Panther God because they're kind of on strenuous terms which are courses in his own comic the idea is that instead he reaches out to the tiger God and this is kind of cool because it gives us all these different Pantheon sees different animal beings that exist out there but the tiger God basically emerged when the first beings came into existence and while the tiger God does represent the idea that humans were terrified of Tigers you know back in the early days it's also the idea that the tiger God basically represents the very essence of what it means for humans to feel fear it is the the full culmination of humanity's fear combined into a singular being but the idea is that Black Panther really kind of fights against the tiger God for a second only to basically try to use surface power now of course this leads directly to the maker and the High Evolutionary being successful in their goal to channel all these universes energies into eternity and then ultimately free it but it has a side effect of bringing in the original Ultimates and that's where people begin to look at these things now something else that I want you to notice here is that among these original Ultimates is the ultimate Incredible Hulk and that's why I say during the events of secret Empire that was not Ultimate Hulk that was just regular Bruce Banner we know that because he's in this story right now now it also begs the question you know is Marvel just kind of blowing you know throwing continuity out the window which they seem to be doing and it's entirely possible but the fact remains here that because of the fact that these different universes are all basically coalescing into one another it allows you know Galactus and his eternity watch to actually jump out of all space and time so they're literally in this white space they're outside of all things in existence they can actually watch things in existence take place now keep in mind we're talking about beings who are of the highest order so it's not like you standing in Las Vegas and trying to see what's happening in Los Angeles they have this sort of multiversal cosmic awareness and so they can stand outside of the multiverse itself they can stand outside of all things and still see what's going on inside the idea here is that again Galactus begins to hit home at the concept that if the first Fermin is not stopped that this first universe isn't isn't halted did it'll result in the destruction of all things in existence which includes all the remaining cosmic entities death so on and so forth the cool thing about this is that it also basically has ultimate s-- the the newest version of The Ultimates facing off against their previous their alternate reality counterparts now the funny thing about this is that people look at blue Marvel Adam Brashear and in a lot of ways he's kind of a ride off now of course people have recently on YouTube men talking about him more and more but basically blue Marvel is one of Marvel's versions of Superman that's really it now he's also a genius in a lot of different ways but his power is not to be trifled with and in this instance he knocks out Ultimate Hulk in one punch that's all it takes he literally just uppercuts him in the chin and that's the end of Ultimate Hulk I mean he's just down now the idea here is that because he's so empowered and because he takes out the you know Ultimate Hulk so fast it immediately catches the attention of the other Ultimates the the original Ultimates now of course they continue fighting on until America Chavez basically says hey look were the current Ultimates here in this universe now it's basically the Avengers from one universe leading the Avengers from another universe and at that point it just creates a cease fire it is this classic Ultimates Captain America basically saying everybody stop everybody stand out if they are effectively Avengers and we're basically Avengers then we need to talk this out and figure out what's going on the problem with this is that by combining their efforts together they come to the realization that what a maker did was by freeing eternity it basically allowed eternity to be consumed by the first ferment to literally allow the first moment to bolster its own power and so inadvertently he actually achieved the opposite of what he was shooting for now none of this matters anyway just because of the fact that the maker as we see him here is just as arrogant as he ever was when he was in the alternate universe and so because of this it literally leads to him just being destroyed by by spectrum this living source of energy that's all she is she's energy in a physical form and that's really all there is to it he gets wiped out pretty fast now I would argue the reason why this is done is because of the fact that the maker is also still going on in infamous Iron Man so again this is the whole continuity thing this is why these are getting kind of weird for those guys had never read DCU this is the problem people had when it came to DC Comics characters appear in one story they don't appear in the other there's no continuity we don't know went what story when these stories take place if one follows the other it gets really weird and it gets really bonkers and it gets really bananas but the idea here is because of the fact that eternity has been consumed by the firmament the goal of the Ultimates as they exist is to combine a combination of their powers as well as their brains to task and actually jumpstart eternity again and what this does is it brings him back not only that because he's effectively resurrected here it also brings about the reintroduction of all these different cosmic entities because remember they are all effectively children of eternity that's the way it works when it came to Marvel Comics do you have eternity the embodiment of the universe and then like you know a man and a woman giving birth to a kid eternity just sort of popping out all these cosmic entities different things like that those Celestials who were destroyed by the first firmament are basically resurrected here they're essentially brought back and so again it's kind of eternity giving birth to all these things bringing all these entities back again and so because of that we also end up finding out that the queen of Nevers had actually taken the last of the Celestials before they were destroyed and so this one celestial that did survive gave birth to even more Celestials and so again it's basically this return to familiarity it's everything resetting itself back to the way it was before just by virtue of eternity popping up so again it's really just this idea that this being that literally exists as the culmination of the universe is returning the universe back to the way that it's supposed to be now of course things wrap up pretty fast here and it's actually kind of disappointing the way it wraps up so fast the reason for this is because of the fact that if you're not familiar with what Marvel's doing right now Marvel's basically doing legacy and generations and the idea is there was so much negative backlash to secret Empire there was so much negative backlash to Marvel basically switching characters over are getting rid of classic characters replacing them with new ones the Marvel hit the panic button and instead they said okay fine we need to basically bring back everything the way that it used to be and so this story believe it or not this is actually Ultimates to issue number 100 this is legacy numbering what Marvel originally wanted was ultimately 7 through 12 that's what the story was slated for but because of the whole remembering thing it's been shortened by two issues and then in turn they've just tacked on you know this ending sort of ramrodded it into the conclusion of the story so it was supposed to drag on longer as far as I can tell but it's not so things basically just end the first firmament is just defeated right off the bat that's really it and then that just kind of the story things just kind of get reset to normal and that's that is this quick you know super into a story that should have otherwise been drawn out by a couple more issues and actually probably would have had more of a successful closure to it but the fact remains with this particular thing it's it's really just things going back to normal to a degree go like just still remains a life bringer but again because of the fact that this takes place before the conclusion of secret Empire what it does is it just shows the rest of the the members of The Ultimates going through and doing their own thing Carol Danvers taking out hydra black panther going back to going back to what Conda with the tiger God in his possession presumably meaning that he's going to start drawing his power from a new entity but again it's one of these weird scenarios because the story just kind of ends it just kind of comes to a conclusion but with that being
