all righty folks welcome back to another episode of RL crafts as always brought eventually hopefully there will be one quick install for the time it's been a very interesting mob because there's a lot of persisting mobs and stuff like that so the resource requirements are quite a bit different writing your standard mod pack and so it's kind of taking some adjustment adjusting and stuff like that they're enough it's all you guys are on it though zine is the technical wizard master as well as the MC pro hosting people themselves but thanks to them leave the description and now what shall we do we're in decent shape I'm gonna do a level of some skills I'm level three so you know I plant I plan on not screaming at any geo knock that pops out that's my first goal yeah other than that I that's really my only goal it's pretty much it what was it that I wanted to level up there was something that I wanted to be able to do there wasn't able to do I know iron axe is gathering that's not but I got I have magic six so I can use the cool bandages so we're fine there it's like do I want to level up gathering what do I want to do what could be a thing I don't know I don't know you have so many options ahead of you your entire world is ahead of you we need oh there was something that I wanted to be able to build with but I wasn't able to build so I feel like I should level up building name building yes I can't remember what Oh anvil building 12 that's what it was yes building I need to go break some birches I need a go be like birch please okay so that I can get some matched boxes so that because apparently our torches are going out yeah round our time we want to reignite the existing ones or hey our buddy the umber golem is still hanging out [ __ ] lava next to it that was cool yeah you had a good shot there dude no he was he was I about it I do appreciate that her ferry is still here too though she's much more useful than other things very nice oh there's a hopefully very nice they said yeah I tried to have him on it whoa I hit him I hit him successfully watch he starts moving okay he's now on top of the tree oh dude I hit his face I didn't hurry I'm hitting his groin which sounds unpleasant out him it's very loud though but I'm hitting him and I'm prepared to get absolutely wrecked a put the water down after the warning what I burned to death as I put my water down similar situation look peaceful it was just sitting there and then something went flying by and I was like what just went flying by and I was looking at that monster like did you see that thing and then it fired at me and it turned out that what went flying by was a projectile that I had avoided the first time just like I was just staring at it like did you see that it is when I was debating can eat a eat a ball go wait go wait I don't I don't like you Armour go that disc uestion wow dude when you when you monetize it's just scattered they scatter I know God where's that okay well hey at least I got my experience back I'm just okay so a purified water is its own like block type right yes okay that's all I needed to know so we're fine alright but I don't actually know how much health this boy has but what I do know is everything is on fire okay there we go okay that's good it does go back to purified that's good oh he has a little minion boys dude I'm just I wasn't Manning up you don't want to man up here and take him down I'm worried about is that I want to find my chest place that's don't ya you startled me I startled myself a little wait a my employer Guinea oh my god dude

plant the tree that's beyond my ability what are these what our I have a question to help I don't I don't have ranged you have range so you could I don't know do non leg yeah that's not he is is he climbing the tree are you climbing the tree okay what I will be disappointed about is if if I do take him out and then whatever he drops incinerates immediately under his feet fire bro how much health does he have is the question I don't know it must be a lot ouch ha nice nice hit - nice it you could stand in the water that I have placed I can't reach him from the water what you have placed whoa easy there buddy you light me on fire then I'm gonna burn taking him down boys got it just our wheat the image again I can't tell if we're doing any I have no idea I don't know what you're doing I'm under a tree how am I on fire in water what what if you put the water on him he's he's in the water I don't know what to tell you okay well I couldn't see that he looks like he's kind of put Oh minions yeah he's spawning minions rat how do you diamond you come to the water it's a better point working on it I'm working on it oh that's a big thing out there - where's the big thing behind this oh my god that's a sea monster as heck that's its tentacle stuff its tentacle what justice curated I can't wait destroy this thing or is it like too high a level for us to actually do anything just right figure out level one with our swords right okay you're a little aged there's a there's a very right over here what you got beaten by no there's fire right there it's bad this bad this bad this is really bad it might gone into the water and then just rolled right into the fire Oh No [Music] Oh what did I lose you know what an idiot stop no give me stop everything sucks everything sucks this is all your fault yeah but I got aggressive and confident and stuff like that okay we're aggressive and confident and you know you're you shut it away why am i up there and what is happening why can you perhaps assist with taking out a minion why am i able to climb stuff and and things are launching me into the sky oh it's this freakin minion bros to ruin my life oh no oh that's fire okay oh oh not again I'm [ __ ] standing on fire stand in the fire you idiot do I have any anything did anything survive oh god gimme gimme gimme out of here Jesus Christ oh how does he keep hitting me through the tree there's a fire lizard now - oh is that what's hitting me some frickin Frick Frick kitty Frick I'm pretty sure that my thing I'm pretty sure that was the minion he sprayed you with fire and death okay why does this keep happening I I mean there's a lot of things going on but I don't know what you should be confused on on why because we attack the big giant things it's about 1,800 times bigger than us even if your halberd though oh look you got stuff you're fine I know I'm pretty sure I lost my halberd which is a sad sad we know is it look like you were hearing it but new wait hold on do I have I don't think I do I don't think I have oh I do you have my halberd no I have my variable oh there it is they're new he was turning on the whole board you son of a [ __ ] he's coming at me and he's leaving get him to leave move get him to leave it was a lot of fire so screwed there's a lot of fire I can't please scene please can you do something I'm away from where he's standing I'm getting ok come here boy you're Kimmage yes oh I got it come here I think you did it by getting me to climb the freaking tree I got my Albert can I see his health his health is 99% [Music] his health is 99% just you know and I think my boomerang just boomed so my usefulness to you is greatly diminished but the boomerang was fun up until that point also it's nighttime and we're outside of ideas I just all I want is for this son of a frickin Frick he's whoa that okay that was intimidating yeah he's he's scary but I got my stuff back I gathered that by the way that he was large okay I'm in I'm heading now I'm dipping I'm dipping I've lost a part of a chest plate but I'm dipping I lost a part of my armor waiting two plus two brains I don't know what pleating is oh hello Skelly thin I'm good good shot it get the heck out of here you literally stuck in my head right now you're fine you're fine it's just a flesh wound walk it off walk it off I can't believe I lost some of my really good bandages though I think we just saw what else to lose I lost a stone axe but otherwise I suppose you know it could have been worse than that could have gone a lot worse than it did for you let's be honest let's be honest with ourselves for a second need to make it I killed a Jewpacabra which was really quite aggressive that's cool and there was nighttime so we can sleep and hello yes dad oh I'm ready for the MA whoa cinder blade this item can be used to create powerful equipment using an equipment Forge or can be crafted into a useful resource yeah I got that that's a fancy boy okay I sleep now with you yeah yeah please please I'm scared of everything well I mean I feel like that's reasonable like you know well this is gone well this is gone well so far we're okay let's put our beds down again and now we can't sleep until later man I can hear the dude up there walking around now that we've gotten now that we've got him out of the out of the volcano yeah he's seasoned Shamu it's good all right so who do we want to explore at all uh yeah I mean I'm in the caves wandering around I know we've been down here but I don't remember where we've been down here so I'm just kind of checking around downtown oh that's right already ready to get shrekt but I just took out this dude bro without any issue whatsoever is [ __ ] Tim I kind of want to go see what the see merge there is robot you want to go see what the sea monster is yeah okay I feel like you're you're not factoring in some of the all the factors you're not setting all the considerations it's not really moving all that much though is the thing I'm sure it is completely and utterly incapable of movement oh wait what is that like a flaming underground shipwreck a flaming underground shipwreck sounds like quite the thing this is pretty interesting actually and the big boy the big boy is not moving around it's kind of chilling in the same spot well you should go say hi and experiment with him yeah you think no I think that's a bad idea OOP I lost my torches do you really want to be my would you like to go check out either this structure up here or try to check out this shipwreck yeah I mean dungeons right now so I I messed up a little bit and I inverted when I was starting in staffing by recording so when I stopped my recordings when boring stuff is happening it turns out I was actually starting them so I recorded all the boring stuff not the interesting stuff so we checked out the shipwreck there wasn't all that good stuff in the shipwreck though it was it was kind of just a few little um like these flare gun things that can't actually be used because the two Opie and magical 999 is required and then yeah unfortunately no I know so no one died yeah no one's fine no one drowned two times on the text menu no one did that that never happened I just want to also show the little settlement up here which it didn't yield a great deal either no that was also disappointing it basically just had a fire in our Lyons disappointment it had a couple of beds it had a bit of food in one of the chests but otherwise that was pretty much it otherwise it was just oh oh I forgot to bring the saddle though that is one thing that I needed to bring is just very cold so we had to stand next to the fire and try not to lose health um but anyway I just want to run back out there do you want it you want to sleep real quickly I'm I'm on my way it's not easy to get back up there when we don't have stairs and I'm just hippity hopping up okay oh I'll make I'll make some stairs for us I got some cobblestone I'm gonna be a team player process I could do it I'm a team player I got those stairs for us but anyway now we can sleep I keep getting mining fatigue for some reason and I really can't figure out what the issue is not being tired I kept maybe you should leave daily go outside get out of the cave okay mining fatigue is off yeah I just I just want to show the folks the shipwreck because even though it wasn't much other than you accidentally popping a couple times you know doesn't sound familiar I don't know this whatever happened right then ever I am I remembering incorrectly oh that's that is it that is the chupacabra of chupacabra is it the same one that you were dealing with earlier I I mean no cuz this is the first time I saw this one the one that I dealt with earlier was a normal one and this one looks to me but I found a cave I am on my way back my idiocy aside I'm gonna join you back in the mind because we have decided that we want to find diamonds have decided yeah we you don't want to find diamonds I mean it's fine it's just I think we all know who it primarily wants to find hey hey hey hey hey I oh I I did make stairs though so I mean I made some stairs too and we just need more of it I ran out okay so I got 20 years so that's a pretty good amount of stairs that could be used to stare at you want to stare at some stairs yep okay I I can assist with that cool I mean we're happy to assist with that that would be perfect all right I hit level eight oh you oh you're doing this as the mine I gotcha on the acquired or the mining so sighing dude I'm gonna be great all right that guy was fast I not see that one coming holy cannoli dude I'm glad I was here to help you my goodness well I miss my ring what I assume is lapiz okay redstone though redstone we can mine okay cool what is it what is it you want me to do level for pickaxe then for green dot I don't know my pickaxe is that website Oh magic is what green dot is wolf dude is smoldering through the obsidian is kind of cool it like indicates that there is lava underneath no I just think that's quite what you okay it's fine it's fine don't worry about it was it a was it a coal boy I didn't I I didn't I didn't panic doesn't seem like you panicked it's fine it's fine they're just just a moment of I noticed it's oh there's their there is a boy over here hello trip macabre chupacabra I got it I got it I got it we good we are you can we eat supercobra meat probably not yes eating it raw can cause terrifying hallucinations but it says that if you like it like when you cook it it actually is like even though the creature this comes from is disgusting when properly cooked it's delicious I can't want to see a hallucination oh yeah that's a good idea that's a great idea I can't think of why it wouldn't be a great idea okay so I need a little bit more coal so I can get my level four give me some XP so I can get my little four magic because my magic is lagging yeah dude you're gonna want to do I need to get my magic game going I agree with you on that you wouldn't want to be lacking in the magic 1/2 my mountains deck oh well if Slappy's shoot I thought it was diamond for a second I'm stoked AF on it did you okay I wonder what I want to find diamonds so that oh what is this I found a new thing oh no I don't like this new thing hell no I don't like it fabula I don't like you want like once again you wandered off without like waiting for anything so you just kind of were on your own there oh shoot at least I don't think you can ensnare my stuff I why like this oh god I gotta run all the way back down I hope I can find it I mean I know right where you were at this entire episode is just gonna be me getting at absolutely wrecked by everything that's supposed to be the modpack right like we've we've had it pretty like I've seen people discussing about how we've had it lucky up until now have we yo yeah ya know pretty much the consensus is they're like wow they're getting really lucky where did I go oh oh there's the bad thing I found another bad thing you don't want that thing okay you hate you want to you want to be my here you want to be my guy okay if you died to it why do I want to go down here it's right there it's right there just it's just that I believe in you use your frickin halberd you can do this yeah take him down yeah dude sick well what does he does he drop anything I wonder good job you're my Savior there's something pink in that lob over there bro well alright then my heart can't take much more of height I mean it's tough I've had those moments where it's like okay it's fine no I'm fine guys I'm just gonna I'm just gonna breathe heavy for a second it's okay good okay okay okay all right listen buddy did you get vApp ulid I got a golden do knock I got you my pickaxe coming to you where are you I can't kill them I killed it okay okay he broke my pickaxe so then I couldn't pickaxe him and everyone was like but you if you use the pickaxe he'll die faster I didn't I didn't have much option okay whoo I just wanted I do wanna find some diamonds man you would you would think it's not that hard oh geez it's you you would think it's not that hard yeah really it's kind of you know one of the difficult things that we do Oh what is that there's another thing there is this is okay see I'm just terrified now that anything that looks like a vanilla or is bad news mm-hm I'm gonna I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it is okay oh it's okay it's okay it's the thing that I can actually get oh that's good oh it's super or okay I get it okay and then we had I know he made it ouchy William Lyon fire flip oh I am on fire puh I am fire poop a mere oh god poor how I led to me thinking what you could do is not any many water in this area hmm what what what why did you do that why did my water just turned into cobblestone even though I Oh apparently if you place water on top of a smouldering thing it it's just it's like it's lava so that's that's helpful good to know good good things to learn where did I put my torches down no okay good these are not the good sounds oh there's a that is your Z there is a fly or something oh you wanna look at this I don't know if you want to look at all I'm coming up and come back what's up what's up okay it's it's seen me it see me coming I am come back to you I I know that's a scary looking thing oh there's more of them do that way the okay that's I'm coming back to you don't hit me okay [Applause] okay there were more just down the way - I have got a plane for many seconds and I'm gonna leave so that I don't be monetized to it you don't want this you definitely don't want it that's not what you want you don't want it you don't want it oh my I'm about to die if that thing's really bad news oh wow that thing was not nice and I saw like I turned the corner running from it and saw like three more so I I wasn't a keen on that you know those things will wreck you with some status effects my god no thank you jeez dude I'm gonna need to region with some trickin fairy power please let's sleep and then we could kind of ferry cuz we're gonna need okay okay my goodness my goodness you've gained one knowledge rank of the itch itch a tick each tick each a dedicated ticker Sofia goodness oh hey oh you gain health when you sleep did you know that a little bit not much I can't like five hearts yeah that's not a scheduled poison element I was bursting with deadly plagues that infect all around us all around them they have a fondness for mushrooms that that seems desirable oh I see you it's like a it's like a mushroom looking underground place what actually is is that mycelium oh I get that yeah that's that's what I was I wasn't sure what that was oh hello yeah must be myself beautiful hello talk to me what what what you find diamonds yes nice no no not you I'm talking to her she's healing me Oh Oh gotcha understood dude understand okay I thought you were like saying come to me beautiful as in diamonds because I talked to diamonds that way I know Oh a that I think is what is this what is this what is this glowing green freaking Holy Mother of God I'm scared it's freaking neon green help help help help it's it's terrifying it's scary it's a scary boy it's as a fan yellows a fan you looked as scary boy it's a mosquito and it's raining oh I got it I got it I got it oh okay that was that was an adventure to listen to acid splashed charge I would have gotten acidified had I managed to get hit by that but I didn't manage to be getting it by that which is very exciting that's that sounds nice sounds nice not guns all right so you're down here still right yeah yeah I think I found it I think I'm and I'm is dude I don't know where you are because ah I am I just went a direction down the place that clears that up so if you at the bottom of the stairs if you go left there's a watery tunnel if you go through that watery tunnel it will take you to where on that I've passed the mycelium or whatever that's watery no it's like a it's kind of like a left ish u-turn yes yeah you have found diamond cape and you're able to mine on my um nice impress it or the question is what level do we need for a diamond pickaxe oh that's I mean I can you even use diamonds even used an iron pickaxe yet yeah irons all the way for pretty much everything right well I mean I just wasn't sure if you hit level eight mm-hmm I am at level eight for being able to use diamond pickaxe or sorry iron pickaxe iron sword and iron armor question is though oh yeah that was a terrible vein it was only three diamonds vein it happens sometimes okay and I always I can't always pay off we're gonna get so lost and never find like I can see you know I know I know why way back um here let's let's give it a try I think I have a I don't have a crafting table but I have the ability to make it let's do that or do you have a crafting table any chance no okay I'm just watching I'm just watching you do all right so it's an adventure let's see let's make that diamond pickaxe mining 16 okay so it's gonna be everything needs to be 16 in order to use it do we shoot yeah we're gonna need to do that if we want to even want to get obsidian so we're gonna have to get to that level to even get to enchantments at all well sure um all right well in that case I guess I'll just make it we might as well have no idea well there's a lot of stuff to be found still exploring like we've we've been lucky in that we haven't encountered huge killed if things although this episode hasn't been quite so much but but at the same time we've been unlucky in that we have not found really available like good loot in what we've explored but I do see you can actually find there's a lot of good loot to be found exploring like okay it's it's highly recommended that you you explore an adventure um well what I have found is that my diamond pickaxe is apparently clumsy and you can get different tears when you craft so you know that's that's unfortunate I guess that you make X you didn't know how to make a good one and now it's bad yeah if I've really messed it all up there whoopsie doopsy woopsy doop see now I'm wondering it's like do I want to level up mining or do I want to level up buildings so I can use the anvil which would which should I prioritize you can go either direction you want but I am kind of trying to round out and get my farming a little bit and and kind of like trying to get support stuff as well okay so it would it would make sense for you to Oh buddy hey hey that's a gold boy okay yeah the gold boys Oh God it's very startling oh god it's you guy I don't think we can properly express just how startling that is I mean they are watching presumably presumably Oh God oh I don't like it I don't like it at all it's a bad one got him got him got him but that's yep I don't you have to help me get to get back to that spot because I don't know where we were in the cave all right she knocked me he knocked me into lava so hey Michael my goal was to get out of the lava and go to the corner and die like oh oh shoot I'm not trying to steal your XP did I get I didn't get it okay no no no don't come to me don't come to me XP don't do it alright find my way back to you well I think the question is it's like find our way back to each other but yet not I've got you who's where that is here we go okay not that far what's your time a little bit more just to see if I can find any diamonds but otherwise I mean we could we could definitely try to focus on the exploration a little bit if you think I'm good I think you know some cross country might be a good idea okay and it's interesting to see what's out there to see what what we encounter and stuff whereas right now we're encountering Rock and I am the things that are trying to destroy us through that rock so quite fiery right now so are you a little a little warm and under the hood a little bit warm apparently so apparently I should dip on out so that I don't incinerate myself because that would be disappointing to have happen okay let me level up some things I'm just trying to figure out what I should be working towards I'm just trying to figure out like I know we went down there and I went down there how do I get me here they're obviously not down there okay let's see let's see what should we do for leveling um building is 1/8 mining is a date gotta have to double it I guess I'm gonna work towards anvil I'm still gonna work towards anvil actually and I'm one away from being able to use an anvil it's so close so close and yet so far I don't know so close yet so far away but it's okay at least we'll be able to repair our stent well I can you can hand me your stuff I can repair it and then I can hand it back to you okay no I mean that seems like a good way to do it probably yeah I would say give me one second I just want to see I might have the levels to get my building to huh how many does it take why doesn't it tell me how many levels I need to put in order to get the levels to see how many it takes I just want to get my mind like one more vein of coal I might be able to do it then I can place down the anvil and I'll be able to get my halberd nice and good again because I'm worried about that thing I don't want it to de monetize it's served me well so I seem concerned about it for sure I mean my halberd has been quite the lifesaver because it has the reach on it so I realized that once we start exploring a little bit more and things are definitely good frickin Frick we would get one hit boy one hit wonder I realized once we go exploring it might get outweighed pretty quickly but yeah so far I got 12 is it maybe maybe level 12 actually costs 12 let's find out building yes it actually is okay so every increased level costs that many levels which is rough can you imagine what having to get to level 32 in all these the amount of levels that requires holy crap we're gonna just have to farm the Enderdragon over and over in order to make that happen if you can even do that in this modpack but either way interesting we finale this bye check check that's oh that be that's cool thank you I mean look at it not take it but that's fine Oh XE nice it doesn't have to estimate that I suppose we're actually already iron boots with speed sure I'll put those on since they were just in the chest sounds nice and ville oh I'm so ready to hear this thing pop even though I actually have no levels nor do the heels so that's definitely gone well definitely we're looking for there how many is it gonna cost in order to heal this thing though only two actually it's not that bad okay well we'll have to do it next time around after getting a little bit more in the levelling department but for now you want to wrap things up for the episode sure I'd like month and help us out and everybody wins also in that same description we do have links to the playlist if you happen to have missed any episodes so be sure to check that out it's it it's all we got okay cool anything anything for you no I think that's pretty much it thanks everybody for tuning in we should sort out our chests offline I feel like but otherwise you have backpacks and exploration next time right yep alright see you it bye guys [Music] you
