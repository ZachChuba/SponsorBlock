I've been streaming a lot of beat Sabre on my own time lately and the number one thing the chats always asking me is hey Linus when are you gonna do that cool thing where you're like standing in the game and like actually holding the sabers and stuff and my answer is always when I can find a freaking gigantic green screen and a sophisticated camera set up to do such a thing conveniently I happen to have just that thing here at the Linus Media Group's to do so today's video is going to be us going through the adventure of setting up mixed reality streaming and me attempting to beat my all-time high score in Laszlo's supernova my unofficial theme song I have a theme so speaking of theme songs the theme song I'm gonna sing for you guys right now is about our sponsor freshbooks accounting software is custom-built for small business owners like you to help you stay more organized and productive try their 30 day free trial at FreshBooks com forward slash tech tips we're gonna have that links below [Music] James and Andy have spent about the last hour collecting all the pieces that we're gonna need for this setup starting of course with a camera now if we're gonna do this we're gonna do it up right so we're gonna be using a black magic fork a pocket camera to get as much resolution and as much separation between our subject that's me and our green screen as possible we are also going to need a nice powerful VR capable gaming rig so this right here is the OTO and this thing is freaking sick 20 80 TI cor I nine ninety nine hundred K all that good stuff we're using Avaya pro because I wanted to do this wirelessly long story we might not be able to because Jake has the dongle at his house for some reason of course we've got all our lighthouses we've got power for everything and we have significantly upgraded the lighting set up for our green screen normally we've got nothing but these ancient impact soft boxes that are probably the oldest functioning things in this studio other than me and we just close off this side of the green screen in order to avoid spill with a do butene curtain but we've added whatever this is so we've added a Westcott there we've got a big soft box here and is this another Westcott yep another Westcott so theoretically we should have nice even lighting and all we need to sort out now is the software unfortunately that's the hard part and we have no idea what we're doing okay so sources display capture okay display yep okay wait that should be working right now okay well we're off to a really good start download the live client on Steam do we got that okay sweet this is going really fast action cams and DSLRs got a little more than a GoPro yeah we can sort that out okay so let's uh let's get the headset hooked up is this actually powered right now I still don't have power wait it has a power button this whole thing has a bar button yeah it's okay we'll cut out all the parts where we look stupid the hallways tell me they're gonna do that they never actually do it as part of our troubleshooting process we were thinking around with this one can we turn that around the headset should pair to the controllers and it should pick up those in a second no it doesn't have to be that close now that wouldn't work very well your experience Thanks it's I wasn't even trying to get that but now that I've got it you get out of here it's that ready okay controllers off wow I have a thousand hours in VR that must include like accidentally leaving it on a bit god I hope so there's no way you've played a thousand hours of yard games I don't think so yeah so what else is going on I am so excited to try this I have wanted to do this forever looking like ninja laser sword badasses slashing stuff there's a lot of footage of you looking not very ninja badass but it's because you can't see the virtual world that even that's why this is all about Redemption Ltd store calm I don't think it's working oh it's awful like it wasn't completely plugged in yeah nice yeah okay so wait hello hey okay wow it's like already Keaton stuff that's freaking awesome look at this like it's not the sickest key no but like it's automatic yeah that's Auto magic begin calibration so written instructions bring your controller all the way up to the camera lens one of them apparently you want the controller to be touching the camera lens oh no you didn't the whole of the controller okay so you want it like that okay yeah how do I know if it's calibrated I don't know and II made a genius observation obviously the camera needs to be within sight of the lighthouses because otherwise how would we calibrate where the controller is wait shoot it's gone you know what let's just go through the basic freaking setup first let's just haven't actually set up VR thing first duh this oh hey didn't party like they did good oh we're not capturing this are we let the trigger right okay okay we good okay try this one over here pretty nice oh there it is yeah that's kind of on there that's pretty impressive uh we might have to do this again because the framing of the camper is like way off uh Andy we might need a different lens need a wider lens hello nice so King this actually if you want to play around with the threshold and stuff a little bit too far now what happens if we grab that over a no BS capture exe live app output let's see whoa it's working this is so cool and now for a change you guys can feel as cool as I do at the same time as me that's good is that you far okay replying that oh we don't have then game audio wait shoot okay let's see if that's working out oh do we know desktop properties oculus virtual audio device no that's no wonder that wasn't working this actually didn't take that long without an hour so it's working I just need to kind of I'm gonna turn it off turn it all back on get some beat saber mods installed and then I'm going for it I'm going for slaying Lazlo supernova we're gonna see how this goes okay so it's working this is it supernova expert plus I have never full combo this but we're going for it if I'm gonna do it now is the time and we're done already wow that was quick don't worry I got this fool we're we're not off to a good start here oh boy I swear I'm decent at this game they're heavy case anyone was wondering [Music] no I'm not settling for any less than full Congo today oh I accidentally hit the menu button you gotta be kidding me [Music] No not one mistake get distracted I want one more attempt that's only s it's not even SS ah all right well I didn't get my combo but hopefully you guys still had fun I had fun almost as much fun as I'm gonna have link below so if you guys enjoyed this video maybe check out my recent review of the valve index that's probably the most recent oh no we also have a oculus quest like wired tethered update where we check out the hand tracking as well that's probably gonna be up at the time you guys
