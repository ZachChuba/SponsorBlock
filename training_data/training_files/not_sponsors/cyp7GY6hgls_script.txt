hey what is going on you guys that is mr. nose sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new video for you all today so today I bring you a little bit of a different related loot video this one's much shorter than my normal videos and it's a lot more to the point this is actually not monster related either ladies and gentlemen today I bring you loot from 1,000 on cleaned fines now if you're curious to what an unclean find is basically it is a rock that you can obtain in the varrock museum specimen cleaning activity this is all related to the dig site quest and players that get this Rock need to use it on a specimen table and that will reveal the archaeological artifact inside of it now this cleaning activity can be done after of course you finish the dig site quest this was released into the game May 29th 2007 at is members only there is no price to this rock it is a hundred percent untradable and you can take part in this cleaning activity as shown on screen basically in the South fenced corner of this varrock Museum and the only thing really required item wise for this activity is of course those three tools that you see in the very top row of the inventory and these tools can just be found in the tool rack hanging on the wall right next to the artifacts so the goal for this video was pretty simple you know this is a loot series so I wanted to collect 1,000 uncleaned rocks put them in my bank luckily they are stackable and then at the very end as soon as I got to 1,000 I would turn them all in to the storage crate and by adding these rocks to the storage crate basically you can receive a lot of random loot and that is exactly what I wanted to make the center of this video is all of the loop that you can get from those storage crates because a lot of people really only think of this area as a way to gain kudos in the museum because some of the items that you can find while you're doing all this cleaning basically can give you kudos to finish the varrock museum completely and those items are all in tradable which is basically just the pottery the old symbol ancient symbol ancient coin old coin and the clean necklace so don't mind any of that this video is all just related towards the tradable stuff as well as one untreatable item that you can get from this activity and that is the top dog the antique lamp which is a rarity of 1 and 195 you will notice you know during this video that there was a level 3 skill er alongside with me and the reason he said that he was here was because um these lamps are very good for Slayer XP for level 3 skiller's who never want to get their combat higher than 3 and obviously it's very hard to train slayer if you're not gonna train combat so yeah this is one of the ways probably one of the best ways to get Slayer XP if you're one of those account builds now obviously I wasn't really going for the XP here I just kind of was curious to see the loot but it's nice to note that that antique lamp is something to benefit even the lowest level account now one mistake that I did make was while I was collecting these 1000 rocks as you can see we already collected them didn't really take long at all probably less than an hour and a half I was actually just AF King the pile but if you spam click you will get them in your inventory much much faster so for anyone who's actually taking this seriously definitely spam click you will save a lot of time and probably triple the amount of rocks you get per hour so yeah once I did stack up all 1,000 I just started adding them to the storage crates there's one item though that you can show to the archaeologists and that is just jewelry and if you do show him the golden jewelry he will give you a whopping five coins for every piece I know it doesn't sound like too much but you know it adds up over time and you know overall this video did take me exactly 3 hours to make so if you thought this was somewhat interesting and you want to see instead of 1,000 maybe 10,000 maybe a hundred thousand I mean it's really up to you guys like I didn't really know how this video would do I still don't know how this video will do but if you guys find this interesting just let me know I really don't mind doing this in a major way I mean it's very very fast and I did this the slow method you know I didn't know about the spam clicking until the very end so as this loot grows over time you know the more rocks we find the more loot we will find so I wasn't too sure if I should do 10,000 right away but yeah we did actually end up getting our very first lamp and it did take a while it was roughly after using over 300 rocks and I myself decided to use these lamps on runecrafting did receive a solid 500 XP per antique lamp so you can kind of understand why level 3 would do this method in order to get Slayer XP or just y-you know lower levels would do this method to get quick runecrafting XP I'm really not too sure to be honest I myself just found out about this yesterday so yeah I'm still learning a lot if you have any feedback about anything related to this video feel free to let me know below I'd love to learn more about this kind of reminds me of penguin points back in the old runescape I know this has no comparison in XP but it does remind me a little bit of that if anyone that remembers that from the old days yeah in the next inventory I actually did manage to get two lamps so you know your luck can certainly come and go multiple people can do this activity all at the same time I don't think that has an effect on your R and G so it was nice not to do this video alone and judging by all of the loot you know especially at this halfway point there is one item that does stick out and that is the broken arrows so there untradable item but the reason I didn't mention it before is because you can actually make it tradable at the very end of the video if you've been ever curious as to what a Broken Arrow is used for I will be showing you that as well so you might learn something new today or maybe you knew all this already and you just killing some time I'm not sure but yeah so the top left there was all of that broken glass and that is essentially the most useless item that you can get from this activity I'm not too sure what you can do with that I'm pretty sure it's useless if you can do something with it feel free to let me know maybe we can do a loot from 1000 window repair video in the future was my attempt at a joke and I'm really glad that it's level 3 skill er did join me because as you can see in the chat box you know he did get quite a few slayer levels during this video I think he got from 38 to 40 slayer which does boost your total level as a level 3 skill er making that account even more elite than it already can be and yeah let's not forget the main purpose of this video all of the loot that we can get from 1,000 inclined fines not to mention all these lamps I mean at the end of the day we were having our lucky inventories double lamps occasionally to take quite a few hundred just to get started and regarding the antique lamp which actually can come in six different colors this one happens to be red was released into the game February 28th 2005 and just in this mini quest you know you actually have to have the skill that you want to use the lamp in to at least level 10 so you can't start level one at least that is what the wiki says so just something to keep in mind but enough about the lamps let's go ahead and price check all of this loot 1000 unclean finds took exactly three hours to do could have taken probably less and all of this amazing loot the you price check comes out to be a whopping forty to 0.5 K from one thousand on clean finds you're gonna be looking at some bones some ores some bowls pots arrow tips limbs a staggering amount of iron darts iron knives as well as bolts and of course we can't forget about the broken arrows which I did fix at the repair bench in my player own house didn't really result in too much just some irons and a little bit of steels that's pretty much it so for anyone who ever wants to check out this cleaning activity feel free hopefully this video gave you a little insight on the possibility of what loot you can get and of course the amount of antique lamps so yeah thank you guys very much for watching let me know what you thought in the comments below and I'll see you next time until then mister no sleep ow
