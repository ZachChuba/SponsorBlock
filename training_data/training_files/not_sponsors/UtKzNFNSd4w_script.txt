hey what's going on YouTube we'll hear from all-electric back again with another video today we're looking at a new software update I just got from my model 3 right here 20 20 that's 16 2.1 so let's jump right in and check it out channel for as little as $1 a month so let's jump right into these release notes so we see the Tesla toy box has now moved and we'll jump into that we also have nearby charging sites when we can filter based on the rate of charger how much in juice it can put into the car and then another dash cam improvement so you can actually reformat the USB drive right from the car so you never have to take it out again because you can view and reformat right from the car so I'll also show that in the video and backgammon improvements now I must admit I've never played backgammon I may have played it once in a previous video but just know that they are constantly improving all these games and all these new features so backgammon is now has some improvements as well and this looks like it is the last main release and here we have the previous release notes for this update so here we can access the toy box and we have a beautiful new design that actually shows a graphic for emissions tracks romance sketchpad so this is really nice and looks really clean and really good here and if you remember previously to get to the toy box initially you would tap the T on the top of the screen here and now there is no menu where they would kind of bubble up there are more hidden features but this is definitely a better menu now if we go into the nearby charter so you can actually pick okay I want a fast charger or I'm looking for a slow charger I'm not sure why you would be but you can filter out those specific Chargers versus just showing all the charging stations like if you're only looking for a fast charger you can select the only high charger or there's three lightning bolts over there on the right hand side so you can see you can scroll through and I'll show you by distance is how they're sorted now if we go into safety and security and then scroll down a bit to where the dash cam on honk was we have a new option to format the USB device and that allows us to format the USB so if you're getting an error with your USB you can format it right from the car which is great now you don't have to do that in a computer so let's take this new software for a little test drive here and so we are approaching stoplight so I'm going to acknowledge that the light is green and we're gonna move forward and you can see through this intersection it's very smooth I haven't noticed many huge improvements as far as staying in a lane through an intersection another intersection test is coming up what I did notice though is how it's showing people and the people are actually walking previously they only stood still so it looks like Tesla's trying to get more data on people actually moving around the car which is great and they're going to an advanced FSD you can see here the actual people moving on the center display with a gate which is really cool and definitely something that is great to see and shows you how advanced Tesla's autopilot is now I did have the opportunity also to test another bicycle now I have done this in the past in the previous video this is not something new to this software update but you can see that it is slowing down and staying behind this bike on this smaller two-lane road now previously Tesla's autopilot if you would engage at a red light it would go through the red light now with this software update and actually the last software update that didn't have any new release notes so I didn't do a video on it these last two software update actually prevent you from acknowledging the light prior to the light turning green which is a great added safety feature for the stoplight so you can see here I'm at a red light and I'm gonna press the accelerator if you watch closely at the rear-view camera on the right hand side of the screen right now you're gonna see the car roll forward when I press the accelerator right here and the car is gonna roll forward and then it's going to turn green so it's gonna say hey use the accelerator to acknowledge the light then the Carr is going to move through the intersection really excited to see this constant improvement from Tesla I hope as always guys I'll see you in the next one
