the reunion of nyla with the pride was most probably the most educational and impressive moment of my entire life or as so many totally unexpected situations I mean it started already once we entered the camp and nyla met Li are the lions all of a sudden as if somebody would push about him everybody changed his mood the moment are removed nyla from the pride I personally believe that they restructured that pride so everybody had to prove his position his rank and his level within the pride again sokurah and Khaleesi the two youngest females and sisters who are actually inseparable they all of a sudden came at home and even showed aggression toward each other as well as aggression towards the other one through all and of course since nyla joined again she was kind of the center of all that happening around her and she had to prove herself again so she had to prove that she's the strongest and oldest and and most dominant female and that the other ones whether males nor females can't play games with her at one stage nyla was really under a lot of pressure and then Dexter joint with some proper aggression towards her and guess what Leo got up Leo is actually Nyla's brother and he picked up a fight with Dexter kind of protected his sister this was unbelievable to watch it also made me reconsider my personal position within the prize because they did approach me but never aggressive they never challenged me they'd rather came to me to get some confirmation that we are cool or even to get some back up instead of challenging me or or showing any sorts of aggression towards me and the craziest part of the entire reunion was the ending now after two and a half hours of dominating each other challenging each other fighting with one another all of a sudden they stand still they look at each other and they start to roar and I had to roar with them of course Oh God that was the most impressive thing I have experienced in my entire life Wow I'm speechless I mean this was the highest level of acceptance they could show to me because usually they never roar when people are around but now they just did it with me right in between it was so amazing and it was also kind of the ending of the entire reunion cuz after all of those fights and so they kind of looked at each other and said okay we have the structure sorted now we're all on the same page and through those that roaring session they ended it good morning everybody so today is the day after the reunion and we want to go and check up on the lines and see how they are doing and see how they are socializing with one another serious Kenzel I think he feels a little bit alone because one of our workers went out and the other dogs went with him while he was sleeping so now he's missing them and calling them anyway we want to go now to the lines and check up on them so come with me Oh everybody that looks amazing there is nothing but love in the air everybody's back together I'm gonna spend a little bit of time here with them now to find out if there is a new structure in the pride but as it looks like it looks like pretty much the same than before girl all right let's see what we can find out hello ladies who Woods up so as you guys can see the ladies are super chilled again compared to yesterday where they basically yeah you know kind of weird attacking each other and dominating and challenging each other now they're just cleaning each other socializing being super chilled and cool there's nyla are you biting my arm that's a good feeling when a family's back together and everybody is a happy I other socials as well thank you so much for watching and see you guys later
