featured on mr. robots and even PewDiePie's channel the bad USB has become the archetypal hacker tool of recent times they can take many forms though all bad USBs essentially perform the same task they may look like generic USB sticks though secretly their virtual keyboards plug one in and it'll spring to life getting straight to task the idea being that keyboard input is inherently trusted when you download an executable file your computer doesn't trust it by default it'll run a few scans to figure out what the program does but there's a good chance if it's from an unknown developer and has malicious intentions your computer won't even let you run it but if someone gains access to your PC opened up a command prompt and told your computer to delete all of its files the PC will just say ok and get to work no time spent trying to figure out if the person behind the keyboards is legit or not enter the bad USB it simply pretends to be a keyboard so when plugged in it's all type out whatever you want it to do the computer is none the wiser band USBs are undetectable from a computers perspective they're just keyboards nothing malicious they're their trusted again it's just a keyboard so why be so cynical and they're super fast typing thousands of characters per minutes they don't stop to chat they're often used by pen testers to quickly run scripts on target PCs allowing them to gain a foothold on a target computer system without ever having to touch it for example by means of a reverse shell bad USBs can do pretty much anything on target PC there really are no limitations if the user can do it so can the bad USB even sysadmin have found a use for them in setting up new computers for example why spend an hour tapping through prompts to set up a new PC when you can have AB and USB do it for you in just a few moments mal Tronics comm is where you can find the latest of hacker hardware from Wi-Fi D authors tumult we know keystroke injectors Wi-Fi key loggers and USB protectors it is run by myself so do give it two minutes of your time you're guaranteed to like art mal tronics comm link is in the description the bad USBs first major incarnation was hack 5s USB rubber ducky it stems from a vulnerability back in 2006 that allowed CD ROMs to auto run programs when inserted this vulnerability made its way into advice known as the USB switchblade whereas I'm called it the switchblade just because it's got this sweet little wire slider right which was essentially a USB stick that could also run any program when plugged in a separate partition on this on this little USB key here that looks to windows like a cd-rom which means it will auto on because question though a new kind of attack was developed by the hack 5 community this took a generic USB flash drive and reprogrammed the microcontroller such that it could act as a hid device a keyboard instead of a mass storage drive allowing it to perform keystroke injection attacks unfortunately however not many USB flash drives had the Wrights microcontroller and the fact that manufacturers often update the chips from their internal designs without changing the products name makes it increasingly hard to find a compatible USB stick these days so in 2011 hack 5 launched their USB rubber ducky this was a USB stick purpose-built to be a bad USB otherwise known as a keystroke injection device this frame in their office shows the various USB rubber ducky prototypes and iterations over the years along with the USB rubber ducky came at ducky scripts this super simple scripting language makes it really easy to tell you're bad USB what to do a string command simply tells the duck to type something out the delay commands tells it to wait a bit you can even do multi key combinations such as GUI R which holds down the windows key at the same time as pressing R giving you a run prompt it's pretty obvious to see how this may be used maliciously the cia's vault 7 leaks in early 2017 even discuss how ordinary USB sticks can be weaponized and turned into bad USBs a black cat's talk in 2014 propelled the band USB to Fae helping it to earn its place in hacker history and culture in recent years I myself have become infatuated with them and made quite a few videos on how you can make a bad USB yourself though with a really cheap Arduino development board instead of shelling out 50 dollars for a USB rubber ducky eventually you guys wanted me to look at making my own version of the bad USB to make available to buy and so I got to work the idea behind this prototype was that you could store up to 16 different ducky scripts on a micro SD card and switch between them using an onboard set of dip switches the whole thing ran a top arduino and hence i decided to call the final products meld we know I do have a how it's made video up on them which I'll link in the description if you're interested you might have even spotted them all do we know in the ad spots near at the beginning of this video link in description if you're interested I've also made a few videos on DIY in iteration of the bad USB which comes bundled with wireless capabilities it's probably a little too tricky for beginners to set up though it allows you to control the bad USB from far via a Wi-Fi hotspot enabling a whole new range of scenarios that it'll work in there are many other permutations of the bad USB however for example by installing net hunter on a compatible Android phone you can turn your mobile phone into a bad USB device net hunter is basically a permutation of Kali Linux made to run on phones let me know if you want a video on that something similar and more advanced can be done with a Raspberry Pi using pone PI a free to use USB attack platform that I've already made a few videos on recently here's a super simple mostly non malicious example of ducky syrups just to get the idea across this script simply presses Alt + f4 together every few minutes closing whatever window is open more of a stupid simple prank than anything useful a short delay at the beginning of the script is often used to allow the bad USB time to be initialized by the target computer after which it just taps alt and air for every few minutes slowly driving insane at the poor soul who happens to be sat at the PC now this does show one downside of ducky scripts in that there are no functions or ways to repeat blocks of code it's simply executed line by line now this can be remedied by coding a mult we know or using pond Pines evolution of ducky scripts which allows for liberal use of Java scripts within a ducky script if you want to learn more about how Aki script works and how you can become an expert ducky scripts err in just five minutes I'll leave some links in the description this video is sponsored by PCV way needs PCB way link is in the description so let me know what you think down in those comments is there anything bad USB related you want me to talk about I'm all is make sure to LIKE this video if you like to subscribe and hit that notification bell and as always stay tuned for more hacking videos have a good one
