oh do we ever have a spectacle for you guys today right here in my hands is a tiny computer and I do not mean this laptop we have actually jammed the entire tiny computer in side the laptop in its hard drive bay check this out check this out this crazy that my friend is an entire computer it's not gonna light your world on fire or play the latest games at the highest frame rates but it will run Windows so let's try that shall we [Music] the link below so ZOTAC is no stranger to the mini PC game in fact they've got it all over their packaging the original mini PC we made the original we made the original but even pay have never done anything this small so this thing is not much bigger than a credit card I mean obviously it's thicker but it is not much larger than a credit card so inside this device you will find an Intel Celeron and 3350 processor 4 gigs of RAM that is ddr3 memory so low-power ddr3 memory you'll find 32 gigs of storage and surprisingly actually more expandability than some modern flagship smartphones like the iPhone so you get your power button here as well as an indicator LED you've got your DC 5 volt 3 amp input it's kind of a bummer that that's a USB micro-b it's not the most durable connector you've got a microSD slot so that means that the 32 gigs of emmc storage that are already soldered on can be expanded Windows will just see that as a normal Drive some tablets already do this like Microsoft Surface lineup for example and then over here you've got two USB sees that also serve as DisplayPort outputs and it even includes some dongles so this is one of those situations where because what you're gonna be able to do with it depends on the dongles that you've got for it and unboxing actually kind of makes sense so we've got one of those same power - I swear I've seen this before this is the same one that comes with the Dropcam we've got a power cord we've got a little mount so you can throw this on the back of a monitor or something like that I guess you just put like one screw through the base of thing not the most amazing amount I've ever seen then you've got a few different prong options for the power thing here oh wow so you actually just fold that in and then do that oh that is a weird international adapter let's fire it up shall we all right so let's plug this in plug that in plug that baby in hi this amazing how tiny this thing is also fun fact the cooling is all taken care of by the ribbed metal chassis this thing is completely fanless and it's not even heavy like it's it's about the same weight as the SSD that we used for our size comparison a few minutes ago it's madness so with this single dongle that they include we actually get an HDMI output and we get 2 USB 3 ports so that'll be everything that we need to run this thing that's it that's the whole computer you know that you've reached full dongle Ã¤j-- when your dongle is the size of the computer this is so crazy like this is a computer wow it's getting warm already full you're interesting so I mean first order of business is obviously Cinebench right no how long does it take okay maybe I'll just take Alex's word for it what's our score sure Wow it is a dual core without hyper-threading clocked at a whopping 1.1 gigahertz I'm gonna guess 2045 okay hey not bad oh yeah here it is you've already got the score cache from last time so that is less than 1/10 the speed of a 5 generation old mobile processor realistically something like this is intended more for digital signage applications or like the POS terminal in the local clothing store or whatever the case may be it's designed to be seen not heard and just perform basic functionalities so could it do something like play an HD youtube video because for better or for worse intel has baked GPUs onto the vast majority of their consumer CPUs and that's annoying for those of us who just want more CPU performance in which they use more die area for that but it's good for people who want to buy very low-end stuff and rely on the GPU to accelerate applicable tasks so let's go ahead and even scrolling is a little rough got that got that delay all right let's look up a really cool channel - tech tips so this thing's support 4k output oh boy so yes we are running at 4k right now but only at up to 30 Hertz so this is HDMI 1.4 not hdmi 2.0 meaning that you're stuck with a couple of 1920 by 1080 displays running at 60 Hertz or a single 4k running at 30 Hertz oh wow the NCIX bankruptcy auction is still the channel trailer so this is interesting it's not a great experience because even like full screening and then going back to windowed mode on the video is pretty choppy oh and we saw we saw hiccup there but YouTube actually defaulted to 4k playback for us here and other than the fact that the audio is not coming through which could be any number of things I'm not going to blame it on this this is actually playing back pretty well I bet it's running worm though oh it is oh that's toasty it's working hard so the CPUs not struggling as much when we're full screened but it has a harder time when we're running in the browser now ZOTAC is known for a couple of things one of them as many pcs but one of them is overclocking so I wouldn't put it past them to put some overclocking capabilities into their BIOS turbo mode hey oh cool okay should we enable power limit one no right let's disable the power limit here we go alright we're firing up task manager let's see if we get so whoa this thing is running at 2.3 gigahertz now I'm sure we have no way of guaranteeing that it's not going to you know overheat without some additional cooling and to be clear it's still not super powerful Microsoft account background task was consuming 40% of the CPU there but maybe this will give us a little bit more Headroom for our YouTube experience here Oh did it just shut down it just oh yeah it shut down hard I bet we need a more powerful well wart oh it's really hot you know if you need additional cooling though I bet you could just hold the thing like this it's like water cooling it with your blood you know because it'll take the heat away and then your body will dissipate it as sweat so I found this Huawei supercharged adapter down in the warehouse it claims to be 4.5 volts 5 amps + 5 amps whatever that means but it's heavy it's definitely not completely broken so that's good okay do you want a water cool it for me yeah like just hold your hand on it uh oh yeah I guess we could put a fan on it wait did it just shut down again Oh the LEDs red well this is one of the risks of overclocking you don't usually break your hardware but you do occasionally corrupt your LS I can feel it heating up right now as it tries to load Windows like just went red alright fine we can disable or enable the power safety thing all right but I'm leaving on turbo num locks not doing anything so the other thing I don't know is if this thing being rated for four and a half volts is affecting it in some way it was worth a shot if I had one of the old one plus - Chargers not scripted legitimately didn't realize that was there okay we're booted off the - target and we still have the turbo mode enabled 1.88 100 can we settle for a 100% overclock Alex yeah we can settle for that even if Microsoft account background crap is huh that's still 40% CPU utilization alright alright let's wait for that to settle down and then we'll go ahead and try out youtube again task manager is pulling 26% of the CPU interesting so you know what I bet skiing on here is there's only so much power for both the CPU and GPU and if we let the CPU turbo up there's not enough left to play back 4k video which would obviously be a priority for a device like this although yeah it does look like it's fine now doesn't it so if we want to run a game we're probably better off turning off that setting aren't we good okay let's uh Nover clock and play some worms shall we I still remember playing worms 3d on like my buddy's like Pentium 2 so if this can't handle it I'm gonna be pretty disappointed that's a logo I've not enjoyed on my screen in a while ok that's some pretty broken stuff right there and none of my hotkeys work oh that one works test manager will not come up though all right so maybe this will let us at least get to the menus okay that's different here we go start a quick game it's only 720p but hey that's running pretty well oh it's still not actually perfect 60fps how are you supposed to even control this this is stupid oh okay and I think we're done here anyone who thought that the mouse arrow changing its direction depending on which direction you were moving was a good idea I'm glad that those people are all out of game development now because that's awful okay so clearly some of the stuff we did today was not how the mini PC Z box pi2 25 was intended to be used it's for industrial applications digital signage that kind of thing and honestly for that it's just fine if this was a review I guess that would be the conclusion it's not a gaming box and if you were expecting it to be then you were unreasonable like me but it would have been pretty cool if we could have overclocked it you know what else would we're gonna have that linked in the video description so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured in the video description not for gaming but maybe for like Enix serve thin clients get it thin clients cuz they're thin also linked in the video description is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join you guys didn't laugh at thin clients
