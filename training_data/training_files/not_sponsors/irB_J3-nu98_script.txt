runescape has had a lot of crazy lawsuits and court cases in its past as it's been around for almost two decades I've covered a few of the more serious ones a couple times which you should be able to check out in the description but today I'm going to be looking at a few less well-known or forgotten ones including one that actually ended up setting an entire country's precedents on virtual goods and win against a stance jagex has to this day you just click the inbox button in the top right to receive all of your rewards so first up this case is probably the most important one on the list back in 2007 a boy was biking home from school when two teenagers threatened him with violence to come into one of their homes and log into his runescape account they forced him to trade over his gold and amulet and a mask it's believed the amulet and mask actually ended up being a Fury amulet and a green Halloween mask which at the time was worth a couple hundred US dollars they then kicked him out of the house and the boy went home the two boys ended up getting taken to court by the boy's family where the first two judges ruled that as the runescape ulis States the only belonged to Jagex and says the items were still in the game no theft had actually occurred however once it got to the Dutch Supreme Court they decided that the items did count as property and as a result the two teens were sentenced to 200 hours and a hundred sixty hours of community service respectively you may be wondering how they actually ended up deciding this and overturning what the other court said it's pretty simple to be honest the items were sold on eBay for real-life money this is really major because it's one of the first times digital goods were considered someone's property in a court of law like I said at the beginning of the video it goes against the runescape and user License Agreement which states all intellectual property or other rights in any game character account content virtual currency and virtual items in the Jagex products are and will remain the property of jagex and/or its licensers you were only granted limited permission which can be revoked at any time to use such content or Jagex product this more or less goes against entirely with the Dutch Supreme Court ruled as more and more products go digital I'm really interested to see if this ruling will stand and if other countries may end up citing it in future rulings about similar topics this next one I included because the author knows almost nothing about runescape and it made me laugh a little bit so it's talking about how a 23 year old stole 284 runescape accounts the reasoning the author gives is the arrested hacker did not steal the accounts to sell police believe the man who has not been named simply wanted to boost his own standing in the computer game I'm gonna be honest you don't fish 284 accounts just to look cool to other people in fact I'd probably do the opposite for most runescape players the author goes on to describe the game saying the most popular characters chosen by players are wizards Rangers and fighters well the most feared monster is the corporal beast which eats Souls which does actually make some sense although it is worded a little weird however he goes on to say players can also by magical potions including one to maintain age your spots disappear and I have absolutely no clue what he means by this if you have any idea please let me know as I am interested in trying to figure out what he means [Music] this next one is the most recent one and probably the most ridiculous one it's been making its rounds on Twitch and recently on Reddit more or less a runescape streamer was muted and he decided that instead of just dealing with it he would file a handwritten lawsuit saying this violated his constitutional rights and that it was a violation of his human rights there's a slight problem with this Jagex is based in the United Kingdom and is a private company so it's about as far away from the United States Constitution as you can get as you can guess this case was closed very fast in fact it was actually less than a week but he didn't end up stopping there since then he's filed more and more suits against Jagex with his latest one again being dismissed by the court I don't really know what else to say on this one besides we'll see what happens my guess is he'll probably just get dismissed again and again until he eventually gives up as I don't really see this going anywhere this one isn't a real lawsuit but I wanted to include it because I thought it was funny and it might also raise some awareness a player got an email supposedly from Jagex saying that he was being sued for trying to sell his runescape account or items for real life money however the player hadn't done this and hadn't played in at least three years the best part of this obvious phishing email is that it was signed by mod mark who was a game developer he is absolutely nothing to do with legal aspects of the company the top response to this reddit thread is simply you are stupid for our final case we have rune light versus Jagex rune light is currently the most popular client for old school runescape those of you who play mobile or are new to the game may not know this but jagex actually threatened a lawsuit against rune light back in 2018 but why well I'm going to keep it short and sweet rune light back then had a few features that jagex didn't really like mainly that it was completely open-source originally they gave absolutely no examples of what these were and told the developer that the entire project must be shut down and gave absolutely no specifics about the copyright infringement claims and only said legal action would be taken as you would expect this blew up in Jackson's face very fast overnight it became one of the most up voted posts in the subreddits history it actually managed to shake the entire gaming and software community as well with a post on our slash games getting over 6,000 of votes soon after Jagex withdrew their statement and said they'd work with red light to remove the features they disliked to put the main one and easy to understand words it deconstructed the default clients code and made it easier for people to make BOTS however at the time it was already easy for bata to get their hands on a deconstructed client so that left everyone wondering why why didn't I guys just work with them from the beginning will honestly never really know for sure some people think it's because of another client OS buddy it was rumored jagex received a cut of their revenue with rune light which at the time was an up-and-coming client including all of us buddies features and being free it was a pretty big threat to their revenue on the other hand it's possible this was just a big mistake it was the first time old school had dealt with a situation like this and it was likely just mismanaged so before I go I just want to let you know that I've been pretty active in my discord and clan chat lately feel free to join one or both of them I'm almost always there and if you'd like you can shoot me some video ideas or just talk but that's all I have for today I have a few more of these cases available that I could do another video on if you found this one entertaining so let me know in the comments if that's something you'd like to see I will see you soon [Music]
