hello everyone how's it going it's me tim dodd the everyday astronaut it is a huge huge day in space flight history uh this is the first time we're finally going to be see uh seeing people come back home from space uh after being on the international space station for about two months but they're on a brand new vehicle this is spacex's crew dragon capsule oh man uh so yeah we're here today guys we're gonna we're gonna tune in here but i'm gonna give you guys a really quick rundown just in case you guys missed the video that i posted this morning giving you a full rundown we do have an article version of that video so if you guys want to know how do they re-enter you know what are the mechanics involved what are the actual pieces of hardware how do those thrusters work how does the deorbit burn work uh phasing orbits all that stuff i've got you covered uh worked basically since last time you guys ever saw me i've just been like head down working on this stuff but let me show you guys something here real quick we do have an article version of this um and it's uh so if you go to everydayastronaut.com you can click on a video about how do you get back down to earth from orbit how nasa astronauts bob and doug get home and so the timeline that we're looking today uh they're right about to do their deorbit burn so i want to tune into that really quick but i want to show you the criteria that they've had to go through to get there they have a lot of considerations here there's seven landing sites that they had to choose from right um and they basically look at all the different sites their weather so you can't have wind greater than 16.5 kilometers an hour 15 feet per second at the splashdown zone wave period and height must not be the same or greater than a seven degree wave slope less than a 25 probability of rain specifically a 25 decibel on the relative to z on the weather radar i don't know either lightning can be within 16 kilometers or greater it's a beautiful day out there uh they've been showing some clips every now and then of the landing area uh the recovery helicopter must pass a basically have to fire up the helicopter make sure the helicopter is good to go uh which they can use for recovery operations uh there could not be and then the all the helicopter has all these extra criteria as well like the boat it's gonna land on uh can't really be like tipping around too much uh they have to have good visibility as well but right now we're coming in so this is the descent entry and landing here so um basically we're right around here the recovery vessel go navigator uh or wait sorry uh we're coming up here on trunk cargo section is jettison so that's gonna be the first thing that we see right before um they do the deorbit burn the deorbit is how they get home um sorry i'm realizing you guys are probably seeing like kind of half this stuff does that make it better there we go so um we're coming up right now uh it is local time i can maybe pull up the local time if i maybe i can but local time right now is 12 23 and at 1 50 and at 12 51 that's when the cargo trunk is about to be jettisoned so i'm thinking we're probably gonna just tune in here really soon and um let's see here and and uh let me get my patrons up here there we go discord hi guys there you are i was in the wrong i was in the wrong room all right so let's go ahead and i'm gonna tune in because there's gonna be probably a lot of listening from me today i'll be i'll be trying to answer you guys questions but there's already people talking there's already lots of things going on so thank you uh everyone everyone that's that's already uh saying hi and uh memberships and stuff like that i really really really appreciate it um but i this is probably not the time or the place that i'm going to be able to really sit there and uh and be able to and like focus on sorry about that i was all busy fixing the clock and i forgot that obs does that to me okay so anyway we're gonna just go ahead and tune in here real quick and uh and listen to what they're working on because there's probably a lot of stuff we can learn and like i said uh i'm i'm i'm mostly just gonna be listening here because i wanna learn along with this stuff too but i'll try to answer you guys questions when we can and i'm going to try and uh and and afterwards stick around after they land after they're recovered we'll answer a bunch of guys questions so i'm sorry if i can't get to everyone today i'll be trying my best but let's just tune in here and see what's going on that is when we'll start the deorbit burn and again that'll be the longest burn of dragon's return journey the latest timeline we got had it lasting for about 11 minutes and 22 seconds it'll be the last firing of those forward bulkhead thrusters the four draco's the very top of dragon that'll eventually be covered up by the nose cone following the deorbit burn and as we've said before that deorbit burn is what commits them to coming home when that happens that capsule is re-entering the earth's atmosphere and that'll put them essentially on a collision course with planet earth it lines up their their orbit to intersect with that splashdown point in the gulf of mexico so real quick as far as the pointy end up fleemy and down goes what the weight on that i think until the until we actually get to the main parachutes deploying and then we'll be able to tell you know whether or not the pointy end is up and what was the flaming end which was the heat shield is down that'll be our time to confirm uh like i said we actually have that in there too uh i think andrew if we can move pointy end up flamie and down all the way down to after the main shoe is deployed because that's really the time that it matters almost the most i think it matters the whole time frankly because obviously as they re-enter they need to be able to have that heat shield facing forward but luckily having a big blunt body heat shield like this is extremely passively stable we still have some questions coming in again if you have one jump over on twitter use the hashtag ask nasa so the the cool thing like i said the cool thing about the uh the dragon capsule design in most capsules is that the the bottom of it is is relatively flat and what what that means is it's extremely stable you literally would have the hardest time trying to get it to flip around and that's a good thing because when you have the heat shield uh that is experiencing the maximum heat and the heat isn't necessary people always say air friction it's not really air friction the heat comes from the air not being able to get out of the way fast enough and it gets compressed so imagine like you know this thing's coming screaming into the atmosphere 10 times faster than a bullet and the air just can't get out of the way fast enough and so what happens is the air gets compressed and when you compress something it ends up heating up and heating up so much that it actually turns into a plasma and that plasma ends up being about half as hot as the surface of the sun so it's unbelievably hot so that heat shield needs to be facing forward that is that is the thing that helps it and ensures the survivability of the crew and vehicle banda so i'm so i'm kind of listening here right now they're kind of asking questions but i want to go ahead and answer some of your questions uh we'll talk about this a little bit more when when they do the deorbit burn but one of the things that i wanted to talk about is how the deorbit burn is actually done from the nose so they actually face forward to do the deorbit burn then they flip around it's kind of like the space shuttle to distill burn backwards and then face around nose first this is the opposite of that like it faces nose first and flips around backwards and uh the reason they do that is there's the the thrusters the draco thrusters that are underneath the nose cone that are facing forward um have a few advantages over the other 12 that are around the the base of the vehicle and that's that they're firing straight on so you don't have any cosine losses you don't have any losses you know being angled at all so they're straight on so they're nice and efficient that way they're also a longer nozzle because they're not uh they're called it's being sleeved and canted where some of those thrusters are actually cut at an angle to fit alongside the exterior of the spacecraft these ones are straight on they're a traditional nozzle so you get a little bit better vacuum efficiency uh because they're not they're not uh cantered and they're not they're not scarved as well um and yeah it's uh pretty cool so let's listen in here real quick starting so we're looking at that to really pick up at about 10 48 as we'll start getting into the attitude for trunk separation and then we start basically executing a bunch of steps that are going to commit bob and doug to this reentry yeah we're looking forward to those uh it will be it'll be quite the journey now of course uh with respect to the deorbit burn bob and doug will remain in their seats and strapped in for the entire duration in fact they won't be exiting those seats until they are being uh until they're able to egress or exit the capsule after it has splashed down and been recovered out of the ocean and safely resting in the nest of the recovery vessel along that note our next twitter question is from brett the question is what is the orientation of the astronauts when seated as in do they face the front or the top of the capsule and do they find it comfortable great question there so in the views that we just had a couple minutes ago they were uh i guess what we would call i think maybe what we should do here is since we have a little bit smaller audience then we can we can answer you guys questions a little bit easier um let me go ahead and i'm going to get to some of your guys's questions because there's a lot of stuff to get going on here so um let's see here this is a good question from uh from kai asks hey tim just like the falcon 9 is it possible to record a video of the re-entry that is external with no comms like the re-entry profile the falcon 9. so kai's referring to you'll notice in our thing we actually show there's going to be a communication blackout where video will not be coming back down to us and uh and that's just because of that plasma interference it's really hard for there to be radio communications during that period there's about a six minute communication blackout while they're experiencing uh the maximum re-entry portion and uh so obviously we're not going to have video feeds from that and but they will be recorded locally because again you can't transmit uh radio signals through through hot plasma like that um and so they'll they there will be recorded video we have a lot of cool recorded videos from other space programs the space shuttle of course was was pretty nuts because you could actually they had those big forward-facing windows and the space shuttle kind of angled itself at about a 40 degree angle and so it's the plasma was literally coming up over the nose but because the windows were inside the wake of of the entire orbiter uh inside the wake of like the whole heat shield the plasma was basically coming up over the windows and it just looks so intimidating and so scary i just feel like it'd be really scary to be sitting there just being like right there literally just two meters from my face is something that's literally half as hot as the surface of the sun it'd be about like touching the sun um and so there will be there will be recorded video i'm sure locally and hopefully we get some of that as soon as possible so all right why is the dragon um orbiting in an elliptical pattern between the hemispheres is it to naturally slow or is it to save propellant use no it actually has nothing to do with propellant use or anything like that the reason it shows up on a map you'll notice that the orbits go up and down like this on a map and you might be like what the heck is that like what are they doing they're stuck on an orbit they're going like this they're continually just going around and around the earth but because they're doing this the earth is also spinning underneath them now i talked about this a little bit in the video that i just posted this morning so after this is all done you should check out that video because i talk about is considered that's part of the phasing and the inclination so the international space station and therefore the dragon capsule which was just at the international space station is tilted at 51.6 degrees so it's at a pretty steep angle going around the earth constantly right and the earth is spinning underneath it so if you plot that out on a two-dimensional flat map like that it'll the ground path where the actual orbit is goes up high to 51.6 degrees north and then slopes goes past the equator it goes down to 51.6 degrees south and then jumps back up and it just makes this wave pattern this oscillating wave pattern but the thing that's hard also to remember is that not only is it doing that so so the spacecraft is going around the earth about every 90 minutes but the earth is also spinning so every 24 hours obviously the earth will make a lap but um so it's it's nutty stuff honestly it's really it's really quite impressive that they have it all figured out absolutely perfectly so it has nothing to do with saving propellant or to slow it down at all that's just the path that it's on and nothing's going to change that until you uh introduce energy so you can or in this case like re remove energy from uh from the body from from the spacecraft because right now it is going so fast it took that whole falcon 9 rocket to get it that fast right in order to get it back down from that speed you have to take energy away it doesn't just you know you can't just make energy disappear and be like i'm going to stop now so in order to do that uh that's one of the good things about using about having the atmosphere on earth the atmosphere is a positive and a negative when you're coming back it's really hard because you know it's very punishing it's very hard to get through it has temperatures and and pressures in extreme environments that are that are really really hard to design around but at the same time it can actually remove the energy of this the vehicle remove the velocity so it's exchanging kinetic energy the velocity of the spacecraft and literally exchanging it for heat just like brake pads of a car right when you have brake pads literally all it's doing it's clamping onto the brake pad it's creating localized friction that friction turns into heat and it's actually dissipated through heat the energy is disappearing disappearing or being converted into heat from kinetic energy into heat energy this is almost the same exact thing this is a giant brake pad and the the energy is being transferred from kinetic energy compressing the air the air is slowing it down but because it's compressing the way the energy gets taken out of the equation is through heat and the heat shield will literally flake off a little bit and take some of the heat away with it wicking heat away it's called an ablative heat shield so it's intentionally going to be kind of falling apart just a little bit letting stuff go the heat goes away with it so that's how it's slowly converting it's kinetics 10 times faster than a bullet energy and letting the atmosphere scrub away that velocity and exchanging that for heat and that's the type of stuff to me that's like whoever figured all this stuff out i mean that is just absolutely wild stuff um yeah so um let's see here so i i'm trying to find questions here um i again i really appreciate you guys with with all your tips and everything but i do want to stick to to questions right now since this is definitely one of those things that has a lot of questions so this comes from cigar says when the capsule flips from the nose to the heat shield is it normally safe to do that because won't the capsule body sustain damage love and prayers from india so when the capsule flips from nose to to the shield is it normally safe to do that so when they do the de-orbit burn so i think the question is when they do the deal when they're facing nose first right and they have the the nose cone open right and they're going to do that 11 and a half minute burn 11 minute and 20 second burn i think is what it's currently calculated and that changes based on their exact orbital parameters down to like the millisecond basically so they can nail their target so when they're doing that they're still in space and then once they're done they're still in space it's not like they're done with their door but we're almost like oh we're falling and we're in the atmosphere you know it's like they you end up slowing down enough that eventually you come in contact with the atmosphere almost on the opposite side of the planet and since you're orbiting every 90 minutes it takes a good 20 30 minutes to really start experiencing atmosphere um or any kind of significant atmospheric pressure and don't forget the atmosphere doesn't just turn off like at the line of space so we define space as a hundred kilometers 62 miles in altitude it's not like there's atmosphere and then when you get to that all of a sudden there's no more atmosphere and now you're in space the atmosphere just tapers which is why there's huge altitude different you know even air pressure that we can experience as humans between different cities like if you've ever been to maybe denver colorado it's a mile high you know 1.6 kilometers in altitude basically or adesa baba is like i think two miles in altitude or something it's like three or four thousand meters in altitude it's a it's a very high city um uh there's lots of other you know then mount everest obviously people have to wear oxygen that's because the atmosphere tapers it's not like the atmosphere just ends it's not like oh we're at this altitude there's no more atmosphere and even where they are right now even where the international space station is there's still a little bit of atmosphere it just tapers out eventually you get to the point where it's like virtually no no molecules air molecules at all but in low earth orbit there's certainly some air some air molecules so once they flip around they have a long time still they have they have several minutes before they even remotely begin to experience any some kind any substantial atmospheric pressure okay so i'm still listening here to make sure there's there's none of that rushing air they'll get some of that uh once they're further down uh during their descent and then they're also able to hear when the draco thrusters fire and one of the really cool things they've done to train the crew is spacex had a number of microphones placed throughout the cabin during that demo on flight last year and they were able to record what it sounded like inside through all of the major uh all of the major burns the launch the descent landing everything and in the trainer upstairs here at hawthorne at spacex headquarters they have speakers set up where as they're doing simulations or practice runs of the different phases of the mission they're able to hear what it should sound like inside dragon as they're going through that so i know that's one thing bob pointed out is one of the things they're looking for is does this sound like i was expecting it too does this look like is that a light i'm supposed to see all of those different things that for them is like reflex by the time they've trained it this much that's awesome all right let's take another question from you guys again i'm kind of going to be trying to listen in here um so when we actually get to the the next part which uh i just want to make sure we're not missing any milestones here um and sorry we're trying to get it so that our timeline will will light up and show you what the next sequence of events actually is uh but yeah we're having problems with the the way that our file system sinks so yeah oh we are less than 10 minutes away from this sequence starting we are just about nine minutes away in fact and first we'll see that maneuver where we'll get into the proper attitude or point dragon really in the right direction for the claw and trunk separation we're essentially going to do a 90 degree yaw maneuver turn dragon sideways to to make sure the trunk goes out and away not coming out in front of or behind the capsule essentially re-entering the atmosphere with the capsule we're going to avoid that and then dragon will position itself for the deorbit burn it's going to point those forward bulkhead thrusters into the direction that it's currently traveling this is called a retrograde maneuver and this is done specifically to we're going to slow the capsule down but more than anything we're changing the the perigee or the lowest point of the capsule's orbit again essentially putting it up on an intersection point with that spot in the gulf where we're coming home now notice that he said what's interesting so the retrograde burn which what's weird about this the retrograde burn is actually facing pro-grade that's because the thrusters they use it doesn't it's all arbitrary right like it doesn't necessarily matter you could use a thruster that's sticking off the side of your spacecraft if you needed to for some reason it doesn't matter which direction you're facing in space there's no atmospheric pressure to like you know make a difference in that so they actually use the top uh four thrusters that are under the nose cone they're draco thrusters they use those four which are facing at the top so they're facing prograde they basically point their nose forward towards the direction of travel and they do their they'll feel like they're literally hitting the brakes very little because the thrust of weight ratio is like 0.05 uh to 1 thrust weight ratio is what i think we calculated for the the draco thrusters i've got so even when they're all firing they're barely it's not like they're gonna be like whoa we're slamming on the brakes and just barely feel the lightest little pressure like you know almost no pressure on the restraints and they'll slowly slow down but they're going to do that facing forward and then they'll flip around so it is it's a retrograde burn but they're doing it facing pro grade which um which is uh kind of you i mean i can't maybe it's not actually that well let me think about that no i think that's actually pretty normal to do i'm trying to think of how like apollo did that um but yeah anyway pretty cool stuff again these are the kind of things that i think is just fun to think about and and yeah let's see here um why do they place the deorbit thrusters under the cap that's a great question uh razzabot so that's again asking about you know the the top four thrusters are literally underneath the nose cone of of the dragon capsule and you know what i don't have the best answer to that um i'm trying to think about it from an engineering standpoint if if they knew that that they're going to gain the most efficiency again by not having cosine losses that's like you know if you have thrusters pointing straight they're going to be you know basically 100 of their energy that's shooting that way it'll all go the opposite direction right if you angle them out at any at any angle you're experiencing what's called cosine losses where you're starting to put you know yeah you're moving it still in the direction you're attending but you're also pushing in towards the spacecraft you're losing some of that energy to basically just compressing the spacecraft a little bit and so if they wanted them to be facing straight up they can't really do that on the along the the body lines of the vehicle because don't forget that it's tapered those walls are at like a i don't know 15 degree angle or whatever it is so if you want those thrusters to point straight up you can't just like stick them on the outside edge of the thing it just it literally physically wouldn't fit it would just be weird you have to follow those body lines so in order to make it so they do point straight up you can hide them underneath that nose cone and that and okay dragon spacex for deorbit we just go ahead all right doug we are five minutes out from the orbit sequence start in addition i just wanted to inform you we are expecting some ratty calm during claw and trunk set due to vehicle orientation okay we see 4 45 left for the uh slu and then randy comes during the clock good read back doug so what they're saying is they're basically in the middle of orienting the spacecraft so they can ditch the trunk so the dragon capsule has the dragon capsule it also has the dragon trunk attached to the bottom of it and that's held on by this they're calling it the claw and it goes around the heat shield and connects to the side of the spacecraft and that that's so that they can um that has all of the heat exchangers so the the heat pumps the heat radiators are on the trunk and on the opposite side there's solar panels those solar panels obviously provide electrical power to the vehicles so they deorbit that before um before they de-orbit because the dragon trunk is intentionally burning up on re-entry they actually want to put like space trash in there literally like international space station they put some stuff they want to throw away in this trunk and they let it deorbit and they let it burn up um but they actually let go of the trunk before the deorbit burn but it takes a while you know so they do that so that there's no chance that there being any kind of collision but i'm gonna listen to this real quick here bob and doug were in their last orbit around earth uh i i can't remember what the number was that you you quoted earlier dan but they have done thousands of orbits around earth during their two-month duration on station so it is really exciting that the line that we see on that trajectory map uh is no longer you know fully around it they're they're coming home we're not we're not seeing two lines showing what their next orbit is going to be they are on their final orbit of planet earth and this is their 1024th orbit around our planet since they launched back in may of earlier this year so we're counting down we're under three minutes away from that first maneuver and that's going to be a slew as you heard doug radio down and that's essentially we're going to change the attitude we're going to use those draco thrusters to essentially spin dragging about 90 degrees to the side so we can jettison that trunk and that'll be done in the two stages we'll do the claw separation and then the trunk separation two minutes 32 seconds and counting this is where things really pick up this is where we really commit to coming home and this is where we're in kind of the final stages of bob and doug's trip in outer space and pretty soon we'll be seeing them in the gulf of mexico yeah well they are staying comfortable and continuing to monitor data and telemetry in the vehicle dragon is actually doing a couple of things itself to prepare for this deorbit sequence again that's doing these things autonomously uh it's isolating the thermal control system loops from the radiator this is the system that will help keep bob and doug cool uh while they are re-entering the atmosphere like we've said before the external temperature will reach 3500 degrees fahrenheit and that thermal control system is what helps keep them cool during that time also dragon is initiating the separation of the claw mechanism which will terminate the data the power and the fluid connect and the fluid connections between the capsule and the trunk so right now the vehicle is preparing to execute that and we are anticipating execution of claw separation in three minutes and 35 seconds so you know we've been here for 10 hours i think at this point the webcast as a whole has been going on for almost a little bit less than 24 hours so you know we're in the final moments here as dragon is beginning it's it's journey home uh to bring bob and doug back to earth this is this is the moment that dragon is in the position to start coming home the recovery team's already on station they have been for a while out there off the coast of pensacola we are less than a minute from starting all of these carefully choreographed sequences to essentially split dragon in half get rid of that trunk so we have the capsule i'll point the heat shield back down towards earth following that deorbit burn and then we bring them home we are just about 30 seconds away now from maneuvering dragon to get ready to get rid of that claw first and then that trunk separation there will be about a 35 second difference or 35 second jump from separating the claw to separating the trunk and we'll keep our eyes on the ground track for you and make sure we get kind of exact locations of when these separation events are occurring we're looking for both the claw in the trunk to separate cleanly and then it'll be less than five minutes until we do the deorbit burn yeah and after that it'll dragon spacex deorbit sequence start all right sweet here we go great news never copied all right so the draco thrusters on dragon starting to fire yes now moving its way over to the trunk jettison attitude should be about two minutes away from the claw separation it's beginning everybody for those of you that are just tuning in you are just in time at this point in the mission we are now beginning to execute the final steps of dragon endeavour's return to earth right now we are performing the claw separation slew which basically means dragon is maneuvering itself into position into the proper attitude in order to separate the dragon trunk and that will be initiated first by separation of the claw the claw is the mechanism that attaches uh the trunk and the vehicle excuse me and the capsule together the claw is what delivers power and telemetry and fluids and we need to expose the heat shield right now the trunk is blocking that so we will jettison the trunk and we will um then have uh allow us to maneuver into the proper attitude to perform the deorbit burn which dragon has performed a number of burns so far overnight uh and this early this morning and this will be the final burn that the vehicle has to perform for this mission we just heard confirmation dragons in the trunk separation attitude we are now standing by for claw separation again this is vital because luckily they have not committed to de-orbiting yet but so they could work issues if something had happened but the the dragon i just heard confirmation the trunk has to be removed in order to affirmation of clause okay so that's the claw but the trunk then jettisons about 30 seconds later with the claw separated we're now standing by for the trunk separation in less than 30 seconds 10 seconds till trunk separation and we just heard confirmation of trunk separation trunk separation coming at 10 52 a.m pacific with dragon flying over the indian ocean just off to the west of australia dragon spacex we showed nominal trunk jettison oh yeah we felt it all right so the crew just got the call nominal trunk separation that's exactly what we were looking for next up is going to be that that deorbit burn again this is the longest burn of their trip home this is the longest firing of those thrusters in the last time we're using those forward bulkhead thrusters exactly uh those forward bulkhead thrusters like dan just said that's what we're using to perform the de-orbit burn once we uh do that we will then be able that dior burn will last for 11 and a half minutes once that is completed we don't need to use those thrusters anymore so we will close and lock the nose cone in preparation for re-entry so we're a little under three and a half minutes from the start of the deorbit burn again our sequence of events has started we're able to separate that claw at 10 51 a.m pacific that's 1751 gmt or universal time and at 10 52 just a minute later the trunk separating while dragon was flying just off to the west of australia so claw separated trucks separated next up the orbit burn yeah right now uh dragon is running exclusively on battery power now that the trunk is separated also right now telemetry is looking really good for the vehicle the nitrox system is primed for cabin and suit cooling and the heat shield is exposed and ready for atmos atmospheric reentry like i said before that nitrox system which is essentially the air that we breathe every day down here on earth uh nitrogen oxygen combination mixture it's the same stuff that they put in your scuba tank if you are a scuba diver the nitrox system is used to cool the cabin and the suit to keep the crew comfortable during the reentry phase they will actually have cold air flowing through the their suits themselves as well as through the cabin itself so a two-pronged approach to maintaining a comfortable a comfortable temperature there inside the capsule like we said the next event that we have coming up will be the deorbit burn which we're expecting that to commence in one minute and 40 seconds okay so again this dior burn is extremely extremely low power so that's why it lasts 11. they're only slowing down about three percent like so to get up to orbit it took the entire falcon 9 rocket in two stages of it uh hundreds and hundreds uh just an insane amount of fuel insane amount of power to get home to the ground tracking map there dragon to get home all you need is literally like a tiny bit of thrust a tiny bit of delta v change enough to lower your orbit into the atmosphere now again it's not an immediate thing it's not like you go and like now we're in the atmosphere it's more like you slowly lower your atmosphere and that changes where you're going in the on the opposite side of the planet basically that's how orbits work which you speed up uh facing the area of your orbit your the opposites from the opposite of the planet that will raise your orbit if you slow down it will lower your orbit on the opposite side of the planet so that's why they're doing this deorbit burn basically just south of australia there because what that will do is it will lower the orbit to dip into the atmosphere you know somewhere starting around the equator ish or something and then you know as they re-enter it'll slowly get slower it'll begin getting slower and slower which will lower their orbit which will get slower and slower which will lower their orbit which will lower their altitude which will lower their orbit which will lower their speed which is lower there it just keeps going until eventually it's bled off all their speed and they can pop the shoots so that's basically what they're doing so they're aiming for this really precise target right at pensacola florida they have 11 and a half minutes basically to fine-tune their orbit fine-tune their deorbit burn and just absolutely precisely nail exactly where they're going to re-enter and then even while they're re-entering they can spin and move the the dragon capsule around because the heat shield actually has a lifting vector in it so they intentionally slightly offset the center of mass from the center of the heat shield and that creates it so that as it rotates around they can create a little bit of lift a little bit of drag and yeah i'm ready and i'm sure it's safe to say that bob and doug are ready they they've done a number of interviews over the last few weeks while they were on station and just the excitement and the enthusiasm for the mission is is palpable just the opportunity to be able to fly these two incredible humans to the international space station and back is such an honor and we're just really excited to get our space dads home safely and back to their families as quickly as possible this deorbit burn that we are currently in it will last 11 minutes and 22 seconds i love that precision already a little more than a minute 10 in counting so we have about 10 minutes to go just heard a call the propulsion system performing nominally that's the word we always want to hear we always like to hear just under 10 minutes to go left in this burn and all within the last 10 minutes again it seemed like we had slow progress of events all morning and then boom within the last 10 minutes we had a couple of things happening uh dragon maneuvered itself into the appropriate position to jettison its trunk uh and it did so successfully nominally and then it initiated the deorbit burn just a couple minutes ago like i mentioned earlier this deorbit burn is the last time those four forward draco thrusters will fire forward kind of meaning at the top of the capsule dragon endeavor has not yet entered earth's atmosphere but this deorbit burn is what will line the vehicle up and put it on its final trajectory to the landing site in the gulf of mexico right now although we can't see it at the moment bob and doug are using their screens to keep tabs on the burn duration draco fire excuse me draco thruster firings and trajectory details such as entry angle capsule perigee and how much distance is remaining until that deorbit burn terminates so dragon is flying itself so all they really have to do is stay strapped in their seats and keep tabs keep tabs on things i should let you guys know that our timeline is it's not going to be highlighting and activating uh it's just static so this is just so you know the the sequence of events unfortunately we can't the way that we normally sync this and operate uh is not working that's why we delayed the thing we're trying to fix it beforehand but they are static so that just gives you a good idea of what's coming up next so we can't unfortunately show you what has occurred uh yeah and we should also i know people are looking and pointing out that of course is elon musk right there front and center next to president uh gwen shotwell and gwen is uh basically elon's counterpart who really makes sure this whole system is running uh she's incredible uh elon and his team are obviously doing some really cool things this is a really big day for elon because obviously i think a lot of us are focused on this right now dm2 but at the same time we're expecting to potentially see uh starship serial number five the prototype starship vehicle do its first hop today too so it's a big huge day for spacex um a double uh it could be like a double header just an absolute knock out of the park um you know this would be the first time that a commercial partner commercial program has brought humans down from space they were obviously the first to bring that take them up to space and you know they'll be the first ones to bring them down as well so um so assuming this is all just an absolute home run we can tune in literally probably an hour or two later um probably you know about an hour to after splashdown we're going to keep our eyes on bocachica and see if they are doing serial number five stat uh the actual hop today on their rafter engine on their full flow stage combustion cycle raptor engine which there's a chance i'm not sure elon might be wearing his shirt right now it almost looks like it uh oh should we get some bets on what shirt it is all right let's listen in here attitude essentially heat shield pointed down and into the uh the line of velocity and that heat shield protecting them from the heat of reentry temperatures getting up to about 3 500 degrees on the dragon spacecraft but everything looking good we're about five minutes into this deorbit burn again it started right at 10 56 a.m pacific time uh 1756 56 gmt uh dragon was flying about 260 statute miles uh just off the southwestern coast of australia looks like our timeline is working so this now does show you the exact thing so uh yeah so now we can actually bring you along and tell you exactly where they're at so again they're doing currently in the middle of their deorbit burn somewhere south of the coast of australia and that will affect where they're at in the opposite side of the orbit it's gonna say we're probably about to see so right now during this burn we just heard a call that we're halfway through the burn and everything is looking great everything's performing nominally during this burn right now bob and doug are currently monitoring the deorbit tool which like i said earlier captures things like the perigee the re-entry interface how much time or excuse me how many mile how much distance remains before the burn itself is terminated they're also monitoring the burn duration and the firing of those draco thrusters located there at the on the forward bulkhead of the capsule there on your screen you actually can see what bob and doug are seeing right now that is that tool on their screen so on the left and the right of the center screen that is the deorbit that that is the deorbit monitor monitoring tool man that i love seeing those screens so um we should say that you know there are those four thrusters and the cool thing is there there's some redundancy there so those four thrusters perform this deorbit burn and the way that thrusters work is you can't throttle them so they're actually going like just kind of constantly alternating in a sense and that's how you kind of control how much power it's it's producing so they could actually have a thruster go out and just kind of alternate between some other ones and they can even use some of the lower thrusters there's actually four more that are those ones are angled uh that also can help in this maneuver as well so say and the whole thing's smart the whole system's smart so say a thruster would go out they can actually kind of start instantly basically firing up the other thrusters because it's basically in this like kind of like how a a drone or like a you know a quadcopter knows its own orientation all that stuff and it's just constantly trying to fix it and it uses whatever system is necessary to keep itself doing what it's intending to do so the dragon caps will be the same way if a thruster one of those four goes out for some reason then the other ones kind of like can can compensate for that and continue the burn exactly as planned which is pretty slick our new screen is a shot of our mission control center here at spacex headquarters in hawthorne california where the dragon operators and mission leaders are they're monitoring dragon's progress they continue to watch the propulsion data and all the gnc data making sure that everything is looking healthy and nominal so i'm if i can squeeze in some stuff um let's see this is from fallen gaming i can't wait to see the door overlapping about two minutes 30 seconds until the end got my coffee in hand just waiting to suggest everybody asked my coffee mug we do have everyday astronaut coffee mugs i think in the shop or at least we used to at shop.everydayastronaut.com or everydayastronaut.com shop we definitely used to have mugs maybe we're out but ready to close the nose cone that protecting the docking ring guidance navigation and control sensors and also these four forward bulkhead thrusters that are currently performing the deorbit burn during the actual reentry process so we are at just under two minutes from the conclusion of the deorbit burn again dragon is committed to its splashdown point there is no going back yeah we already have the recovery team ready and on standby they've been there for quite some time now here and we have about 90 seconds left in the burn weather looking great at the splashdown site off pensacola winds just around two and a half miles per hour uh c being described as like glass by the core here in hawthorne radio and up to the crew ended up getting fantastic weather for this first crude splashdown of dragon we are one minute away from the end of deorbit burn again this burn is placing dragon on its final trajectory to the landing site off of the coast of pensacola florida that is in the gulf of mexico and our recovery vessel go navigator and the recovery team are ready and waiting to see bob and doug come back through the atmosphere so stoked man like we said this deorbit burn uh during this two orbit burn they're not actually re-entering the atmosphere just yet that won't happen for about another half hour or so this is essentially just lining up dragon on the right course to that splashtown site still in an altitude of about 254 statute miles over planet earth we are coming up on 10 seconds from the end of the burn so we'll stand by and wait for the call out to the crew on the burn performance dragon spacex deorbit burn complete performance nominal nose cone closure initiated sweet as everything's normal can we get a normal in the chat so now the nose going to crack the orbit burn complete we heard the call nominal burn bob and doug are on their way back home this burn commits them to re-entering the earth's atmosphere oh all their all we have left now is to wait that was really one of the last major moments uh before they start re-entering the earth's atmosphere we'll have the nose cone closure coming up next that should be coming in just a couple of minutes as we had about a three minute span between the end of the deorbit burn at that moment yeah the nose cone is actually currently in the closing process so it doesn't just snap shut it does slowly close and lock so right now that nose cone is in the process of moving of moving back into the closed position and we will hear the call out for whenever it has fully closed and whenever not that nose cone available that if that stays open during re-entry that'd be very bad i think it'd probably interfere with the parachutes and things like that so i wonder if they have an emergency situation to be able to jettison the nose coming just in case they actually did have a but you know what when i was i got to sit in the the crew dragon oh my word i think i just answered my own question they had a button in the dragon simulator that said jettison nose cone and maybe they do actually have a mechanical way to detach a nose cone in case for some reason it didn't close properly wonderful we could ask a series so the first series will close and then the second will follow and that'll take about a minute to complete i'm going to ask elon is there a way to manually um is there a way to manually uh what did i say jettison nose cone in case there was an anomaly i never know how to spell anomaly an anomaly in the closing process all right well as we just wait for the finish to that nose cone closure we'll have a bit of time again we'll have about 20 minutes or a little over 21 from right now until we really start re-entering the earth's atmosphere we're expecting that entry interface in about 21 minutes and then right around that time we'll also be looking for that blackout we've been talking about we've had a little bit of what we call radicom at this point so you'll hear kind of some sporadic interruptions in the audio transmission just because of how dragon was oriented for the the trunk jettison and for the actual the orbit burn but that that blackout period will be due to the plasma that builds up around the capsule interfering with those antennas either sending or receiving data so i've heard the call out that the first set of hooks for nose cone closure are in motion so these this will complete in two sets the first set is now in motion so really good news to hear that everything looking good so far like i mentioned before in the background dragon has inhibited the forward bulkhead draco thrusters that we just used to complete that deorbit burn this is to ensure that it's safe to latch that nose cone shut for re-entry also the vehicle has initiated the nitrox purge nitrox is simply a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen it's what we breathe and the the nitrox that is being purged into the system is cooled so allowing that cool air to circulate around the cabin but also inside of bob and doug's suits will help to keep them cool and comfortable during re-entry which will be coming up in about 20 minutes yeah for those of you guys wondering about the camera people those are they're recording there for probably likely a documentary of some kind or something that's not those are not streaming cameras those are likely there for uh posterity here for some kind of production later on i did want to point out i think in the back in the blue mask on the left um let's see it might be just slightly out of frame there's i think that's benji reed principal uh dragon capsule dragon engineer we are latching the nose cone good currently underway with the first set of hooks the first of two sets and we just had confirmation that the first set of hooks is closed so now the second hit the second set will begin to close as well man this is pretty crazy i mean the last time the us did this was in 1981 for sts-1 with the space shuttle we don't really want to talk about how that one went because it was actually a really close claw a really close call um that was uh john young and uh and bob uh not bob banking crippen young and crippen was on sts-1 1981 and uh what was it april 12th because it's yuri's night right or yeah april 12th uh 1981 and they accidentally didn't realize this but the the main like there's a big main tail flap in the space shuttle that ended up uh basically getting a little bit jarred and it didn't have full control through through re-entry and and luckily they were it was a nice safe conservative reentry profile um but it was actually they looked on later review and they're like oh this could have been catastrophic and obviously the cool thing you know the space shuttle required all these big huge turns um in the upper atmosphere these big s turns to really really nail down its landing site and it just really wasn't as passively stable as something as simple as a dr as a dragon capsule or as a capsule in general the capsule shape being that gumdrop shape is incredibly passively stable so at this point say the spacecraft you know lost all control of his thrusters you know and as long as it's facing the right way to begin with even if it's not faith you could almost go nose first into the atmosphere and it's going to want to flip around to its heat shield that's how stable it is so it's an incredibly stable and you know inherently stable design this is the first time since 1981 that we've witnessed a new spacecraft in the united states go through this reentry process so it's definitely a momentous a very momentous occasion so yeah latching has completed good and we just heard a call out that the spacex nose cone is secure for entry we see it on board all right great confirmation there back and forth from mission control here to bob and doug up in dragon endeavor that bob and doug have can also confirmed on their displays that the nose cone has closed normally and it is secure for entry alright so that nose clone nose cone closed completion a lot of tongue twisters with this right now uh coming with dragon still flying over the south pacific it is on its way home we're gonna gradually start to see its altitude dip right now already only 207 miles over the earth's surface it was at about 260 miles when it was still over on the other side of the pacific ocean off the southwestern coast of australia whenever but but what dan's saying to you right now how is slowly lowering it's not remember it's not just falling straight down when you when you're in orbit you're spinning really fast you're flying 10 times faster than a bullet and you know you're going 28 kilometer or 28 thousand kilometers an hour it's about 17 and a half thousand miles an hour you're just absolutely screaming so all they're doing is they're slowing down a little bit which makes the orbit a little bit elliptical dipping part of the orbit into the atmosphere and letting the atmosphere to the rest of things so it's slowly it's just ever so slightly lowering its altitude right now while it's spinning while it's orbiting and then it will start to really kind of bite into the atmosphere uh probably off the coast of south america and that's when it will really start slowing down stepping into the second half of entry dragon is now beginning to flush nitrox into the cabin and continuing to top it off in bob and doug's suits as well again this is cool air essentially flowing through the cabin and the suits this is what will allow them and the cabin itself to remain comfortable during reentry while those external temperatures reach 3 500 degrees fahrenheit so um i did want to remind you guys something some exciting news that we got recently only about a week or two ago before this mission even wrapped nasa totally changed their mind about reusing the spacex dragon capsule there is originally talks for so long this whole process that they would never reuse the dragon capsule with crew they just thought they would reuse it for for cargo eventually just like you know with the crew with this is now the dragon 2 spacecraft so they have a crew variant and a cargo van the main difference cargo doesn't need the abort motors and life support and stuff like that so it's just a stripped-down version and the thought was going to be they're going to strip down the crew ones and use them for cargo but now we're already seeing and not only that they always were saying that they wanted to use brand new boosters brand new falcon 9 first stage boosters even though you know nasa is used to using uh reflown boosters or used boosters on a lot of their other missions all their crs missions and all that stuff it came out like a week or two ago that nasa's also like you know what we're we're actually we're going to going to go ahead and reuse this capsule we're that confident that it will come back in good enough shape to be refurbished safely and we're going to start reusing boosters as well so so upcoming in what is it sept end of august or september early september i think is going to be the crew one that'll be the first operational crew flight with four people and then about six months later um early 2021 they're going to reuse this exact same drag dragon capsule dragon capsule endeavor they're going to reuse it and re-fly it with four more astronauts on board already so they already made up their mind that you know it seems like everything is safe and good even though it splashes down and all that stuff they have that much confidence that spacex has already reused spacecraft their whole dragon one program almost half of the dragons that ever flew to the international space station there's there's been 20 missions uh with the dragon one capsule almost half of those were reused i think nine out of the 11 were reflown capsules so they obviously have the data they have the knowledge on how to reuse a space spacecraft that has splashed down and beyond that dragon dragon 2 has big upgrades as far as refurbishability and like waterproofness and all that stuff so um including the heat shield um we had a good question in discord someone asked is it uh is the heat shield replaced every flight like the space shuttle it's actually supposed to be reusable for up to 10 times and i think they can literally measure just the thickness how much ablated and then from there on they can still make the decision on whether or not to reuse that heat shield but there is a refurbishment process they're saying conservatively they said it was only i i think benji reed said it was like a month or two that they could have the spacecraft flipped around in two months and so they're quite confident that even though this will be the first time they're totally refurbishing for human flight they're quite confident they can refurbish it and have it still fit within the six-month time frame which is amazing we're under 11 and a half minutes from where we expect to hit entry interface so that's where dragon will really start feeling the effects of being in a denser atmosphere and then we are still tracking that blackout to come right around that same time we are under 27 minutes away from splashdown so we are under 27 minutes away bob and doug being on planet earth for the first time since may 30th to kind of put everything in perspective you know the dragon capsule departed from the international space station several hours ago but according to what dan just said it's essentially halfway home just based on altitude alone so the international space station is about 250 miles above earth's surface i think right now it's between 250 and 300 i think right now it's about 263 miles above earth's surface so based on that telemetry that the dan just read off is from an altitude standpoint dragon is halfway home and yet that second half is going to be covered in the next 27 ish minutes while we wait for splashdown and recovery versus the several hours that we've been covering since yesterday yeah we will continue to see its speed drop as it's dropping out of orbit it's starting to hit the atmosphere it's starting to slow from the effects of that friction generating the heat on the heat shield and building up the plasma eventually around the spacecraft its speed is going to continue to drop it's already below 17 000 miles an hour and it'll drop to essentially a terminal velocity of about 350 miles an hour right as those drogue shoots deploy and those are going to pop out when sensors on the dragon spacecraft both gps and pressure sensors tell the spacecraft it's at the right altitude and then those will automatically deploy the strobes coming out of the top section of the spacecraft using two mortars or pyrotechnics essentially to deploy those who do the initial slowing and stabilizing of the dragon capsule then after that the main parachutes will pop out and further decelerate it to about 119 miles per hour and then that will continue to decelerate and by the time that the capsule is splashing down in the gulf of mexico it's only going 15 16 miles per hour so significant reduction in speed there over over just the course of a couple minutes that of course is you know a pretty comfortable speed uh the way that the astronauts have described it previously with other other types of missions also landing down doing land landings at about the same rate that they said it feels like you're in a a minor fender bender yeah you're definitely running into something you'll feel it but they do a lot of work with the seats and the restraints with these crew members just to make sure um while it may be a fender bender you got more than a seat belt essentially holding you in so they are they're very secure in their suits and in their seats and they're gonna stay in there even after dragon touches down we'll still have communication with dragon once they're in the water it'll stay powered on probably most importantly their air conditioner will continue to work while they're in the capsule in the now gulf of mexico and much warmer temperatures than they've seen for the last couple of months and we'll still be able to talk to them from here in hawthorne and the recovery teams will be able to as well yeah i did have i'm seeing some questions about um the cameras and so yeah we um this is from chris i agree there is it is a little bit sad that we're not seeing the outside cameras of these events or any any you know they do have cameras uh they can point at like the trunk and probably see the trunk separation and things like that so i'm a little bit sad but i think they're just more worried about having all systems pointed at telemetry right now in data um and unfortunately they're leaving us with this and eventually i think we'll we'll hopefully see some shots from inside the the spacecraft occasionally especially once they're under parachutes and then they do have of course videos down there on go navigator there's a whole camera crew ready to film the actual uh the landing so yeah so we'll see some better footage than just the mission control here and hawthorne this is spacex's mission control um so they're they're they're in control of this thing now it's it's not even though it's a nasa mission and nasa uh it's you know part of the international space station and part of the commercial crew program um they're they basically just hired spacex and said like here you go make it happen make it happen spacex you are now in control you know they are just the uber to the international space station they just get paid an amount and there's a tight tight collaboration but at this point you know it's all all hands on deck right here at hawthorne california spacex for entry brief okay doug we have no update to timing because the burn went great and your vehicle is still looking really good for entry no health issues at this time one of those quindar tones okay dragon copy thank you in addition the recovery team is go and the weather is still great winds are about two knots and waves about one foot from the ship they're reporting very calm how cubby happy good weather at the uh landing area thank you okay and uh last piece is that we do expect some additional ready com during entry prep 2 due to vehicle attitude so if you can get us your entry check report a little bit prior to entry prep too we'd appreciate it welcome okay thanks doug so there we just had a bit of a briefing between mission control and bob and doug up in crew endeavor just confirming with them that the deorbit burn was great and that the timing on their pads doesn't need to be updated we are able to upload new trajectory calculations including times that remain live depending on you know how the burn goes and at this point in time those don't need to be updated it is important that they do remain accurate because bob and doug their primary mission right now is to continue to monitor the vehicle status and telemetry and data being presented to them on their touch on their touch screen displays in front of them and so during the more dynamic events they certainly want to be aware when things like parachute deploy will be happening and when splashed down as is expected so making sure that the timeline of events the sequencing is accurate is certainly important in order for them to stay aware and updated of upcoming events just another quick position check dragon still out over the central pacific down to about 108 miles in altitude and we're expecting that entry interface come up in the next four minutes or so again at that point dragon should be in an altitude of right around 62 statute miles or about 100 kilometers and that's when it really starts to feel the effects of the atmosphere it starts to experience the lift and drag and other atmospheric effects it's been free from while flying in the near vacuum of low earth orbit so continuing to drop in altitude still looking for an on time splashdown should just be about 19 minutes from now so this is a good question and sorry guys i'll get you guys questions when i can it's gonna be really hard today uh how can they spend so much time orbiting in the capsule in the future could they undock and land faster so i just released a video this morning a lot of you guys probably haven't been online enough to notice but i did a video all about like the considerations and the criteria the orbital mechanics around re-entering and deorbiting but the the big scoop basically the big takeaway is they're orbiting nothing's gonna change that like you can't turn hardly hold on spacex copies entry prep complete thank you awesome so it's really really really hard to change your orbit so basically you have to just line it up when you're aligned with where you want to land because the earth is spinning below that orbit too right so there's just considerations about the landing places and then not only that but also the phasing so where the spacecraft is when the orbital path is aligned with where you're trying to land so it has to be it's all these considerations there's basically three different moving parts it's like playing 4d chess or something and uh it's it's it's time of you the speed of you your relative speed the orbit where the orbital plane is where the you're going to be landing splashdown criteria all the waves and everything so i have a video that tells you everything about it how you re-enter and land after we're done here check that video out i promise a lot of your guys's questions are probably answered in that video um including you know why don't they use the super dracos um why aren't they like probably every question you have i promise i've pretty much got answered so um so have that have a watch on that video afterwards and it should answer everything we're seeing here today because we're only 15 minutes away the weather is good we saw blue skies and a couple of white fluffy clouds out there in the gulf of mexico as we got views from our recovery vessel go navigator but glad to hear that conditions are sustaining and that winds also are looking really good around two and two two and a half miles per hour so hardly anything at all really couldn't ask for better conditions for a splashdown day we we kind of threaded the needle once again almost like we did on launch with the weather today you your upper limits for wind we're about 10 miles an hour so we're we're well behold below that threshold for a splashdown today the dragon coming up on 82 miles in altitude continuing to dip down we're expecting that entry interface to start pretty soon where the vehicle itself is really going to start heating up it's going to continue to use its draco thrusters to maintain its attitude as it continues through the earth's atmosphere and we'll have that calm blackout coming up in just a couple of minutes as well i should mention though that dragon's shape is substantially taller it's a taller vehicle with uh with uh less steep walls or i guess steeper walls actually they're almost more vertical compared to like boeing starliner and the orion capsule which have almost like 45 degree walls so those ones actually are more stable free entry dragon might be a little bit top heavy and and be and they might need to do a little bit more active control to really make sure it's right in the sweet spot and perfectly stable but again these are designed to be passively stable as well though or at least more inherently passively stable based on their shape man is anyone else are you guys feeling like my heart's beating it's like this is we're coming up on the the real stuff here oh man so like we said we are anticipating a brief blackout period where we're unable to communicate with the capsule that's uh we're expecting that to start in exactly three minutes uh that will last for six minutes total and during that time we will be unable to command the vehicle or receive telemetry that being said dragon is designed to be fully autonomous so it's driving itself anyway so bob and doug will will stay fastened in their seats and like i said that anticipated loss of signal or as you'll hear it called los is anticipated to last for just six minutes and again um i saw a good question from big deal and again i'm sorry that we're going out of order here you guys have been awesome bearing with me here uh like i said i really want to listen to this but why do the beep bop sounds happen when they talk and notice on the paul those are called quindar tones and ones higher and one's lower so you can tell the start and end of a transmission based on wait or is it earth ground comes have one beep at the start and stop let's listen we will see you on the other side at one eight four two okay so it's start and end because the the tone goes i can't i can't go with it it's about about a half step uh high and then it goes low so start transmission here beep end of transition here boop and uh that that's so that there's some kind of digital record almost or some kind of in in tape and replay you can tell who was starting and stopping what communication it's just kind of a way to have an audio record and even like a notification almost like here we have an incoming transmission based on that little quindar tone so we'll be going through entry interface where it is encountering aerodynamic forces really starting to build up uh the external temperature as it and that external temperature will reach about 3 500 degrees fahrenheit however the the the interior of the cabin is environmentally cooled so bob and doug will should be should remain comfortable during their descent there will be cool air flowing not only through the cabin itself but also through their suits the suits have sensors on them that are able to detect the temperature inside that suit and once it once that sensor reads that it has reached the the maximum temperature threshold it'll flush the suit with some cool air and and really circulate and cool it down i'm gonna listen here but i think the crew only experiences about three to four g's of deceleration here so it's at peak i do that's one of those numbers i do want to get confirmed so i'm going to listen in here and see if we can get that in that communication at about 42 minutes after the hour so for these next six minutes they're already less than 60 miles in altitude and this is when the capsule is really heating up during that re-entry reaching temperatures of around 3 500 degrees fahrenheit as again you're essentially hitting the atmosphere more than 17 000 miles an hour in the friction building up that plasma around the spacecraft that's what's going to prevent us from talking to bob and doug or getting data back from the spacecraft for the next six minutes flight computers are in control though it's going to continue to maintain its appropriate trajectory and attitude having attitude determination devices on board the capsule not reliant on communications with satellites and it's going to continue dragging down the correct path for this splashdown off the coast of pensacola so we are in that black out period we're going to continue to stand by until we get them on the other side man okay so uh this is uh i did see this really quick just wanna answer this person's question uh you're too late you probably you might not have been able to see it anyway you know you have to have the right conditions to be able to see uh spacecraft it basically has to be dark where you are and the light has to be shining on them you have to have you have to be in the shadow it has to be reflecting and i don't know if you would have been able to but if you would have it would have been about 20 minutes ago when it was on the other side of the planet so we should hopefully be getting some views from a couple of our assets out at the landing zone including our wb 57 high altitude research plane which is going to be relying on dragon's telemetry to actually lock onto it in the sky and give us an infrared view of the capsule during the final stages of re-entry we're going to be looking for the drogue deploys at about 44 minutes after the hour those will be two drogue shoots they're going to come out when the vehicle is still moving in about 350 miles an hour it'll be in an altitude of about 18 000 feet they'll come out and do some initial slowing and stabilization of the spacecraft and then less than a minute later they'll detach and the four main parachutes will deploy you'll see them come out and look kind of closed up initially and then they'll do what's known as reefing opening up in really two different stages just to minimize the immediate loads on the parachutes themselves uh those and again i'm seeing a lot of questions about you know why we're not seeing video from the spacecraft right now telemetry or data between transmission between the spacecraft and the ground is is currently physically impossible we wouldn't be able to get live views from inside or outside of the spacecraft right now at all because the atmosphere again is getting think of this spacecraft as something it's going 10 times faster than a bullet it's hitting the atmosphere and when it does that the air can't even get out of the way fast enough so it compresses the air in front of it in its bow shock just like the you know like when you see a boat and it has a a bow and like the the wake it leaves think about that same thing with the spacecraft and you know how sometimes boats the you know the waves come up kind of high on it because it's ramming into the water it creates that pressure we're thinking that same thing here with with the bow shock of the heat shield is compressing that air and when it does that it compresses it so much as you compress air it heats up and if you do it enough you can actually heat it up to become a plasma and that's exactly what's happening so you cannot send communications or data radio signals through that hot plasma it's just physically impossible but there are internal recordings that hopefully they'll release here soon that we were expecting this blackout period will last a total of six minutes and we're about halfway through there now at the moment dragon is re-entering the earth's atmosphere and due to the plasma building up on the exterior of the vehicle we're unable to communicate or send commands but dragon is fully autonomous it is steering itself uh and right now bob and doug are flying home yeah the the spacecraft there's never controlled from the ground you know there'd be too big of a delay um you can send uploads for something for the spacecraft to do occasion like if we had to you know like we do that with curiosity we'll send it a set of commands or a place to go or whatever it takes 20 minutes to get to mars even at the speed of light and then it executes those commands and has to do it itself or have some kind of autonomy the dragon capture was completely autonomous in that sense where there's no like input from the ground to fly at home or do anything like that it's got a program sequence that can be updated if it needed to but um we're gonna hear them asking for comm checks constantly just like in the apollo movies and stuff so i do want to listen in for that so we're still inside that anticipated blackout window it does look like we are getting maybe some sporadic data starting to peek through this is why you heard that communications check with the spacecraft dragon spacex com check copy we've got you 5x5 as well doug looking good and you can expect an automated shoot deployment okay so we're coming up with all right really good news there we have come out of the blackout period and we have reestablished connection with dragon endeavor with nasa astronauts bob bankin and doug hurley on board i've got goosebumps guys we were able to reacquire that communication a little bit earlier than expected and now we are just waiting we should just be about two and a half minutes away from that initial drogue shoot deploy yeah two minutes and 26 seconds agps has converged you may have heard earlier that bob and doug are currently experiencing 3.5 g's not too bad that's about what they pulled during the ascent phase just like a mild roller coaster the vehicle is now over the gulf of mexico it is approaching the landing zone off the coast of florida near pensacola and there we have our first shot there it is this the first view from the wb-57 airplane it is dipping in and out a little bit this is going to be an infrared camera showing us dragging and re-entering it's basically coming in you know it's like a it's like a meteor you know it's coming in and you're seeing the tail of its plasma still and it's hot air in its wake gps units that it uses actually in the parachute deployment process as it helps along with the pressure sensors really give a solid altitude to the flight computers on when these are supposed to deploy hopefully we've got a decent temperature standing by for the drogue chute deployments we should be just under five minutes away from splashdown passing 15 kilometers brace for drogue window oh there's a video kathy we're brave about 14 kilometers in altitude 8.4 miles continuing to descend there on your screen we have a shot of the capsule as it is preparing to deploy those initial parachutes the drug parachutes again these parachutes help slow the vehicle down even further and help stabilize in preparation for main shoot deployment right about now the capsule is going about 400 miles per hour 600 kilometers accelerating quickly 650 kilometers an hour for those of you metrically inclined and standing by for drogue deploys so it's now don't visual two drugs out oh yes there on your screen we have visual confirmation of those two drug deployments all right so two of two the droves now out they're gonna do their slowing and stabilizing of the dragon spacecraft they should be detaching in just a few moments and then we'll see four parachutes the main parachutes deployed dragon under droves so they'll you'll see four small pipes see four small pilot shoots and then the four main shoots open up so the expected descent rate the expected velocity under the drogues nominal we're right at around 150 miles an hour and already dropping normal you can see the droves now detach yes four millimeters confirmation of deployment of the four main parachutes and this is okay they're they're refilling out visually on four shoots out we are visual four main parachutes deployed yes oh that looks good that's good guys i think now it's time for us to do a pointy end up flamy and down confirmation it appears now the shoots are they're under shoots it appears the pointy end of the spacecraft is indeed up and what was just a second ago a flaming end is down this is exactly what we want to see pointy end is up flaming end is down it's happening folks we're coming down for a nice soft touchdown they're gonna splash down somewhere between six and seven and a half meters per second nice and easy no big deal they got this main shoot decent rate nominal passing through 700 meters oh yes so at this point dragon has saved all propulsion systems on 600 meters 600 meters and we're 600 meters above the gulf of mexico should be approximately a minute 30 from splashdown mission control team here in hawthorne has reported the precise landing coordinates to the recovery team they are standing by ready to go get our space dads go get those space dads go get those space dads it is time so soon we'll see the horizon crosstalk about 300 meters oh that shot one minute until splashdown so again it'll touch down about six to seven and a half meters per second looks like all shoots are 200 meters here brace for splash down copy brace for splashdown here it comes so there we heard bob and doug reporting that they are bracing for a splashdown prepared the gulf of mexico here in the shot just momentarily as we're now just about 20 meters off the ocean it's a little yes yes splashdown as you can see on your screen we have visual confirmation for splashdown spacex copies and concurs dragon endeavor has returned home nasa astronauts bob and doug half of the spacex and nasa teams welcome back to planet earth and thanks for flying spacex thanks for flying spacex oh that's the first of many guys we're gonna be seeing this a lot don't forget we already have another one of these happening in about two months the crew dragon and endeavour congrats everybody at and now we lose communication and we're into section of four decimal eight zero zero thanks for those words doug and we uh copy that you are into uh four decimal 800. the great news all around there our space dads are back on earth after a 19-hour return journey from space dragon endeavor has played splash down in the gulf of mexico just off the coast of pensacola florida and on your screen there you can see our two fast boats and they are indeed fast racing out to greet dragon endeavor as it sits there the first on there we can see a view inside the capsule bob and doug looking good although the communication was a little choppy we did hear the endeavor in three decimal one we show ourselves in stable one and spacex copies for vehicle assessment step three decimal one stable one good news stable one essentially they're upright in the water stable two also another potential where it could be on its side or even upside down but dragon does have a water ballast system to keep it upright where it's able to essentially pump seawater into bladders in the service section of the capsule but they're upright we already see the fast boats approaching they touch down came right on time at 11 48 a.m pacific 1848 utc bob and doug now in the water and the recovery ops they've already begun we're we already see the the fast so let me give yeah i'll give you guys a little run down here so there's two fast boats the first one's going to go out it's going to make sure that none of the hypergolic propellants that the thrusters use they use mono methyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide or mm mm hnto and uh that is actually extremely toxic it's a horrendously toxic gas and they've been fired basically all the way through reentry they had but still been active so there could be some residual gas and just to make sure there's no leaks or any problems like that they actually go up to the spacecraft and they do with masks on and everything the first boat will go up and check for hydrazine leaks and make sure there's no leaks nothing noxious that's gonna uh injure the recovery crew at all and then they also check the integrity of the spacecraft make sure everything looks good after re-entry the second fast boat out there is going to go try to return the parachutes and they go grab all the shoots so that doesn't hinder in recovery operations with the the the boat that will come and scoop it up so back in the days with apollo they basically got out and they laid you know all the older capsules in the united states they got and they laid in like a little boat and then they recovered oh this is playback this is gonna be cool um but basically you know they went laid out and then they got scooped up by a helicopter that helicopter then took them to the deck of an aircraft carrier right but this is different this is oh that's looking down that's oh cool those are the four parachutes in the water um but now they just have a boat they have a recovery team it's a spacex recovery team they call them the spacex navy almost and they go out with this there'll be a ship that has an uh has everything basically it's a pretty small boat but it's called the one out doing this one is uh go navigator on the atlantic coast there's one an identical one called go search because there were seven options for landing sites they have seven pre-planned landing sites and um there's four in the gulf three on the atlantic coast and these boats they'll drive up to them so first they'll kind of get everything secure and all and then the the actual recovery vessel will go out turn around and scoop it up out of the back with this hoist and then hoist it up onto the deck of the ship and then once it's on the deck of the ship they open the hatch and let the crew out and they immediately take the crew the crew is going to be weak ish they've been up in you know in orbit for about two months experiencing micro micro gs so their body is not adapted to earth not adapted to gravity and so they'll have to be helped out of the capsule and into an immediately a medical checkout facility on the deck of the vehicle right there like they only walk they only help them to go like you know five or ten meters or something just a nice quick little jaunt over there uh they check them out and then they actually have the option i think pensacola is one of the closest to shore options so they'll probably just stay on the deck of the boat no big deal but if it's some of them are like 300 kilometers away or you know 200 miles off the coast and if they're that far away they'll just stick them up on the helicopter which there is a helipad on that ship and fly them home so they can get homes quickly to their families so um let's see here i'm going to listen in quick she's uh joining us by satellite phone brandi if you can hear me i mean what is it like right there on the water what was it like to watch watch them splash down for the test objective so stand by at the council as we get it up and operating on lucky i'm not sure what we're hearing there but this comes from that gamer uh they are now called earth dads um so i'm gonna answer this question from from ben quigley because i know again i just did a video all about this such a shame they splash on rather than uh actually ben accidentally said uh repulsive landing instead of propulsive landing but all in all good show spacex so again i just released a video this morning all about this entire process so whenever you tune out here have a watch on that i'll tell you all about the orbital mechanics all the hardware all the timelines all the criteria everything i take care of you up and down i promise you'll have almost no questions but the super draco thrusters are primarily there as an abort system and originally spacex planned when they released the dragon 2 capsule in what was that either 2014 or 2016. i don't remember but when they released the dragon 2 capsule they had this video i think it's 2014 this video come out and they showed that the plan was to return home and land propulsively using the the motors because assuming you don't use the abort motors to abort you know if the ascent is fine in the sense normal uh then you know by the way the word's actually nominal but at one point one of the spacex commentators accidentally said normal because it's kind of like normal so it's now cemented in in culture basically in spaceflight culture so assuming everything's normal and they don't end up doing an abort or anything or needing to use those dragon throats they have all of that propulsion all of that propellant on board to be able to still use it for something else and the idea was we'll use those thrusters to land they could land right back there at kennedy space center touchdown nice and soft like a helicopter and literally just recover them and take them home you know like no big deal super easy recovery efforts um cheap and fast but there was a few reasons why nasa wasn't a big fan of that nasa didn't like that you'd have to have landing legs protrude through the heat shields they also just weren't necessarily sure who's the safest option to have to rely on rocket engines even though there were redundant pairs of engines on all the corners they just weren't really too stoked on it and originally elon thought it was cool because they could use that for you know that architecture to be able to propulsively land on the moon or propulsively land on mars which of course when you have something that big and heavy you have to have propulsive landing in order to land parachutes don't cut it on the moon because there's no atmosphere mars has a very thin atmosphere so you when you start getting over certain masses it just does not make any sense to use a parachute parachutes scale poorly for heavy uh for heavy objects especially on mars so they have to use proposed landing and the original idea is hey we'll just use the same capsule to go out of the moon go to mars you can propulsively land no big deal but they pretty quickly found out it just was not the right architecture that they're still using um you know adding all this extra mass of a heat shield all these extra things and it's just not the right architecture to do propulsive landing on other worlds and then so you add all these things of like nasa didn't really want it it would have been a pain in the butt to certify it you know maybe it could have happened you had the heat shield holes and it's not even good on other worlds it was basically just a party trick at that point and when you're dealing with human life safety it's not worth you know risking anything like that and so then the next question people say is well couldn't they use that as a backup i've had many people have almost like how dare they not have it as a backup what if the shoots fail you're telling me that they wouldn't give it everything they got just to turn on those engines and propulsively land what are the odds that the parachutes which are now 100 reliable and have been tested to the 18th degree right now you have to arm a rocket system that has potential to do a lot of harm if it's if it's you know your highly pressurized super draco engines the whole fuel system steps up to a different operating pressure all these things happen in order to arm the the super draco abort motors and it's not like you can just turn them on they have to be actively you know they have to be doing thrust differential to make sure they're maintaining orientation they have to have perfecting you know ground radar to make sure they're landing softly like yes all of the hardware is kind of there right they they could do it but the odds are by enabling all those steps all those all that hardware including the potential to in turn on these engines you're actually adding so much more risk than just making sure your parachutes work right like are you adding risk or are you subtracting risk and arming an abort system while you're under parachute power or potentially under parachute power or potentially having the spacecraft think it's not under parachutes and it is you're just asking for problems plain and simple if it was smart they'd do it and obviously they came to the conclusion that all that's doing is adding more potential faults more potential places to have problems so it is not an option um although it's although it was cool we'll see plenty of cool propulsive landing and crazy cool things with starship which again hopefully later today we're going to see uh potentially the hop of uh of starship so obviously number five starship out at bokuchika which will be absolutely plain and simple bonkers um yeah just plain plain plain bonkers man that was that was a big one i'm gonna listen to what they're saying the ocean it could be a little tricky so uh this person has undergone a lot hours and hours of training and certification in order to perform this very important task there on the right hand side of your screen we see the second fast boat approaching of course both of these boats needed to wait for their queue from the water recovery lead in order to approach dragon after splashdown again that was just to make sure that there weren't any toxic vapors in the air and now that they got the all clear we do see them beginning to work on and around the dragon capsule so even though the camera is a little shaky that water looks super super duper smooth almost like glass which is certainly ideal for a water recovery like today yeah got to remember that this is a view from the the main recovery vessel which was still a few miles away from the splashdown spacex we have hypergal sweeps and unfired ordnance checks uh nominal rigor is on board the vehicle about two five minutes until capsule lift 25 minutes until they so they already have the rigging attached to be able to good news so they're about 25 minutes away from pulling the spacecraft out of the water so that's awesome vapor tests came out positive or rather negative which is a positive thing so the team was able to approach and now the crew member that is installing the rigging is on top of the capsule it's difficult to see there because the slower vessel that the primary recovery ship is a little further away but as we heard it's just a mere two and a half minutes until they will be hoisted out of the water i'm i'm sorry 25 minutes not 2.5 i misheard that yeah they're fast but they're not that fast so i see a good question here um this is from uh tech controls i imagine elon would want to be at the hop any idea how long it would take for him to get there we actually had this discussion just a little bit ago and discord i should mention if you guys want to learn more about space or have community to talk about space flight stuff we have an awesome discord channel uh it's a patreon exclusive so if you would like to join our page our discord channel go to patreon.com everydayastronaut it's just a really welcoming warm community where we're all learning together constantly constantly learning about space flight and uh it's it's just awesome i love everyone there we're talking about how long would it take uh for elon to get from from headquarters to hawthorne or from hawthorne basically to boca chica and hawthorne airport can't actually uh someone i forget who it was sorry uh who was that just dropping those knowledge bombs um that was so awesome but you can't actually oh dr raptor was who it was um it was so awesome dr raptor was was uh was telling us that you can't actually take off a gulf stream elon's jet from hawthorne airport which i didn't know i think they shortened the runway apparently um but so he can't take off from hawthorne he can go to another airport about a little bit further away probably more like 10 15 minutes away and then he could land at brownsville airport which is about 15 20 minutes away from spacex uh boca chica so really the flight time should only be what two or three hours so i mean i at best i think if he really tried right now he'd probably be in boca chica in about three or four hours um i don't know what he's gonna do i i would really really really assume that he really wants to be you know at the actual uh at the hop of that serial number two for those who don't know what i'm talking about spacex is working on this prototype vehicle called uh starship well the the whole vehicle will be it will be called starship but they're currently in a prototype phase so they're on their serial number five version and they're hoping to fly today this thing is massive it's nine meters wide about 30 meters tall so 30 feet wide almost 100 feet tall and it is huge it's running on the most advanced rocket engine in the world it's currently sitting out on their test stand it's going to take off from the stand fly only 150 meters so about 500 feet uh it's going to translate over it's going to land nearby it's only probably going to be a 45 second flight or so but it's using some of the most advanced things in the world and it's just been crazy to watch them try to work on that vehicle because it's they've had a lot of teething problems so to see them get to this point uh this would be a fully reusable rocket that can take more mass to space than this than the saturn v but not lose any of it you can recover all of it and refuel it up and do it again it's a really exciting future for spacex really exciting feature for for space flight fans um and so this is the first small little baby step in their bigger grand scheme of the starship program and we're gonna see new little landing legs deploy today i'm really excited for that so we will see we will see not really laying on their backs in the ocean they are seated upright a little bit which would allow them to have a better view of the team working i saw some questions about how is the guy climbing on the capsule isn't it hot so it probably gets fairly hot but again most of the heat is on the heat shield which gets wicked away so the heat you know the the all of the plasma in the gas is is 3 500 degrees celsius about half as hot as the sun um or is it 1800 and the sun's 3 500 i think it's 1800 degrees or so um although the plasma is that hot only a small percentage actually gets to the heat shield and the percentage that gets to the heat should most of it gets wicked away luckily the the walls of the vehicle are inside the wake so they're like they don't actually experience much heat at all really i mean they'll get some heat and they'll get hot but then it had about six minutes of cooling off once it splashes down a lot of the you know a lot of that heat would also be transferred uh into the water so it's relatively cool to the touch it might still be warm you know but it's not like it's scorching hot so um yeah someone can approach it no problem throughout the entire recovery process essentially until it's time to get them out and on that note too we had a um again i'm really sorry if i missed some guys at super chats i was having to tune in does that water get super heated after splashdown from heat shields again depending on how hot i'm guessing by the point by the time they actually do touchdown i don't even think it it'd boil water anymore like it's it will have cooled down substantially by that point what's that other boat that one looks like it's got it's just a fisherman out there like hey what are you guys doing and we did hear the rigging is pretty much complete so right as they arrive there at the capsule the main recovery vessel will be able to begin getting it up out of the water so now as the recovery vessel go navigator is getting closer to dragon dragon's position there off the coast of pensacola florida we're able to see the capsule in a little bit more detail uh it is certainly no longer a bright shade of white like we said those external temperatures were reaching up to 3 500 degrees fahrenheit so the thermal protective systems thermal protection systems enable dragon to return while keeping the internal temperature rather temperate and you are seeing a few more boats than expected um the team's currently working with a few private vessels in the area making sure that they get out of there no way guys are you kidding me are you kidding me i hope they get fines for that are you serious just locals just driving up to it what guys this is this is a mission this is space flight are you kidding me and now we see one of those spacex fast boats moving in what i was joking earlier when i said it looked like a fisherman just dirt nope coming to find out i was just a fisherman dirt to dirt no way so we are being advised that the recovery team is radioing out to the vessels in the water near crew dragon to vacate the area so that we're able to extract bob and doug safely you know also for the safety of those folks in the area as well not just bob and doug yeah this is this is obviously a dynamic operation one of the first things we do is make sure there aren't essentially poisonous fumes around the capsule so something like this just really can endanger the whole thing endanger the crew members and endanger themselves so the spacex team's moving in to try and get them away so they can safely recover the dragon capsule and get bob and doug on deck and safely inside their medical quarters so we can see them they're getting a lot closer we expect about 10 minutes or so until they should be in position all the rigging has been affixed on the dragon capsule and once they arrive they'll be able to use that hydraulic lift to get dragon up and out of the water i'm sorry i'm like speechless i just did not think people in the right mind would be like ah i'm just landing off the coast of where i live i'll just drive my boat out there take a look like interfering with recovery operations that's insane to me oh 2020 what else are you going to be bringing us i can just about guarantee you that's a private vessel in between us and the spacecraft spacecraft right now zuma just a little bit came up now it's our landing zone oh there we got a shot from our wb-57 plane it looks like that area has cleared out significantly so that is good to see and we're also hearing that all of the parachutes have buoys on them so also good news as the recovery process continues for spacex demo two dragon spacex for comrade config go ahead mike hey doug we're about to reconfigure the forward link we may lose that for about one or so minutes and that should happen shortly let's give us a call back when you think we got it back we'll do oh man so as the main vessel gets closer it's going to back up and get its hydraulic lift set up right next to the dragon capsule still in the water bob and doug still inside just waiting for that recovery we should start the hoisting operations in the next 10 to 15 minutes and then it'll be a pretty quick lift up out of the water using that hydraulic lift into the dragon nest on the deck of the boat or the ship rather and then they'll move it underneath the helipad into essentially the crew recovery area where they'll have a platform right up to the hatch they'll be able to open up the hatch spacex medical doctor will be the first one through the door able to do a quick check in with bob and doug on their status and then he and the other medical doctors flight surgeons and trained technicians will begin to help them out of the capsule yeah earlier just after splashdown we did hear bob and doug report that they were feeling good after re-entry so that was relayed to the flight surgeon and good news to hear again this is a view coming from the wb 57 plane as it is circling the area and we can see dragon awaiting to be pulled out of the water again we are anticipating that lift to begin in just under 15 minutes we're approaching 14 minutes here uh and then in 21 minutes we will have an open hatch you can see the main recovery vessel in the top right there that's the helipad with the big spacex on top it's now backing up towards the capsule certainly not to be confused with one of our landing drone ships there's a live view of dragon of dragon floating in the water there in the background along with many onlookers certainly from a safer distance at this point uh this is a live shot coming from go navigator our primary recovery vessel here so it's crew dragon is also accompanied by the fast boats that are helping to bring it in closer and there you can see a couple of the recovery team members on the deck and also just behind them we get our first good view of the nest yes so this is essentially the nest in the background there dragon will be hoisted using the hydraulic lift out of the water and into that nest that nest will then be pulled towards the camera from this view towards those individuals i'll go ahead and point out in that shot back there all those other boats you can kind of see on the horizon there those are not supposed to be there there's only about five in the fleet if i remember right loud and clear as well and from the video looks like the boat is about one uh length away about five to ten meters backing up to you copy that thanks for the update all right so good news there we're getting ready to see dragon to be lifted out of the water and into the recovery nest as i was saying that nest will be pulled towards the camera towards the upper deck that we saw there and that's where the medical stretchers will be waiting to assist them into the medical bays for evaluation after capsule egress it's already been it's already been 25 minutes since they splashed down it doesn't feel like it that was definitely the fastest 25 minutes of the day the the timeline we were anticipating was for the lifting operations to start within about 30 minutes so we're pretty much right on the timeline still that's been a a pretty common thing so far today you can see them with one of the fast boats getting it positioned to start moving out with the additional rigging to affix to the dragon capsule where they're going to use this a-frame to pull it up out of the water and you can see the dragon nest at the very bottom it's that circular object with the a1 right on it although i'm baffled and you know i'm audibly like just surprised that people are doing this it might not be very obvious like there may not have been a very obvious like hey guys don't go approach this spacecraft after a splashdown so let's be nice like let's not be belittling of the people that are out there they're probably excited they might get a little slap on the wrist and a fine and i am greatly going to encourage no one that's listening to ever do that um but since this is the first i wouldn't be surprised if it just wasn't very obvious locally that like that's not okay to do so i'm not excusing the actions of like but at the same time you know have a little bit of decency and think that you know maybe these people just simply had no idea that it's not okay to do that just not you know not sure what to oh yeah what's up it is just it's it's i'm just shocked but here you can see the hoist beginning to pick up the dragon capsule out of the water uh dry this thing weighs about three metric tons so about a little over i think it's like 6 600 pounds uh that's totally dry it still has a little bit more prop on board a little bit more cargo on board so it's probably weighing a little bit more like three and a half or four metric tons so it's it's definitely uh it's definitely heavy and that hoist has to be pretty beefy as you can tell to get get that thing out of there pretty so making sure that only personnel involved in active recovery operations are present on the deck you may have heard us mention before that there are about 40 people on board today but we certainly don't want anyone in danger or to fall overboard that guy intentionally jumped speaking of falling overboard we're ready thank you all right so the crew was just told in about 30 in the next 30 seconds they have the lines to fix so they're going to start lifting the capsule up out of the water and at this point the communication we're getting with dragon is actually being routed through the boat itself at this point so there we can see the lift dragon is out of the way this should have no effect the uh from aaron asking what are the chances that they won't be able to reuse it now there's unauthorized civilians it has nothing to do with that the main reason you don't want people around is still there there's hydrazine on board the spacecraft there's pressurized vessels this just came back from space it's just a bit of a hazard it's mostly for public safety this should have no effect on reusing of the spacecraft all operations are appearing to go completely normal now but it's more for their safety and just to not get in the way of recovering humans that just came back down from space that's like the pro that's that's the number one thing is we're getting bob and doug home here this is that's what's number one and if you at all get in the way you know if you're if there's a recovery ball is trying to come through or something and and almost you're like oh and my engine stalled you know like you could potentially like just get in the way of work i mean this would be for anything any forget space flight like if you are seeing people utility workers out working on a you know on a pole and obviously you just all drive your cars right up to the truck and being like oh let me see what you're doing hong kong you know like that's not okay that's rude it's rude to interfere with someone's work and this is that same thing so just having a bit of decency and sensitivity to the idea that you know these people are working and also again for your own safety like don't do that just simply do not do that um i should point out look at how small the people look it's easy to forget how big this vehicle actually is it's a big big vehicle and you're also seeing the big hole that they're reaching into right there that's actually where the where the the the shoots are are coming from that's like the trunk that the hatchet blows open the chutes pull from there and they go up on a line that kind of goes around the outside of it at that point is not the spacecraft technicians will work to open up the hatch as we said previously it's a manual process with a couple of different attachments you have to engage before the hatch itself can be open they'll get it opened and then spacex's neil menon will be the first one through the hatchway to check in on bob and doug get their initial health assessment see if they're ready to move and then we'll start assisting them out of the capsule and into that medical facility on the boat don't tell them all these people are going to try and parade it in home like a caravan like we did it so at this point the recovery team is doing uh final securing of the capsule in preparation to actually move the recovery nest into closer to the interior of the ship it'll actually be in a little bit of a covered deck there we had we saw that camera view earlier looking straight out from the center of the boat so once dragon is secured in the nest uh the nest will be translated then forward and uh closer to the recovery uh the excuse me closer to the position in which we're able to actually open the hatch so while dragon is on board safely uh we're not able to do that just yet yeah they're they're working to detach some of those lines that were used to hoist it using the a-frame and we heard that they should be done with that in just a moment and then we'll start that translation yep this is from sephirakes these are just postmates ordered by bob and doug space fly makes you really hungry like why'd you guys tell them to go away we i just ordered some panda express right now we can see the recovery team releasing those securing lines that were used during the lift of the capsule from the water into the nest so they are releasing those securing lines from the sides making sure it is secure from the bottom and there we see dragon moving forward look at that smooth as a tesla i would say that's sleek i didn't realize it slid forward so fast really interesting again texas patriot i do understand the sentiment like i understand the sentiment i understand that people probably are excited and want to see this but you still just have to have some decency about about you know oh it's almost like this like air of self-importance like i need to be there it's like no there this is essential personnel and safety here we go side are those oval windows dragon spacex stand by for side hatch opening and egress happy we're ready all right crew got the call we are go for hatch open i hope they brought down all the the surface samples and do an eva report get all those science points there we go and if you look closely immediately above the hatch you can see the area where you can see them working in now that's where those drogue chutes deployed from the two circles on either side were where the mortars were the main parachutes now hidden by the platform underneath the side hatch here we go here comes history so the crew is in the process of removing the side hatch we can see that go navigator is in transit it is making its way back to the pensacola naval air station however bob and doug will get a ride from the recovery vessel via helicopter yeah there's a lot of people asking about the hurricane this landed in the gulf coast this is actually the i think the most western landing site they have so it's as far away from the hurricane as possible the landing conditions were fantastic very little waves look how calm the water is just outside of pensacola florida this is uh yeah far away from the hurricane the win states were great sea states are great and once that done once that is done the flight surgeon will pop his head in do an initial check see how bob and doug are doing and dragon spacex we've got a slight delay due to some potential ndo hits near the side hatch happy mike we're uh standing by and so they're still continuing to do kind of those sniffs so checking for any vapors or anything so those ndo it's no2 nitrogen dioxide can get detected in the air from the burning of fuel so they're going to continue to just inspect around the capsule make sure that it's again safe for the crew safe for the recovery experts before they get this hatch open do you want to point out the photographer there on the left that is bill ingles nasa photographer glad to see him on the deck down at 11 48 a.m pacific and so again they're just pausing the operations for a moment doing some additional air sampling around the prop system we still have telemetry being fed from the vehicle so flight controllers here in hawthorne able to monitor prop tanks propulsion tank pressures and not seeing any issues with those at the moment can you imagine if someone if this becomes a thing and people all try to boat out to it right away and someone ends up just crashing right into it and damaging the spacecraft ah man yeah so i don't know why they uh so apparently from from michael baylor from nasa space flight who is definitely one of the everyone at nasa space flight that works for mass space fire are just awesome i mean smart they know their stuff if you need a trusted source for your space flight news uh i couldn't recommend nasa space flight enough they're definitely some of the absolute industry leaders but michael baylor from nasa space flight says sounds like the issue might be that while you can put up a hazard zone in the international waters they do not have the authority to enforce it but hopefully we'll find out more post landing briefing man i we'll see i mean maybe that's something that changes i would hope that maybe they get someone that can enforce it or something like that seems ridiculous i know it is a private spacecraft but at the same time it's doing i don't know it just seems not smart for you know if they can't enforce that exclusion zone let's see i'm trying to listen into like what the actual issue is with the opening of the hatch and they're just double checking that there's no no leaks anywhere checking that everything is okay to go and dragon spacex update we're still investigating it looks like we'll be setting up a service section purge we're working on a eta for you so they might have to do a purge gas purge in case if you're just joining us nasa astronauts bob bankin and doug hurley have safely returned from the international space station they made an on-time splashdown in the gulf of mexico just off the coast of pensacola florida at 11 48 a.m pacific 18 48 a.m universal time and they have been pulled out of the water and hoisted onto the recovery vessel go navigator and right now the team is just completing they did an initial check and found that there might be some remnant vapors which we certainly don't want to be around when we have bob and doug coming out of the capsule so the team is working to purge the service section in preparation for crew egress just a little commentary on the hatches that that we've been talking about so while dragon's top hatch is used to connect to the international space station uh that's the one that's located under the nose cone which is currently hidden there at the top of the capsule before the this is the the side hatch is what is utilized utilized for uh ingress and egress both on the launch pad as well as coming up here on the recovery vessel when the international or excuse me when the capsule is docked to the international space station they will use the forward hatch to exit and enter the capsule so i should i should note that there they were supposed to get the crew out of the water and everything in an hour and they had the the vessel up on the ship in like 30 minutes i mean they were quick to recover this vessel that the spacecraft this is really really impressive and you know it's mostly just a matter of they had a guideline of you know how long it should take and both boeing who also is a commercial crew partner and spacex are supposed to have the crew outside uh recovered within an hour and it's kind of just that's more of a you know generic guideline but um yeah so i'm still listening in here stable condition now that they're on the boat not in the water uh but again our team's just continuing to step through they're they're reporting that they're seeing all of the vapor levels that they initially detected have been dropping in that service section per dragon spacex we showed that levels are declining but are continuing with purge uh and in addition just so you know we are not seeing any you know leak indications or anything like that these are pretty small levels but we still need to do the purge at this time okay cappy yeah you're reading our mind mike we were just wondering if you saw any indications of a leak or some depressurization somewhere but it sounds like it's just uh part of the deal cool yeah that's a good read back doug so just kind of putting them at ease that the what they're so right now they're just kind of sensors are picking up a lit little bit of like nitrogen um or some kind of uh gas i didn't quite read which one it is um but it's it's a very trace mode it's obviously not enough to affect the people around but they're just making sure that everything's stable before they even open the hatch there there could be some pressure differential just making sure everything's good and bob and doug were curious like we're just making sure this isn't like a hydrazine leak or something uh hazardous you know or something that would be uh explosive because of course there are propellants still on board the spacecraft there's still that monomethylhydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide onboard the spacecraft and those are you know highly pressurized still um but they just really wanted to make sure that you know there's that they're they get their reminds it is that we're not seeing a leak in that right you know basically um how urgent is this and it's it sounds like it's very not urgent but they're just waiting until everything is completely to this the the standard state of you know how of how uh inside the capsule oh dan was kind of um yeah they're just basically waiting till the levels are at the you know where they're supposed to be basically oh man let's see um oh we're getting buffering from this okay it's back we had a little double buffer there i apologize about that so hopefully just about 44 minutes post splashdown uh actually still ahead of the timeline as we weren't expecting to get the hatch open until shortly before 60 minutes at which point we'd be bringing bob and doug out so this service section spacex another update the service section purge should begin in a bit under five minutes uh right now we're showing nto about 2x of our personnel exposure limits and we're hoping once we start the purge it'll drop down for us there we go okay thanks mike so they're about twice over there basically double the and i'm gonna have to correct the amount of resources mto that's the dinitrogen tetra oxide and that's one of the hypergolic fuels used inside dragon for powering those uh draco thrusters yeah i should mention the so the way that the hypergolic propellants work and the reason they're used even though they're really nasty stuff to try to try to work with the beautiful thing about hypergolic propellants and hypergolic fuels so there's always you're going to have a fuel and you're going to have an oxidizer unless it's a monoprop so you have your fuel and your oxidizer your fuels obviously monomethylhydrazine your oxygens nitrogen tetroxide and when they come in contact with each other they instantly ignite they just can't help it the chemical reaction happens and they just they just they go right this is fantastic when you're using them for for thrusters for little maneuvering thrusters because again as i mentioned a long time it feels like hours ago now almost or two two minutes ago depending on how you feel uh that they were just up in orbit and we're talking about the maneuvering thrusters those draco thrusters you can't throttle a maneuvering thruster like that they literally just work in impulses so you're just doing little little just blast small timing it's all about time it's not about like you know like up or down throttle it's about how long they're you know igniting and so you need something that can be extremely instantaneous you can't have there be like a pump and then a you know a little like spark or anything anything can go wrong it just needs to work and that's the cool thing about hypergolics and that's why they're used in spaceflight is because it's just instantaneous so they keep them inside of extremely highly pressurized composite overwrap pressure vessels they keep them in these bottles those bottles are under high pressure and then uh all they do is they basically have little little valves like digital valves or electronic valves that be can be controlled by the spacecraft and they can just go you know and like literally just open these valves perfectly in these sequences down to like some of the nicest highest and thrusters that i could find online when researching this was down to like 0.03 seconds so what is that 300th of a second which is really quite amazing okay so just because they're probably still at that limit it looks like they might they're going to purge this is to make sure that the lingering nto fumes that the team is detecting get flushed out essentially the service section is not the interior cabin where bob and doug are it's actually the part of the capsule that is outside of the place where bob and doug are that's it's external to the to the cabin but it's inside the capsule itself so you can think of it as the space between the exterior of the dragon capsule and the interior space uh where bob and doug are there's the i think the interior pressure vessel essentially yes exactly so bob and doug are fine the air that they are breathing is you know that nitrox mix that they've been getting throughout the entire duration of of of today's operations but it'll be essentially the area below their cabin completely sealed off from the service section yeah that service section is where we there's a lot of telemetry it's where there are the prop tanks and we're just making sure that those get aerated so that lingering fumes are swept away again they had detected higher levels than they want to see of nitrogen tetra oxide that's one of the two hypergolic fuels used in dragon the other one being monomethylhydrazine those two fuels essentially when thrown together even without an ignition source will react that's what makes them hypergolic fuels a much simpler more elegant solution used in a lot of on-orbit maneuvering systems in spacecraft yep just as i was saying a second ago so again we're just standing by so as you can see on your screen there is one crew member that has kind of what looks like a dragon spacex i don't have a great huge update for you just letting you know the service section purge is still in work and we'll try to get you out of there shortly so as i was saying two individuals on your screen there one with a face mask and what looks like a scuba tank there with some clean breathing air there might be another crew member with the same personal protective equipment or ppe that will come on deck here that type of equipment ah there we go that's the kind of equipment that is required in order to perform this purge again the nto is the fumes from that are toxic and of course we want to keep all crew members safe as we prepare the side hatch for opening in order to let bob's progress it looks like limits are dropping and getting pretty good we're still continuing with the purge just to be extra sure so um just a real quick question uh from robin the hood is the international space station currently celebrating watching this moment the answer i would definitely say i would assume yes or at least they're being briefed on what's going on because these were their crewmates for two months you know they're on uh on station with with the people currently on there for expedition uh i can't remember the number right now but you know they were these are their friends and their colleagues at this point splashing down of course they're paying attention and probably extra so because it was the first flight of a brand new spacecraft as kate was talking about they're not inside the pressure vessel the section of the dragon interior where bob and doug and their atmosphere exist uh they're essentially outside the pressure vessel but still inside the outer shell of the dragon spacecraft man there the funny thing is they're probably going to get into shore here pretty soon actually because they're not too far off the coast thank you sean for subscribing so this is as funny is they kind of refer to this as the spacex navy believe it or not so it's funny you say that mugsy um they yeah i mean maybe we'll develop new protocols and stuff like that like like we said that you know crew recovery is the absolute number one priority and uh yeah this is a good question um from from mouse max says will dragon get a jet watch before it flies again yeah it's actually going to get a decent amount of refurbishment there's about two months worth of refurbishment planned um according to benji reid who's the principal engineer for the dragon program uh he said it'll only take about a couple months to really refurbish it and get ready for flight again and then they hope to fly this same spacecraft again in i believe it's um i believe it's in like march or february march so early 2021 we should see this exact same dragon spacecraft flag and you can tell that the exterior gets it you know it takes a little bit of a beating it takes some scorching so they can actually respray all that the um the thermal insulation and thermal foam they can inspect the heat shield the heat shield again is supposed to be reusable they might replace them i'm not sure where they're actually at in that process but levels have dropped sufficiently we'll be able to step back in to the hatch opening process from halter ferguson says where's a can of air when you need one just okay guys you're good to go but on that note zach asked doug will be getting assistance this is a good question uh why don't they dump all that propellant and depressurize after the shoot deploys you don't actually want to dump the propellant because it is again so toxic so unbelievably spontaneously combusting that if it you'd end up just with this huge you'd end up with like the ocean on fire you'd end up with toxic fumes everywhere making it so the recovery vessel can't get to them you really want to keep them they're safe and they're they're completely safe inside their bottles they're you know stored in highly pressurized uh composite overhead pressure vessels so they're safe in there um and they're stable they're not really under much risk it's just that um if there would happen to be a leak or anything it definitely has to be mitigated and they have to purge it with nitrogen which is exactly what they're trying to do now so they're and it might not even be a leak it's just that some of the thruster firing you know some of that gas could have got stuck just and we're talking trace amounts we're talking about like literally it could be so just right at the threshold like they said is about twice over the threshold and that threshold is like basically zero right if we if we sniff any of it it's the threshold so um so there what they can do is because some of that can get trapped between the outer body work the outer molding basically and the inner pressure vessel which is where a lot of that equipment is at that point is when um is is is where some of this gas seems to be just a little bit trapped and they're going to be just purging with nitrogen and of course our atmosphere is is primarily nitrogen so it's just an inert gas that they can just you know shoot through it it won't it won't um interact with anything and yeah international space station and then they're right here with the front line with the recovery teams ready to welcome them home so it's been just about a minute since we heard that last call to the crew same with this that's why they can't ditch it we should be just about done and they need the they need the fuel up in space too they need that to re-enter that stills what controls the the thrusters through reentry well on this note you know branded saying we just saw why they why they used to use aircraft carriers recover apollo well but don't forget also the the apollo spacecraft always splashed down in the pacific ocean in the middle of the pacific ocean so just to have vessels capable of you know those deep sea operations and out there in the middle the ocean states and all that stuff um it was just in the middle of nowhere so this wasn't anywhere near the coast where anyone could go out and boat to it so i don't think it had too much to do with like the military aspect which is literally what boats are physically capable of being out there and providing for the crew the recovery crew and the the astronauts again i'm i really sincerely apologize that i might be missing some of your guys's tips i'm trying to kind of get through these here but also trying to not interrupt what's going on on screen too try again spacex 4 update exterior we're seeing uh three parts per million nto and six parts per billion of uh mmh and nil however is asking that you desto your triggers and take a sample inside the cabin so just double checking that there isn't any of yeah which detector what number like yeah it'll be uh detectors two and three in location 14. so just making sure okay thanks doug there's a leak inside the spacecraft at all being extra cautious all right so we just got the the call out of the current readings of both the nto the nitrogen tetra oxide and the monomethyl hydrazine either in the parts per million or the parts per billion but just as an extra safety precaution we heard anneal so anil menon the medical authority from spacex on the boat asking the crew to take out some air detectors that they have inside with them just to do some quick sampling inside the cabin itself so again we've said it before we'll continue to say it throughout safety the top priority with this operation so the teams are going to be very methodical and make sure that everything is in a good setup a safe environment not only for the crew themselves but also for our recovery forces but for now bob and doug still inside of crew dragon we are just 58 minutes post landing elon's still there is still there i'm guessing he he's probably not going anywhere until the crew is off of the vehicle and safe spacex dragon with a status go ahead doug okay for uh nr2 on detector 2 it reads 0.0 and on detector 3 it also reads 0.0 for mmh good okay great news 0.0 for detectors 2 and 3 for no2 and mmh thank you very much that's good copy and so doug hurley reporting zeros across the board no traces of either the nto or the mmh that's good so we're still just kind of tuning in to make sure that watch until everything's safe so like i said this might end up being a really big day for spacex because there's a chance that after all this is done here a totally different set of crews different teams don't forget there's about 7 000 plus employees that work for spacex so it's not uh it doesn't really have anything to do with uh with what's happening here today but spacex for a status update one second okay so currently our exposure limits um are below limits but the purge is actually doing a pretty good job we saw nto go from three parts per million down to 1.5 over the last few minutes so ideally with a lot of caution we'd go ahead and let the purge run for a little bit longer but we want to see how you guys are doing if you're okay with continuing with with the purge versus uh knock it off and get you guys out of there quickly yeah we're fine hanging out mike no problem here okay thanks for that doug we'll uh keep working the purge to uh get us down and uh and uh thanks for the thanks for that yeah let's just keep everybody safe no reason to rush yeah we concur yep that's the right attitude early reporting the crew still doing well in dragon so they are good to continue to hang out the medical authority there on the boat recommending uh as long as the crew is okay and still doing well inside dragon they'll just continue with the purge trying to get those trace readings of any hyper golf vapors all the way down to zero because again we're really focused on not only keeping the astronauts safe but all of the recovery engineers and medical professionals so yeah i just wanted to kind of continue my thoughts sorry i got it i was listening in there so it's it actually and i got an update it sounds like the the hop test today the star trippers starship or starship is likely canceled for today sounds like the next uh attempt wouldn't be until tomorrow so that means we'll probably have to wait for tomorrow to to do the hop and that's okay i think this is plenty of action for spacex for one day um and again they're they're just being very cautious making sure they're completely all at the thresholds to safely get them out of there and have all the the gases safely dissipate and get out of there too so um we're at an hour and two minutes so we're kind of right at where they should be have gotten out it seems like if there wasn't that detection that they probably would have been fine in about you know t-plus or splashdown plus like 35 minutes yeah expecting seasickness um so good it is good to hear that they're doing well still inside the dragon capsule oh man huge thank you to to gita this is really genuinely generous it's funny our our system here our comment system doesn't show you but it is one of those animated pairs writing a firework but it just spells it out for us which is equally great so thank you so much to gita and also i just saw a really generous one too from alex mann alex thorne so thank you gita and alex horn this is just too generous tim just before the big moment big thanks for all your work love the channel keep it going greetings from the space fans space fans and friends in the netherlands i'm telling you i cannot wait so first off thank you sincerely thank you so much but i cannot wait to get back to being able to travel i want to go back to europe um you know someday i want to do like a speaking tour like i said um where we can do you know bigger some of the you know top five or ten big cities in europe and you guys can come out and hear speeches about space flight or we just talk and do q and a's or something i don't know um but i would love to do that and it just sucks this year is not going to happen at all since i literally physically can't even travel to europe and i want to do that around the united states too but it's just not a good time for something like that so it's fun to come here together so i can't wait to come visit my friends and and fans in the netherlands it'll be awesome um morgan t has a this is a good question morgan t wants to know why don't they land in the great lakes to avoid the salt water issues so i don't know if salt water is particularly that much more corrosive um but the the great lakes is also a significantly smaller target to land in um and near a lot some pretty big metropolis areas as well i just don't think it'd be um and they want to be keep their vessels and all the crew and all that stuff down near the space coast down near all their operations so they don't have to you know i mean i suppose they if if saltwater was a huge issue they could potentially look into something like that but i i'm guessing it's more just water and not necessarily the fact that it's salt water um and they do some things to try to mitigate that so um let's see here um thank you so much again to to ian here man this is crazy about the egress process getting bob and doug out of the capsule once they're in the medical area they'll look to start bringing in the helicopter as both a bomb and dog are going to be flown back to pensacola via helicopter getting them to the shore in just a matter of minutes where a nasa plane is going to be standing by to then load them up and bring them home to ellington airfield at the johnson space center in houston um this is basically what they're doing here um from from mi uh why not just flush it with pressurized air actively like fans uh clearing smoke from building or is that what they're doing that is pretty much what they're doing they're actively purging nitrogen through the lines enough to be able to clear out any of those cavities that might have um a little bit of just residual amounts of fuel we're talking about like parts per million parts per billion amounts of these fuel so it's literally like by definition trace amounts like we're not talking about like pockets of it so because it's also such trace amounts it might also be harder to flush out as well because you know it might just kind of hang out there so in light of one of the social media questions that we were asked earlier someone asked if bob and doug have netflix available on their heads-up displays there in the capsule and they've been they've actually been pretty busy throughout this mission you know monitoring telemetry and data and checking for timing and i would say now's about the time that they would certainly want something to watch because you know at this point their only job left to do is get out of the capsule has to be a feeling of just success though for those two i mean taking taking the first flight in a brand new spacecraft we knew as test pilots this is something that was kind of their bread and butter when they were in the military and definitely something they they left at the chance for once they became astronauts and really a pretty flawless flight for dragon obviously will have all of the the post flight review coming up in the next several weeks as we continue to assess all the data that we receive throughout the mission and any data still recorded locally on dragon itself and we'll be spending the next several weeks going through and assessing the mission and working through the certification process and we're already targeting the first operational flight currently pegged for no earlier than late september yep late september for some reason i was thinking it's more early september um this is a good question here from from okay um they're oh sorry i just was listening they they are going to be starting either starting or stopping the purge um but there is no longer external power being provided to the dragon caps i don't think at least on the boat because it has internal batteries to last a healthy amount of time um probably probably days even would be how long the spacecraft can survive you know because it would need to be able to survive long enough that if you know recovery vessels they splash down way off target that recovery vessels could get to them so they have substantial battery packs in there space station on saturday they had a sleep period eight hours of rest on the capsule on their way home they've been up since a little bit earlier this morning that weight coming about 4 40 a.m pacific so a little more than eight hours ago and a dragon the purge is now complete one more drager check and then we should proceed with hatch opening sweet okay good news thanks that is good news indeed so confirmation that the purge is complete and that they're just going to do one more test to make sure that all of the fumes of concern are away and that it is safe to open that side hatch and retrieve bob and doug once again once that side hatch is open our flight surgeon will be the first to say hello get a quick medical checkup although based on the reports that they've been pro that the crew have been giving us along the way it sounds like they're doing great they're feeling good and they're pretty comfortable there inside a crew dragon things are looking good it seems like everyone wait to hear back from that reading here on whether or not it it worked it looks like there's enough people around now that they must be pretty confident they brought everyone back and uh dragon spacex we show 0.4 parts per million on nto 18 parts per billion of mmh that's below limits we are proceeding with hatch opening let's get them out of there okay great news thanks mike all right so there's the green light we've been waiting for uh in fact the green light we've been waiting for for months at this point uh this is our first opportunity to say hello to bob and doug our favorite space dads as they are now about to egress or exit from dragon crew endeavor again this is the culmination of what has been about a 19 hour journey home all starting yesterday as they departed the international space station thank you thank you so this hatch will be manually opened and once doing so flight surgeon anil menon will say hello and make sure that they're still doing all right and then proceed to assist them with exiting the capsule hey chad hope as well there we go and we see the hatch is now open hatch being opened at 12 59 pm pacific match is open yes so right now they're going to put a piece of equipment in there that basically smooths out the edges and make sure that it is a comfortable exit from the dragon capsule just a little piece of structure there to ensure that the hatch will remain open and that any sharp edges around that side hatch are protected so now remember again they're going to be escorted like helped out because they are weak they've been in space for two months on the international space station where they're experiencing micro gs their bodies are not used to a full g um so they're weak and they need help out and again this was different from the space shuttle most of the time the space shuttle uh the crews were never on board for more than two weeks due to the limitations in fuel cells and so they could pretty easily just trot down looks like bill engel's got his picture and now they're helping just to make sure that everything's good to go i can't wait to see him get out of there i'm curious how this will look actually because they're in a seated position they have to come forward so they're facing the hatch right now on a seat about like this just a little bit reclined whenever the people get down in there and they have to kind of pick them up and rotate them or wonder i'm sure they practice that choreography the spacex recovery team is now assisting nasa astronauts bob benkin and doug hurley to exit the spacecraft sorry we got the hatch open just about two minutes ago we paused for a little while as they were just detecting some trace amounts of some of the hyper golf fuels so we executed a series of purges and then once those were down back in acceptable limits we were able to then start with the egress there we see a stretcher on deck this is normal this is part of the standard recovery procedure and it is just simply to ensure bob and doug remain safe like we said readjusting to gravity can be a little challenging uh dizziness can often occur especially when you're on a boat so this stretcher will just be used to a standard procedure to make sure that the astronauts make it over to the medical tent as easily and as comfortably as possible this has to be the smallest recovery boat that astronauts have ever gotten on i'll bet besides the crew of soyuz 23 but all other missions for the united states that splashed down between 19 what was that 1960 or in 1961 and and 1975 all had literally like aircraft carriers is safe and free from any injury now that they are home so that's that's different you know yeah this is um this is a good question here the next big mission if you guys ever need to know like what's kind of coming up we do have on our website everydayastronaut.com you can click on pre-launch previews and get a sense of some of the missions but i'd say the next big exciting thing will be another crude mission here end of september on another dragon capsule and falcon 9 but other than that i think um i think the one that i'm looking forward to would be starship development down in boca chica texas which which again we're looking at hopefully a hop this hopefully tomorrow and then maybe some higher altitude flights soon thereafter if this goes well hopefully we're looking at still being on target to see a 20 kilometer hop this year which will have this crazy belly flop maneuver this is uncrewed of course it's totally developmental but it's such a big scale doing such wild things that it's really really fun to watch um stick around on my channel if you guys have questions about that stuff um i explain all of that you know like i'm constantly kind of showing you all the things like i said this morning i did a video released it this morning all about why how exactly all this stuff happens the mechanics the systems um i like to break down things like that and i've done things on like why they're gonna do that belly flop maneuver for starship um i've done videos on why they're using stainless steel for starship instead of carbon fiber i basically cover as much of this stuff as i can for you guys to help you understand um chip endeavor i'm sure doug will have some good words for you guys as well but uh thank you for doing the most difficult parts and the most important parts of uh human space flight getting us into orbit and bringing us home safely thank you again for the good ship endeavor that was bob banking commander bob banking thank you bob for those awesome words it's absolutely been an honor and a pleasure to work with you from the entire spacex team it's been and awesome we'll hear from doug hurley as well some initial words from nasa astronaut bob bankin he's in the pilot seat so you've heard him refer to himself as plt we're still standing by for crew members to begin making their way out of the crew dragon spacecraft and again they're going to get some assistance just uh the couple of feet to the medical quarters on board the ship where they're going to be able to get out of their suits that they've been wearing for all the the final dynamic phases of the separation events deorbit burn re-entry splashing down just a little over an hour ago at 11 48 pm or am pacific time go for spacex here we have our first view of michael i just would like to sort of reiterate what bob said and add my thanks to everybody over the last several years that's either worked in hawthorne mcgregor or down at kennedy space center anybody who's touched endeavor you should take a moment to just cherish this day especially given all the things that have happened this year we certainly can't thank you enough our families can't thank you enough just proud to be a small part of this whole effort to get the company people to and from the space station they can celebrate with each other cease and we'll talk to you soon hopefully in person thanks so much doug and you're welcome and thank you so much for those kind words and we all wish you a safe journey home and a happy reunion with your family soon and we look forward to seeing you in person as well some really nice words there from bob banks there on your screen we saw uh nasa astronaut doug hurley egressing or exiting from the capsule might have been hard to see on your screen there but we got a thumbs up indicating that things are going well if this is a real quick thanks to the last person we had on screen craig jones thank you for watching with your family or watching with your son i that means a lot to me i i work really hard to make sure the content is always family focused and uh digestible for everyone no matter what level of knowledge they have um we want to assume that you know that not everyone's an expert because this stuff can be really intimidating but it's extremely exciting stuff to learn together and it's fun for us to be able to come together and celebrate this stuff together no matter where you are in the world i don't care if you live in you know any any other country this is not a great day just for the united states this is a great day for all of humanity that we're increasing our access to space and working on an exciting future where space flight's cheaper more readily available more and more routine that's what this is all about and i just think that's a future worth being excited for i think that's a future worth um worth celebrating and coming together about and and again i i've said this many times and i it just keeps being drilled in that 2020 has just been a year of division where people are just continually bickering over the silliest things together and it's like this is our time to come together and just celebrate human achievement and celebrate human exploration that's that's what space flight is to me that's why i'm so excited about space flight because it it it bonds us it brings us together and there can even be friendly competition or even unfriendly competition still brings out the best in humanity no matter what it is because we're pushing the boundaries of knowledge we're pushing the boundaries of science and exploration um and engineering i mean this is this is what the stuff is all about spacex has done some incredible things to be able to do this here today it might seem like we're doing things that we're doing again back in 1960s uh but the the way they're doing it these days is completely different way more the cost has come down already by almost an order of magnitude compared to old vehicles highly capable vehicle and again this is just one of two vehicles that nasa has hired to fly crew to the international space station hopefully we'll see boeing get their starliner back up in the air this year for another uncrewed test flight and then the starliners should take off again hopefully this year and did they say that the first person all right so they're getting set up and we should see spacecraft commander doug hurley making his way out of the capsule and it looks like we've got him out we've got him seated there he is there we go another thumbs up can't wait to see those pictures we've got some applause here and as you can see in mission control a standing ovation for a job well done all around yeah our crew members bob and doug are now safely back home on earth and they're going to get checked out now by the nasa medical team they're going straight into the medical quarters onboard the ship that'll be their first stop on planet earth and then they're going to be making their way up into a helicopter and then heading back to dry land so once they're complete the team's going to prepare dragon itself and they're going to begin taking it back to shore but just it's been an incredible incredible mission this all kicked off just two months ago on may 30th from launch pad 39a at the kennedy space center in florida we had a successful liftoff we had to dodge around some weather it was suspenseful clearing up the last possible moment they had a flawless ride to orbit a 19-hour journey to the international space station where they just spent 62 days on board 64 total days in space they were expedition 30 63 crew members doing science experiments space walks repairs everything on board the orbiting laboratory their journey home began yesterday when they closed the hatch to dragon and undocked hours later at 4 35 pm pacific after four successful departure burns and a phasing burn to line up their orbit bob and doug rested up before waking up for a re-entry earlier this morning we successfully jettisoned dragon's trunk and performed our final on-orbit maneuver the deorbit burn at 10 56 a.m pacific to send dragon on the path home the spacecraft successfully re-entered the earth's atmosphere and slowed its descent with successful deployments of two drogue parachutes and four mains with the final splashdown occurring off the coast of pensacola florida at 11 48 a.m pacific right on time following that successful splashdown we saw spacex recovery experts quickly move in and prepare dragon endeavor for its lift onto the recovery vessel and just a little less than an hour following splashdown we saw bob benkin and doug hurley make their way thumbs up out of dragon and into the recovery ship's medical facilities safe and sound yeah we just got word that the helicopter itself should be landing soon so that'll be their next step in their journey they'll catch a short flight back to shore where they're going to transfer to a waiting nasa plane for another short flight back over to houston uh they're gonna be reunited with their families and that's gonna bring an end to this historic flight uh it's it's really been an honor and a privilege to share this journey with all of you as we open up this new era in human space flight but i mean just as we close the book on this mission we're already counting down the days to the next crude dragon flight yeah absolutely spacex and nasa will now begin the process of reviewing data and telemetry from this successful demonstration mission to prepare us for crew one which is currently targeted to launch no earlier than late september crew one will be space that's awesome we've talked all about that i should mention before we before you guys all leave here that today uh this shirt the f1 engine shirt is 10 off if you guys want to get your own f1 engine shirt by using the coupon code launch day all lower case one word launcher i don't know we were trying to debate in discord here if elon was wearing i don't think he was wearing his full flow stage combustion cycle shirt uh but that's also available we also have a new full flow stage combustion cycle hoodie as well these are brand new these ones are awesome they're literally just got in stock they have uh really cool insignias on the side that show like the chamber pressure the efficiency and the thrust of the of the raptor engine uh the diagram on the back custom these are all the hand sewn here handprint in the united states very premium bespoke things we don't do print on demand uh so they're fulfilled in

speechless there were multiple times where for good and bad we definitely had some fun things to talk about there but what what a memorable mission and it's so fun to see that this this mission was absolutely flawless and once bob and dog are back home safe they're i know they're excited to see their families there's a really cute tweet earlier from um let me see if i can pull that up here give me one second i'm just gonna go to see my retweets and i'll be able to find it easiest that way um it just almost made me cry just because it's so cute because they both have kids both their wives are

through each of them have one son and bob and doug are literally like best friends they were in each other's weddings i mean it doesn't get any more of like a just feel-good story than that and again like i keep saying 2020 is the year where you know there's been so much negativity and this is just something to cheer for be excited about look forward to and just come together you know that's that's what i'm all i'm all about unity and about looking forward and trying to do good things together and not try to split hairs and and be you know be negative so i'm really sorry that i that i miss a lot of your guys's super chats but i just want to thank you so much for all your love and support uh even here for me uh that it really goes a long ways and for me like the internet can be a really toxic place and i can get lost sometimes just in the negativity and the and and mean comments and things like that i think a lot of us can and it just seems like everyone's extraordinary right now because everyone's kind of just in this weird half panic mode but everything's okay but what do we do and uncertainty and um and it just means so much we have a place here that you guys all come and hang out uh there's a lot to look forward to there's a lot of fun content coming out um we're working straight away tomorrow i'm gonna be diving in well tomorrow we might have to cover the hop now the seal number five starship prototype hop in boca chica texas we have a lot of stuff going on and there's a lot to look forward to so at least it's it's never ending and that can be good and that can be bad so i just thank you guys for for choosing to to watch this with me to to come part and be part of our community um and you know and and just just coming together and celebrating this stuff it just means a lot to me it means a lot to my community again my discord channel um you guys are awesome i really really appreciate everyone that's in discord they've seen the past week they've seen uh andrew and i just go well i passed two weeks because really we started working on that curiosity versus perseverance launch about two or three weeks ago and have just been going crazy ever since then it's just been like firing on all cylinders so um if you guys do want to join our awesome discord channel or have more community to hang out with um get some of those behind the scenes things of how we're making videos what we're working on next uh go to patreon.com everydayastronaut love you guys it's been a wild two months i'm telling you that if i can't believe that was two months ago already i was down in florida during the middle of a pandemic masked up like crazy washed my hands constantly uh practicing ex nasa was really good about practicing social distancing and man i should try to find that that shot of of that was still one of the most incredible things i have ever seen was you know i've seen so many launches in person i think i've seen probably you know close to 15 or 20 launches i don't even know anymore um and to see knowing that there's two other their human lives on board i frankly i really wish i i always wanted it to be um i always wanted it to see a soyuz i assumed i'd see a soyuz before i saw this and i'd love to see a soyuz still but there's something an emotional connection when you see humans leaving uh this is gonna be a weird picture-in-picture in picture maybe i will um how do i get my little face over here you know there's something when you're when you're standing there and you see there we go ignition yeah yeah yeah the dawn of a new era everybody yeah yes the dawn of a new era go go doug that was fun i love that percussive sound that to me that's worth celebrating that's worth cheering for that's worth being excited about and and that's what this is all about you know that's what spaceflight represents for me it just brings out the best in humanity it brings out the best in hard work education it brings out the best in dedication just every bit of it it's it's the commitment to a long-term goal and just really nailing it down and uh yeah this is just the beginning guys like i said there's something i it was so sad for me that the because of the pandemic the global health crisis there weren't crowds of people normally there's the press site is full to the brim i was one of only 75 lucky members of the press that got access to that um and you know one of somehow i still don't know how this happened but one of only two people got interviews with elon musk and jim breinstein that day it was me and cbs and that still blows my mind and the the fact that that's the limitation that there was on that event one of the biggest events at least in my career covering space flight one of the coolest things i've ever seen covering space flight had to be limited to 75 people was just heartbreaking too but at the same time it was so cool that we could all still come together you know we all could come together hang out and just yeah it was it was awesome so i i look forward to more that we need more of this um oh yes ginger man in our discord says i still want to see the dash cam footage from the car i did save it i did save it i have it somewhere i probably should should pull it up somewhere so oh man what an awesome awesome day though um i i'm probably gonna start heading out of here guys oh man hold on did i miss jeez what hold on hold on hold on sorry i have been hold on that can't be right um someone donated way too much i think can i click right on it in youtube here jeez pexus i'm sorry i totally missed this thank you uh really really really appreciate that that is absolutely unnecessary at this point uh but i promise we're just working on kicking out some content for you guys and and trying to just maintain positive and and have some fun and learn together you know again that's just what all this stuff is about so uh i i better work on signing out of here guys because there's still a lot of stuff going on a lot of a lot of things happening that we have to be working on the back end here i also happen to completely accidentally shut down my thing how did that happen uh but just thank you guys again for hanging out i really hope that you enjoyed this and this gave you something to look forward to and then we could come together again next time there's a launch and splashdown um yeah um super super awesome i just really love and appreciate you all so let me know what the questions you guys have like i said we'll definitely for sure um have a lot of content coming out we're definitely working on um part two finally of sls versus starship which is kind of more it turned more into because we really talk about the funding scheme and the funding structure of fixed price contracting and sls and how it's doing so the best way you can compare that is not to compare it to the private industry but to compare it to the apollo program so we're really comparing the costs and the benefits of the apollo program versus the artemis program but what's cool is the artemis program will say what you will about sls and it's really rough start and it's but it's currently doing pretty good again um but it has the human lander systems and a lot of commercial partners involved in the artemis program so does it weigh out and and bring us up to the how does it compare to apollo and how how are the the the actual mission architectures what are they like because they're very different mission architectures yes they both go to the moon but they couldn't really do it in more opposite ways so i'm already on page like 12 of that script uh we'll be hopefully filming that here pretty soon so uh yeah uh i i do have to say i do not think there's going to be a serial number five hop today from what i'm hearing it is no longer uh it is no longer happening uh today at least but again thank you to everyone i'm so sorry that i i miss a lot of you guys things it was just too too much going on i appreciate you guys though so much so stick around again remember to watch the video that i put out this morning if you really want to appreciate what all happened today the hardware involved the timelines the criteria the mechanics the orbital mechanics all of that stuff i've got you covered it's a deep dive rundown on everything that happened today um so you know what to expect next time this happens which again hopefully will be pretty soon pretty soon so um yeah all right i love you guys i'm gonna get out of here thank you guys so much for tuning in and hanging out with us also it's been fantastic um congrats again to bob and doug welcome home huge congratulations to nasa for selecting such an awesome commercial partner uh to do this safely and of course huge congratulations to my friends and teams at spacex you guys are awesome thank you for continuing to inspire us and make this stuff frankly look kind of easy uh that's the highest compliment i think you can get is knowing that you made this stuff look easy and look cool and look fun so thank you for doing that thank you for giving us all a little spark of imagination uh yeah all right guys that's gonna do it for me i'm tim dodd the everyday astronaut bringing space down to earth for everyday people bye everybody so so so you
