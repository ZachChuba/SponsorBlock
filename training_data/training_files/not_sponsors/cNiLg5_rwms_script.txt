[GGG waiting room in Taiwan] Ooh, a forsythia bloomed over there. The forsythia bloomed! The Taiwanese fans prepared so much for us. This was a container full of nougat crackers, But it's now empty. I think the person who ate the most  of this Was SOWON. And SINB in second place. In third place, probably YERIN. Does it usually zoom in this close? - Or maybe I pulled it too close?
- It's just your arms that are short! [SINB's offense] Dummy! But it's so heavy... She says my arms are short, BUDDIES... Well, it's true. Is it? Of course. Of course! BUDDY! Are my arms that short? Why, of course~ If not, there's no way your face would appear that big on camera. Or maybe it's my face that's big. That's a fact too. I'm going to film you from underneath if you keep going like that. Fine! - I can handle the underneath shot.
- The importance of the camera angle. [Confident] But you do look good... Stretch your arms. Even your arms are long! I know, right? Hey, you hold the camera.
Let's see how the angle is when you're holding the camera. Okay. How is it? - See? Now your face looks bigger!
- Nope! Do I look as big as UMJI? Give it back. [UMJI can't lose LOL]
What the heck are you doing? Don't act like your arms are long. They are short, you know. I have a long pair of arms! Sometimes people say I
look like one of those monkey dolls on Kipling bags. Now I think I know. - Hang on, are you choking me?
- No! I'm cupping your face in my hand. Wow, hilarious.
