all right ladies gentlemen welcome back to another episode of RL crafts as floats your goat so feel free to check it out dude I look so good in diamond armor oh my goodness look at this look at this do you know oh yeah dude this is the first time I've done the f5 intro with diamond and boy oh boy it's looking Gucci oh hey you adjusted the this I didn't have a chance to make fun of you for the step here that you couldn't grip on going in I'm sure yeah I mean I told you when you were complaining about it I was like I haven't had time to finish things like let me at least you know finish what I'm doing before you start making fun of me so since last time we've decided to come here and colonize this beautiful structure we have managed to transfer over the inventory from our previous place so it's at least a little bit of inventory organization going on here mob drop coal tools weapons armor random stuff it's always it's always good to have a couple random stuffs chests yeah the problem is is the random stuff chests you ever know it's like they spread yeah yeah I know it's it's a virus and it just goes yeah I need to get more charcoal filters though I feel like before we set off again so I can remind myself yeah unless of course you have a bunch of them on hand no no no it's are you charcoal filter what this is oh yes paper charcoal and paper wait do we have a lot of charcoal did I put that in the coal thing or are we all oh we do have a lot of charcoal that's brilliant freakin beautiful and inside know exactly where it is because we put the paper in the wood bipe wood and wood byproducts chests and then I put the coal in the coal chest and then I can just go over here and then I can just make a bunch of freakin things and then all of a sudden I got a bunch of charcoal filters that first reason don't stack because some of them have NBT data and others don't don't worry about is that ya know I'm still confused why he monetizing or I'm alive ik is now another alternative term it's NVT tags on things you know these things can happen sometimes okay don't you worry about a thing I was worried but now I'm no longer thank you for that right so I figure as is kind of the core of this modpack we should probably go and explore a little bit more eh yeah it seems like a plan or dude I bet you now with freaking diamond armor and stuff if we went back into that dungeon oh we would wreck shop nobody would even stand a chance really pulled all of our stuff out of that darn dungeon now you want to go back but we arranged it so no we don't have to go back to it but we should find something new I have memories of that dungeon and you're just like let's go back I'm sorry that that has happened to you it was it was painful you know like in there hurtful sort of way mm-hmm I remember when we had a lot more variety of meats and we demonetised with all of them I guess which is kind of the bakken amount of the monetization occurred okay so do they with you of course excuse me what what do you mean I just what meaneth no nothing what do you mean no no what you mean I don't know all right well uh are you are you ready to take a break from your beautiful bridge Hey I'm almost done I just need a bucket but okay were you gonna water under the bridge yeah but it can wait but you know it's little thing making a little nice it's fine yeah yeah I could probably I could probably wait until a different time okay definitely one of these here for now just save water under the bridge water under the bridge as they say yes put the stairs there I mean yeah absolutely it's good story safekeeping no I agree all right have you got a sleeping bag on you no I mean it might be good if we're traveling and then maybe bring some diamonds because soon as you that defense up to level 16 you'll be able to put those to use let's Harry Potter under the stairs sleep it up nice absolutely dude alrighty let's head off on an adventure which direction do we want to go in I pick last time and the time before that let's go this way hopefully we'll find some new way stones or something like that oh yeah dude I saw one of those boys earlier it's like some subnautica boy what if I used it as a wave straighter or something like that is that what it's called are they mean are they good everything's mean in this pack unless otherwise found I have a lot of arrows now so I could go for the shoot I mean if you want to shoot then shoot there's also a I have a holder behind it yeah I know I see that okay yeah Hippogriff is chill though Oh three shots we need a monster trees or whatever so we can we can tame hippogriffs and then we can fly oh dude really yeah wait so what are they what is it called I think it's be streets something that East treats huh please wait that is a thing made from juicy meats you can tame some beasts with this wait oh wait it's just like any kind of meat bro we should totally just make this now cuz we can okay and then do we need a saddle though we have a couple saddles so I think bro I'm down let's make some beast treats then we can hopefully stumble upon like a couple hypocrites as we go and then we'll be able to fly that's gonna be next level dude okay here we go we are going to use cook the rabbit and then I know dr. rabbit doesn't work that creates an item warm treat name so I can feed a worm apparently it has no further description um cool and then the fish just makes you should I make aquatic treats I don't know if we're there yet I don't know take care some cooked pork chops in this furnace right here okay cool yeah I just need five and then then we'll be good or maybe whatever you're providing me here which is that's two - I just need food as well so it's like you know whatever you take for that you take three there's you more cook pork chop all right let's get some beef streets I just hope it's one treat will tame the beast and that'll be it no this is um this is a brute treat made from fatty meats brutes are quite simple minded could any be swayed so these are just gonna be food for you I really I wish I knew baked pinky meat Aspen meat okay so it's got it's gotta be cows apparently that's that's really all there is to it was not too far yep I'll go eat some cows into oblivion I've okay I've gotten fourteen raw beef so fingers crossed and that will be enough to make magic happen all right well I'm just gonna oh is that the Hippogriff that I hear yet it oh my god if it stays there if it stays there it better stay there oh here we go these treats we're ready we out here come here hey hey hey how long is your detect that I have be streets in my hand they're nice they're tasty you want don't fly away from me where's he going where's he going he's now he's back over here do you want ah I can't see it the stupid forest oh there you drop one down to me as well so there you go yeah here here hey come back why are you so high off the ground good land why are you so consumed with flight I have food right here you need not hunt you fool you fool I'm heating up it's bad just jump in the water yeah but then I can't chase him if I'm in the water taking a bath okay very again how do i multitask like that on top of it and my honey once oh my god this dude sucks he doesn't well what do you want to die it seriously he's too high-calorie for you what are you doing this way hey I can't chase him over here I'm writing we need to be up in the tower at his level for him to have any interest at all I built up well yeah but then you're stationary what could that gonna do not a whole lot cuz you ran in the wrong direction I ran in the wrong way you're chasing away that's how it works yeah it's definitely saighe antic flying beast is definitely scared of come hither you fool maybe it gets to be night time he'll one absolute fool I'm pretty sure he's maintaining like a constant height over whatever whatever terrain he just seems to pop a pop up a little bit what an idiot nevermind I guess we're not taming a friggin Hippogriff this will go sleep and then set off on another adventure geez what a dummy okay well I have lots of now that now that Hippogriff idiot has decided to not be cooperative we don't know adventure I guess after you stick to meet him to go and do its thing we're fine ah this direction as previously attempted and then distracted I wonder what's in here could be a woodland mansion in the dark oak fort whoa whoa whoa breath breath what I found out I own you know it turned purple is this the taint hold on defiled yeah you get out of here freaking spider weird spider Braille I wonder if it expands though like easy are you it's not you it's not a meanie but it's a yeah it's a mecha those are the maka foodist but wait there's a whole thing right here whoa what is that angry no no no it was like a area AoE some sort of thing oh it's probably mosquitoes like the taint have that just attack you wait what is this I break it and then put it back down it is a defiled stone oh god did I I broke it apparently that's the thing that like completes some sort of ritual and when you replace it back down it's no longer that thing anymore so hopefully there's another one of those multi blocks somewhere around here I wonder if this spreads though like is this oh oh there's a fire going on over there - oh that's good yeah that's fire that's all right that goes down deep iron wolf armor wait so does it oh oh apparently I'm burning up so let's let's definitely go underground what is this I'm on fire mother trucker dad it's a it's some sort of fire like situation so I've discovered a happy face type shard gee willikers dude don't come too close to that my god I'm burning up even though I'm underground God dang it bro help me ow ow ow ow oh okay so it's a plant did I step on all right what is other thing that was hurting you yeah this is called defiled lands is apparently the modpack so that's a thing interesting huh no freaking idiot no I just want it I just want to eat I don't want to put torches down right well I've managed to cool myself off by about one stage lava there's a bunch of lava out over there weird out where that fire is like oh yeah oh is it a volcano it's probably a volcano like the the one Oh Frick was yeah these these are the plants they hurt you oh okay also what is this do not like there's a farm over here this seems like a great place to have a farm you know it's a lot of filed stuff okay gonna just gonna just do this for a little bit I broke nothing of the farm don't you worry I calculated my placement absolutely profile spine oh dude that poor vile spine though that quill beast doesn't the friendly oh I'll take it down boys there's another one Oh what do you want that's what he wants I can do water fighting all day it really would be better for me actually because of the whole eat situations hell don't mind if I do okay I wonder what our there's any dungeons beneath those volcanoes or anything or if they're just purely on the service can i prep I don't know wait to quit the cool beast they run away they don't actually attack you now I feel badly I think they'll attack you no they don't they just run away now I feel badly all right they seem oh it's Annika something in their wake yeah they have a defense mechanism but it's purely defensive I'm stinky frog this might be this an aspen smells like we've seasoned ask you one of the meats that makes the beast Oh family Mike Oh balls don't like it their meat makes B streets oh is it okay so you're gonna go after it well it was on the move I know dude poor thing is trying to run away I feel bad it died in the vile spine Oh rip that's no bueno I don't know what these book forms do either structure over here ah oh no dude it's it's the tan it's the tax a hundred percent we're in trouble we're about to be overrun by the taint our house is in the direct line of fire I just I just witness did you witness the defile lands defiling yes okay oh oh where are you anyway I'm right your wall you're running towards me right now house you'll notice the defiled lands will defile this house block by block it's a bad situation and our house is in the line of fire well before it gets to our house we'll be able to figure I have to build the Great Wall of taint this really goes back to another series that happened at one point well we'll remember how or we'll figure out how and stop it oh there's a thing over here there might be where we're gonna have to build a great wall of paint that's like impenetrable to things oh this is one of those oh we need to break that spawner I'll pests out pus students that's like what the thing is doing on my chin we've got another one of these things over here I'm not gonna break it this time still dunno what it does but it could be of importance and I'm sure comments will let us know and then oh is yet another one and then there's a or structure over here with on top of the hot stuff there's a pink stuff what is the pink stuff Imbrium or oh it's the big it's the big slime dudes you can make okay I'm but hey uh you know oh we're not gonna want this we're not gonna want this I'll shoot it I've got it I got this I've definitely am never gonna miss this shot never gonna miss God is ace sort of tired about you know got a warm-up shot in there somewhere pick that stuff up now freakin running through that's stupid stuff yep yep also I'm quite toasty right now trying to get these can be thrown whoa what did you get that's you get those from the these guys oh sorry your feed mom mom wait what what was that mom so what's the item again it's these flowers you just throw them and they go kaboom yeah but you got to be careful pick them up because you can make a boom-boom oh really with me hook them up oh yeah that's what that's what happens I tried to pick it up and I don't know whether oh you d I see you D I when we get the seeds from them too so we can plant more oh so you can just right click and it'll take the thing off yeah yeah huh yeah that's pretty cool okay that'll do some kabooms that's sick bro we need to grow some of these I'm totally down with that that's just oh yeah that's what I'm talking about so no kaboom booms if you just right-click right how it appears I am quite fiery at this very moment so I will jump oh oh Spidey Oh what up dude Oh Oh Frick Oh Frick I tried but he survived two blasts I'm gonna need to uh cool off for just a moment here briam has been acquired as well as more of the half face tights half face tight a face tight dude your faces tights block of hefei State Oh tears of penance fires fireballs so there's that Oh Umbria mingotts are going to that and a remorseful gem which is so there's there's some stuff that goes along with this specific biome that is actually cool yeah I wonder can we plant those seeds outside maybe we should take some of that dirt you can't plant it on the regular grass well I mean you might have to till it oh I guess they're not on anything killed though are they yeah take a few there there oh we're gonna take some sprays that could pose an issue the defiled 38 we probably didn't yeah I mean we could place it down we'll see if like man placed defile dirt creates problems for us right because maybe it's like leaves leaves will decay if they're natural but if you place leaves you're good otherwise our Enderman spa nose would be in great trouble all right what else can we find round these parts other than their lies over here oh is that the house the computers house no what a nice house dude glass and everything very pretty where's the entrance though interesting question little girl it's fine a lot of hoes iron shovel dude in fact I will take that because I forgot to bring a shovel with me so I swapped out my stone pickaxe for an iron pickaxe you owe six iron ingots an iron axe an iron sword let's get this bread let's get this wheat and some bones and so if I probably don't have room to make all of these a lot of Ramos we need some backpacks that don't hurt our Oh did they put the valuable stuff down here no looking like oh yeah Oh some diamonds you went into the right chest first didn't you I forgot to bring a compass I'll take that there's a comb pass and bucket Oh bucket I guess I'll get rid of the few things guess they told me that the Aspen meet you said is good the acid meet just was one of the things that was useful for the B Street here take take the B Street did I just drop that you saw that way oh okay cool me yep yep yep and then 37 weeds yeah it's not bad it's not bad how many diamonds was that - oh I mean a it's better than nothing we still haven't you know we haven't gone strip mining or anything so it ain't bad oh there's another weed in here also a mana wheat is that bad messed up for you it's a little weird on my own do a drop off and go out again yeah and our inventory will fill up in another two seconds you know the drill yeah or we could find a way stone see we can find a way stone we're just straight to the north okay as you say whatever you just saying I'm looking at the map you're gonna want that it's a nice torch yeah it's a pretty cool place it just right there absolutely alright you do drop okay maybe a slightly different direction this time sure like it this way I don't think we have been all the way over here earlier get more apt dude yeah absolutely prepped oh yeah I have nineteen I should increase something what should I do maybe I should do the L skills that's what I'm in what I did so prospecting or wood cutting or oh I could do combat though as well melee damage increased done didn't oh it did work okay cool you gotta make sure you hit that dumb I did hit that done I don't know where you went off to because right here not far freak look for the falling tree I was very worried about you I didn't know what I was gonna do no man I find my way back home so much easier when I have a map showing me exactly where to go I can understand that honestly does make sense is this an Easter Island head like it huh if there's anything to it anything beneath hmm it don't appear to have anything more thing doesn't even get a view it's just completely concealed by the leaves it had a view for many many many many years yeah but it has no ability to chop the tree in front of it yeah big bummer dude big bummer it's like that neighbor that builds the fence and you can't do anything about it you're just like come on man it's gotta be rough dude if you live in like an apartment building skyscraper that has an impeccable view and then just new construction gets built and completely obscures it right across the street the bigger view and be a bummer I'd be bummed yeah what hurt your resale value like pretty dramatically as well yeah no that's the way they crumble cookies sometimes indeed I have found a thing Oh also that's a house of it dude this ravine is a big thing you're right no but this ravine has a big thing in it oh yeah dude that's actually not a village that's just a that's just a thing but a singular house but within that ravine I don't know if you took a look it's kind of gnarly it's another one of those aquatic dungeon things that we got beef that we experienced before except maybe this one will actually be viable on properly yeah you know put it down wait is this actually this doesn't lead to another dungeon does it no it don't it definitely don't hmm I wonder if we should check out that dungeon though what is the best way into this thing it's super interesting it's like an aquatic biome in a ravine hopefully we can get some experience out of this one that'd be nice if we can figure out where it entry or can we mine in I okay I didn't know if it was like mind proof or something I can hear chupacabras oops I can't see anything in there uh it seems like we're in the clear and at least this first room come on in water's great a verdant yeast is over here Geist yeast oh yeah we got a couple geese and Guice and careful okay careful you don't want it hey he just needed that yeast he just needed that yeast there you go oh that's right theez likes absorb light you can't ouchy fire there's a that's a is that a big boy bigger than normal take precautions it's a shadow helm that's not a chupacabra oh is it not I don't have it's a big boy yeah he's taking many arrows I mean I like I like the way this is this fight is going at the moment okay that was you many arrows okay spawner right here what's wrong he dropped blood leech scepters low damage rapid fire why drains health and what yes what what did you stab demonetized player somehow very interesting you know we've definitely not been here 100 there's a lot of stuff in here too like this is dude nice saddles for those these chests are actually all the same these manuscripts are apparently useful and we left some behind did we will we stew we do have some make a bestiary book and i don't know what the bestiary book does but okay people got mad that we left it behind so here we are we never make mistakes when picking them up now don't be never make mistakes never have we in a million years oh there is just another spawner sitting over here for those geese --tz-- we didn't realize that spawner just dropped a diamond nice you want a blood leech sceptre whoa sorry sorry sorry I was just there you see now worked and it started going after you I apologize for that oh there were pointed at me they stacked on each other that's very interesting always worried for you so other rooms that we could go into yeah there's still plenty of spots to go oh boy it looks very dark and it's cold a little bit of a dead end back here it looks like can't let those torches go to waste that's gonna say save the torches yes sir wait was there and there oh man other rooms through there it was just rooms everywhere there's a oh one of the one of those bad boys who shoots webs yeah why can't I break that web that's weird where's the he fell down oh we're starting skeletal wait what oh that was a touch of T's I think the stuff just hit the five-minute mark as I walked up to it it all despond in my face wow that sucks a lot of my face it really did it just despond in my face you'd hate to see it a lot of gold a lot of apples apples are good iron battle axe and more iron hmm our Christmas eggs are really that useful but do we have saddles for us if we were to find like horsies hi we have one in that back at home and I'm carrying one on me right now so I don't know what the best approach is nor do i you can ominous in here honestly yes we're unbelief IR noise there's got to be some kind of big boss somewhere in this dungeon I I have to believe ya this won't spawn better for sure for sure also this water is cool hey you know what sometimes water is cool I like cool water personally spider spider where where where right over here Oh in the tunnel I thought you meant it was like gonna knock us into the thing Oh what up dude get wrapped kit braaap oh do we just take creepers out actually like before they can even explode good stuff it's good stuff gotta love that increased melee damage to right here like that lava and water again oh it didn't do spawn this time but we just don't know oh maybe it's the contents of the chest where I can't see oh okay got it got it got it got it where's another one right over here they come from the dark how's your health it's it's fine dude I'm out here okay rockin it yeah yeah it's it's just another chest that's spawned bug ly I think that's what those things are bugga bugga bugga lee spawned ugly boo do I care about the oh diamond wolf armor okay and you said man you scripts are good yeah we want to get at least three of them okay I think we actually we've we've more than three manuscripts we got a couple spawners in here I don't know where you ran off I ran off in this direction is right here writes hither hey lost my water oh that's no one Oh interesting oh there's a lot of geese in here dude a lot of yeasts nice thanks nice another geese oh hi dude yeah you'll have to fire Oh buddy Oh Oh geese careful get back get back oh boy oh why the explosions I was throwing my things at oh you trying to blow them up yeah that's a did it work early I can't I can't pick up this water with a bucket okay I didn't work oh no no no no no no guys we have a problem we got we got a rat on the horizon Oh Frick Oh Frick help got it oh god those guys are so bad they're so bad the panic the sheer panic dude there's I don't know it all because it feels like there's nothing you can do about those boys um oh well you know do you want to uh you want to call it here and then we'll continue the
