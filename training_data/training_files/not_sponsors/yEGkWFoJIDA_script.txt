alright guys welcome back to the channel thanks for tuning in thanks for subscribing I hope everyone as well Tesla released their major update towards full self-driving which is the traffic light and stop sign control 2020 12.6 and we did a little bit of her first drive video I'll go ahead and link it below and at the end of this video but now we're gonna do it more of an official review after having some time to play with it test it out and see some scenarios we're gonna do more of a thorough review talk about the good talk about the not-so-good and I get some suggestions and how Tesla can improve major step towards city and local Road full self-driving / autopilot it's called traffic light and stop sign control now it's called traffic light and stop sign control but we're not really controlling traffic lights or stop signs per se and neither are they controlling the car I think it really should be called traffic light and stop sign awareness okay so this is what it says it's what it reads traffic light and stop sign control is designated to recognize and respond to traffic lights stop signs and slowing your car to a stop when using traffic aware cruise control or auto steer / autopilot this feature will slow the car for all detected traffic lights including green blinking yellow and off lights as your car approaches an intersection your car will indicate the intention to slow down via a notification slow down and stop at the red line shown on the driving visualization to continue to the stop line pull the autopilot stalk once or briefly press the accelerator pedal to confirm that this is safe to proceed as with all autopilot features you must continue to pay attention and be ready to take immediate action including braking because this feature may not stop for all traffic controls this feature will be conservative slow down often at first and will not attempt to turn through intersections over time as we learn from the fleet the feature will control more naturally okay and then it has a little bit of indicator or instruction on how to actually use it and now it also has a note that says when using this feature when this feature is enabled the maximum set speed while using Auto steer is limited to the speed limit of the road okay so that's sort of the notes on this particular release and then we're gonna talk about that a little bit we're gonna talk about the things that are good we're gonna talk about the things that are not so good again and how to improve so let's jump into it I'll start with the good things first okay so the first thing we want to do before we jump it to the good things is talk about how do you enable it you go to autopilot while the car is in park here's the new icon here give them another disclaimer and instructions on how to use it and you click yes this is says its beta to emphasize that it's in beta and again for this particular release as far as I know you need hardware 3 with full self-driving enabled to activate this feature or to actually use this feature if you don't have it in your release notes it's probably not released for your particular hardware configuration alright so the good things first and foremost the car can recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs that in itself is an amazing feat for any car manufacturer awesome for it to be able to do that happy to see it do that after a while not using this before just being able to see the lights and the full self-driving visualization preview to be able to actually see it in action there's an amazing sight to see so definitely great for Tesla for me being able to enable that feature and functionality it also speaks to their ability to override or overcome as I mentioned before in my older video about why your Tesla can't reach speed limit signs the ability to overcome that that egregious patent that basically says that cars with cameras can't read or adhere to stop signs or traffic signals based on the mobile iPad so being able to get around that patent and that issue that sort of loophole kudos to Tesla for doing that so that's awesome so as you saw in the first drive preview or maybe you'll see right now in this particular video it also sees the signs from further away so further away as it approaches an intersection where a stop sign is or a stop the traffic light it'll see that from further away than it used to before okay it also highlights and stops at the limit line so it's not really stopping at the light per se it also draws that limit line that red line that's indicated here to show you that that's where it's going to stop both for work from stop sign perspective as well as any other applicable traffic signs including traffic lights so that's always a good thing all right it slows down naturally when it's in the proximity of winds when it's supposed to work close to a stop sign close to a stop light it actually slows down very naturally not abruptly so good good point on that end and then it also displays the lights accurately with only slight latency we know that the instrument cluster has some latency where cars that pass in real life are not aligned with what's visualized on the screen on this particular release the lights are very very quick to respond to the real-life action of the lights changing so the latency is pretty low in that regard okay the visualization themselves the lights glow and they're more visible when you're on adaptive cruise control or on autopilot it's also a great thing because it's easier to see on the white background of the model 3ds and model wise it might not be that big of a deal but for the black background and these objects being gray in the visualization it's a lot easier to see when they're lit up so here's what the light looks like when you have it on here is what the light looks like when you turn it off see that light stops glowing put it in park turn it back on say yes put it back and drive and then that light again is glowing again so that's a good thing here all great things absolutely love it there's no other car company on the road right now that has this level of technology so absolutely not complaining but now let's talk about some things that are not so good that we can make a little bit better I'm not gonna call them bad things but just things that need improvement things that Tesla can improve on to make the experience more inspiring so number one if you have a navigation path on a local Road or a set of local roads that are continuously going through lights stoplights where there's dense areas of traffic lights the car needs confirmation at all lights so whether they're green and you're gonna proceed through them and they're not at risk of changing you still have to confirm so every single time you get to a light you have to confirm and I understand the hesitation there but over time I would love to see them take that down a little bit or for it to be timed and synched with the lights to be able to see when the lights are gonna change there are some cars that have that feature that can sort of determine when the light is going to change maybe take that into consideration and then proceed from there all right the next thing that is a bit of an issue is that it doesn't display the entirety of the intersection it shows the lights prior to this in the full self-driving preview it would show the lights in the adjacent lane right so the lights here that are red or green versus the lights that are red it would show that and now it just doesn't seem to show that and even more importantly just doesn't give you a good accurate sense of all the traffic around you specifically out of intersection so let's say you come to a four-way stop to be able to show the stop sign on the other side maybe it's visually obstructed but the car sees it that's gonna be beneficial same thing with a green light or maybe a sort of a turning green light want to be able to see that to make sure that it's not safe to go and we understand all the traffic conditions that may be impaired by the visualize so maybe I can't see that this light is green but maybe the car can so that would be another beneficial feature for the car especially as we approach full start driving to know that the car sees these additional lights and the entirety of the intersection not just the lights that are in front of me okay the other not-so-great thing and thing that we can improve on is a speed limit obviously you definitely want to go the speed limit but Tesla always allows you especially with adaptive cruise control and autopilot to set an offset at your discretion whether it's five miles an hour over or ten miles an hour right now with this feature you're not allowed to go above the speed limit so it goes the exact speed limit so if anyone behind you is going you know five two miles over or five miles over they're gonna be right behind you and they're gonna be pretty upset that you're driving so slow so especially on local roads when you're going speeds like 25 miles an hour 35 miles an hour can become problematic so even when you're going a little faster roads where it's 40 miles an hour or more it's gonna be a little bit problematic because you gonna be going so slow relative to the rest of the traffic so what she would at least allow you to carry it with a speed limit or even just make it what it used to be in terms of driving on local roads which is when it hits a certain speed zone it limits you to five miles an hour over I think that's acceptable all right so the next thing I want to talk about is a really really big issue seems to be a bug and this is just basically saying that hey when you use the stock to confirm you can actually do that and the car will actually run a red light so if you're at a red light and you press confirm right it intends to proceed through the red light now in contrast yes you could run a red light if you'd like and if you're saying if you're pulling the stock to confirm your one in the car to go forward but it should not break the rules of running a red light now watch this now if I am able to confirm they will actually try to run this red light which it shouldn't do so I'm gonna wait to these cars pass press confirm and watch this confirm now and now it's proceeding through the red light shouldn't do that again if I press the stock it's gonna proceed through that red light not a good thing to do prior to this if you had your car and autopilot or adaptive cruise control and it was stopped to the point where it came to a hold you could press resume and it would resume the action of cruise or autopilot but as long as the car was stopped in front of it it wouldn't proceed forward same concept should apply here with the red light if I'm at a red light I pull the stock it shouldn't proceed to the red light issued way to the light turns green and now go and this is just saying that hey if I've pressed if I've come to a stop at a red light and I want to press to confirm that means I'm aware of what's gonna happen the light changes I'm at the car to just go okay if this is not in play what needs to happen is you can absolutely not touch the pedal or the stalk until the light turns green so did it expressly needs your consent and that's a great safety feature but if someone accidentally bumps the pedal but their foot or someone bumps the stalk it runs the red light and they're in big trouble so that's a bit of a safety a safety issue that hopefully Tesla can fix with a future update all right so the in addition to that there's also lots of false positives things that it thinks are stop signs that it prompts you to and starts to slow down this is great that a scanning the environment so that's a good thing but some of the false positives are a little bit odd people with red shirts on and in black pants with white lettering on their red shirts can be considered stop signs signage for stores that are red and white will also be stop signs so these are some things that you know probably can be updated with an update and as more owners get this update the more data it collects and can get better and be refined so I'm not too worried about it but there are some false positives all right next up we want to talk about the fact that it does not adhere to common traffic lights if you will so for instance there may be a scenario like this where you have a double yellow light where two blinking yellow lights are there it really does not respond to that all right so here we come up on a blinking double yellow light and somehow it just doesn't behave the way it should it's gonna give me the prompt it's going in and out it's giving the prompt I'm gonna proceed right I can confirm proceed again it doesn't work doesn't work doesn't work and I have to keep going so it doesn't really work on those double yellow lights and clicking the stalk it's not responding it doesn't really know what to do in those scenarios so I'll engage again going past the same double yellow light it sees it as giving me the warning it keeps going up and down doesn't really know what to do join the limit lines that says I have to override it it turns grey and then it just sort of fails and breaks down here so again double yellow lights blinking lights these are areas where they could improve on so situations like that which are a little bit more common in certain areas than others are things that we think it should be able to handle a yellow light a blinking yellow light is still a blinking yellow light you should be able to slow down and stop for it but if I proceed through the car should know how to act accordingly a single blinking light no problem double blinking light seems to be a problem so there are some traffic signs and traffic lights that this is not quite equipped to handle all right next thing is that it waits too long to slow down when approaching a stoplight or stop sign when the speed limit is greater than 35 miles an hour giving me the indication that I'm gonna slow down it's going pretty fast so I would hope it would slow down a little bit sooner but did a decent job slowing down at the last minute what is the best and ideal use case for this this is gonna be great for rows that don't have a lot of lights that are interspersed with a long navigate on autopilot journey where you're driving from a highway to a interstate or interchange that may have a couple lights here and there 45 miles an hour at 55 miles an hour that's where it's really great because typically you would have to take it off autopilot to engage these lights so this is really great for that not so great for densely populated areas with lots of lights and lots of stop signs because you have to confirm so much you might as well drive you must just drive yourself add to that the fact that you can't even make turns just yet turning at the light it's not a factor so you still have to turn if you need to make a right or left turn okay so that's it those are the major observations from the good and they're not so good in areas that need improvement let me know your thoughts in the comments let me know if you spotted anything different anything unusual that I didn't cover in this particular video and until then let's talk in the comments let's see if we can bubble this up to Tesla and raise some awareness so that they can make adjustments really quickly they're really good at doing that and until the next time enjoy your day enjoy your Tesla
