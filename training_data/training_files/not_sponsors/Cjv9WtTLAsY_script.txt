characters this one happens to be another one oh boy there's a crazy buddy cop action film out in theaters right now hubs and Shaw and what I hear is that it's part of this Fast and Furious franchise well you know what that means time for a tie-in episode where I look at where these movies began with a 2001 film The Fast and the Furious [Music] what country reminds me the time of bitten by a rattlesnake mmm so we're doing this gag again huh I heard they might ban women drivers so I have to bill to drive with me but you said you hadn't driven much but he has he's driven what oh my god that's not the fast in the Furious movie I thought it was gonna be [Music] fantastic that was a waste of my time well we got to do something to tie into Hobbs and Shaw so we may as well go to the original Hobbs and Shaw for our over-the-top buddy cop action oh no not free be in the beam the other original Hickey and Boggs no the other original Hobson Shaw there we go the 1989 classic tango and cash I say it's a classic because it's one of the rare posters that has the actor's name above the right actor this is the timeless tale of detective Gabriel cash and detective Egon Spengler one where's our money suits and plays the stock market and the other is really dirty they don't get along too much but then after being framed for murder they got to work together to electrocute the hell out of people the behind the scenes production on tango and cash was almost as action-packed as the movie itself the movie was hounded with problems from the very beginning originally cash was to be played by Patrick Swayze and yeah I can see that after dropping out to do Roadhouse he was replaced by Kurt Russell while the film is credited to director Andrei Konchalovsky Konchalovsky feuded with producer John Peters all throughout the film over the movies tone resulting in the directors firing and at moments the film was directed by Albert Magnolia and executive producer Peter McDonald the film's DPD barry sonnenfeld was also fired during production and due to a lawsuit with producers Peter Gruber and John Peters against Warner Brothers over the producers replacements the film's release date had to be sped up by many months for a Christmas 1989 release despite the movie being filmed only a handful of months prior in the summer of 1989 so downside sounds like it was a nightmare shoot but upside we can't tango and cash baby okay let's do it and it's a musical as the movie opens in license to kill we meet Raymond tango he's the Felix Ungar this universe chasing down a drug truck and dude where are you going that other truck is hauling unlicensed clear Cola he knows this truck is no good it's driven by Robert sadar and the only way to take it down standoff with a semi-truck [ __ ] man this guy's crazy he's shooting at us for trying to run him down Maniac Cop should have already proved that Robert really shouldn't be driving a big truck tango didn't even need to pull out a gun his force field would have stopped that truck anyway as lieutenant Jeffrey Lewis takes a break from his harry reems audition he's here to congratulate tango or whatever his name is oh what's your weapon I want your ass who the [ __ ] you think you are he thinks he's Rambo um is this movie screwing with me what are they gonna call cash Jack Burton only one way to prove this is a drug truck put a bullet in it great now it's all over the highway and useless fortunately the villain of the movie Eve is Perret happens to be driving by banknotes I'm going down fashion I know this wait James Hong is cash also Jack Burton I'm confused tango and cash had the honour being the only two cops in town I guess so much for them ever going undercover that's what you get for publishing your address after cash poses for the poster he's got to save himself some cans look if that wasn't gonna get hit by a truck it was gonna get hit by the bus from speed I miss 80s cop never mind your damn car I got a bad guy to catch Plus 80s cop come with a random shot of nudity out of nowhere there we go just slam another car into the truck Hugh Munster my baby was in there timely anyway that's cash he's the Oscar Madison of the group and together they make up Turner and hooch back at the precinct they're gearing up for the sequel stop or my sister will shoot featuring Teri Hatcher well what's up to with how long it takes to build a house not take a vacation a dance tour is not a vacation so it's a dance movie now why is this in the Flashdance universe then she's off to do studs for the latest marty cam usek video anyway I figured I'd wait until I got to the station to take this off that way I can show I'm a badass show off my chest this seems like a safe place hey he's been [ __ ] with my gun sighs shifted on I don't know but maybe stop pointing that thing around everywhere off to the bathroom slash interrogation room slash locker room all right they should just chuck things out that would make for a more entertaining movie meanwhile tango is really just in this for the style and the action I don't understand you you make a shitload of money you dress like a banker what are you doing this for actually you're like a Cobra tango your methods are over-the-top rocky for at the villains lair there's too much overacting in one scene Jack Palance Brian James John EEMA crazy eyed henchman Jack is stressed his son RAL juhliey from the rookie is having a similar problem with Sheen and Eastwood I didn't know I would have to say this but then it gets weird two little mice that's so much damage sir was this really necessary and where did you get those oh well that was God so no one's gonna mention the mice thing huh and then it keeps going tango and cash will be safety they have moms you could have just said all of that but I'm so glad you didn't sir that was a long way to go to tell us that your building has a rodent problem so that's their plan to frame tango and cash so they can continue to sell their drugs and weapons I mean they could just kill them but why risk another semi-truck at this staged bust they meet with her contact the musical score by Hans faltermeyer he did axel F and I just realized we haven't seen tango & cash face-to-face yet well Jack's problem kind of took care of itself they find a dead federal officer who is wired clearly tango and cash did it there can be no other explanation you're going down for this no other suspects in mind get them on the bus to prison immediately captain mr. blue isn't gonna help you out of this mess doctored audio planted weapons open-and-shut case say this there's no reason for me to believe that it isn't genuine to be ver Michael Jeter is just their accountant he has no expertise in the audio at least they're keeping it together when this is over we have to pay Jabba the Hutt here a visit I'll bring the chainsaw nothing although they may be serial killers they may not have killed the agent but they definitely need to spend some time in jail don't worry once this guy starts sweating Arnold will be there to shoot him in the head no you know what it means if we go to jail he'll definitely have to do a butt shot they're offered a deal to do 18 months time 18 months for killing a federal agent um you should probably take that deal that's not that bad actually pretty good deal considering their lawyer mr. Littman is a publisher not an attorney tengo gives a very respectable speech excellent now they can do just a little bit of time and then get their revenge what say you cash this whole thing [ __ ] sucks oh he's just repeating what he overheard from the director arguing with the producer something about a giant spider at the end good work gentlemen with no more cops in the city we could do what we want forgive me for asking mr. Perret but what happens in 18 months when they get out maybe we can cut a deal their plan is to kill them in prison sure much easier to frame them wait for the trial wait for the verdict then kill them in prison then it would be to just kill them outside of prison unfortunately they've accidentally been sent to a maximum-security prison what do you mean they're not there they were on that bus listen I'm already trying to trace them they were I don't understand this universe why would anyone fix this error we got to come up with an escape plan to get out of this lockup but not after the bus shot welcome to prison boys take of her Spanish is open for business for God's sake just get to the love scene already I'm pretty sure he almost blows him at one point cuckoo but this is a sitcom prison well you know they don't put cops in general population what's with the fire why is it raining trash who's in charge of this prison also awkward he was in Beastmaster too you're getting your barbarian movies wrong tango and biggest twist of course Clint Howard is in this prison played Howard is in about 50% of my episodes and only about one percent of the time do I know he's in it before I watch it tango had an issue with a slinky once but he straightened it naturally the prisoners could just roam free and throw tango and cash through the laundry chute don't worry guys this is just a hazing once you get through the ceremony you'll be part of the prison fraternity even the Dean is here just think of me as somebody who doesn't like you very much no a film critic how did you all get in here do you run this prison are you the governor but this is an 80s action movie which means it's a patriotic action movie I think that's what's on Patriot grandpas tombstone just a few fight scenes to get out of the way and then they can easily escape well there is that I forgot this movies fetish with electricity [Applause] finally the guards showed up for the night shift there is no daytime shift let's easily get the hell out of here this creepy wants us dead so bad why does he just put a bullet in our head and call it a day honey what the hell's it got to play this game for no one knows his demonstration with the mice didn't help at all it just made things more confusing but the assistant warden who is friends with cash tells them that they need to escape or you could just make a call and let someone know that they're at the wrong prison tango has reservations about escaping though because it could be a setup plus he's made a new friend this is my fiancee sneaky sneaky that's it did tango make quite Howard is Beach [Laughter] I don't know how more people don't escape nothing to see here seems legit tango is nowhere around to say that if you get through the tunnel without being killed you'll see de white tango was right though it does turn out to be a setup by the crooked guards and inmates that's funny this doesn't look like the kind of place that would have crooked guards what kind of maze is this tango you son of a [ __ ] let's get out of here before Jack Palance makes another demonstration somehow this is all gonna lead to underground and escaping through the mud I just have a feeling no but that be more realistic this prison is like the underwater level of the Ninja Turtles NES game dear Christ how is this prison not burned to the ground on its own yet as long as here only touching one wire and you're not touching the ground you don't get electrocuted Frank well let's give this a shot but not before tango finishes his date with a soul taker at this plate I'm surprised that that killed him for good in this universe I'd expect something like shocker to happen unfortunately with their ankles shattered they didn't make it very far jack hears about the escape and wonders did we buy too many TVs one would have been just fine and maybe we should have just killed them instead of doing this stupid complex plan that's not a problem that is mice can't solve seriously I think this may be the only reason that Jack took this role oh we're at Q branch now if Q ran a Chucky Cheese what is going on here is this a Jim are they making a dog Bob and of course Michael J Pollard is in charge of it all no I'm just here for guns nuts tick look they haven't gotten the pooch insky prototype perfect yeah but when they do it'll be gold now to hot down the crooked FBI agents who set them up this agent was paid to frame tango in cash it would have saved a lot of time if you interrogated this guy before the trial or you could have just put a car Bob on tango or Cash's cars and as for that corrupted audio recording turns out it was made on a 1989 iPhone that plays inappropriate music lucky for me this place is soundproof nice what am i watching Sesame Street now okay Woody Allen you'll be getting no slapstick comedy out of threading this machine when I'm done with you oh right tangos sister anyway on the set of one night in heaven let's set up the meet cute with Catherine and cash this is a movie bound and determined to not just be an eighties movie but the last 80s movie more on that later so cash has the hots for tangos sister Wow Hobson Shaw really are fans of tango and cash I know when I see a stripper I also demand she play her own instruments by the way they're real and they're spectacular gob zips around to the place so there's only one way out cavity whoo-hoo to the boys in prison see this only it was Patrick Swayze we could have gotten that to Wong foo prequel that the world demanded if you're wondering where tango is he had the same idea only to catch Rutger Hauer instead now they can get right to that sexual chemistry well sliding off a high tension wire to a pine tree in 40 miles an hour tends to slip a disc returned this is tango and cash your fine uh-oh I smell a misunderstanding oh my god why are you freezing it like that why are you moaning are you having an orgasm good thing you captain Oh is about to murder my prison buddy captain that's why you screen all your guests mmm no better than all these squabbling yeah you're two weeks late if you had checked your mail well in tangos defense he has been in prison I mean he raises a good point so they got the tape that clears their name and the address for Brian James at 10:10 villain Lane hmm definitely a tease bad guy hideout overly sunny in the room bad guy hiding around the corner expecting you shame shame don't you know ponytails are out this season never talked like that again yeah I saw something like this the commando afterwards will let him go wink you're being too obvious tango James was given a bigger role in the film when Stallone really liked his performance maybe because he proved he can survive electricity they play a game of good cop crazy cop where tango wants to kill him though you're doing it all wrong cash has to be the crazy cop he's the one who looks the most like Martin Riggs but back it why the hell is there a cue branch they are now armed with a redneck Batmobile this is the same guy that invented you're exploding bazooka boots oh right I forgot about the exploding bazooka boots you're just now telling tango about this I think the criminals in this film do the least amount of damage okay no distractions we're gonna kill some bad guys if you don't make it back and I do I am gonna date your sister and we're gonna bang on your grave did Bruno Motta take over directing this part of the movie quick bust inside drugged land was this movie also made from an unused script to a Megaforce sequel Jesus this place was just waiting for a battle and Jack should have seen this coming this is literally the climax from angels revenge they'll be fine the most unrealistic thing about this movie is that the word subtle exists in it and of course the bad guys had a monster truck just laying around why not the only thing this is missing is a grizzly bear it looks like if the finale of grizzly 2 actually was finished and edited together only with more comparing penis sizes baby guys guys you both hang dong here's the problem they made everything explosive there was really no reason to arm all the drugs with c4 and there's a legal arm stealing - for Jack Palance is Lord of all crime oh and they kidnapped tangos sister their only other choice was to kidnap his optometrist glasses or no glasses they're gonna kill some bad guys Hong Place Hong Time ass oh well this is pretty much all you need to know about the last act massive property destruction I don't think that's footage of outdoors I think the inside of the TVs are simply just on fire on second thought maybe we should have killed this guy on the roof kind of silly not to as much as I love Jack Palance Brian James's extended role really does make him the lead villain here looks like someone found themselves another number one guy he fills all of the lead villain functions including a big fight scene before his amazing death by crotch bomb as for Jack well he was killed by a different movie the bride's crotch bomb was from Batman Returns of course then again in this movie Jack is also Scaramanga well that was easy enough gonna just stuck with a Batman clip it's just one more for the road I love a great love story can't you both see that you're made for each other [Music] gotta love any movie that literally ends with them saying to hell with what critics think boom tango and cash yeah I'll tell you what I think I don't much like this dumb movie which is what I would have said in 1989 but nowadays it's cool to like tango and cash so I love it this is pretty much the buddy cop movie you get from the director of Nutcracker 3d and the writer of a hell night nowhere to run plus with some script doctoring from Jeffrey Boehm of lethal weapons 2 & 3 dango in cash wasn't exactly a hit with critics not that that ever would have mattered anyway but it was a mild success making back a little bit over its budget though in recent years it has gained some love or it's unapologetically over-the-top action and dialogue making it perfect to be the last 80s movie seriously this was the last major studio release in 1989 and what better way to go out than with a movie completely going for broke and showing everything that audiences love about explosions big testosterone filled balls buddy-cop banter ridiculous set pieces and the COPE feel glory of iron pumping 80s action I mean if you're into that sort of thing personally I like the fact that the French Connection does not contain an exploding dog bomb head or do I any chance of a three-way [Music] [Laughter] you
