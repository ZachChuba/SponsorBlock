courses plus more on that later hi I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's video the Seven Years War part two in our last video you saw how colonial skirmishes and diplomatic twists started the 18th century's very own world war in this video we'll be discussing one more diplomatic reversal that managed to completely change the course of history before we get to that let's start off today's video with a completely unnecessary excuse for me to play with the reverb settings on my microphone it's 1758 and in one corner we have France Russia and Austria who have been stopping the competition in Central Europe and in the other we have the Anglo Russian alliance in serious need of a cutland but considering the fact that today the United States official language is English and not French you may have guessed that things turned around for the British and Prussians you'd be right but it didn't happen immediately Frederick had just suffered the greatest military disaster of his career after a string of defeats at ke and Maxim on the fields of Kerner's Dorf a name that would haunt Frederick's memory forever Prussian forces attempted an ambitious double in development hoping to overwhelm the Austrian and Russian armies massed near the Oder River but Frederick had used this tactic a variation of the oblique order before and his enemies were ready for it the Russians had heavily weighed their forces in the center and were able to dispatch reinforcements with ease wherever the Prussians attacked the battle marks the only time forces under Frederick himself broke order and retreated in total disarray Frederick's allies meanwhile enjoyed a reversal of fortune after successfully defeating the French in Madras India British forces won a series of victories all over the globe in a turn of events that should be thoroughly unsurprising to anyone who's ever read up on British history they began to utterly dominate the war at sea the Royal Navy was victorious at Guadeloupe Lagos and kiba on bay decisively extinguishing any threat of French invasion on the British mainland the ground forces in North America complemented these maritime triumphs after capturing the newly christened Fort Pitt the previous year British regular and colonial forces spent that spring securing their hold of the western frontier with victories at Fort Niagara and Fort carrion which gave them control of the Hudson Valley with that front secured it was time to move north all summer British forces under General James Wolfe lay siege to Quebec leading to the Battle of the plains of Abraham on September 13th yet another British success however Wolfe would not live to see his officers march through the streets as both he and the French commander Louise Joseph de Montcalm were killed in the fighting as 1759 drew to a close British supremacy abroad had been confirmed and they were well on their way to supplanting France as the premier global power the following year 1760 proved equally auspicious for the British on the battlefield but also saw the death of their King George ii died on October 25th possibly on the toilet that fact is not particularly important but the writer threatened to quit if we cut that from the script anyways he was succeeded by his grandson George the third who would oversee further victories around the globe in India where the British had actually been fighting the French and Indians Britain scored a decisive victory at the Battle of Wandy wash in January despite being outnumbered by 2,000 they then launched a renewed offensive and by September the French army and their remaining allies were trapped in their colonial capital at Pondicherry during the grueling three-month siege that followed civilians died in droves by early next year the French garrison surrendered and the British were victorious in India in North America the Redcoats and their colonial allies seized on the momentum that they had gained through the capture of Quebec to win several more easy victories that summer throughout the course of the war French support among Native American tribes operating in Ohio and Canada had steadily eroded the Shawnee and Lenape had made a separate peace with Britain in 1758 while many of these so-called Mission Indians those who had converted to Catholicism continued to fight up through 1760 at which point they too abandoned the war effort though some sporadic fighting did continue that year essentially meant the end of French Canada and the last major conflict in the theatre unsurprisingly Native Americans both who had aided the French and British allies ultimately got the short end of the stick but more on that later so how were things going for Frederick in Central Europe this year I think solidly mediocre would be a reasonable way to describe this situation the Swedes took control of a significant swathe of Pomerania in January while the French took Marburg and the Austrians captured the Silesian city of glutes that last defeat was especially damaging to Frederick's pride because the Austrian commander Aaron Stephane Loudon had once sought employment in his army but was rebuffed Frederick quickly struck back at him though defeating the Austrian forces at Leibnitz in August the following month brought an utterly humiliating defeat when Russian and Austrian troops captured and held Berlin from October 9th to the 12th despite the rather short occupation it was still a terrible blow to Prussia morale in keeping with the trend of Frederick winning battles while losing the war he ended the year with a success at the bat of torgul one that came at a heavy price a third of his troops as New Year's Day 1761 came and went the Seven Years War had seemingly contracted and appeared to be making a decisive end India and North America were no longer the sights of large-scale warfare and the British Empire had established supremacy in both theaters in Central Europe however the walls were closing in on Frederick Prussians and Hanoverians looked West to try to stymie the French but in doing so left kohlberg open to a Russian assault in December Elizabeth's forces took the city Russia's final port on the Baltic Sea creating a two-fold problem for the besieged Frederick Russia's greatest weakness it's chronic supply problems had just been resolved and Prussia's access to British naval assistance was curtailed not that the Brits were feeling especially helpful in fact the newly crowned George the 3rd was significantly less committed to supporting the Prussian cause than his predecessor had been George the 3rd immediately suspended financial aid to the beleaguered German state likely as the first step towards suing for peace after all the British had won in the corners of the world where they had fought so why should it be their problem if their Ally couldn't pull its own weight by now things were looking grim er than ever for the Prussians exact numbers are hard to find but by the year's end the maximum number of troops he had at his disposal was probably around sixty thousand who were up against hundreds of thousands of the combined French Austrian Russian and Swedish armies the hour was late and the enemies were at the door it was a foregone conclusion that Berlin would soon be under siege his only hope it seemed to him was the Ottomans it was a bit of a long shot to say the least but Frederick had been making diplomatic overtures to the Sultan for years and he thought that maybe just maybe they would start to bear fruit they ultimately didn't join but more than enough happened early in the year for things to remain interesting 1762 saw two new powers entering the war a full eight years after the conflict broke out in North America Spain's new king charles the third hope to capitalise on the weakness of Portugal still recovering from the disastrous 1755 Lisbon earthquake since Britain was most likely to challenge them in that regard and had important economic and diplomatic ties to Portugal he was quite receptive to French support to join the war the French in return hoped that the British would either have to divert troops to defend their allies or lose source of material and financial support perhaps alleviating some of the pressure from their most powerful adversary on January 4th war between Britain and Spain had begun the conflict was marked by three failed invasions of Portugal by Spanish and French troops throughout the year each one repulsed by the Lusitania pnes and their British allies a number of troops were mobilised in Brazil as well and the neighbouring Spanish colonies in South America but actual battlefield casualties were very rare and deaths were almost exclusively a result of disease as if this turn wasn't stunning enough Empress Elisabeth of Russia died exactly a day after the war in the peninsula broke out leaving Russia's commitment to the war effort in doubt as it turned out Elizabeth's successor Peter the 3rd was something of a frederick fanboy and almost immediately sued for peace despite Russia's highly advantageous position frederick anxious to end hostilities promptly offered East Prussia to the Russians but much to the entirety of Europe surprise Peter refused all he wanted was to be given the order of the black eagle a chivalric honor awarded by the Prussian government presumably with a bewildered shrug frederick agreed and Peter placed most of the Russian troops under Frederick's command who joined the Prussians in the field by June 1762 Sweden which had only really entered the war opportunistically simply said nope and backed out of the war meanwhile Frederick took this opportunity to reinvent Alesia but the new Rousseau Prussian alliance did not last long as Peter was deposed and killed in a coup organized by his own wife and Frederick's distant cousin Catherine the second in July having successfully Game of Thrones her husband the newly widowed Empress withdrew her armies from Central Europe probably because the plot twists were becoming too unbelievable before they left however they did help contribute to one more Prussian victory at Berger's Dorf where frederick allegedly bribed the russian commander to stay put for a little while the Austrians under font down assumed the Prussians had more fresh troops available and handing them a victory France's crushing defeats in India North America and Portugal as well as Austria's in Silesia had fatally drained both country's Treasuries seeing Austrian prospects for the reconquest of Silesia disappear and suffering under a brutal British blockade Louis soon sued for peace the Austrians were not far behind the official peace treaties would not be signed until the next year but for all intents and purposes the Seven Years War was over [Music] the first of two documents that ended the war was the Treaty of Paris no not that one nope nope nope yep that's the one signatories of this treaty included Great Britain France and Spain with Portugal being expressly included under the terms of the treaty certain possessions that had been captured during the war like the many sugar rich Caribbean islands and part of the African colony of Senegal were returned to their original owners nonetheless in terms of territory Britain was the biggest winner France renounced all claims in India made since 1749 they also gave Britain all territory in North America east of the Mississippi except Norland that was given to Spain as compensation for Florida which had in turn also been ceded to Great Britain speaking of North America as we already mentioned the Native Americans living in eastern Canada and the Ohio Valley now had to deal almost exclusively with the British some like the Micmacs and certain members of the Iroquois Confederacy felt compelled to ally with them with many eventually fighting on the British side during the American Revolution before eventually aligning with the British many Native American tribes made war with their new Imperial overlords reigning in Ohio in Pontiacs rebellion which started in 1763 hoping to stern the violence towards the third issue the royal proclamation of 1763 later that year thereby forbidding the settlement of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains the colonists who had just fought a war in part to take said land from the French promptly ignored it in Central Europe Prussia Austria and Saxony signed the Treaty of Hubert osburgh five days after the Treaty of Paris bringing an official end to the asylum theatres of war the terms of peace returned clots to Prussia and reconfirmed its control over Silesia in return for the prussian evacuation of saxony the war in this theater had proven that frederick was an exceptional battlefield commander and prussia was a force to be reckoned with but it also demonstrated it would need strong allies in any future conflict Austria and Russia meanwhile had proven themselves competent military powers that could keep up with Western Europe's finest a truly global conflict arguably the first of its kind the Seven Years War had a profound impact on the world Britain's supremacy in both North America and India was solidified while France began a precipitous decline we didn't talk much about the conflict in West Africa since it was mostly confined to small British expeditions against wealthy French colonies but it does emphasize how far-reaching the war was battles fought on four continents placed an enormous logistical and financial strain on all of the powers involved the economic woes that ensued are widely seen as a major cause for both the American and French Revolutions the year 1763 may have been the end of the Seven Years War but its outcome would reverberate down these centuries and shape the world as we live in today if clicking the link in the description below you
