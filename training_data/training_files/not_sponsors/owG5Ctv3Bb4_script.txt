hey everyone you with Tesla Tom thanks so much for joining us on Ludacris feed well today I want to run through a video with you today I took between the North Shore of Sydney and the inner west of Sydney crossing two bridges at the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Anzac bridge in our Tesla Model 3 mostly on navigate on autopilot it did pretty well and I want to show you what happened exactly today okay so the car is currently on Willoughby Road on Sydney's North Shore this is the last traffic light before it hits the freeway as you can see a whole bunch of cones there and showing up on the screen as well and part of the road work this is hardware 3.0 in our Tesla Model 3 performance stealth running version twenty twenty point twelve point five it's on average lane change mode for autopilot and looking forward to the next update when we see more visualizations like traffic lights and stop signs so this is what'll be rode in narrow and burn and we're about to enter the on ramp for the freeway as you'll see very shortly so that noise is autopilot being engaged by myself two shakes down with the right stalk and I'm pressing the speed limit on the screen and that means the car will try to match it and you'll see that the car is going to suggest the lane change so I'm indicating to the right and waggle the steering wheel a bit and then the car will do the lane change for me I'm also using 60 frames per second on our DJI Osmo action camera mounted to the roof of the car and running Rocksteady which is the inbuilt digital stabilization so for those who've ever traveled on this road which is called the moringa freeway or the Bradfield highway which is basically the Sydney Harbour Bridge approach from the northbound it's a tricky road because there's about ten lanes across and you've got to pick the right lane basically so it's always a good test I find for autopilot so that took the right-hand side of that fork pretty well just the correct way to do it and the way I would have driven to as a local now this bit was very interesting because you could emerge pretty quickly to the left to get onto the right part otherwise were nothing to Sydney Harbour tunnel so I was very impressed with the car and you what to do so the first bit you'll see the car wanted to to merge which I have was happy to do so I figure in the co2 stalk down that's not too bad but this bit is what it has to merge very quickly onto the other side of the road and this is when the car did it by itself I had my hands on the wheel dready to take over but it'll see very shortly this is what happens see that see that the car indicated by itself and merged left all by itself and I had my hand on the indicator ready to go but I didn't need to use it so that I was impressed with that because like I said if I hadn't not if the Kai had not merged at the left it would have gone into the tunnel so yeah that's like a little hint of autonomy right there which was very good okay so there I am matching the speed again at 70 kilometers an hour see that Lane on the right that actually goes into the harbour tunnel had the car not merged by itself it would have gone into the tunnel where is this surface road here it goes into the Sydney Harbour Bridge so we're just passing North Sydney on our right there and you'll see very shortly that we'll see the Sydney Harbour Bridge with the North pylon and the map and see there on the screen that we're about to cross water and that's what we're about to hit the bridge proper okay so the car is going at 70 clubs in the hour very nicely and the car is suggesting I switch lanes so I did that right sorry left stop down and then wiggle the wheel a bit and the car will take care of the rest those lanes in the left to the bus lane and also the kiled expressway which I normally do my tests but today I thought I'd do this test on these middle lanes of the Harbour Bridge it's a bit of a tricky one because these lanes switch directions depending on the time of day so yeah so obviously it's safer to be on the left-hand side of the road because these two left lanes generally don't change but that lanes for I think I believe 3 & 4 do change depending on the time of day so this is currently about 2:30 in the afternoon so there's more traffic coming back northbound for workers in the morning it's more lanes going southbound okay so we're about to reach the southern pylon of the Sydney Harbour Bridge this is when things get a little bit tricky you've never driven this road before you'll see what I mean very shortly because there are about 3 or 4 different options you can take once you get off the Sydney Harbour Bridge because you can actually go into the city proper or you can join the Western distributor and this whole time the car is on navigate on autopilot that's single blue line there as you can see okay so it's decision time if you're a human driver you would be going what do I do now if you've never driven before on this road you get maybe one chance because these are the signboards so you've pretty much got to make a decision right now being a local I know which ones to take so I I was watching very carefully but I wanted to see whether the car I decided could decide what to do and it certainly did it picked the correct lanes to hop onto the Westerners Tribune er as you'll see on the map there it joins the anzac bridge eventually but it's not all smooth sailing yet because this part of the road is over the top of Darling Harbour and cockle bay wharf below us but there are still more decisions to make before you hit the anzac bridge as you'll see very shortly so the left lane goes to the anzac bridge the right two lanes head towards darling harbor and the inner city so the cars doing so so far so good matching 70 clubs in our excuse sir that tilt there that's the rock steady digital stabilization of the camera trying to keep keep the dominant motion I mean without this it would be causing a lot more vibration so I'm happy to take the trade off with the tilt rather than it's shaking okay so you have to stick in the left lane normally and again if you're a human driver that's the only signboard you get as you saw before to make a decision whether to go right or left and again there's another decision coming up another fork whether the stay left or to take the right two lanes for Darling Harbour because we're going on the anzac bridge I want to stay in the left two lanes but then there are there are cars joining from the left as well as you can see the car took the right way as well going left and again I was bit worried there but I had my hands on the wheel and the car made the right decision albeit I must say it was a little bit dicey like it was probably too close for comfort I would have probably hugged the left side of the road more so than the car did because the car actually took the middle of that fork and then swiftly took the left side again probably something that neural-net will take care of hopefully in time okay so once you are on this road it's smooth ish sailing because this is the approach to the anzac bridge i fondly known in Sydney as Madonna's bra there's will see very shortly why it's called that excuse the glare it is about 2:30 so the Sun is still fairly high setting west because we are facing west apparently so see a bit of a glare but importantly the screen is in good view there for you guys to see it's a nice shot there of the anzac bridge yeah so this road is 60 kilometers an hour a lot of cars do go faster than that so you'll have to excuse why everyone's overtaking me but I'm trying to stick with the speed limit okay so this is interesting there's an upcoming lane change here you'll see the lane next to me has a lot of grey line and then it says upcoming lane change so it's a warning that it wants to change lane eventually because there is a turn-off so I'm taking the early option and I letting the car change once I indicate and then confirm with the waggle of the steering wheel and then you'll see that this road once we pass the second peak of the anzac bridge that's pretty much it and then it'll disengage from what a pilot will navigate an autopilot and then re-engage just basically pilot which is the two tram tracks so as you can see there the it's warning you it's going to disengage pretty shortly so I've been pretty happy with this this part it's done pretty well with both Anzac and that's the noise there it's disengagement okay so this is the return journey going back towards the city [Music] and that noises me engaging autopilot so this is on basic autopilot like I said into the city crossing the anzac bridge once again eastbound are those two lanes or those two lines indicate that it's basic order pilot without the navigate part and then now it's a single line which means that we are now on navigate on autopilot [Music] entering an SEC bridge once again and this again the approach into the city from anzac bridge is not easy even for a human driver if it's your first time there's a lot of decisions to make as you'll see it very shortly and again I'm trying to stick to the speed limit here 60 kilometers an hour but just from experience people do go a bit faster than that on this road it's a nice approach in the city you can see the inner city that's there's piemonte below us on the left and it's a Centerpoint tower there Sydney's famous landmark so there are exits here now that's not too bad because you know it's on the far left but so see coming up there are some decisions to make whether you go into the city or head northbound towards the Harbour Bridge which is all white what I want to do on this occasion to get back onto the north side so there's the first decision there so you can either use the cross city tunnel on the right side or keep going on the left so I'm going to as you can see staying this lane because I wanted to see what the car would do there is a fork coming up in this road always worries me those Forks because you don't know what the cars going to do and always the hands on the wheel just in case of course in the event the car is undecided but I'm here talking to you so it means that it made the right decision so there we are there's that signboard telling you to make a decision quickly so the right side goes into the cross city tunnel and if you go in there you're going to miss your turn often at the Harbour Bridge there's that fork and yeah that was fairly smooth at that time plenty of time to make that decision in hindsight yeah you want to stick to the left two lanes to go back go back on the Harbour Bridge so we're kind of above Darling Harbour now and again I think it's not too bad now because if you stay in this Lane you'll end up on the Harbour Bridge if you go on the left two lanes you end up in the city so the car is asked me to stay in this Lane that's fine because we stay on the side you all end up on the Harbour Bridge again just following the speed limit now and then some reason the car didn't read the sign therefore 70 70 kilometers an hour and you'll see very shortly that I do ramp it up to 70 kilometers an hour manually with my right scrolling wheel now this is kind of three o'clock in Sydney and normally pre covered times it would be pretty busy but you know doing the shutdown lockdown period it's pretty quiet relatively speaking so it's good time to test this bits not too bad approach this approach to the Sydney Harbour Bridge because this is kind of a main thoroughfare into the Harbour Bridge if you enter from any other aspect of the city it's a bit trickier but this is fine because it's pretty much a straight shot on the bridge and then when you get to the bridge it disengages to basic or departs so that's where I switched off the video all cones there on your right so yeah you'll see very shortly it um gets on the bridge and that goes back to basic I'll just leave the video running just a bit more because like I said this the bridge changes direction the roads or the lane rather depending on the time of day so I was a little bit hesitant to stay in this lane I wanted to change over to the left but that taxi only left there even though I passed it the car wasn't sure which lane that taxi was in so again something for the new order to take care of in future so I I sort of gave that up and yeah once we get on the bridge just I'll cut the video there because you know that we know that at the moment with this update the bridge doesn't allow navigate on autopilot okay so my term finish up the video there once we get on the bridge oh guys well thanks for watching hope you enjoyed that that is our navigate on autopilot s from the North Shore of Sydney to the inner west and return using two bridges the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the anzac bridge I think it worked pretty well to be honest and I'll use that as a test moving forward for the next update oh guys thanks for watching stay safe take care of yourselves and don't forget you'll never charge a loan I'll see you next time
