I recently released a 47 minute documentary entitled voicemails from strangers it was the first feature-length docket [Music] was to find a concept and for this project I wanted to focus on connecting strangers through the human voice the form of this concept took changed from when I first envisioned it if you check out this video on my channel I explain what happened in more detail but to put things in a nutshell originally I wanted to document phone calls I shared with my subscribers but after the experiment started I wound up with 6000 81 voicemails in my inbox at this point I shifted the focus away from the conversations I had which were mostly cordial but rushed to the voicemail collection which covered a lot more intimate and in-depth subject matter so after some reworking I settled upon this final concept create as pure a slice of life documentary as possible start the movie by explaining how the voicemails got in my inbox and then for the rest of the movie share a selection of them with the audience no commentary no omnipotent narration justice story's raw honest laid before viewers to hear and contemplate voicemails from strangers concept locked step 2 was obvious I needed to listen to and document the voicemails seemed simple enough but in practice this proved challenging documentaries they cover real-life people and real-life subject matter it's easy to become emotionally invested in the story that you're telling or the people that you're chronicling with this project I was literally listening to thousands of stories plenty of them stressful or heartbreaking at worst and it's tough to listen to a person unfold their life to you in a 30 second message only to be pulled to another person and another life seconds later I didn't anticipate just how emotionally draining this whole process would be halfway through the list I almost considered slowing down the project or even scrapping it completely it felt like too big of a mountain for me to try to climb alone but eventually I realized that in some way I owed it to the strangers who called strangers so willing to share such clothes in personal pieces of themselves I owed it to them to do something meaningful with the messages they left the deeper and deeper I got into this documentation process the more important it became to see the movie through to completion the story of these strangers meant something to me and I knew it would mean something to others 6000 81 voicemails later I was certain this was a film worth making step 3 condense the material 6000 81 audio recordings is a daunting task it took me a solid four days to listen to all of them from which I selected about 300 that I felt were compelling enough to share with viewers this doesn't mean that the other 5700 some messages were lacking or boring or unimportant quite the opposite some of these messages were just a bit too intimate for my tastes personal information and vulnerabilities were revealed by many colors then it made me feel exploitative to include them in the movie I didn't feel comfortable sharing such sensitive material so as a result plenty of messages that were sent to me they never made it onto my shortlist the 300 that did were real isint to one of the calls included personal messages to me that wouldn't be relevant or meaningful to the lay person so I knew I would cut these parts out the trick was figuring out how to edit such messages so that they still made sense after removing these moments some calls upon second listening simply didn't convey a clear message a lot of them were for better or worse redundant obviously this is no fault of the caller's a lot of them are going through similar things but I wanted to make sure a wide variety of voices could be represented in the final film as an example I probably had 20 calls in the 300 from students about to graduate voicemails that detailed their worries about adulthood employment paying rent including all 20 of these live lesson the emotional impact upon the audience so I used only two or three of them in the final movie all of these cuts were simply personal determinations made by me in the moment this is the editing process scouring your available resources and refining them again and again until you left with something that properly and efficiently conveys the desired story one time was certainly a factor that I was constantly mindful of throughout the entire process I experimented with different drafts of the call log originally a 70 minute cut but that seemed to drag halfway through 30 minutes felt too short it's hard to judge this kind of thing after two days of constant winnowing I settled upon 135 voicemails that would be used in the final movie this brought me to step four create a rough cut in other words now that I had my final voicemails I needed to inter cut them in a way that formed a coherent narrative I wanted voicemails that included the time of day to be played chronologically so the movie begins with calls of people waking up halfway through people are out to lunch and towards the end of the film people are reflecting on the events of the day I also wanted to take the audience on sort of an emotional roller coaster some calls were happy some were sad some were frustrating some melancholy I played around with finding a call order that didn't stock too much of one emotion up front but instead had sort of a flow to it I can't really explain what I mean by this basically I wanted the calls to form sort of an unspoken narrative something that would keep people watching eager to hear the next strangers message in the next and the next never wanting to ever really end audience emotion and audience attention is something that's always on the forefront of my mind and which only voicemails and know supporting narration to work with I had to be careful a day or two later I had the calls lined up in the order that I wanted so the next step was to add some music now this is normally done in the latter stages of development but because this is a documentary centered around the audio experience I had to get this locked down right after the voicemails were fully assembled I spend a lot of time listening to music during my day today to find tracks that convey just the right emotion if I stumble upon a particular song that has a certain say retrospective feel to it I store it in my collection and I put a note of this next to it in case the need for such a tomb ever comes up in the future as you make more and more audio-visual thing the greater your music library grows not there are plenty of royalty-free services out there I wanted to make sure that I used music in this movie that I could retain the rights to for years to come you can never underestimate just how important music is in a film it can in a very real sense make or break your picture so I took my time with it three full days finding the right music and mixing it together with the vocals a large portion of my audio work it goes completely unnoticed by viewers and actually that's a sign that I'm doing it right and to make sure audio levels were properly calibrated for the entire movies runtime is proved difficult because different music tracks are sometimes mixed at different decibel levels and the volume of the voice mails I selected they were all over the place so I had to make sure to normalize the audio and integrate all of the elements together in a way that felt natural the loudness or softness of each piece of music of each call needed to be intentional it took a while but eventually I got there next I needed to create captions the audio quality for most of the voice mails was poor sometimes difficult to parse so I knew I would need to provide subtitles and closed captions to make it easier for audiences to understand what the caller's were saying this actually had a double benefit of providing viewers with this sort of a central eye point so I could keep their attention focused mainly on the messages to be completely honest this was the most boring part of production transcribing every sentence with proper accuracy it took several days it was quite a grind and there really wasn't much glamour and sitting at my desk plugging away at a keyboard I made sure to keep these captions within the proper safety margins and to fit them in a central text box so that the readers eyes didn't have to scan the whole screen it's an old trick that subtitlers used to increase the speed with which one reads admittedly I made a lot of typos so I had to go back and correct these but eventually I had the audio locked and the captions locked this led to the next step which was to add visual elements I decided to select stock footage that kept with the theme of each individual call but I had to make sure the clips didn't detract from the listening or the reading experience I also wanted to avoid using a lot of faces something about landscapes and obscured people would give the audience the creative freedom to imagine what each caller looked like and this went a long way toward making the viewing experience more serene I sifted through hours upon hours of stock footage libraries to track down clips that would work well with the music and with the calls in total I sourced about 280 pieces of video I realized the subtitles were hard to see against certain backdrops so to make them easier to read I placed a gradient between the video layer and the subtitle layer yes I know if I wanted to I could have released this thing without any visual elements at all but where's the fun in that having moving pictures added another layer to the experience sometimes I was even able to integrate sound effects from the clips into the audio experience and although it took two weeks to do the end result of combining video and audio was definitely worth the extra effort at this point I had a rough cut completed and ready for review I've been working on the video for almost a month now and I was worried that I was getting tunnel vision this happens a lot you look at something so long that you don't notice a lot of the imperfections or the glaring issues so I took my rough cut and I asked my wife to watch it to see if the movie was conveying the message that I wanted she gave me great feedback perhaps most importantly pointed out a couple of typos that has flown under my radar so with a list of needed Corrections I got back into the editing booth I corrected the typos fixed the editing blips added some end credits and having spent a month on the whole process exported the final cut after that I dropped the movie on my channel and from here I'm just focusing on promotion driving traffic to a forty seven minute video is tough especially when you've got the YouTube algorithm working against you doing my best to get as many eyes on the movie as possible but I know that the audience for something like this is small I am planning on submitting the documentary to a few film festivals I'm working on getting together some kind of local screening for later this year I'll probably announce more details when they become available overall the experience of creating voicemails from strangers was incredibly rewarding this all started out is just something to do with my summer the idea that I began with wasn't exactly what I ended up with but in the end I think I enjoyed the final film way more than my initial expectations the truth is most occu men thérèse they take years and years of planning and craftsmanship and I know that this movie just isn't in the same ballpark as these large-scale projects but at the same time I think I'm better off for having put it together if you want to watch the documentary check the links provided it would mean the world to me if you watched it in its entirety give it a thumbs up if you liked it let me know what you thought about it in the videos comments and be sure to share it with others after that if you find yourself worldwide and checking it out helps support my channel so have at it [Music]
