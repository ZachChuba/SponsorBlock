hi everyone I hope you're all doing great with your in Tober draw toolbar which Tober or whatever Tober you're doing this year I'd like to thank you so much for the amazing feedback that I got on my previous inktober video I really truly appreciate it I'm back today with another interbirth dreamed draw with me video but before we get started I like much for listening guys and please enjoy the video so for this illustration I started out with some sketching in my sketchbook I wanted to do a mermaid did anyone mermaid last time I suddenly don't remember the last video at all I think that was a wish actually yeah that was a witch so I decided I wanted to do a man at this time and I wanted it to like be framed in this black kind of box with some some bubbles from the water and then have her like borderless the No yeah that one was like like just fuchsia with the rest of the white paper and so yeah that was the idea so here are some of the thumbnails that I did in my sketchbook with some different kind of poses and it is the last one number five that I the one that I'm drawing right now that I ended up going with I can't quite explain why I think I just like the the flow better and also the fact that I didn't have to draw a full body and in this video the lighting in my workspace is changing quite a non that not like a lot but just a bit and I've tried my best while I was editing the video to to kind of even out the Lighting's but in my work room right now in my office I have a window just next to my desk at the left side and I'm also putting up some studio lights to even out the light from the right side but whenever the Sun is out it misses up with the lighting no matter if I pull the curtains down or how many lamps I put up I can't control the Sun and the Sun is a very strong light source obviously so sometimes they'll be some shifting lights I'm trying not to record any of these traditional paintings while the Sun is on this side of the house because it actually lived to the other side fairly quickly but this day I just had to record it this early because I had a very very tight schedule and I couldn't wait to do this through tonight fall so I apologize for if you rely if you realize if you notice the shifting lights I'm trying to make up best as I can and another little thing that I thought I wanted to mention is that on these drove of me videos that are so long you know they're like I think I have got some 30 minutes now so I'm at 40 minutes I want to try to run a few more ads on them so you to better help sustain my career as an artist I really hope you don't mind and just feel free to skip them it doesn't matter I'll just put them in there and see if it makes a difference because I think it will so I need to work less on other stuff so I can make more YouTube [Music] so in lights of Halloween coming up soon I thought today I wanted to mention a few horror movies that I really liked and I recommend others to watch and I'm going to talk just a little bit about them as well but I won't be spoiling anything so don't worry first I want to say that I really really like to watch horror movies and I've kind of become a horror fan in the past what's the like now eight years or something I used to be terrified of horror movies I mean really terrified even just overly dramatic movies or thrillers I couldn't handle them as a child I would wake up in the middle of the night having cold sweats because I was getting nightmares I couldn't sleep again so I would have to go sit in the kitchen one of my rights is making no noise right now have to go sit in the kitchen in the middle of the night with all the lights turned on and just drawers or something because I couldn't go back to sleep and I was also kind of afraid of the dark and I had a very very crazy imagination as a child and I I kept sometimes floating between the state of being awake and being asleep and not really realizing if I was seeing stuff or if I was dreaming it really really really horrible okay but then after I moved away from home when I was 21 I started casually watching horror movies every day when I come back came back from school and it actually really helped me so I would just put on a horror movie in my completely lit up room bedroom and I would draw something also or I will sit and play in my Nintendo DS or something while the horror movie was playing and I started out with a lot of classics like the ring and the and movies that I don't particularly like because I think they're bad but but they gave me the opportunity to explore the horror genre on my own and eventually I ended up liking horror movies and the frill so much that now I that's just my favorites younger and I can always always watch a horror movie and I love a new good horror movies come out and that's why I want to talk about and mentioned some horror movies today because if you're like a lot of movies and that genre are really really really bad and I have a few that I think are really really good something that I want to recommend to you and the first one is one of my favorites and it's conjuring the first and the second movie I think the second movie is the best but I also like the first one so conjuring is basically a a movie series based on the Warren's who were paranormal investigators and their journals and I mean those were people living in the actual real life and the movies are based on their journals and their experiences and pretty world famous hauntings as well such as a medieval horror and stuff like that which actually gets a feature in one of the movies even though it's not about that movie so I really really recommend conjuring one and one and two they have some really nice like shock effects but they don't seem cheap at all and yeah I just really really like them because the cast is also really really well picked up another one I want to recommend and that's a series and it's a Netflix it's called the haunting of Hill House I think this is the best horror series I've seen in my life I don't remember how long the episodes are I think that between 40 minutes in an hour and maybe 10 eversource on something and there are so so many Easter eggs in this series and it's just so well made and there was the scene and the were not going to spoil there was a scene where a lot of the main cast was gathered together and talking then 10 minutes in the conversation or something my husband said wait isn't this like a one-shot so one shot just means that you don't turn off the camera and even if they just fake the one shot or whatever it was really incredible than you realize how long they had been going on without the camera recording at all so I that that series just incredibly terrifying and has really nice effects and I don't think it ever gets boring it's kind of like watching Game of Thrones with horror even when the cast is just talking it's still very entertaining and thrilling so yeah I really really recommend the haunting of Hill House the next moving on to recommend is probably the one that I've seen the least of I mean besides honing of Hill House which I've only watched once sinister the next movie I probably watched these two because it's so terrifying that I can can't really watch it alone just yet and it's mainly because of the sound design the sound design in this movie is incredible and bound to give you nightmares there are these little scenes in the movie where the main protagonist finds some old film that he plays and while he plays these old films there are some very very eerie sound designs happening and the I swear that will give you great news besides that the movie is okay but just because they sound design is so amazing I recommend watching it to have nightmares the next movie are going to mention is a personal favorite of mine not necessarily because it's really really really good because it's just I think it's okay I mean it's good it's not amazing it's good it's called hide and seek and it's about mental illness that's as much as I can say and some of the consequences of it and it also has a child as the main protagonist as one of the main protagonists at least and the reason I'm mentioning this video is because that's the first horror movie that I learned to watch on my own without getting scared and I could watch it in the middle of the night or rotate like it didn't matter I could watch this alone as the first horror movie without getting scared so yeah a personal little favorite and the next two movies I'm going to recommend are classics there are alien 1 and aliens which is I mean alien and aliens alien and aliens alien is alien 1 and aliens are is alien to surround rambling a little bit right now I just really really really appreciate a classic old monster movie and alien is my favorite by far I just think all the the cast are amazing incredible and the fact that this was before CGI and they actually built the aliens in suits that's just incredible but those are classics and I really recommend you watch them if you haven't watched alien movies yet and if you're really really into them I also recommend you watch Prometheus I really really like that although I don't find it as horror ish it's more like friller sci-fi but yeah the next video I'm going to recommend is the visit a video I explore tried recently actually recently being within the last few years but I only watched it like three times I think maybe four times and this movie is yeah it's scary it is a horror movie but it's also incredibly funny the two main protagonists are teenage kids who who just doesn't admit amazing an incredible job at mixing between showing real feelings on tape and also missing around and it's about two siblings a big sister and a little brother who visit their grandparents for the first time they have never met them before and then things just get really really creepy and weird really fast and it's really really a good movie and has an amazing plot twist so I really recommend that you watch the visit the next movie actually I think this movie too is something I don't yeah I only watched this one once too because it's too creepy to why it's it and how funny it's called creep I found it on Netflix I don't know if it's on Netflix where you live but creep is creepy I mean incredibly creepy and if you if you're scared of fairies and stuff like that don't watch creep ok unless you really want nightmares this is such an it's a I don't really know I think they have like a term for this kind of movies like when the camera is handheld so it's actually that two main characters one is the protagonist and one is the villain obviously or something but but the main protagonist is no it actually both of them now that I come to think of it both of them use the camera throughout the movie but the main protagonists used it most of the time so it's a handheld camera kind of like Cloverfield ish feels so it feels like a a home movie that someone found somewhere it's it's a really really good and very creepy movie and sometimes you just sit there like I don't really know what's going on but I feel everybody basically you you if you have had problems with stalkers maybe you shouldn't watch this because there are definitely some stalkerish things happening in it and it's generally just really really creepy and the last movie aren't going to recommend for this year's Halloween is one of my I think current ferrites because I always feel like putting it on and I can watch this on my own as well and it's mama and it has Nikolaj coster-waldau in it the Danish actor who plays Jamie Lannister and Game of Thrones and he actually plays two characters in it but it yeah they're twins so yeah but but it's it's probably one of the best horror movies and most creepy monster designs made in present time I think so very shortly it's about two kids who gets found in the forest where they have been raised by some kind of entity that they called mana and they brought out back from that forest house out back into civilization and the the kids play these roles so well you have to remember that one of the kids when they I mean in the story when they got out in that cabin in the woods that's actually a title of another amazing horrible but at the forest house she was really really really really young I think maybe two years three years old so basically that forest house is all she remembers for those years they were there I think they were it may be there for five years or something before someone found them they all this happens in the beginning of the movie so it's not really spoiler but they're being brought back to civilization and lives with Nick Acosta Bella's character and these really really really weird things happening when mama kind of comes to be together with her kids so it's the the monster design in this is incredibly incredibly well made and so creepy and if I'm not going to spoil anything don't worry but but it yeah and no way you have to watch it for yourself it's I think it's a really good movie it's it gets a little Hollywood Issue at some points but generally I think it's an incredibly horror movie and I really recommend it and because I said Nikolaj coster-waldau I actually came to think of a Danish horror movie that he's in that if you can somehow get a hold of it or watch it somewhere I really recommend it it's quite old Nikolaj coster-waldau is really young in this one and it's in debt in Denmark it's called native actin it's just a finger transference to the nightguard but I'm not sure what it's called in English so basically it's  I cast a veil up the main character who is a guard a night guard in a morgue you can basically guess I think where this is going right so there is this bill he asked what is this bill for and the former night God says well if the bell rings that means someone in the morgue is awake and you're just fixating on this bill throughout the entire movie the movie isn't necessarily but you are as the viewer because you're terrified that that bill is going to ring and I'm not going to spoil to you whether it's going to ring or not but I tell you this is a creepy movie it's horri but it's also filler and kind of what's a genre called like investigation ish you know like mystery I think it's also kind of like a mystery movie but in the night guard or Ned of actin it's a it's a really good movie and also like host of elders but in his isn't it so yeah okay I think I just spent literally 15 minutes recommended some of my favorite horror movies I just wrote a list really quick of like movies that came to my mind immediately I know that there are a lot of more a lot more movies that I could recommend so I just can't turn my brain on and remember them right [Music] anyway I look at the screen right now and see how far we have gotten into the video and I completely forgot that I actually wanted to say something about the dog no I just want you to catch up a little bit on it so I am using ink from Wilson and Newton Newton wait I mean I have to be okay from Windsor and Newton black Indian ink that's the ink that I'm using it's the same thing I used last time and I'm also using the same pen ink that I showed you in the last video and I must admit I have become pretty addicted to this ink pen I mean I love my my regular well like pants with you know like with a cap on them and everything what I call liners liners but but this has become kind of like a new obsession for me to use ink like this I just really really really like the way that it flows and all the variety variety my mortal nemesis word comes to mind again it's variety did I say it correct the first time instability in the lines and the it's so easy to shade because it varies the line shapes it's just incredible and kind of daytime and this process today is sped up with 200% so what you see like there's over and can't speak right now the speed speed at which I'm drawing in the video is double as fast as I was drawing in real life yeah so that should give you an idea once again how really really slow my draw sometimes that's also why I have to cut a lot in these videos because I don't want to speed up my draw with my videos too much because I think that kind of ruins the essence of what the draw with me is so I have to cut in between and I actually cut away half of the reason but I think I cut it so that it makes sense so you don't think like don't feel like you're missing out on too much and I also made that close-up shot of the face because yeah I wanted to show you how close how I inked the face as well so basically also when I need to cover a big areas of black I just use a regular brush to paint in the ink as if it was watercolor and now that I can't think of anything else that I could talk about I thought maybe I could share with you some of the ideas I have for upcoming videos I do this once in a while to give you an idea of just what I'm working on and yeah because I obviously have nothing more interesting to talk about now I've done my horror movies the gist but as you heard in the beginning of the video I am going to next month next month of release a video on how to build an art portfolio I'm not really sure if that is going to be the focus of the video like in the output folio part it's more like building a website and deciding like what kind of website do you need because for me for instance I I need to have a section with some of the artwork that I really like that I want people to see but my entire website shouldn't be an art portfolio because there's so much more to what I do for instance here in YouTube and an on patreon and I also have a shop so there's a lot of things need to combine into this website so I portfolio is definitely a part of it but but I'm trying to make it as broad as possible to include as many people and make it as relevant for you guys as possible as well so that video is coming out next month and I am still working on a video I mentioned a few videos back about inspiration for your drawing workflow which is all of the creative processes leading up to the drawing like picking colors and making a mood board finding or making your own references and stuff like that it's a pretty big production so it takes a while I think it would be out in November as well hopefully if not then then by the latest in December so yeah working on that as well I also wrote down some more ideas for art style challenges that I just did recently because you guys gave me a lot of cool inspiration in the comment section comments section in the previous video and of course I'm working on the infamous tutorial on layers and layer workflow part 2 which is due for a year ago so yeah that's a bit embarrassing that I haven't gotten to that yet and I'm also working on a new workspace tour because I've just very very recently like one week or two weeks ago managed to do a big interior interior upgrade in my office because we moved back this spring and the office has been undone for a long time and now we finally got some new stuff up so I'm actually kind of ready to show you my new new setup and that video should be out yeah this year to November or December I'm kind of like November or December in things because this Sunday something major is going to happen in my life and I'm very very excited to tell you about it I know some of you know what it is don't spoil it it's a surprise but May basically something major is happening this Sunday and I'm going to share with us quickly as possible what it is that is happening but I won't say anything yet because even though it's mostly for my own sake I mean it's actually entirely for my own sake that this is happening I I can't it cannot cannot cannot can't not affect my youtube as well so it is really exciting and I'm very very failed to mention this to you and it's something that will be taking a lot of time in November and Cimber and that's why I'm kind of loose on when the videos will be out but yeah I am making different kinds of contact for guys I am having such a hard time right now talking oh yeah yeah yeah last video I want to mention I am planning to do a video on abandon artwork and speed paints because I realized the other day when I was going through my video folder with video that I haven't claimed for specific videos that there are us there's a lot of video in there for drawings and ever finished or stuff like that and I thought it would be fun to share it with you as well as now that I remember a video showing you some of my old web comics that's going to be a crunchy day and maybe I should redraw one of the pages of my away comment maybe I don't know that depends on how much we cringe today I suppose [Music] [Music] [Music] so right now with the drawing I have tightened some ink and mixed it with a lot of water so you can like this washed out ink very transparent ink and I'm just giving her hair some shade so it wasn't like this big white blob I think it looked okay it's a big white blob but I really like it better with a little bit of shading and I'm also shading some of the other areas of the drawing and doing it very lightly because if I add too much water and and go over the air the red air is too much with the brush that will start to become pink and that's not what I wanted for this drawing so yeah I'm just doing some shading now here with the gray [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] and we are almost finished with drawing by now last thing I want to do is my personal favorite thing to do with traditional art and that's adding some shine I picked the gold and basically this is some gold powder by some Inga and you just pour out some of the powder and mix it with water the more water you you put in the more transparent it becomes the less water you use the figure the substances and the more opaque it is I use perhaps a little too much water this time but actually once the the gold dries you don't notice it because the way that it interacts with the light and stuff you think you'll see that in a bit when I finished the drawing so I think I will just leave the last minute or so to the music and I'll return to say goodbye [Music] [Music] like my big head coming into the picture during this golden signature don't mind it at all so this is the final version of my inktober mermaid drawing with a golden signature down there in the corner feeling my define that I love the way that I shine so yeah this was actually really really fun doing and I we as usually really enjoy working with the inks thank you guys so much for watching this video and for sticking with me to the end and I am really excited to see you next time so until then take care guys [Music]
