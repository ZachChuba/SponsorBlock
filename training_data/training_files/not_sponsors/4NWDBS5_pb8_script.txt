[Music] so I've been sick this week very annoying because I had a full week of filming fun but there we go I've still managed to put a good video for you together today we're talking about seven other things that matter in landscape photography let's go so here's the video today we're talking about seven other things that matter in landscape photography it's kind of a mixture of mindset and some practical tips that you can not only use to improve your landscape photography but also improve your enjoyment of it after all that's really what counts before we get into it online store make your next move with Squarespace so number one is fitness there are a lot of people out there that will not walk more than 500 meters or so from the car in order to take a landscape picture now that's fine if you have restricted movement or something like that but for most people I think it's a mindset that people get into that they don't want to go too far from the carpets enjoying outdoors a little bit more getting in touch with the landscape spending time in the landscape can really improve your photography and that means getting a bit further away from the car and to do that we need to become less sedentary there I see it so often there are far too many people who are just not active enough it's sad to say but you may you may realize that you're one of them I certainly realized that in myself I'm Way too sedentary most of the time it's something I've really committed to solving because about three years ago I injured my back and it just sort of became I mean I was I was restricted for a long time but it then became a bit of an excuse as to not do more activity more fitness it's something I'm working on myself I'm committing to you to get much much fitter I want to lose about four stone in weight because being fit and being active in the landscape moving around the hill quickly massively improves your landscape photo because say if you're on a mountain and you see above you there is something incredible that you want to shoot the light is just right this is happened to me the light is just right if you don't think you've got the fitness to get up there quickly it can be a real downer it can bring you down it can make you feel rubbish and it can it just it hampers your enjoyment of what you're doing if you fit and you can bound up there quickly without even thinking about it you get there you're not particularly out of breath you recover quickly all your focus is then going to be on making that picture rather than being a sweaty mess like I am a lot of the time when I get to the top it's just gonna miss it definitely is going to make you feel better all-round be more active all that extra energy that you've got can go into creating that picture so it's definitely something I want to working on please hold me to account if I'm not losing weight as we go through the next six months or so hold me to account and hopefully that will you can help me out as well number two is food it's important to everybody isn't it very straightforward but having the right food when you're on a photography trip or a tour or a long day out shooting having the right food is pretty important if you are on a really long walk and you're you know you're going to be expending a lot of energy have high energy food so something sugary because if your blood sugar drops you get a horrible tired feeling where it's difficult to put one step in front of the other if you have that sugary food to build that glucose back up get that energy going again and keep you going through the day having some carbs the day before will help as well but aside from that having a nice bit of food in the middle of the day can really lift your spirits especially if it's something warm you saw when I did my wild camp having that hot food at the top of the mountain in the evening and in the morning when it's starting to get cold can make all the difference to your morale just something simple like bringing a flask of coffee pouring the hot coffee into the cup when you sheltered from the wind and it's cold just it makes all the difference it makes it special and it can just get you going for the next day each of your shoots and your day number three is friendship I talked about this a few weeks ago on the video about why I do landscape photography I love the solitude of landscape photographer talk a little bit about it last week on the video but just before we talk about that look at this I printed the image from last week pretty happy with that it looks pretty great just wanted to show you that quickly but yes solitude is a big part of my landscape photography but there are times when you get creatively stunted you get stuck in a rut you get photographers block as it were and it just becomes difficult to motivate yourself to get out over and over again and continue shooting landscape photography particularly if you schedule is tight as well it's just so easy to stay inside especially as the winter is coming as well going out with a friend can make all the difference motivate each other you can have more fun walking and talking at the same time just bounce ideas off each other creatively when it comes to actually shooting as well you can then compare and contrast your images at the end then it just becomes a whole sort of it's just a completely different experience and that might be what you need to push through that creative block that you currently stuck in and if if you're not stuck in one it's just gonna be another another interesting and good experience anyway so next up we have family I'm not quite sure why but I've had quite a few questions about family recently and people finding it difficult to grind out the time to get out and do landscape photography and I completely understand that because it used to be an issue that I had doing landscape photography can be time-consuming especially if you have to drive quite a distance to get to a good location it isn't very conducive with family life if you have a wife or a husband or a girlfriend or boyfriend that kind of thing and they're not into landscape photography of a lot particularly fans of the outdoors either it becomes difficult to grind out that time and separate away from them you've got work you've got other commitments everything you're doing just doesn't really fit in with doing landscape photography if you have children on top of that and responsibilities with dependents it just becomes even more difficult so grinding out the time is exceptionally hard it's something Isis uses struggle with a lot I sold it I suppose by making landscape photography my full-time job I didn't used to my wife used to come with me a lot of the time because she enjoys the outdoors as well we used to go for walks but then still when I was stopping to do a landscape photograph and taking my time in an area my wife didn't particularly like it when you have to wait soft 20 minutes half an hour in one spot for me to take an image and it just extends that time and it is difficult and I get that there isn't really an easy solution for this but I would recommend that you just over communicate with your family with your wife with your husband wait about when you want to get out plan ahead plan a trip with friends are and then obviously be useful when you are around earn that sort of time away doing landscape photography hopefully you've got a partner that understands they understand they understand what it does for you you all need to be creative and the positive benefits that it has on you your happiness and your mental health but explain that to them don't just don't just let them think that you're disappearing off to get away from them talk to them let them know what landscape photography means to you I think you'll find they'll be pretty supportive the next few are a little bit more practical and that starts with outdoor skills as we move away from the city into the countryside it does become more difficult and having skills around being outdoors is very important and it can really make the difference between you being safe between you getting into the right position being able to get to a location to do your photography so that includes getting up into mountains and I mean it could be anything from simply reading a map right up to those hardcore bushcraft skills that will see you existing way off the grid for long periods of time it's something I'm very interested in because having spent some time with Marten Hilmer recently and he spent all the time in the Arctic when he was in the forces and he started creating some videos around bushcraft and it's something I'm really interested in exploring myself doing a bit more spending more time off the grid in the wilderness and I think those skills are really important but we can work up to that so just by simply learning how to read a map being able to just simple stuff by getting out more often experience walking over craggy rocks get used to looking ahead of you where you're gonna walk get you footing right so you're not gonna fall twist an ankle you right but I see a lot of people really struggling when they're on top of mountains and things like that so just by doing it over and over and over again your skills in the outdoors will will improve and it will definitely impact again on your ability to get into a good location to get those magical unique landscape photographs [Music] next is planning there are loads of quotes about planning and the lack of planning and just how important it is really and it's no different in landscape photography planning can make all the difference because if you just go out blind then there's a good chance you're gonna come home with nothing particularly special but if you have a specific plan about a specific location looking at weather patterns looking at tide times sunset and sunrise times that kind of thing it can make all the difference to you get in a really great image I actually quite enjoy going out without a plan sometimes I'm just going to explore and to scout and I think that's a big part of it as well the soft temper that with all the times when you go out with having a really solid structured plan you need to be flexible within that plan to pivot if things aren't going quite right but having a plan there to start with really focuses your mind gets you sort of where you need to be into the right locations and can be really helpful with your photography overall things I do generally I will start by looking at Google Maps deciding where I'm going to go I will then look at the weather I try not to be sort of too choosy about what the weather is doing but I'll look for things that can be positive rather than negative so if I see misty conditions or conditions that might show that there's gonna be a really good sunset or sunrise I use things like the BBC where there app the Met Office weather more so because I find that's much more accurate I use tie a tight tied up called my tied times I use Skippy sky I use golden hour the golden hour up which is good for sort of predicting whether there's going to be a good sunrise and sunset and then really good up or just a good website is the Ordnance Survey website I've talked about this briefly before but just with a small annual subscription you get access to all of Odd and surveys Maps you can plot routes for your walk off for where your going to go and then there's this pretty awesome fly through mode that sort of shows you where to go so bringing all that together it just takes some time maybe an hour or two before you shoot the night before or something like that but almost always it pays off so introducing that sort of planning process and phase into your photography process can really make all the difference the other alternative is if you don't like doing that is to go on a photography tour or a workshop because a lot of people really benefit from that just by not worrying about any of that and letting the tour leader deal with that for you I have a tour up at the moment check down below to join me on an epic adventure of the Lake District in March okay so next up we have the non photographic gear this makes all the difference it's so important especially as we're going into the winter having the right winter gear is just essential absolutely essential to you enjoying and making sure you're in the right place to capture great images clothing is probably the most important part because as some people say there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing so very simply the way to go is to layer your clothing have a base layer of some synthetic or merino type material then have a fleece type layer underneath that then you want to have a really warm coat a down jacket comes highly recommended from me they are amazing if you've never had one before then on top of that you will want to have a raincoat because most down jackets aren't waterproof so having that rain cover over the top will really make the difference and then as you get warm and cold and the conditions change just remove those layers stick them in you bag most of them are quite lightweight and that's the way to go first think of my trousers I don't bother with waterproof trousers I will put some sort of legging type things underneath in the cold weather and I'll just put my walking trousers over the top if they get wet then they usually Drive pretty quickly because they're synthetic that's just me but it's probably a good idea if you struggle with the cold and things to have waterproof trousers as well hats gloves all that sort of sensible stuff as well will really improve your enjoyment of also just invested in a pair of ski goals this year I want to get up into the mountain in the winter a lot more when you got a snow and wind blowing in your face the ski goggles can really make a difference they help with safety actually because if you're if it's windy and you've got a snow wind and rain blowing in your face you're forced to look down but if you've got the ski goggles on you can still look up and see where you're going and not miss the path getting near to an edge or fall off a cliff or anything sitting like that didn't look all right as well but I'm guessing I probably won't see anyone up there at that time yeah in that time a type of weather anyway so I don't really care but you might see it Oh another video of non photographic gear that I think is really important is a bag my bag is the f-stop cyka bag I don't say this lightly but it's changed my life as a landscape photographer because it's big it gets everything in that I need when you've got it I mean it is heavy but when you've got it on its supremely comfortable for someone with a bad back it just sits really nicely compresses my spine a little bit which makes it more comfortable and yeah just a supreme bag high quality completely waterproof throughout and that's the bit that has really made the difference for me because I see loads of people struggling with bags whacking covers over the top and things like that but mine is completely waterproof throughout if it's wet on the flock and just shook it down it opens up I can get all my gear out really easily and it has it has made such a difference to my photography it's made it easier it's made it just more convenient and that has a knock-on effect of making my photography better as well with one less thing to worry about I also carry a powerful torch with me just ahead toss they're pretty cheap to buy on Amazon I have a penknife lighter all those kind of things that are going to really make the difference if you get into trouble I carry a power pack to charge my phone as well lots of stuff like that just to make it a bit more comfortable and make sure you're gonna be safe when you're out for a full day shooting out and about in the great outdoors so all of those things together I just thought I'd share with you briefly while how I failed to get out this week due to being ill but I hope you've enjoyed it this man and you'll get 10% off your first purchase leave a comment down below let me know what you think and I'll see you on another one very very soon I'll be out again next week
