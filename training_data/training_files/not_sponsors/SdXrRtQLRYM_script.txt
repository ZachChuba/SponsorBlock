the charming man wearing red underwear floats down onto the balcony bright red cape flowing behind him the intrepid reporter moves closer her blue dress trailing behind her the charming man falls closer the intrepid reporter remembers why the man is here what should be an interview between the two turns into a competition of smiles asking and answering questions in between their grins the charming man gazed into the eyes of the intrepid reporter the intrepid reporter glances back to our notebook do you like pink I like pink very much love this exists in a Superman movie and it's [ __ ] amazing it's February the month of hearts chocolates roses and love letters this scene from the 1978 Superman film is a love letter not only to Superman but to humanity the stage is set simply Superman decides to start to drop it anyway to let Louis know what he's all about what could and in most Hollywood films would be a scene filled with exposition drops is instead the most human scene in the film under the guise of an interview we find out so much about these people not just their origin stories but their curiosities their insecurities and their love that they each have for each other but before we get into the score the dialogue the direction the performances or anything like that we need to talk about the gorgeous lighting and set design of Lois Lane's balcony ever since Clark left Smallville and became most of the sets have been crowded metropolis city blocks cram Daily Planet offices or the cold frozen Fortress of Solitude everything feels overwhelming compared to the simplicity and beauty of Smallville Kansas everything except this balcony the bright lights bathed the screen and a dreamlike warmth the absurd abundance of plants make her balcony feel more like a garden a garden separate from the crowds but still very much at the heart of Metropolis a garden where a god falls in love everything about this set is comfortable for us and for the characters Lois obviously feels at home since it is her home and Superman definitely feels more at peace above the massive metropolis and away from his disguised as the bumbling rookie reporter Clark Kent there is such a level of peace achieved through the design of her balcony peace is an underrated emotion in film peace allows us to take a pause from the action and take a pause from the super peace allows us to just share in this moment with Lois and Clark before this moment things are never peaceful between the two Clark's and the audience's introduction to Lois takes place in the most visually overwhelming set in the film and Lois's and the worlds introduction to Superman takes place during the first Superman save of the movie where she almost frickin dies neither have the time to really take the other end that's why this moment is so poignant they now finally have the time they have the peace and everything about their interaction their first real interaction is so human hi what I really adore about the scene is the fact that we learned everything we need to know about Superman as Louis learns it and I'm not just talking about expository facts like his height about 64 or his weight around 2 to 25 or his abilities we learn his character we learn everything we need to know about the character of Superman Clark shows up with this confidence about him almost like he's showing off the persona of Superman to Lois but behind all this quick romantic responses no I don't if I did miss lane you'd be the first to know about it our lines that show us the real Clark not the bumbling doofus of The Daily Planet and not the strong Saviour of mankind but the real good-natured and sometimes dorky Boy Scout that is Clark Kent we learn exactly what Superman stands for yes I'm here to fight for truth and justice in the American Way and Lois his response to that sums up exactly what the audience is feeling about Clark's wholesome view on America you're gonna end up fighting every elected official in this country and then they freakin follow it up with this buzz hmm [ __ ] me that's perfect that's honest that's cheesy that's Superman this doesn't feel like a scene out of a superhero movie this feels like a scene out of a romance movie the way the scene is blocked the couple constantly moving towards and away from each other almost like a game of cat and mouse the camera following their movements the naturalistic performances of Christopher Eve and Margot Kidder they aren't hamming it up and they aren't acting like they're in a comic book they're acting like two people on a first date or in this case a first interview every time her questions or responses seem otherworldly the screenplay and excellent performances bring us back to earth so a question about the home planet of the last Sun actually it's Krypton whether kr Y becomes a question about underwear why do you like pink I like pink very much Lois this may seem simple but trust me delivering all this needed exposition while building character while also developing a romance will also also make us fall in love with these people in under five minutes is no easy task it's a task that a lot of TV shows and movies today failed to pull off a lot of modern films a lot of modern Superman films somehow fail to make the audience care in two hours even if you love Man of Steel or Batman vs Superman or the entire [ __ ] DC EU you have to omit that Lois Lane isn't a character in those movies she's an object used for plot I loved playing her she said I love everyone I work with sometimes it's tricky because I feel like she's in service of the story instead of the story serving the character okay compare this lovely romantic scene from a 1978 film to this bathtub scene in the 2016 film what do we learn about Clark in this scene I don't care I don't care what they're saying what do we learn about Lois the answer is nothing Lois tells the audience she has doubts about our relationship that we never see and Clark assures her she has nothing to worry about by screwing her in a bathtub but at least we see how Jack Henry Cavill is right filmmakers and especially Studios tend to overthink Superman nowadays Superman isn't about explosions Jesus symbolism or a Dragonball Z action sequence Superman isn't about existential angst Superman was never real just the dream of a farmer from Kansas Superman isn't about being cool or trying to be cool Superman is about two people in love Superman is about being human Superman doesn't need fixing he doesn't need to be deconstructed we do we shouldn't be afraid of watching a cheesy rooftop date in the fact that Studios think we are is genuinely disturbing we aren't sick of Superman we are sick of the super Superman's greatest strength isn't being super it's being a loving man put the [ __ ] man back in Superman [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] yo it's epic celebrity Lord chenna here on the microphone and this superpower video by Alex is pretty sick you should watch my Superman video if it's out and if it isn't what watch my Uncle Ben one because wait this is the end this isn't the big Alex you piece of [ __ ] nobody
