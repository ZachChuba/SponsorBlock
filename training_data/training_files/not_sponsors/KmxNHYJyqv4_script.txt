[Music] how hard is it to sell Kirby look at him look how cute he is it should be the easiest thing in the world to sell a cute puff ball like Kirby but apparently not I'm sorry Kirby commercials shouldn't be that hard in concept if you're trying to sell Kirby for example just show Kirby and play cute Kirby music however it's apparently impossible to sell cute video game characters on TV without making it an absolute nightmare and you know what Kirby our sweet little baby got it worst of all so today let's check out some awful weird and creepy commercials starring our favorite little nightmare so let's begin I'm sorry you have to see this I'm sorry we completely compared to superheroes super guy well I'm sorry dashing superhero guy or whatever your name is you're not you're not Kirby so you lose in some ways Kirby lost I don't know what Kirby you're looking at but Kirby is a super thick boy full of the muscly muscles he is a real man's man you could also tell this is very early Kirby because he's white that's that sounded more racist than I wanted it to Oh Ruby's gone all Kirby's got is appetites and the ability to give the suck to someone and dangle their body oh my god yeah kids you wanna play Kirby's Adventure it's all about human mangling see the glorious Dream Land groovy and he had some means to fight it's for the kids now back to more commercials so play games ago and some play games ago hmm okay well what year did this come on again 1993 great you know what that means we've reached the 90s the time of loud noises and funny faces pinball video game called Kirby's pinball oh your eyes Kirby it's not you that's not you you're better than that place cover your eyes Kirby it'll be over soon get Nintendo's new Kirby's pinball and for Game Boy and will that you all go what our friends friends are there to pick you up when your friends are there to rearrange someone's face when they're acting like my friends are there for you to intrude a bar and beat up all of the patrons simply for existing and if that's not what friends are for then why do we even have friends friends are a hamper efficient friends are a hamster a fish and an owl if that's the criteria I guess I guess I've never really had friends but you know what I could have told you that this kid this kid is really freaking out right now about Kirby this isn't is this real is this a commercial or is this like an actual investigation about some kid what he did he made me my friend avalanche whoa now this this isn't even a commercial for Kirby this is literally some kids this is some psycho kid who is who is admitting that he killed his friend and buried him alive what have you done this is real this kid is like I swear I buried my friend alive but I didn't do it the pink puffball told me to do it I would never do something terrible he's a cutie the guy listen this kid needs some serious help I have never seen Kirby invoke that level of fear in anybody into the chain reaction puzzle game for dry kirby's dream course it's psycho golf and 3d only for super nes it's gonna be okay guy well we'll catch him mobile cat we'll put him in jail look he's right here he look he's harmless and those cops what a bunch of dicks like they're just there toying with them they're like oh hey hey get a load of this kid he's afraid of marshmallows and you want a marshmallow kid with the screaming why no rational tease lately tmk also emergency room perfect setting for a kirby commercial emk blue monkey kirby thank you keep your fetishes away from me you you're allowed to be whatever you're into but when it comes to putting it on TV and putting it in my Kirby commercial no no no that's that's where I draw the line keep your inflation away from me get too much of a good thing long term too much Kirby someone better check on aunt dude maybe he's been inflated got him into observation dad just throw him in there just just toss them in there with the other kids we don't have a cure yet there's no known cure for tnk so just throw them all in this room they'll settle it out eventually Oh - your sister panel hmm don't like that very much don't like lunch lady pop and kids with a needle to get Kirby out of it buddy is a retriever [Applause] Kirby Kirby is just Kirby Kirby shoots missiles out of his mouth blows the house up it happened say please adopt also you know no offense to any cat people out there but Kirby with a missile in his mouth is still less dangerous than just having a cat loved Mad Max if you can't beat him eat him chew up the competition with Kirby as he gets across 20 gut-busting race courses Kirby's air ride one of the most colorful and vibrant and lively racing games that Nintendo has ever made so to make a commercial let's put it in the colorless desert brilliant you say I say I'm gonna stop you right there this is one that I really remember watching and seeing a lot on TV Kirby and the finger of touchiness on my television every day [Music] the sunlight I understand that the DES is all about touching the screen but why we did what was the style it's not a thing yet I actually don't know I never had a D s an original D s back in 2006 I was still playing on my gameboy color so maybe there was no stylus and the only way to play this game was with your finger but that's no excuse to have a giant finger walking around with Kirby having their romantic ship [Music] now you can use your finger to keep Kirby on the right path who shifts this is their fan artists I bet you there's fan art of this I bet you that I'm gonna look it up we're looking this up right now let's check this out let's type in Kirby I found something but it's very inappropriate and not something I'm allowed to show anywhere actually so let's just move on and forget that I talked about this let's say you come across on evil tree hello evil tree whispy woods is not exactly what I'd call an evil tree he is a tree that stands there and blows wind so I mean it's not really evil unless you got hair by yourself you're in trouble that is not what I want to see you know when cute little Kirby is lighting a tree on fire and beating it up that's one thing I don't want to see a bunch of human snot-nosed brats turn over this tree who is defenseless against himself this is nature PETA is their nature PETA I throw Kirby I should have done that I'm sorry I'm sorry Kirby mmm it's okay now it's okay and those were just some creepy Kirby commercials some weird Kirby commercials some commercials featuring Kirby that make you think what in the [ __ ] were they thinking exactly I don't know I had a terrible time I got scared but at least I got to have my big Kirby and at the end of the day what more do you need in life so thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed what was your favorite Kirby commercial and yeah I don't have much else to say here this is really comfortable actually I think I might fall asleep like this see you later [Music] you
