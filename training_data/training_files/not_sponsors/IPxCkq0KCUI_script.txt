[The photographer is working hard today, as always]
- OMG! Me too
- Stand over here. Sorry! My hands are shaky. Why am I so crammed in here though? Move a little bit... [The photographer is trying to get the right angle] How is it? It's still too bright. I guess it's not that pretty? If it was pretty she already would've said 'It's so pretty.' So cold... Ah, it worked. - Is it pretty?
- Yeah. You sound soulless. Try harder! Try harder! Ah wait. Try harder. - Is it not good enough?
- No. [The photographer's standards are high] I want to hear you saying that I'm pretty. I think it's better to take it closer. Right. It looks too white when I take it from far away. I wanna try taking a picture too. One person at a time! Line up! - How do I look?
- Pretty! - Was I this pretty too?
- Yeah. [Soulless answer] Hey! I'll take a picture for you. - No!
- Okay. - I'm not gonna do it.
- Let's try taking the picture again. [SINB's photography session is over]
It's ready.
