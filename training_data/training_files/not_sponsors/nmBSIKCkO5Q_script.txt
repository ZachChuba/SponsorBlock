all right Zach yep rate that name one out of ten noida mm-hmm oh it's looking bad well I like look I like it so far but then I think of the noid and I think the noid and how a disastrous he is and how violent he is it always horrible it makes you sick policies it makes me so I do it ah exactly so therefore I take it from a possible 43 out of 43 43 million billion possible popcorn bags down to 41 43 trillion of my bags of that make sense so should we just turn this off and not bother yeah all right with friends Laurie children welcome to Noida zack has not played this me this is a great game this is the best game it is it's really hot at the moment ya know and it's it's got like practically a hundred like it gets got over 95 percent on Steam I think right now all the right Tomatoes the steam the screen sharing we fix that you where I need some a vertical sync uhm a vertical change so look Zack this is the game you're this little purple okay yeah wander into the woods I've never gone this way what the [ __ ] you can go left I've never gone left before no no sometimes there's like a little treat maybe every time there's a randomly generated your phone off okay you're the last Mimzy so you have ones right now we've got two ones I've got a blue one or there or there evildoers in these ports yeah it's like a dungeon kind of a game oh my god oh it's bad it's [ __ ] bad you lost half your health getting that laughs oh my god the sacrifice of one's self to the pursuit what the [ __ ] well knows that you just like unlocked a boss did i okay let's try to get out of here look this yes the bomb wand it's a little warm thing it's a little warm spirit go away worm maybe you can hit it with the bomb no I'm never gonna get out of here tomar this is a really good first this is the worst first gameplay even though you could go left I've never tried honest and you spit ups with yellow stuff see in that that's it now I'm dead that's the regular regular old timey burp if that's true that wider why are there little broad pieces are the yellow disgusting see this is how every game starts off you go into the cave and now we're in the cave this is sort of a standard game one other word is that some line cards you can kick it what are these glowing that's just the tutorial yeah it's just telling you what the controls are so now this is the game we're in the we're in the cave world the mines gonna zap those little those little Oh your four-legged things are these actually don't know I call them little golems but they don't really look like golem the kind of hairy little golems so yeah this is the first level it's just the mine area and there's like gold and there's like yeah there's effect it like every pixel is like simulated physics so there's like like you notice how it creates smoke and the smoke gathers near the top yeah you got destructible environments like worms and I always like that in the game I don't blow something up take pieces into something this is one of most satisfying games ever played now I maybe there is the objective but what's the objective of this game just keep going down yes it's one of those games where just each level introduces like new enemies and environments that it's just but but but the the actual layouts different every time you play and it's all procedural yes see Julie generator absolutely it's great it's kind of scary oh oh look there's one down there and I'm stuck that guys like we buried in gunpowder yeah I don't even want to [ __ ] bother so this is the whole point whenever you see a shiny shine like that that means there's a wand that's what you're looking to get yeah you can have up to four oh one so now I got a new one now I can oh look it's fire it's a flame one well it's a guy I think it's a flame torch it's just yeah so he could later add more spells to it but right now all it really is is a torch can i light stuff like that I bet you can go up to like something flammable like you might need like yeah gunpowder you just stand under it oh he's got he's got a little flask of water so he just splashed himself with water to put himself out isn't that cool what's that you'd be careful around gunpowder with that thing I don't think this is dirt I think you're right that it's just dirt and then there's blood and there's water so you know I got blood and water on me what does blood due till tomorrow on when it's on you yeah I actually don't know like you were you have a theory that it makes certain enemies angry if you have blood on you that's just what I assumed about to do but I actually don't know [Music] look Justin I know I've never read up on it Oh treasure whoo that's a big treasure chest gold here I'm gonna [ __ ] you for just putting a bomb right here blowing down right below I can I'm nothing oh and there's gold light and fire yeah burn the [ __ ] eyeball stupid eyeball he's gonna die probably he's gonna he's gonna take you with him look he's leaking green oh there he go give me my gold your greed made you fall into fire oh yeah and when he's got oh [ __ ] see if he had water on his on his clothes it would he wouldn't have caught fire oh look at all this gold Omar nice you got 200 already under some gold right here 100 bombs we do with gold what is that what does that let you do so at the end of this level there's gonna be a store that you can spend Oh what there's another new one what does this one do it's not another torch it's another torch does it fire nope look he's got a floppy cape yep and that's pretty much the whole game he's got a floppy game yes so it's left trigger is that is both jump and fly it's the same button oh [ __ ] basically holding it just makes you keep going up until you run out of seats see those meters in the top right Zack first ones obviously health the second one is like your jump power so you can shoot up until that runs out it's like your jet pack basically and then the third one is what is the third one oh that's just mana which your standard thing doesn't really spend very quickly but some of the more powerful spells will drain that really fast and you wait for it to recharge what are the rules don't fly around like if you healthy flare up for as long as that orange bar has something in it you can fly oh I see and it recharges as soon as you stop using it yeah the first level is kind of mostly about just getting gold so you can spend it at the store now we're not gonna be any gold limit references we made a pass to the beginning oh there's one right there what is yeah yeah I want that oh and look all this gold right here I'm gonna get all this [ __ ] right no come back bomb look at all that [ __ ] gold oh I see so it's also built into the ground yeah blown out of the [ __ ] earth yeah sometimes get stuck in it it's kind of [ __ ] well this closer certain things can coax it out okay I don't need two torches whoo that's a bomb - is it yeah that's like some cake it's glitter bomb what whoa it's not as strong as a real bomb but yeah that's the glitter bomb so those three else wait wait oh my we can go mining with this now just get a bunch of gold we could try there's guy what a good guy there's a big shotgun a big big did you see that big big big big eyeball boy it was a big he's you think glitter bombs on that car didn't ya if she did you blues [ __ ] rocks get blast that guy directly with the bombs oh oh he's it going up and down he's [ __ ] whoa no he's still living he's making a little babies [ __ ] look at all and they're all dropping toxic sludge he died yeah he tried I think he's dropping acid oh is that straight acid yeah that hurts you way faster look at the gas go on fire I [ __ ] love this number powder game did you ever see that no it was it was a browser kind of a thing it just had different particles like this but they this is like they made a game out of it so cool Oh different is it to do particle effects off or something like this would take a flat 2d platformer version I honestly think it's pretty complicated a game like this no no no like each pixel like has its own like material in physics I I have a feeling this was coated from scratch but I could be wrong maybe this was game maker oh [ __ ] though or some or unity or some other Connell this was made go animate dude this sucks okay [ __ ] no just go for it go for the [ __ ] exit done for the exit you still have 20 now you have 20 health you'll make you odo odo oh god get in the water what was wrong it was poison he was poisoned the water will rinse off fire and acid and stuff she's look we can buy stuff now though I so this is stuff you can put on your wand and get by like everything if you wanted I wish you could buy multiple flowers there's 15 fireball scatter spell circle of this placement circle of stillness I personally do circle of stillness make everything around you freeze or something what does that do it's right we got lots of money rain cloud then we got all sorts of stuff so these are the ones that we picked up 16 do this rocks revenge explosion pick more love or boomerang what's more love me I don't know the thing things like me more yeah I don't know if it's worth it what's revenge exploit I want to blow myself up yeah that sounds dangerous boomerang spells also totally yeah boomerang spells could be weird these are all [ __ ] I'll just do more love I guess creatures in the world are more friendly toward each other what why would I want to do that yeah do they do the little Lea little David's usually attack each other yeah think they can do look at kill the rat so now they're less likely to definitely not beneficial to the player I'm just trying to get oh my god no I was trying to get the gold out with the beautiful gold right beneath you yeah okay this this isn't very this is a random direction it shoots it I think that's part of its split feature should I try to get that one you get the damn log you could but it'll be easier with the real bomb I'll control ball oh good so much okay wait so which one of these sucks that's that's a variant on the glitter bomb it looks like that's awesome okay we're I don't think we wait does this break through no no I think it's just for killing people okay so Zach what do you think I'm just thinking about what a funny YouTube reviewer would say about this and I would say maybe he looks like you know something could be on his ass when he flies right since this is queef yeah it isn't weeping up at a big tornado oh no a little bat don't worry you he's more scared of you than you are of him like spring water at my own face let's spray spray you should shoot them with a big fireball that's a t-shirt you buy at a hot tub you buy it at Venice Beach do you love those like boys shirts oh the ones are the ones that have like like thug tweetybird yeah I love all that [ __ ] I want to have a kilometer Wardrobe full of those shirts why's Tweety Bird like this weird like [ __ ] icon have you guys seen the one that says go ahead call the police I'll have sex with them yes can everyone go girl why is Tweety Bird a cup I call it enough the word so it's auto-filling probably how many search results do you think it would take for that to be the case for Google to when you type is why is Tweety Bird and in Google autocorrect auto fills with a comm icon yeah I got him [ __ ] you you killed a little baby one oh my god you finally took out the big one finally that's gonna mean how's that mean it's clearly like like a valid use of time to use the word finally always dead see that go chase him down get his gold go oh my god is so much gold well these guys you have go oh there it is you're pretty much all enemies drop gold yeah also bean and water is very valuable so means you won't light on fire if you go over it see Emma I'm 66% 78% whoa you got sick what do up you throw your W belly you just do that I think was there something else mixed in hey that's good maybe it was dirty water maybe have a chance buddy belly inside this swimming pool what is throwing up dude I don't think that so they may have just been acid mixed in with the water that is hurting you what would we went with the three of us went to Waterworld the dome are with the lazy river threw up on his belly he got kicked out that's what I do is what I do this guy's my friend I said anybody anybody that crazy that was really nice Tomer oh no I was there so many of these [ __ ] guys oh my god drop him in the acid drop him in the acid in da sea [ __ ] that's a fun like my music spell yeah the music's like really like scary but it suits oh my god I'm [ __ ] just keep throwing show shooting a billion bombs I know but you keep running into more [ __ ] that's the scary part God did yeah this is bad look always bad he's loved it as doing that no now I'm boys and now I'm gonna fire this is [ __ ] scary just get out of here just go down go down I haven't been yet well you might get trash you gotta keep going you got mean look you gave them the slip know that they aggro for [ __ ] ever they'll chase you all over yeah but you gave them the slip okay if you say so buttercup oh wait like this is the end [ __ ] you I'm not afraid Oh BOMs material let's do armor [ __ ] it I'm gonna try this really quick okay so we're on the 3rd and oh wow that's more rapid than the default what are those should buy any of these I mean I feel like I've used those before and they're there they're definitely stronger than the normal blast but they've got less range okay I'm just gonna go another one [ __ ] it just [ __ ] you Toby look worth the ice world where rats roam free just like in the real ice world I would have still messed with some more wand stuff but [ __ ] it you got sniped [ __ ] bastards should go further whatever the [ __ ] that is just a bite out of that you want to take a barn over oh that is so [ __ ] cool well that's right you added fire tier at all sittin oh no wait okay so those done all fire at once no it cycles through them all right I'm going to shoot a normal one I think no it's definitely bigger it is yeah all right I'm gonna replace this one don't even know what the [ __ ] that is oh it makes poison I don't even want that [ __ ] that tumor what is the worst poison you've ever injected Oh what's the worst poison I've ever injected yeah [ __ ] that would be the evil substance known as marijuana this pure poison the worst Ito's ever adjusted it beyond the marijuana is the marijuana propaganda he constantly spouts to his friends and family so star always goes into Heather's though there's actually there's no harm to her at all it's actually good for you in every way what the [ __ ] what about you just made to rain clothes [ __ ] I'm dead body state but at

of those spells are okay see I say you take the split thing from the one at the bottom and add it to your try adding that to your your note your your standard one the third one okay just try shooting it I hate ya it's like would you p fu that's true
