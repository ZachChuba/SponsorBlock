I don't think I've ever personally owned a toaster toasters take up valuable counter space they produce unreliable results the slots don't typically accommodate thick bread and bread always just tastes better when it's grilled over open flame or pan-fried in a buttered skillet now as good as avocado toast is for an emergency breakfast especially when topped with Maldon salt citrus zest chili flake and black sesame they look expensive all my money is on ricotta toast catching on with the generation tired of reinforcing stereotypes ricotta is incredibly easy to make at home and even if you go with store-bought you can use it to dress a piece of bread up into something that would sell for $12 just as easily as avocado toast without being slaved to the narrow window of ripeness that a gator pear makes you nail every single time on a slice of toast cut on a bias smear on a thin layer of lemon curd swoosh in some ricotta and finish it with any edible flowers like squash blossoms basil blooms or cilantro flowers as with all fancy finger foods finish with a flourish of flaky salt like Maldon edible flowers might only be available if you've got a garden out back so if this is not an option try out this one peel open a bag of chopped dates and sprinkle them all over ricotta toasts followed by shelled pistachios for a striking black contrast against your white canvas finish with black sesame seeds again salt the cherry season is in session whip up a cherry salsa by mixing half two cherries and slivered scallion greens with a basic vinaigrette made out of lemon juice olive oil salt and pepper this on ricotta toast in conclusion full fat ricotta is the Neo avocado that our fancy toasts deserve are you with me before I go this is not an ad they did
