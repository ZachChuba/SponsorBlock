okay so this monitor has appeared in like four videos I think at this point on our channel so you probably know how amazing it's got a whole laundry list of features some of which you might actually care a lot about like a 4k resolution screen 144 Hertz depending on how you interpret that refresh rate and I mean it's got some other stuff that you might not care about HDR g-sync professional-grade color accuracy and of course what-have-you RGB lighting oh and of course right it costs 2000 freaking dollars but what if you could take away the extra RGB cherries on top and just get the stuff that you really care about the 4k and the high refresh rate this my friends is the wasabi mango which yes is really what it's called thank you Korea this is their UHD 430 it's a 43 inch 120 hertz 4k display for over $500 less than this one over here your GPU and radiator check it out today at the link below [Music] so the wasabi mango UHD 430 believe it or not was actually the first commercially available monitor to take full advantage of the DisplayPort 1.4 spec which means that over a single cable it has enough bandwidth for the displays 3840 by 2160 resolution at a hundred and twenty Hertz without any chroma subsampling so no it's not a hundred and forty-four Hertz but depending do you ask neither is this one by the way you should check out the full review for this thing here it is it is pretty freakin amazing so you might be wondering if the UHD 430 came out first why is this review only coming out now that's because this thing is only available for purchase in South Korea but now thanks to enterprising exporters you can actually get your very own in North America on eBay for $1400 with free international shipping that is a full six hundred dollars cheaper than the Asus and Acer offerings hold on a second is 43 inches it does have DisplayPort but it's this thing just a TV with DisplayPort is it even any good for gaming uh yeah that is like this thing might kind of look like a TV like look at this look at this stand here and everything you might even kind of like smell like a TV but it feels it games like a gaming monitor I mean we consistently saw impressively low input lag and even the response times feel great considering that this is an IPS panel like there's barely any motion blur to be seen on it now of course going for a budget option can I call a $1400 monitor budget I mean first there is no variable refresh rate technology no desync no free sync even and since 4k games take a lot of pepper to run well you're likely to be in the 40 to 60 FPS range when you're playing triple-a titles even if you're running a gtx 980ti or a titan v like this machine is actually and that's the exact frame rate range where the most dramatic effects a variable refresh rate can be seen with that said your mileage may vary depending on the games you play and even how much you notice or care about tearing or stuttering and that sort of thing also there is a chance that the UHD 430 will get a free sync support in the future via a firmware update that's actually the method that wasabi mango used to upgrade their UHD 420 way back in 2015 compromise number the next is the HDR that yes there it is so it's on the box and they claim it supports HDR but this is one of those HDR int kind of displays where it only reaches 400 nits peak brightness true HDR really demands a minimum of a thousand its peak brightness and while we're at it we should know that you can't get 120 Hertz 10 bit color and HDR turned on all at the same time you actually need to turn the refresh rate down to 98 Hertz to really experience HDR otherwise the bit-depth gets downgraded to 8-bit which I mean on the subject of bit depths and color accuracy well the AU Optronics panel that is in the Asus PG 27 UQ and the Acer X 27 is a quantum dot panel giving it very accurate color over a wide gamut this one well let's just say it has good coverage of the sRGB color space I mean it is H IPs after all but then it has what we would describe as Bork all as far as DCI p3 coverage goes and colors that are definitely not accurate enough for any serious photo editors out there let alone four five I wouldn't edit a picture I took on my phone on this thing quite frankly looking at it side-by-side with a real monitor finally and if you're into that sort of thing there's no RGB or glowing lights or anything like that but at least the chassis actually isn't half-bad it does have like a brush to anodized aluminum face even if the bezels aren't super skinny it's got a base amount compatible back so you can put it on an arm if your are wall mount if you're into that sort of thing and it's got side accessible IO with two DisplayPort 1.4 ports three HDMI 2.0 ports and a Toslink optical audio jack which you might actually use since the included speakers while definitely appreciated don't sound great and aren't even loud enough for monitor use let alone TV use so should you buy this monitor I mean I guess if you've got a powerful enough rig to actually take advantage of 4k 120 Hertz and at least some of your favorite games and you really want to be an early adopter then the five to six hundred ish dollar price difference makes it easier to justify not to mention that it is 16 inches bigger to boot though that does mean that the pixel density drops from a hundred and sixty-three pixels per inch on this guy to about a hundred and four on this one so you won't be sitting that close anyway at least that is unless you are playing one of those visual novels that I definitely don't about ting is the mobile carrier that new phone at Linus dot ting dot-com we're gonna have that linked below so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it was awesome get subscribed hit the like button or maybe check out the link to where to buy the stuff we featured okay in the video description also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join now if you'll excuse me that was the wrong alt tab that's more like it
