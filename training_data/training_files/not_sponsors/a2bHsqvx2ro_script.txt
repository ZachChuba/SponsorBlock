do you enjoy killing people by accident have you ever dreamed about getting launched into orbit at 30% damage how about Porsche leaving your opponents until they leave the game if you answered yes then mr. Game & Watch might just be only humane but if that doesn't sound like something for you you could always just pick fire emblem and stand there like an absolute degenerate but why push yeah just move them a little bit closer so mr. Game & Watch let's start with his weaknesses but rather is weakness because he only has one and that is being light very light so light that it ganondorf's nice is in your general direction you're dead but then again he's made out of paper what did you expect all his moves except for one have some sort of use but in this video I'm gonna go over the most important ones mr. Game & Watch has the fastest up special in the entire game but its strength doesn't lie on it's not backer damage instead it lies in the emotional trauma that we inflict on your opponent's every time the as much is breathed on your shield [Music] this move also makes you practically impossible to Edgar Wow and if you enjoy the occasional online tournaments sudden death should no longer be a problem next up we have the up smash also known as the violence the thing about this move is that when you release it you become completely invincible why it doesn't matter the only thing you need to know about this move is that you can charge it at any point during your game and one of two things will happen one they wake it out and try to punish it afterwards only to be finally told to take a seat because and lag isn't real - they challenge it with an attack and get outright heated into space before the game was released his fourth smash used to inflict racism but then soccer I said from here genius at changing but even after the nerf it's a pretty solid attack and last but not least we have the only attack in Super Smash ultimate that will make a snake man take his finger of the Bieber depending on what you collect in your brackets the damage you deal could be anywhere from annoying to instant death what this means is that whenever you fight any character retro relies on projectiles they now actually have to play the game essentially mr. Gannon watch is a character that excels at being an if you main him your friends will hate you but in the end it's worth it because forcing potatoes on a ganondorf until he dies is probably the most satisfying thing I've ever done in a video game anyways thanks for watching normally I would make this video longer but my sponsor said they will sue me if I didn't post this video today so until next time have a good one [Music] [Applause] [Music]
