hello audience dr. Lindsey doe here today sexplanations video is a little different it's a spider-man vlog sponsored by the playful and adventures online sex store adamandeve.com hi We Need to Talk I was getting ready for a class trip to Europe and a big opportunity to ask MJ out when my Aunt May insisted I packed my suit and then she told me that I might get this feeling that something's off which she called my Peter tingle and if I didn't have my suit I wouldn't be able to protect myself or others I get it may pack the suit you were totally right but do you have to call my heightened spider sensitivity a Peter tingle aside from Peter being my name it's also euphemism for penis so Peter tingle sounds like a start of an erection and that's not what it's like actually it's really similar to an erection Edith can you help me explain Peter tingle okay Peter Peter tingle both your sense of danger and arousal are run by the autonomic nervous system which you might know from bio class as responsible for body functions like digestion breathing heart rate dilation of the pupils sexual arousal and the fight-or-flight response can you project an illustration yes Peter autonomic nervous system when you get a tingle in your groin this is usually activated by the parasympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system the body at ease taking care of biological processes feed digest breed rest your spider reflex is the sympathetic part that reacts fight flight free this is why I get hard when I'm relaxed not in this suit banner would definitely give me a modesty cloth if I got a boner in this suit sorry continue if you touch your penis or pleasurably rub it on something the pudendal nerves in the perineal region carry the message to s 2 s 3 and s 4 spinal nerves that's the tingle s 2 3 4 big the penis big leg 4 then pelvic splenic nerves transmit an erection agenda to the pre Artic nerves which go to the prosthetic plexuses by the prostate to the penis ok to my spine and back out that's very similar to my spider leg sensitivity next Nick dick oxide is released from these parasympathetic nerves and endothelium causing cavernous smooth musculature to relax arteries in the penis to fill the cap horas que unos a-- and to a lesser extent spend the corpus Clan Joseph wool eateth simplify a stimulus sexual or otherwise sends a tingle to your nervous system that triggers the body to enlarge the blood vessels in the penis that filled the sponge like tissues with blood as they expand this creates pressure on the envelope around these tissues called the tunica albuginea and compresses nearby veins so that less blood flows out simply the nerves send a chemical message to increase blood flow in and decrease blood flow out where's my brain in all of this the nervous system vascular system muscular endocrine skeletal reproductive and respiratory systems all work together to transform a flaccid penis into an erection and a human into a hero your brain is the reception of stimulation the interpretation communication and organization of sensation the Peter tingles according to my tactical software when you and MJ kissed these areas of your brain lit up so much on the right side with the suit I can measure the po2 levels or partial pressure of oxygen in your penis you said that you hadn't gotten a tingle in it but flaccid your po2 is around 35 millimeters of mercury whereas an erection elevates your po2 to 90 millimeters of mercury whoa mr. stark put everything in the suit as for your skeletal system human beings do not have bones and their penises or clitoris is like many other placental animals for example the angle of an erection is determined by the size of the erectile tissue and how the ligaments and pubic bone attach I bet that applies to strap-on mechanics Peter even prior to the spider bite you experienced Peter tinkles the kind that shoot up your penis through your scrotum and your anus often resulting in an erection some tangles are psychogenic originating in your thoughts and fantasies others are reflexive genic reacting to touch your spider like intuition is similar many systems engaged it once you are aroused you're awake yeah I'm a stick with calling it a Peter tingle Edith another time we should talk about my web-shooters stay curious Peter a big thanks to Adam and Eve for it sent to the US or Canada so exciting give me the tingles man my minion
