[YERIN is taking pictures of the members]
I'm taking a picture of the back of your head, is that a heart? Oh hey! Your hair looks super red in this. Where's the focus? I should take a picture of just your head. [Focusing the camera on the top of her head]
Why are you taking a picture of my head? It's the easiest to get the focus. Oh, it got focused. Wow, you took off your hands right at that timing. Did I do a good job? Good job. Wow so pretty x2 It looks so pretty. Who should I take a picture of next? [The next model is YUJU!] Why is it not focusing? Try leaning more back. Oh, good good. Your doe eyes were perfect. - What is this?
- Look at how big and shiny they are! [Her photography skills got acknowledged]
Woah! This is crazy! Woah! You're so pretty x2 They're all best cuts. [Impressed at herself] First of all I think YUJU's round and shiny eyes look so pretty in the picture. - And...
- She calls everything weird 'pretty'! It really is. - Next up is SINB's eye
makeup.
- I second that. Also Isn't this so cute? This is so pretty. She's pretty when she's looking down. She's pretty when she's looking into the camera. She's pretty in any angle, Her whole body shot is even prettier. [Please stay tuned for more of YERIN's photography~!]
