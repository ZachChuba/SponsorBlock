more on that later hi I'm Griffin Johnson dear armchair historian today's video was the prussian army really as good is that one kid who wears a pickle hob to school thinks it was [Music] during the 18th century the Kingdom of Prussia became renowned for its almost a legendary military however as with anything in history there's often exaggeration and misinterpretation today we'll be examining whether the Prussian armies reputation as one of the most effective fighting forces in all of European history is well-deserved or merely the product of popular imagination [Music] to assist us in answering this question we will be examining three aspects of the Prussian Army structure tactics and military successes let's start with structure namely the Prussian command system under the leadership of Frederick William the first the soldier King Frederick's first course of action as King of Prussia was dismissing the majority of his court from the previous ruler and inviting numerous military reformers Frederick recognized that a large army needed competent officers and in 1716 he founded Prussia's first cadet school the cadet in house the cadet training program was open to only members of the Prussian nobility at the time also known as the Yonkers this meant that while Prussian leaders had adequate training their positions were not always earned with merit but with status officers are nothing without men to lead and so in 1733 Frederick William the first turned his attention by introducing the Canton conscription system in which Prussia was divided into small regions containing about five thousand households each every able-bodied male was added to a list of potential recruits and soon this meant that Prussia would have the fourth largest army in Europe while this allowed the Prussians to count themselves as one of the major military powers on the continent they still had not developed a reputation for discipline and tactical innovation still when compared to the armies of France and Austria where the service of enlisted men was voluntary and commissions were mostly purchased we can easily say that the Prussian system was remarkably efficient the next task of these soldier King was to make the Prussian army as disciplined and effective as possible there were three most visible innovations implemented under Frederick's rule we'll start with the first the iron ramrod the first question some of you may be asking is how could an iron ramrod increase battlefield efficiency the simple answer is that as opposed to the wooden ramrod the iron ramrod didn't break in battle something which otherwise would happen frequently as for the second innovation whereas other nations generally trained their men to fire a maximum of three rounds per minute Jews of frederick william's army were relentlessly drilled to fire up to six shots per minute which was an unheard-of number at the time and although this rate of fire was impossible to achieve during the chaos of battle and in fact could barely be achieved on the parade ground it didn't sure that the Prussians would be firing at a greater volume than their opponents even if it was only one shot long the third and most iconic innovation of the Prussian army was the goose-step a marching style that at first glance looks comical but to be highly advantageous on the 18th and 19th century battlefield introduced by the great reformer Prince Leopold of unhaul Dessau in the 1740s it was intended to keep soldiers marching at the same pace in battle making it easier for commanders to maneuver and maintain control of their armies by contrast the marching orders of other European armies made their formations liable to dissolve in combat Prussian military innovations didn't stop there and the cavalry arm of the Prussian army excelled in its role as a shock force it was noted for its aggressiveness as can be seen with the deaths head or totin cop huh Tsar's considering all of these points it is apparent that the Prussian army excelled in its use of tactics the development of tactics means nothing unless they can be implemented correctly on the battlefield a skill which requires a great general for the Prussians theirs would be the successor of the soldier King none other than frederick the great frederick inherited in the words of tim Blanding author of frederick the great king of prussia a large well-equipped and well-trained army a loyal nobility accustomed to serve and efficient administration and a budget large enough to allow a war to be waged without additional taxation or loans Frederick personally commanded the army at many battles and for our purposes we'll be examining his three greatest victories corn Friedberg rose Bach and lutein the latter two of these battles contain examples of the Prussians using the advanced tactics we've previously discussed while the former can be used to demonstrate the efficacy of the Prussian cavalry the Battle of Houghton Friedberg fought during the 2nd Silesian war against Austria was Frederick's first major victory and the moniker which we still use when referring to him today during this confrontation a force of around fifty nine thousand Prussians defeated a combined Ostrow sub out sixty three thousand men the battle is mostly remembered for its conclusion in which a single Regiment of Prussian heavy cavalry rounded most of the enemy's lines capturing over two thousand prisoners six months after this decisive victory the Prussians and Austrians signed a peace treaty that ensured Prussia would have control of Silesia the next great victory was the Battle of RoSPA fought during the Seven Years War this battle only lasted an hour and a half and more notably it was won by a Prussian force of 22,000 against an Ostrow French force of 42,000 Frederick was able to execute a series of complex maneuvers that required his troops to march in total unison with one another something achieved with the iconic new step Frederick was then able to outflank his enemies using a tactic known as oblique order applying pressure with well-disciplined volleys on the enemy's flank and crushing them with a final cavalry charge the final great victory we will mention today occurred exactly one month after the Battle of RoSPA near the Silesian village of Luton employing many of the same tactics that he used in the previous battle Frederick's army of 33,000 decisively defeated an austrian force yet again the battle is notable for featuring one of the greatest displays of Prussian discipline in the entire Seven Years War in which two lines of Prussian grenadiers is marched perfectly spaced against the Austrians the outcome of the battle ensured that Austria would be unable to participate in the rest of the Seven Years War thereby securing Prussian victory we can then conclude from these battles that Frederick the great reputation is well deserved however it should be understood that Frederick's military reforms were not perfect in particular artillery was the branch of the Prussian military that was never used to its full potential Frederick did recognize this later on in his military career and was one of the first leaders to adopt horse artillery but the cultivation of Prussian artillery would be overshadowed later on by a young Corsican lieutenant after the death of Frederick in 1786 his army began to mine into decadence and mediocrity for the remainder of the century the shock of the Prussian defeat at llena in 1806 at the hands of Napoleon inspired the military establishment to undertake a series of comprehensive reforms under the leadership of General Gerhard von Scharnhorst the Prussian army opened the officer corps to the middle class which by 1830 allowed Prussia to again become a formidable military power further reforms to strategy and doctrine occurred under the renowned Helmut von Moltke who emphasized initiative and rapid movement all of these reforms allow the Prussians to crush the Danes in 1864 the Austrians in 1866 and the French in 1870 which paved way for German unification in 1871 in order to get 20% off of their annual premium subscription thanks for watching
