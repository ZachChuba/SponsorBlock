what's going on folks ted from nerd immersion here and we're continuing the nerd immersions guide to everything series where today we'll be talking about squeezing in fifth edition dungeons and dragons you can thank michael cullen over on twitter for suggesting this topic there's not a lot to go over as far as squeezing goes in 5e but it's something i don't think i've ever used and i don't see come up very often so maybe this will be a highlight for it for folks who are unaware and maybe it'll lead to us expanding on it in a future video for sponsoring this video let's move on to squeezing in 5e so it's in the combat section of the player's handbook i believe it's also found in the basic rules for 5e so you're going to be scrolling down here and you're going to get into the size area right this is where it's going to allow you to move through people's spaces and there's basically just this one little paragraph which seems kind of silly to me that it's only one little thing but let's take a look at it right so squeezing into a smaller space a creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it thus a large creature can squeeze through a passage that is only five feet wide while squeezing through space a creature must spend uh one extra movement for every foot it takes and has disadvantage on attack rolls and dexterity saving throws attacks against a creature that ha uh attacks against that creature have advantage when it's in a smaller space so basically this is something that i don't think ever comes up and it's something that i'm kind of curious about myself right so if we're looking at a battle grid and not to say you're using a grid for your combat but humor me here right it is a large creature is two by two right on a grid right a medium creature is one square large is two by two well if you've designed a dungeon with a five foot long hallway and i've done this and you know uh well you can't fit your horse your mount or the enemy can't fit through this five-foot hallway that's it well i guess you're gonna stay in the five-foot hallway where you're safe and just barrage them with ranged attacks or so on or you can't bring your horse into the dungeon kind of a thing well technically you can right squeezing says that if they're a large creature they can move through a five foot wide hallway they just it says that one foot of extra movement which is basically how we handle almost difficult terrain although it's not so if something in that hallway is difficult terrain it would double the effect right because this is squeezing makes you reduce so you're gonna use basically double movement to move so if it's you wanna move five feet it's going to use 10 feet of your movement if it's difficult to rain that'll be doubled again um and you have disadvantage on attack rolls and dexterity saving throws but also creatures attacking that creature have advantage so this means like the paladin or whoever has a mount a horse you can essentially force your mount to squeeze into this five foot long hallway and make its way through the dungeon if you want another common thing would be the door right a five foot door they can make it through they're gonna have disadvantage on attack roles and deck saves and enemies are gonna have advantage on it but that might not be a bad thing right i mean the amount of times that someone who plays paladins pretty frequently with them being my favorite class that i haven't been able to take my fine steed or find greater steed mount with me into a dungeon is significant right i i haven't been able to do that because the dm says well it's only five foot wide hallways you can't do that actually i can i i mean there's detriments to it sure and good luck trying to get back out right if you have the horse coming in behind you the war horse coming down the hallway and you need to backtrack real fast well now you gotta deal with getting your you can't basically maneuver through each other to get through there you have the horse blocking up the whole thing so that might be a problem for you but that's a thing you could do but it also works the other way for enemies the parties can't like if you're fighting an ogre in a big room with a five-foot hallway one thing that i feel like a lot of people don't think about is how did the ogre get into the five-foot or into the big room through the five-foot hallway well it probably had to come in or your party is gonna be searching everywhere for the hidden 10-foot wide room or hallway or secret door that allowed the ogre to get into that room when really it could have just been uncomfortable sure but squeezing through the hallway to get into this bigger room and they might say well we'll just we'll just backtrack into the hallway and then it can't get us well it can it's gonna be difficult and yeah i could definitely see some interesting cinematic moments of something you know you see it in movies and tv all the time where there's like the big creatures like trying to claw through the hallway and try to make its way in chasing people and they're like backing up and it's climbing down obviously if this would say something like a dragon this could be even worse because if it's heads in the hallway the breath weapon still works down the hallway even if it's just the head but it says you got to remember that it's scaled like that so a creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than this so you got to scale this up too right so a huge creature that would be 15 by 15 and a grid could fit into a large size design one and then it scales all the way up so your gargantuan dragon could fit i guess through a huge size hallway so if you think about put that in perspective for you right a gargantuan dragon could fit in a hallway that's designed to fit a regular giant they just have to squeeze through so it's something i don't see come up too often like i said or at all i know i personally haven't used it but i think it could really add some interesting dynamics to combat that we just haven't seen before by forcing these larger creatures into smaller spaces or again like i said the pulling the the pony or the horse through the dungeon even though they couldn't normally fit but again if the room opens up if you're pulling your your war horse through the dungeon at half speed but then the next room you get into opens up into a large cavern well then now you've got your mount in that room and you're good to go so i don't know i'm curious what your thoughts are have you used squeezing in 5v and your games at all again i know things like oozes and stuff and there's i think there's certain uh classes that have the ability to squeeze without using the extra movement i think the original kobolds back in three five that was sort of a mechanic that they had uh they could squeeze through spaces with no detriments just because of the nature of how cobalts were i also think that would be an interesting concept to start implementing on different races certain kinds of races like let's say uh a more smaller race like maybe uh but i guess that's something else i didn't even think of a small race like a gnome or a halfling could squeeze into a space that's designed for a tiny creature right because that's that goes small and then tiny they could squeeze through a space designed for a tiny creature though again with half movement which is something i don't think that's ever considered either they could really fit through a very small space just albeit with with detriments but that would be an interesting racial feature to add to something where they're able to squeeze through a space smaller than them with no negative side effects of any kind uh i don't know what you would call that it probably i imagine it would be some sort of ability in the same vein as like powerful build how it's you are it's sort of a standard language that you can just apply to a race where you count as one large size larger for carrying capacity maybe you call it slight maybe that that sounds actually pretty good maybe i might have pulled that from an old edition and just stuck in my brain but like slight build this you know this character this race you can move through some one size smaller than you like in an area designed for one size smaller than you without squeezing and then that would then force people to go look up the squeezing mechanic which would draw more light to it which might get it more use so i actually really like that so i think i might try to design some race or give this ability where it allows you to do that and i'm curious what you think let me know your thoughts in the comments down below would you like to see squeezing appear more in your 5v games are you going to use it more or maybe you've been using it the whole time and i'm in the minority on that so thank you again to skillshare for sponsoring the video again there'll be a link in the description that you can click for the first thousand of my subscribers who want to sign up for the
