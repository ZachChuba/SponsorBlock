okay so here's the thing watching movies on the BFG D is pretty cool it's HDR 1000 it can run it any refresh rate so no matter what frame rate your contents running at it's perfect with no judder or anything like that but it's got a fundamental flaw it's only available in a mere 65 diagonal inches so at risk of becoming you know that guy today's video is gonna be about this upgrade we are going to be getting ah the best of all worlds by upgrading to a 120 inch projector screen and at the same time we're gonna be installing a sound system you guys thought this cool that's great with this sub I sincerely hope we don't end up with any noise complaints and use off the code tech tips 20 to save 20% at the link below [Music] okay so Riley I don't know how you got roped into this but no either here's the plan for today basically it's twofold we're not actually ditching the TV we still need that 4k 120 Hertz gaming goodness yep but we're gonna take this projector screen and put it in front of the TV because that's how projectors work so if you want to watch no no no the projector goes way over here and it fires that but if you want to watch a movie you use the projector and if you want to play a game the projector and then we're doing a five point one point two yeah clips dolby atmos blah blah blah sounds set up this I can't believe this thing it looks like a weapon it's the r11 5sw uh-huh which means w4 sub woofer one one five four fifteen inch the more you know we won't even need a side table what if you put anything on it it's just gonna fall off from all the the sick webs do we have to unbox this should we call lure that's only if we have too much unboxing and we're feeling sick so I haven't had a Clips audio setup since my pro media ultra five point one's long story but they were given to me by a previous girlfriend and current girlfriend didn't like me hanging on to them now that's a speaker this bad boy will get you at least 55 watts this is ridiculous yeah and they fit perfectly how much is this setup they sent over oh no I think the two bookshelf slash monitors are like 800 bucks just for those two wow this is a little bigger right that's what you say so the cool thing about Dolby Atmos is that instead of the movie studio having someone go in and manually code like you know the helicopter moving from here to here and what the mix is between the left and the right and the rear channels and whatever else every object that makes sound is instead just given an exact position in 3d space and then your dolby atmos receiver which we already have from our last upgrade here is going to use however many speakers you have and wherever they are to best approximate the original intent of the movie producer so these are not as good as if we had more upper channels and more surround channels but this already seemed pretty over-the-top so we can't really fit anything behind yeah - Linus look they go these aren't that dissimilar from an actual like an actual weapon like your your tongue yeah yeah yeah well you wouldn't use it like that that's for sure you've taken you've taken martial arts haven't you I had kind of imagined just like like just like a rollable kind of like like a vinyl blind you know yeah so then you reached out to East Porter's audio and video and asked them for like a $700 still tab tension but like just a regular cheap screen I was like we don't need nothing crazy right and then they responded with this a hundred and twenty inch elumen 4k reference studio tab tensioned crazy screen it's got these little metal tabs that run down the side and a big metal string I'm assuming and a weight on the bottom and it keeps the screen really flat and so in ten years hopefully it still will be perfect how was a projector screen 4k o 4k there's the big thing apparently it's just cuz the fibers are really fine as opposed to some projector screens so they won't show any grit at all it's got the finest fibers you've ever seen okay I've never seen fibers this fine I haven't seen any kind of fibers danger Wow must read that's a circle does a circle but a suicide a square why the kids tech channel now that's a good idea let's see this bracket is called an L bracket like the letter have many LMG employees does it take to mount a laser pointer do put it in wow that's gonna be really big yeah and you want it bigger hey yep you're all over the place thank you get a hold of yourself go drunk you're home oh man they include drywall anchors please nobody nobody install this with drywall anchors it's only like 30 pounds tell me a story all about how my life got twisted upside down and I'd like to take a minute to tell you about it cuz it's a crazy story so take a seat I don't think that's how that goes my hook is on the wrong way here wow it does not look straight at all really I mean we laser leveled it didn't we yeah hey we don't have enough clearance ooh yep that that camera or the the Wi-Fi antenna okay it looks like a camera all right just I'm just gonna take it out for now this is utter madness so the projector we're using is actually a rescue from a previous project where we mounted it to the front of my car that was really that was really weird anyway this is a more appropriate use for this thing this is view sonics kind of budget 4k projector cuz it's not really native 4k uses pixel shift technology and we know that it's super bright it's 3,500 lumens so we're gonna go ahead we're gonna use this puppy and I put not to a fans in it oh yeah it was a little loud out of the box but check out this upgrade BAM I found the only projector rounds I could get that was long enough to fit underneath that light okay I'm gonna put the screen back down so we can at least kind of like sanity check the numbers before we start drilling so I guess flip it upside down first right are you gonna hold it upside down oh you will did you flip it already oh nice so if we know it's just can you go to the left a bit [Music] you're in an awkward position having to hold me I was trying not to leave a mark on your shoulder [Music] Brian would have done it like that but like wait how are you planning to screw this in exactly it goes that's straight enough right sure yeah yep for the record I wanted to make it beefier than this decoration where speak for wiring you making another one of your little checklists you have this ones on cardboard so I guess we should start with the first one projector HDMI I was thinking maybe we use one of those spare wires and like tape it to it and just pull that wire down yeah the question is how do we figure out which wire is which did Brian label them maybe he did oh yeah they're labeled Wow what a champ oh boy oh boy sends the 12 feet that are in the wall oh boy ah can I have the tape that wasn't a great throw do you think he stapled these to the wall you have got to be kidding me he wouldn't he did why we we have no we have no way of doing this sir this is a super long HDMI so let's see if we're gonna have enough to go like maybe over and up or something why don't we start with figuring out exactly how long it needs to be yeah we would need to add so much to you over there we need like a second one of these cables okay here Jake if I can make this shot through that cross beam then we don't have to move a lot oh my god yeah I just explodes all in my face great plan what's up safety that would be very safe okay I made myself a better projectile this time oh no no I have an idea it's fine hold on did you do it it's sort of I need a stick a very expensive one hey ten of ten so while Deeks getting power for the projector screen sorted out I am getting our Universal projector mount attached to the bottom of the projectors [Music] nom-nom-nom-nom-nom [Music] [Music] [Music] guess the label was correct so for our speaker runs we're using these little aftermarket plugs called banana plugs and there's no performance reason to do it it's more of just a convenience thing if you ever have to unplug and replug things all right well it looks like crap oh yeah look it's not the perfect length of wire okay this is actually really looks like it needs to go up not that bad though okay so there that's up a few inches I'm actually getting pretty close to being ready to call it good ah so is this basically like the plan no they're supposed to go down in this weaker standard oh all right well that is better I need to do the length first though so just leave that where it is so all that's left then is the sub dose of the web master 5000 katsu so yeah we just need that RCA cable over here then in power oh that worked it's definitely on now moved some air by the way here the gain is at 11 by the way I love that it goes minimum to 11 [Laughter] okay so it's working feel like that seems bad so what we're doing right now is we're it's not perfect but we're doing like a calibration the receiver is going to listen to the speaker positions and then adjust the delays this might be a little loud yet the remote Wow that is so different holy oh the babe it's a little overpowering maybe 11 wasn't the right choice yeah maybe 11 could be a so we got the dolby access app loaded up we got Atmos turned on so you can tell from the indicator up here we did have to make one small adjustment where we had to set our receiver to output audio only to the speakers not to the speakers and the TV that's fine we got that sorted out so now over watch hey let's watch that we should check out check out some of these demos so what you guys are seeing right now is with filming lights still on with them off it's actually pretty darn impressive and shockingly we actually managed to get the position of the projector pretty much bang on we're gonna need some light though just so we can see what the crap we're doing so cinematic experience pretty damn good I am absolutely blown away by this projector actually yeah once we have it in a light controlled environment that is not bad this screen I think costs more than that projector but I mean the screen is a big part of what makes a projector sound good right so I'm not gonna say like movie theater experience but like we're getting there definitely getting there we're close yeah we'll be we'll be going with that what is this are they trying to have a story in Mortal Kombat but it shut up it isn't it not it is not how do I stop stop it you're so mean good Annie Jake I mean obviously we're still gonna game on The BFG Dee whenever possible but really not bad so I guess that pretty much wraps up the movie watching experience upgrade we satisfied I'm pretty satisfied this is freaking awesome I'm like blown away the one thing I can think of that we need to do is bring the seats up a little bit and then we could probably be convinced to upgrade the projector at some point you know 8k you know whatever maybe if the operator I think the input delay on that we came along but man this is freaking unreal I'm getting a little bit of DLP rainbow effect but it's certainly finally noticed I've seen personally far from the worst I've seen and these speakers are unbelievable yeah you know now don't wait so thanks for watching guys and a massive shout out to clips for providing these speakers and east porter's audio and video these porters audio and video who hooked us up with the projector screen this is absolutely unreal we've already got people poking their heads in asking us is there going to be like a sign up so that like we can reserve the space for movie night or Fight Night or whatever so it's freaking awesome while you guys are down there in the video description you can check out where to buy stuff we featured as well as our link to our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum cool
