all right lads welcome back to my channel if you are new here my name is Tom Hulk and I do not have an intro but after reading this literary stillborn I do have the desire to remove my own eyes if talking [ __ ] about Lele pons is considered beating a dead horse allow me to be the one who finally sends her to the glue factory before I start today's video if you're not subscribed consider doing so I want a million subscribers because I deserve it if you're not quite sure who Lele pons is I've made a video on her in the past so make sure to check that out but essentially she is one a latina - an Instagram comedian who is also a Latina 3 the Internet's favorite punching bag within good reason not because she's latina but she is just in case you forgot latina after posting vines Lele made her way to YouTube and music and all of that is pretty [ __ ] however her final insult when my senses Leigh Leigh's final solution surviving high school a novel by Lele pons and no ghost writer but Lele pons starring Lele pons the Latina perfectly captures Lele pons infectious and genuine personality oh wow what a crazy an incredible review I wonder who left that AOL hahahahaha in this funny fresh and lovable novel vine superstar Lele pons teams up with number one New York Times bestselling author melissa dela cruz to bring her fans a rollicking ride through the high school years Layla's novel retails for $11.99 under vine star with more than eleven million followers honestly this book is exactly what you think it is going to be a pile of absolute wine on it so I read a lot of books I've read a lot of books in my time I'm an avid reader I'm a literary giant however I have never read something more full of [ __ ] in my whole entire life I read this book twice this weekend I listened to the audiobook twice because I wanted to make sure that I wasn't missing any details see the first time I read the book I wasn't quite sure what the plot was actually about or it I thought I miss the whole entire point the book I didn't des turns out there isn't one it's it's literally 250 pages of [ __ ] I'm so sorry trees whoever did this to you I am so so this was a tree this was actually a tree this is something that gave us life and that helped us out in a lot of ways this is going to drive people to suicide with how [ __ ] dull it is there are two benefits this book has given to the world one stroke in Lele pons massive [ __ ] ego Pooh any writer out there who was thinking hmm I'm a bit [ __ ] like I'm never going to get published if this if this can make this if this can make its well into bookshelves you can do anything I could take a [ __ ] I just spat in this piece of paper yeah this is more literary meaning than this ever will ever will in the grand scheme of things I may have put 20 quid in Lele pons is bag camp however I am extremely happy with the audiobook because Lele pons reads the prologue so instead of me describing what this book should be about let's listen to this batty [ __ ] talk about who the [ __ ] lying through words on your weakness I absolutely couldn't [ __ ] town give me a clue Lele honestly please inform me about how terrible your word I have [ __ ] poster notes [ __ ] shut the [ __ ] up Lele you know what you're doing you knew this is torture Lele honestly I have never met a girl that wants to fist herself so entirely and so hard underneath the heading of every single chapter is the amount of followers that she has you see this chapter one zero followers I'm just a lonely girl from Caracas I don't know anything about the Internet sixty pages in Chapter ten parents idea of cool what's that underneath it Oh crikey looks like a follower count up today chapter xxviii four million two sheets every chapter the beginning of chapter one as I said late I think she's the most special quirky different girl in the world first thing you need to know about me is that I wasn't always that gorgeous sexy cool breezy blonde do you know today I know I know it's shocking no I hear you disagreeing Lele has always been perfect well you're right I have always been perfect but that's another story for another time no it's not that's and that the story of you being perfect is and I know what you're thinking it's a novel don't take it so personally this isn't Lele okay well the main characters could Lele pons that the parents are named after her parents and it can any references under the drop Josh Peck do you guys want a Josh Peck reference she needs Josh Peck in this book so it sounds like he's a real version of her life however Lele describes us this is a novel and the character Lele pons is based on the real Lele pons but it's not her exactly and the stories in this book were inspired by Leila's life and her vines but this story is made up this is not a memoir it is a fiction of why am i speaking up marina Joyce it is a fictional memoir if such a thing can exist why not so this book was sold on the premise of it being about a young girls first year at a public high school ooh Lele is a cool quirky and wacky latina will she survive will this spunky spirit survive her first year at Miami hi I would have minded I would have minded if this book was just like a Mean Girls parody s book where is that oh yeah I'm quirky and I'm different and I'm from a different country I don't speak the language and I don't know if I'm gonna fit in oh love interest oh I go from the loser to the big blossoming so I would have minded that because you kind of anticipate a certain level of cheesy [ __ ] when it comes stupid YouTube books however this I'm gonna read some direct quotes out don't worry I'm gonna go through some of the characters and the plot points in the plot hole we started this video so if you like that kind of [ __ ] stick around even though I have been filming for an hour so you've probably stuck around for a bit where do I begin I don't want to begin I don't know with any book to say for example the Bible I start with starts with zero followers and she said nobody knows me and nobody trusts my Shero Lily pons has rewrote the Bible is there gonna be a religion I hope there's a [ __ ] religion instead of Sundays going to church we just jump in the pool and talk about how much of a lip line that we are you walk in there's someone on the organ playing gasoline there by daddy yankee I'm a convert so this book is sold of the premise that the plot is I'm Lily pons and I'm a quirky Caracas girl from Venezuela and I'm here to tell you that I'm new at Miami hi will I survived my first year I would have minded the plot if it was like that by the way they had been [ __ ] and boring but I would have minded it because at least there was a beginning middle and end and there was like a narrative for me to follow maybe some fun and interesting characters for me to relate to this book has nothing to do with surviving high school in any instance yeah she may be in a high school in the whole the start of the book maybe her moving to a new high school but it's not about her her conquering her internal fears or maybe finding a love interest getting some best friends and struggling with her grades but overcoming it because you know I'm gonna be duckling and now I'm a caracas swan it's none of that it's it's it's about Lele pons and her rise to stardom and everyone else kind of dealing with her being a [ __ ] if this book wanted to be honest the back of it would say Lele pons slowly rises to fame whilst attending a school will this spunky Caracas Venezuela and princess ever shut the [ __ ] up about how many followers she has spoiler alert she's Chacon every chapter starts with how many followers she has there's a few other characters in this book such as Darcy he was Leila's best friend kind of even though lady [ __ ] hates her looks every other line in this book is like oh yeah you look so pretty Darcy in the next line is Darcy's an absolute [ __ ] they have a weird relationship and every time Lele mentions Darcy is talking about how she's the only african-american at the school this is how Lele describes her and Darcy meeting the bell rings and I've never been so excited to get back to class I know it's a kind looking african-american girl walking back on campus with impeccably braided hair and indisputably nerdy glasses this book is full of potholes from literally chapter 1 to chapter 1 day 1 of Miami hi zero followers look three pages in it talks about how she starts vine and how it's such a magical experience for her and how she started mine and her old school and she has a thousand followers from there so you just you chat and [ __ ] from the word go this book is 50 chapters long day one starts on chapter one with her first day at Miami high which obviously she gets bullied at in and the most nonsensical way ever in first period English a boy with spiky blue hair throws a crumpled ball of paper that bounces off my head during second period world history a kid with a backward baseball cap calls out hey why do you talk so weird when I explained to him that I have a Venezuelan accent he calls back I don't know it sounds like you just don't know how to talk so that is just that is that is one of the opening paragraphs so there's a lot to digest just in this one segment a kid with blue spiky hair even though in two pages times some girl bullies Lele because she's dressed a bit outlandish Lee and we keep it pretty simple around here doesn't seem like it if this lads got blue spiky [ __ ] hair - - who the heck no no one gets paper balls thrown at them for no reason Lily Lily you're clearly an [ __ ] number number three is she ever gonna not mention the fact that she's Venezuelan or latina in a sentence in third period calculus a redheaded girl with glasses approaches me to say everyone here dresses kind of more subtle just so you know for tomorrow I don't you're thinking mm-hmm maybe as a reader I should be feeling sorry for Lena she's getting bullied on her first day no I'm not gonna feel sorry for Layla she is an absolute unlikable [ __ ] a whole entire thing there was in fact there's no characters that I like I've already discussed Darcy her best friend let's talk about the love interest his name is alexey al e xbi this is how Lele describes meeting Alexia a miracle in first period English mr. Contreras presents us with Alexi Copa transfer student there's really only one way to say this Alexi is hot blue eyes blonde hair push playfully off his brilliant four brilliant forehead okay absolutely define behind his white t-shirt he's James Dean for the modern school girl throughout the whole entire book you would have thought he would have any redeeming quality within being the love interest maybe he's super friendly and considerate and kind and Knight no he's an absolute [ __ ] the first couple of pages are just about her struggling to find somewhere to eat at lunch and oh maybe I won't have any friends but it's okay I'm laying there pawns I'm one of a kind and that's why people don't like me every situation that could be in any way interpreted as a negative towards Lele she seems to flip it around as to something where she's the most special person in the world and that's why things are going wrong for her like I said the conversations in this book are just so unrealistic let me tell you about some dialog between Leigh Leigh and their parents so Leigh Leigh comes downstairs on day two not wearing something as obnoxious as a white t-shirt and black trousers you look lovely mum says filling my glass with orange juice I liked her outfit yesterday dad interjects rather uselessly it was creative unique I hope you're not going to let this new-school squash your individuality well if it does squash my individuality it will be your fault as you are the one who sent me there they give each other the famous look that says well that's our Lele and that's the end of that she couldn't just go downstairs and go to school it has to be some kind of social commentary about how excellent Lele pons is and how she's as true to herself hmm she's never gonna change a news flash if you're a [ __ ] change fundamentally shift your ideologies and your belief if you are well if you're Lele pons but if also if you are so specifically for Lele pons we have the best friend and the love interest but with any good book you need to have an enemy you need to have an arch-nemesis and this comes in the form of given borrow why do they always have to have the full name when it's the baddie so is hmm that's Regina George hmm that's your van borrow if Lele at the beginning of the school year went from mmm shy duckling ah people aren't gonna like me I'm just quiet and I'm different I'm from a different country I'm I'm from Caracas and she starts getting like oh I'm I'm more popular now people are accepting me for my flaws and maybe I can accept them too I kind of understand it and I would kind I would hate it as much as I [ __ ] despise this book but the only development is oh I have no followers and I start [ __ ] high school I end high school and I have [ __ ] loads of followers and people like me because I'm famous and I don't give a [ __ ] about grades you think I need a [ __ ] education there is the there are terrible messages in this book the whole point of the book is lele convincing everyone that she shouldn't care about school because being an internet celebrity is more important there's this one part where she birth she burn she sets it on fire so her best friend Darcy gets an A in a test Laila gets a D or an e or she [ __ ] fails the test so Darcy turns around like ooh I got an A Laila is like ooh I got a D and I'm just gonna read it you where's this well where is it of course Darcy who is sitting next and he gets an A why is this girl got to be so smart all the time I bet she even barely studied school just comes naturally to her I want to be proud of her but I'm just jealous like like well done for being self-aware but like you're a [ __ ] what did you get she asks D - oh I got a yes Darcy I can see that you're literally holding up in my face she laughs and I laugh and she laughs and I laugh all the while I'm hot this is where it gets crazy all the while I'm holding the lighter up to her test she doesn't notice until it captures fire in the smell of burning paper fills the room and then to carry on the absurdity when she gets sent to the principal office she starts talking about how much she's faked crying and oh I'm gonna make her feel bad for me I'm famous I don't need any of this you're not gonna suspend me I'm famous there's this one part let me have a little look mrs. Lombardo the principal reasonably says the Lele after she'd [ __ ] set piece of paper on fire for no reason hmm do you think you can just do whatever you want because you're a little bit famous I mean I honestly want to know what you were thinking that's a pretty reasonable thing for a principal to learn around and say to us actual [ __ ] student Lele says my first instinct is to tell her that I'm not a little bit famous I'm almost a lot famous at this point closing in a billion loops view shut up no one can nobody give us a [ __ ] so after showing absolutely no character development in the principal's office Lele finds Darcy and you would have thought that she would turn around and be like you know what I'm so sorry I'm a dick I'm a bit of a date kind of let things go with them ahead and she kind of does she kind of pulls me in there and makes me think I'm gonna like her let me read you this so this is Darcy Lele are you out of your goddamn mind you could have hurt someone and now I can't even show my parents how well I did on that quiz Lele replies with each yes that is really hard and I am sorry like you can't even feign sincerity I tried to genuinely care that her parents will never see the results of this one particular pop quiz look I figured you'd be mad and I would be too if I were you what I did was really selfish when you've got an A I took it as a sign of my own incompetence but your success isn't about me it's about you I realize that now and I'm happy for you this could very easily be a defining moment in the book Lele could get humbled by a friend Darcy could turn around and be like well you've been a prick recently like you are a dick just too so there's one like hyperaware character in his whole entire novel I would have given this five stars up [ __ ] five stars however because Lele pons made this book this is how it continues this is that this is what turns this book into a fan fiction that Lele pons decided was a good [ __ ] idea Darcy responds and you excel at what you do you have over five million followers on vine do you know how rare that is you're a performer and median and you're doing astronomically well you're reaching more people than I ever will with my good grades Darcy is so right but to be nice I say that's not true mmm you're gonna become a scientist and cure AIDS probably burn the libraries any library that has this in it burn it because all the other books have been [ __ ] tainted this is masturbation in literary form when she first meets her enemy of that it's because she's in the gym changing rooms and she's taking off her t-shirt and she's got an old sweaty brow on oh god the horror let me read you this segment can you go I think my grandma has the same bra that never happened so Leigh Leigh and yevette have a relationship where they bully each other but at one point they become friends and take a guess as to why they become friends and as outlined in this chapter can you can you read the heading there are you excited about what's to come up three signs that show a person is lying can she stop number one just in case you wanted to know an egg a pod reggaeton wasn't always first on the list but it's getting promoted ever since it identified your vet as latina and your Breton Lele become friends at one point in this book because they're both latina but you know how they both realize that the both latina nothing to do with the fact that her name is Lily pons and she has a clear apparently Venezuelan accent the reason she got bullied on day one if you remember the guy said why'd you talk funny and she's no rose cousin crackers no nothing to do with that it's because lay lays phone rings and her ringtone is gasolina gasolina and because of that you vet over in the vet yuvan I don't give a [ __ ] anymore did that the frenemy is over in the corner and she starts like popping it to the song and Lele it's like I'm not the only looking yeah you're looking at you know what I've actually been mostly Baris about honestly and truly reading this book over the weekend I've been thinking to myself if I get hit by a bus whilst listening to this audio book the last thing that people are gonna think that I was voluntarily listening to was Lele pons surviving high school I've been walking around reading this with like all the books in front of so three signs that this person is latina reggaeton so as long as you listen to reggaeton you're basically latina number two the telenovela slap the tenor la vella is a distinguished art form in which there tneows act out over-the-top situations and exaggerate every syllable for the sake of our entertainment number three loud cursing latino guys and girls are more well let's say self expressive than your average person so basically this part of the book is Lele is awkward and unapproachable and she really wants to go out of a Lexie but she doesn't know how to approach it because he's so like cotton dreamy and he's a big German boy big blue eyes and blond hair just say you want to [ __ ] me Lele it's getting embarrassing at this point this middle part is oh I'm getting popular now so everyone wants me everyone wants to [ __ ] me everyone loves me and everyone thinks I'm great and Alexi is now my boyfriend it's this end part this how do I describe the end of this book you know what I'm gonna do I might just end the video right here because that's essentially what this cock-blocking piece-of-shit book did to me can you see the pressure I was going to give this to my local charity shop but I don't actually want to do them disservice we've given him a piece of [ __ ] there's this one part where Lily gets splashed by a car at a party like in every film [ __ ] ever and she's aware and I'm so sad and miserable no one loves me no one's gonna like me and people are gonna think I'm an even bigger loser than I am [ __ ] yes boiler alert but listen to listen to this listen to how self-serving and how much of a [ __ ] wank off this sentences who you vet Oh shrieks Lele looks like a sewer rat yes I say I got splashed I don't look cute whatever you bet what's your problem with me Thunder dialog [ __ ] but I am it's okay as possible this is it my problem with you is that you're a freak and you don't belong here I don't like when girls like you come around thinking you're special and can just be whoever is this the police coming to take me away I deserve to be taken away I spent my own hard-earned [ __ ] money on this I should have no legal competence let me continue my problem with you is that you're a freak and you don't belong here I don't like when girls like you come around thinking you're special and can just be whoever you want to be but I can be whoever I want to be that doesn't mean I'm special that means I'm human anybody can be whoever they want to be it's just that not everyone realizes it listen to how it Aleksey sticks up for her she's not a freak Alexi says she's cool and so what she's a little weird that's what makes us so incredible those aren't conversations at 16 year-olds have she's super cool and credible and quirky and that's what makes her so incredible shut the [ __ ] up shut the shut up at the beginning of the book she describes herself as lele 1.0 and then throughout she's like oh now I'm advancing to lele 2.0 time for me to start wearing mascara oh I've got my braces off I'm Lily 2.5 until it all comes crashing down on her Leigh Leigh and her best friend Alexi split up towards the end of the book after a tumultuous relationship that reading involved in fuchal but their relationship and the dynamic between them two there was exact same when they were friends compared to when they were boyfriend and girlfriend the only difference is Leigh Leigh kept talking about her tits a lot more Leigh Leigh's a little bit heartbroken but she tries to be mature and this is right at the end of the book where I'm actually thinking yes come through darling please give us some kind of development let me like you I have not liked you for a single page let me like you towards the end absolutely not she has to share my hopes and dreams isn't she like she doesn't every other aspect to cement the fact that Leigh Leigh hasn't learned anything throughout the whole entire book towards the end she meets Alexie's new girlfriend and she's called lila and this is how Leigh Leigh describes her I scan Lila from head to toe where the table cuts are off long blonde hair green eyes edgy leather jacket okay okay so she's a less cute version of me if I started this year as lele 1.0 she's Lele 0.5 but remember by now I am basically Lele 10-point oh especially with all the emotional growth I've done what emotional growth for you some as conceited as you do here than you do on page one but there's been no development you've made me hate you more how is that how can I hate you Leigh Leigh Kwan's ask yourself that you've made me hate you more how is that possible let me read you the Josh Peck scene where is it we're closing up towards the end of the book now Leigh Leigh's at a nickelodeon party hey are you Lele pons someone cause as I'm making my way back to the front door I turn around and guess who I see Josh Peck from Nickelodeon's Drake and Josh I'm so starstruck that I almost forget to be mad at him for mispronouncing my name almost actually I say it's Lele Drake you're ridiculous he seems impressed again she's talking about how to pronounce her name because it's a very personality trait instead of Josh Peck toast feature in the book maybe she wanted to drop a name in there that people might recognize that's all well and good she didn't even think of a unique and bizarre scenario in which Josh Peck is introduced this whole entire Park though oh it's pronounced Lele oh yeah well your name's Drake not Josh haha that's the joke that's a vine that's an actual whole entire vibe oh [ __ ] I can hear the sound effects in everything so the final scene of this book Leigh Leigh and Darcy are hanging out there's not an impactful scene in any way but it should nicely tie up the book give us a good moral message let me know exactly what they wanted to put cross so Leigh Leigh does Darcy's nails and just as she's finishing up she knocks her over and then when she knocks her over she goes flying she goes everywhere she's such a clumsy [ __ ] oh this is crazy this is wacky we have to turn this into a vine I say when your best friend is the clumsiest human alive dope she says do you think we can get it in six seconds let's find out every step each chapter ends with oh wow we should make this into a bar it tries to be so deep about buying I can't as someone who made vines like don't get me wrong yeah it was all well and good old fun the special place in everyone's heart and all that [ __ ] but it's not as deep as she makes her sound she goes on about how a vine is a happy place and it sounds stupid but I just want to shut off from the world and express myself and create my art she refers to vines as a art so many times so the final chapter of a book such as this really summarized the key messages and the points maybe any questions that the author wanted the reader to ponder throughout this whole experience let's see how this book is summarized not a lot can happen in six seconds there's not much you can do you can't write a song or read a book or pass the test or compete a manicure or clean your room you can't cook a meal or make a plan or learn to drive or write a letter or save the world but this year I've learned what you can do you can wake up become alive send a text take a shot make a friend and fall in love fall in place save a life make a change make a first impression get a second chance and most importantly you can tell a story I only need six seconds to tell a story and as long as I have that I know I'll be just fine that's not that that's not but you can't defend a book like that perfectly captures Lele pons infectious and genuine person that says who or says AOL a parent you didn't read this [ __ ] book a well come on AOL if you're still out there AOL if you are still a company look me in the eyes right now and tell me that you read that novel I could probably pull quotes from this book and talk about all day long but I have spent all weekend reading it and now all day talking about it so I just want to move to a [ __ ] but must want to move to a different country I want to move to a different country where I only move to Caracas despite my scathing review if you are gonna be the person to buy this online number one don't number two make sure you protect it if only I had a appreciate it and thank you to you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed it if you want me to review any more youtuber books feel free to let me know down below in the comments let me know down below in the comments if you disagree with any of my opinions I'm not claiming that I'm the best biggest book reviewer in the world but I do know [ __ ] when I see it this is a pile of [ __ ] thanks again for watching I love you guys I'll see you soon bye bye [Music] [Music]
