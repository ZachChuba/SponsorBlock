have the micron pens there's an assortment of different sizes over here we have some fabric Castle brush pens very good for black spots Steve and I are gonna be using the Statler 2 millimeter and inside it's gonna be the Statler Mars carbon 2h LED we also got a Stadler eraser right here the saagara electric eraser very good for small spots we got a sumo grip quickie eraser we have two blue Copic markers the oom vo5 we've got a lot of neutral grey Copic markers we've got red Copic markers for suit we've got our 14 our 24 our 27 and our 29 we also have two white pens for extra details and webbing a kneaded eraser one of my personal favorites got a left pointer for the pencils and for the steep get out of here and for the paper we have the strength more 400 PI comma cardboard so we're gonna start out by drawing the chest cavity you got first vivid dominance with your pencil field no you don't do okay so really the chest tech like the rib cage so we're gonna draw the rib cage shape it's like this everything is gonna be pretty simple for now until we get to the other parts now we're gonna draw the hips the hips just like a little underwear over here gonna jut out like this come down over here and then on the side it's gonna come back like this so we have the butt right here try your best to keep up you my viewers are great at art okay now the legs we're gonna spread it out a bit so Stan you kind of just want to get the bigger in place not really worried about proportions just yet we'll fix that in a little bit okay for Miles Morales he's gonna have a fairly big head what did that line which line yeah it's just the ribcage line oh there's the neck so we've got the head right here usually I just draw a rectangle to place it down got the hips you got the legs either oh and as we go on I'll actually help you out of it if you need any help now we'll just place the arms down so you really quickly want to just make cylindrical objects so this arm over here is gonna be like a cylinder this over here will be a cylinder but we're gonna place a little wedge right here I'm gonna draw a circle for the elbow guys right shoulder what's really flowing swoll okay which shoulder this one that's wait okay so this you actually want to make it go back a bit because she's leaning back so you can just use this erase this part and kind of come in like this you see what I mean the best his head place it back a little bit because okay O'Shea this is gonna be the spine you see that s for the spine right now your spine is over here so his head needs to what is that you're like I need something okay but at least needs to be somewhere around here okay wait now let's just check the proportions so this should be the same as over anything hold up yeah yeah just try to keep up keep up boy hey there's miles and for his knees just draw circles like that okay okay so far and then for here just draw a cylinder what's like a little hook over here so the top part of this form is gonna be a little bit bigger and then for his hands you can just draw a little blob just to mark everything down ya know what that make sure isn't this part of it so you want the hips to be out here a little bit more so he's kind of leaning back now we're gonna start placing the pecs down a little bit do you want to do is you lighten up your entire figure a tiny bit so you guys can barely see that we're gonna go over with our second layer right now here just try we're gonna start placing the Anatomy so this is our basic underlying figure all right I need lighten it up okay I'll wait for you to lighten the bow for a second and just like enough all right and now we're gonna start drawing the pecs so for the pecs you want a line over here and it's gonna connect up right here so the pecs if you look at it straight on it's kind of like that and then the nipples are over here okay okay so start drawing well then you could go up don't kind of go down over here so you kind of want to make it curve around with the body so we'll just place the nipples right now right here for the heck of it so we know the placement and we'll start sketching in the side why do we need a given nipple I mean just for placement dude and then we're gonna start drawing you got a rib cage right here like a black dude overall yeah but we still need the anatomy we're gonna kind of just sketching his body over here and I do have that part down a little chunky dude and now we're gonna draw a line down the middle for the ABS down to his crotch and then all right well this looks like the underside of a snake this spider right yeah the shoulder is gonna be right here we're just placing everything right now and we're not gonna make him too muscular unless you want hey my one mind getting really buff already the muscle is getting the triceps over here triceps you see those triceps gonna be really really lean over here we're gonna want to place the forearm muscle the brachialis right here so the formless logos from here yet dry like everything ah yeah I draw every single muscle before I start and the shoulder you're gonna want to draw the gym all that talks about it's a striated shoulder it's fun to talk and I do just gonna place some lines for the floor muscles like that staircase oh it's just for the dynamic look for now okay I'm gonna show you how to draw the hand okay so first what you want to do is draw a square over here okay now what you want to do is do an extra triangle now you draw a circle at the end of the triangle you draw a thumb like that go in and draw a line down here kind of make the go down so that's gonna be a really basic with this okay so hands usually you don't hold it straight out like this it kind of goes in so we're gonna place it by making it go in this isn't the final hand so it doesn't look perfect yet but it's gonna look kind of like this and you want to draw a triangle over here for the muscle right here yeah not a huge gap between it's okay I'll help you Oh once we go along to the inking space so now what you want to do is the proportions based on how you want it to be yours looks a little bit unnatural cuz of how big the chest cavity but it's like honestly up to you what you want to make it look like I'm a natural yeah yeah let's do his head so what you want to do is draw an oval first please do but it's gonna be based on this little rectangle we did earlier draw a curve for the eye line and now we're just gonna sculpt in his face like what you would do for a sculpture by rowboat country whip up a sculpt in his jawline you have the back of the head a bit so you can start to see like an egg-shaped thing to develop to cure tumor then just make the next smaller depending on how you want your figure to look okay so mine I don't want him to buff too but if you want your your super buff you ready is a lot buffer than your a guy I feel yeah I'm gonna make the our fingers that's so weird I'm gonna make this part a little small I'm gonna give you a really low hanging lat all right let the bodybuilding enjoy like okay and for the other arm we're gonna do the tube again and I'm just gonna place his hand I think is really pecs I really uneven there yeah we're gonna do the hand later so just roughing the hand the best you can right now and then we'll get going from there so there's like a super rough hand right now I'm gonna erase the lower body a little bit yeah I'm Square to wrap yeah yeah and then the legs we're gonna make it pretty simple so let me give him the glutes right yeah so you just put like a little bump over here for the glutes go back here yeah but your pumpkin came and for the leg you're gonna want to draw two lines over here and then over here yeah over here draw a line like that so that's gonna be how the muscle goes so we're gonna draw one big muscle over here but if that's enough oh no that's a guideline so we're gonna have one muscle over here one muscle that comes down over here it's the guideline and one muscle that comes down there yeah and the knees are gonna be pretty basic so this comes out of it and end and after this the leg okay so I'm gonna draw a really really basic shape of the leg so the leg doesn't go like this straight down okay it goes like this comes back out and then like that that's how it like looks okay so I'm gonna push the knee in a little bit gonna make it come back out and then try and go for the cab and there's no equal I mean a dinkles then we'll put the Jordans here in a bit I think I'm actually gonna adjust this head a little bit more later like Alexa they're firemen unnatural for these bats are actually longer okay his legs are gonna be easy I'm gonna make you go like this put the knee right here and yeah just do something similar to that side and just gonna place the shoes here that foot was huge by these yeah cuz it's to the side how do you go and here's the guideline um just do like a triangle over here for now because we're gonna place Jordans there I think I'm actually gonna adjust the head a little bit cuz I don't exactly like it too much so for spider-man's head if it's looking straight on we usually go like this and then you have these right so if it's looking to the side we're gonna have it over here and then we'll see part of an eye so it depends on how you want to tilt it so I'm gonna have him looking down a bit I'm sprayed on all right but yeah it's up to you how you want your character to look and just mold your head a little bit this case I might actually make actually the shoulder size is pretty good whoa I don't like my in spider-man head so I'm gonna adjust it yeah so whenever you do these drawings you always want to keep adjusting until you're happy with how it looks actually think it's a little too [Music] oh I think the problem is with the neck I'm gonna have them look down a little bit more so actually if you want him to look down more you hide the neck a little more it's barely gonna be sing his neck hey how about you buck your guy looks so much buffer actually maybe I'll just have him whipped to the side for this one eye guy is angled a lot less than yours oh yeah that's true oh okay you raised the left bring it up a little bit like that okay not that big that big looks a little unnatural yeah he's a steroid you know miles morels is not a steroid user happy now okay um let me adjust the head so that I like I'm giving them B and AB you see that um I'm not I'm not quite happy with the head yet so for those of you guys that are watching usually I'll struggle with this part a little bit because I'm not always sure where I should place the head cuz you want it to look natural to you don't want it very unnatural looking my head neck off-center oh no I don't want me to fix it for you [Music] just feel like you're like mines looking a little bit better now you see I like it once I place the hide because if you guys don't like it you guys can always erase it and place it somewhere you like better okay let me adjust the eyes a little bit okay are you almost done with this step yeah I think I'm gonna be done soon - yeah you guys there's a lot of different ways you can draw his head but just do whatever you think looks coolest okay after I'm done and happy with my pose I'm gonna check to see yours and see this anything I've to fix what are you doing yeah I think I'm pretty happy with mine okay Sheree fixed ears a little bit there's nothing okay so so I'm gonna tell you what's wrong okay let's look what's lighting up this whole figure okay if you want it but I'll show you how to make him buff but look good at the same time right now so I'll go based on your guidelines so you got the text right here right I mean you drew it's slanted but you're gonna want to make this curved over here since we're looking slightly up at it okay you got this coming in that's good that's good you got that about this so that part you got down however this part you made it go straight down you're supposed to have some curvature so we'll make it go out over here bit zoom out of here I think he has glutes his arms this parts good this part you're gonna want a skinny here book here but if you make this part buff you're gonna want to make the forms buff in the hands bigger otherwise this light cloth have to be really tough I think he's right-handed yeah okay the hand is way too small do you see this it's supposed to be like that big oh my guess okay we're gonna fix the head placement a bit so I'm not gonna help you draw the head but I'll show you where to place the head head placement is gonna be over here so that it's centered right now yours is way off to the side so it looks like his head's Mon what is it okay the arms actually not bad over here and the legs you actually have down so that's not that actually you're gonna want to place this leg a little farther out so you see how if you draw a line down here he's not quite balanced more stuffs going to that size so for you who know one of my guys hips are way wider so you're gonna want to extend his speed out a little bit so he's more in stamps yeah except well look at this is so much bigger beautiful okay so do you think you're okay so now that we have this part down we're gonna start roughing in his costume I just thinking looks straight on okay let's weapon this costume so his costume pretty much his shoulders are gonna be covered in red my pencils in a bowl it should be fun this costume is gonna be pretty red and so you're gonna want to draw this triangle down here some kind of shoulders or something yeah yeah - right down here yeah and something like that actually this is a little high so just come from here okay got that like that yes something like that then draw a circle in the center so this is gonna be where the spider is despite a local race and then we'll draw a smaller circle inside it's gonna be the body of the spider and then we're just gonna place the legs real quick because we can go straight in with Penn Pokemon oh yeah it kind of says this so next up we're just gonna roughen the rest of his costume so it's gonna go with that see that weight this so it's not going all the way down it's just pointed down and over here we'll have wedding and see the Jordans we can fix a little bit later so so the Jordans will do at the end with photo reference so we have it really act right back photo reference oh okay are you ready to go in with ink yeah oh let's choose the pen I'm gonna start off with the 0.25 you can start off with the point 35 if you're not comfortable going in with crazy detail at first which ones like yeah yeah that should be good point three point 35 okay so we don't really need a light in those yours yeah okay okay oh let me show you how spider-man's eyes look real quick so you see how you drew yours here are yours versus mine you see how yours is like this it's just like this yeah when I make it so this place isn't as rounded and this place is more rounded see see the difference in Star Wars they had a character with vertical eyes like that that's weird sighs oh that's strange dude okay let's start with the eyes come on mmm wait were already starting there yeah should it be should mind be lower on his head no just looking straight on - looking down a bit God what happened okay now after this okay wasn't this black guys or something no way after this you want to put an extra ring around his eye bye guys eyes already so thick ring around it okay I have space - do you need me to help you yeah that will be the only hope okay so that part will be read later okay so now we're gonna just slowly but surely sketch in his face so people like me yeah you're doing it in pen dude alright right now but I guess I better make him look good at jeez dude why are you doing this to your own drawing okay hey hey hey we're working on the head right now I'm just driving it back yeah so kind of just go over your lines Oh cookie and make it kind of sketchy you don't exactly have to follow your line just think about where the line best fits even my guy that is near the end I'll see if I can salvage your character he's perfectly fine all right I just have been long beanie head all right you see that epic all right so after we get this part down salvaging did not work out just ignore the head okay now sure some techniques to fix it later so right now we have the neck over here mm-hm and now we're just gonna kind of go in and rough in his muscles okay actually let's finish up the head first so that's fine okay dude we didn't move on to the traps yet he doesn't have so for the head we're gonna draw a line down over here so just follow me and I draw a line down over here because there's gonna be a little bit of extra light come over here dude and then I don't know what's outline this boy way my guys head is completely different should I draw a line still yeah yeah cuz that's gonna be the extra light you see it's gonna turn out pretty nice we should I just make up your mind thing be symmetrical you know yeah just like a circle and it's not me see you don't want to draw the line over here cuz that line that light's gonna be casting so let me tell you guys real quick there's gonna be a light casting up from over here light casting over here so that's where the lights hitting you feel like you think you can make it slightly different because all shadows are gonna be a little bit different if you're trying to draw the exact same in this mind yes do that now we're gonna want to put an extra shadow down yes you know before I hate it in should it look like this yeah that's actually pretty good but it makes it more accurate oh yeah cute into everything yeah so there we go we're gonna do an extra line at the top or the little cast light all right you see that okay not bad not bad your clock is off by now yeah it is I was just too lazy to fix it okay that's really weird right now you got that shut it in okay if you're having trouble shading it in here's a thicker marker okay this goes by faster I like those weird line I don't know that's the neck all right just just try to do this well that's okay we'll fix later we'll fix some more later here at the end of the inking stage I will help fix yours a bit so now we want to do is want to start going in through the outline see all the outlines on the side so everything let me show you without inking up the page so if we have a line that goes over here since the lights coming from over here the bottom is gonna be thicker like that and there might've been advanced enough to care about this I mean it's gonna make it look a lot better so over here is gonna be bigger at the bottom and whiter at the top yeah and then all the connecting lines are gonna be slightly thicker like that yeah yeah that's actually really good nice I just try everything thin and picking it up later yeah you could do that too it straight up pain go yeah because I'm in the middle of a video I don't even know who that is you usually want to flatten this out at the all right you want to do that so just kind of driving that hander though drawn the hand a weight for me I'm gonna check your hand first so something like this it should have a long arm in this damn good yeah I think edges are really really long but it's okay I'm gonna make him long and lanky my bodybuilder habits go over here and then we're gonna oh it's not the crossing thing that goes down over here then let's actually shade in the hand first because it's a little thick to thin okay yeah here I'll shave the hand with you okay so first we're gonna do two things we're going to do the line on the outside so we always do lines on the outside because there's a little cast light from back here so you do a little line following the entire thing through and like that yeah pretty much and it might seem confusing right now but you'll see what I mean later that yeah and now we're just gonna start shadowing it in so you see the muscles you drew underneath and associating everything that turns away from the light and and leave a little bit of space over here for extra cast Floyd so you can always start out by drawing the little one see that so the bicep it flips underneath so this parts gonna be darker the shoulder and I have this over here should be pretty easy are you keeping up it'll be easier later okay and okay I'll show you for the shoulder you see the shoulder muscle like that right and there's a cylinder for the arm since this parts gonna be shouted in its gonna cast a shadow down the arm like that know what I mean do you know what I'm saying so you're gonna cast a shadow right there all right just like that you're balling this price should be pretty easy since you're just shading stuff in and you want to just shade in the little long winky muscles and so there's like little triangles everywhere okay that's actually pretty good on the arm okay do you see that on the form I just draw a random line yeah so let me show you real quick so you know how you what is that vertical eyelid oh forget it okay so you know how you do a ton of muscles like this right normally draw them oh but you did a ton of it going like that right so pretty much what you're gonna do is coming up your shading you're coming like that just a lot of random inter interlocking muscles like that to create the tiny little triangles here drink some water before we keep going all right nice okay now we're gonna go in with the bottom it's okay it's like wait darken up the undersides yeah actually we can do that way at the end so start drawing in the chest oh and let me take you through the the logo real quick so for the logo do this with me okay draw two little spider mouths over here show us spider leg over here and over here don't know this spider leg over here and over here you're gonna have two things coming down over here yep okay now connect the circle doesn't have to be a perfect circle cuz it's pretty messy in the animation - about that hey nice that does look like one okay now here's what we're gonna do there's an imaginary line okay there's an imaginary line so we go up so each like that you see it this and then for this one we go down over here so we don't connected yet and you got it you know my heart literally I like the little keep getting away in wonder lines really yeah like that and then afterwards you finish up the sir my that forget so my like okay well forget about that it was loosely an extra one your is it was a JA do I almost forgot about it over here and I missed it but it's not a super important part so don't worry about it actually this part needs to be lowered all right that's probably the hardest part honestly the logo the logo is really really hard okay okay I'll let you focus oh let me just put in some line weights while you're at that okay it's not too bad it's not too bad all right now start filling in the middle part the start doing the little chest picture me dickory dock my pest is really different direction a little bit over here I just not follow you home follow your guidelines and wherever your heart takes see this wrong already no no you're correct cuz this is the big Peck I mean you want yours to be a bodybuilder so so that's correct and that's the ribcage cuz the PEC can always get wider and bigger but the ribcage doesn't that's a bone okay now draw draw this in with me Shaw a line down here this is gonna be the lat and then there's gonna be something over here there's gonna be our guard line and then we're gonna go in and shade it oh oh sure so you actually draw that yeah and so what we want to do right now you can take a thicker pen if you want so start set out by drawing the line again so draw a line down the entire side and just do random striations and stuff but there's gonna be an entire line down the side and now since this parts gonna be casting a shadow here it's pretty much all gonna be black actually so I think this entire place I'm just gonna make black this upper side that's just a bit wider huh as if it wasn't wide enough to begin with there no fire no hunger then you cast a little shadow like that when we get us Steve don't jump ahead here talking I got a boy and the bottom of the ribcage we're gonna shade in this entire bottom of the ribcage [Music] I mean you have a thicker pen oh yeah and then now we're gonna finish up the test over here we're just gonna shake some yeah yeah that's good okay and now for the serratus what you actually want to do is draw a ton of shapes that look like that just put a little under way the size so I'm gonna be really stylized so you just start over here draw if you like that and what you want to focus on is the triangles at the bottom are always smaller than at the top so it slowly gets smaller and smaller as you reach the top let's do some banana I'm gonna yeah yeah like that you actually got it okay no back down I don't have any money I don't have to do that many like inches how many huh I hit some tumors okay you're astray don't look like vicious gave their scales cuz you didn't leave enough room in there so you want to spread it out a little bit more of God thank you another one good just leave it and we shaded it all the way up and then evening at it okay now we're gonna start shading in the pecs so they're like [ __ ] from getting boiled I guess Lister's yes yes there you old blisters for the chest this entire place is gonna be shadowed so don't shout out inside over here but this entire place is gonna be shadows so inside where watch what I do first so here so you see hum going around the spider logo yeah pack right now no not the whole peg so the part that turns away from the light so this part because our lights from up here that's right and then you want to do a few striations coming out of here too yeah yeah yeah like that and after that you want to add some shadows on top of here for the collarbone ready let me just show you this one really really fast thing okay this we can do right now so leave a little line over here do two lines over here and then just kind of go like yeah that's it that's his neck my neck is completely doing I'll show you what to do for your neck so yeah line over here and over here and then since casting over here this supports gonna be shadowed okay cool beans alright let me add some line weight right now while I wait for you to catch up a bit so my striations something things off no no that's good I mean it's gonna look weird for now cuz you don't have any color anything on there but just what's gonna beat that yeah coatings a lot faster that the other striations on the other side matches them so windy outside geez okay now we're gonna have the draw the other side of the suit yeah so you're barely gonna see him in you're gonna check the button no not for the I did not know that they now put the wine at the end and then line there and here's what we're gonna do now now we're gonna cast a shadow from the head okay so the head comes down over here my head is still different okay this entire place is gonna be cast in shadow you see that right here yeah this entire place finish our wooden yeah exactly well then I'm gonna share this portion in yeah it's really gonna be any light hitting there Michelle's just watching home before all right she she's kind of up close right now do you want to say hi put your head in here and say hi what is that scary okay you're ready to go I'm sorry YouTube are behind better than the way we do how do you shave the other here here I'll show you this will be a little hack and I'll just help you in the process okay okay so so I have this remember we drew the line over here going all the way and you draw a line going all the way down and since this this side of the PEC is gonna be shadowed in and draw that it's gonna be shadowed too - it's a cake seam you're gonna have a really cool piece does that look a little better now sure okay now we shadows okay now we're moving on to the ABS most of this portion can be chatted in see this place shadow in between the legs yeah pretty much pretty much everything down here is mostly gonna be shadowed so we're gonna draw a line first okay just to make sure the sides are gonna be showing so make sure you mark off your sides yeah I need so we got the sides right here so we'll drop in center right can't you see that yeah yeah you can always just do that another line on anything yeah dude it's so windy outside okay we don't back yeah yeah no way so what we're gonna do now is take your big pen and now we're gonna do the AB portion so I'm just part of the app just be very careful when you're using a big fun you see that though now we're gonna drop the second half underneath [Music] just such a weird dream yesterday and you appear denied we're getting busted late being woody okay okay and like that and an ant on any of it just just say you know what have you been doing the etching in my family did you think here yeah so just shade in the bottom part of the apps do some of the society portions right now and I'm just trying to circle I don't know yeah yeah actually you got it those are the upper abs just think you're drawing the to upper abs shoot wait my proportions are strange too okay my mind has an eight-pack cutting his hips to over this year this even right yeah yeah and okay so you're gonna want the upper abs over here showing a little bit of the amplification the time you get over here and that's it yeah that's tough to watch Conan the side first pull it in the site over here a tiny bit and now walk into this whole place this whole place is gonna be blacked out why do you have it a 2x event to show you that it's all getting blacked out so you black out the sides of 52 and this will be be just the huge cast shadow like I just made it a lot every here otherwise you have to draw everything in so if you're lazy just do more cash [Music] okay not bad not bad make sure you have this portion the extra shadow okay now let's just see the big Morehouse lockdown bigger than just to the crotch region is yeah that's good yeah it is but now it's slightly easier so use your pen again you might have looks rig unlike you I'm just shredding I think I use this right now get full main shape of the leg in following okay yeah and have the other way out over here near be a little bit more sketchy with the like as a good part of the leg is just gonna be shattered in we're gonna spend a lot of time on the off-white air jordans good okay why did you move on to the calves already go to that part yet okay let's draw a line down the side for the muscles just just draw a line down the side to make sure we don't che that in cuz later we're gonna do such a cool effect you're gonna see it and do like a spike over here because that's where the muscle goes up into the leg and something like that okay and same thing over here spike up go down and on that is a youth Bank oh no spike up where the line is do you see this line have a bottom oh you're supposed to hear it let me show you this is draw a line up here so you'll go down here so I go can go down so now I'm gonna quickly show you what the pencil which parts gonna be dark okay so since the legs like this you see the leg you can see the resemblance right pretty much since the lights coming from over here this entire part of the legs can be shuttered in and this parts gonna have a huge cash out of so this entire parts can be shouted in so this part let me show you what the bigger market real quick [Music] so this parts gonna have more shadow than the other parts come up here yeah see what I did and this part is gonna be the bottom of the muscle so the bottom of the muscle you always want to shove it in a bit yeah the legs are usually a bit harder gotcha the crotch regions really really hard and this parts easy just whack it all in I'll use a big marker today yeah usually I use a big marker to blacken the big spots [Music] BAM check that out look at that looks cool doesn't ha check it out how are you doing okay okay I'm gonna toss in the fuel line weights while you're at it so line weights is just whatever curves under quite nice so far Andres over here language over there all right looking good all right this coming along with a nice nice and the other side the Lydian just a black and really really fast with a big marker your pen so let's see what you did this place supposed to be shining in yeah you got it you got it nice and this in after this part all this keep walking yeah including the crotch yeah cuz it's all gonna be covered in shadow all right now I'm gonna start explaining the knee and just listen and follow when everybody ready dude and you already did the calf part without me getting ahead of yourself screaming speedster calf and kind of want to just make it triangular have his ankles here yeah and spider-man has fairly skinny calves because he's a skinny superhero damn it I gave him huge calves right dude right when I told him they need skinny calves like give huge caps okay so the calves are gonna be really really easy because we're blocking in most of it because it's at the bottom so here's what we do we spike it all the way down because there are strength muscles going all the way down so over here you spike all of it right here's my goal of it - yeah and pretty much what happens is you see the knee right here you're gonna test this shadow for the knee there's something that comes right actually this shadow for the knee shoot we made the knee really really long bring it down a little bit then I'm gonna have a few little bumps over there and other than that just entire places when you black unless the costume is different no no I think we've got it right yeah yeah we got it right do it that by itself is gonna get get us age-restricted hey didn't the entire like a burning here whatever or the entire knee yeah thank you just fade into focus okay uh let me explain it real quick so a knee looks like this okay so you see that's your kneecap that's your knee so this is what we're shading in hitting in this entire part of the knee like that come down here we're gonna leave some space of the air jordans it get started [Music] can you help me okay I'll help you out in a second and Annie part you just do like a little cap and then we do a few little bumps on the side and that's pretty much it so say if you were to do it it's a cap shape a few bumps like that yeah okay picking up these lines a little bit okay oh now you're ready for the other side so the other side should be a little bit more simple just hungry gonna come to eat with us later it's Cristina waiting for you we're gonna find Christina felt let me grab the whole thing yeah just chilling there you're hungry I will go after filming in my pants will that do what is this weird lump oh it's part of the muscle yeah and then same thing on this side you have the little bumps for the knee but this sides gonna be a lot darker so everything over here is gonna just be shadowed in and it doesn't have to be perfect too because we're gonna go and need kopecks Kovac should be pretty fast shoot but my arm just moved and I covered up that entire spike ganon okay whatever are you making mistakes everywhere you see I made a big boo-boo where does it keep going you spiked up and down and then spiked the other way I don't like all them spikes okay it's time for me to look for an Air Jordan reference so we're doing the off-white Air Jordan so yeah I fight Jordan 1 Chicago okay let me search that up well I'll fight Oh Jordan so the red ones right how much are they [ __ ] dude this one's $6,000 oh no okay let's find one on this side ooh dude these actually do was pretty sick alright so now we have a reference for our off-white Air Jordans oh we should put the tag on it today Oh we'll do it later who put the off-white tag on it at the end right okay so let's do the Air Jordans so we're gonna start off just getting the basic shape of it we're gonna go with that dude the Air Jordans I'm drawing or way too big like a bit smaller so just kind of get the right size maybe that should be good this TV you see none guys is good here's good when was too big before okay so we're gonna kind of get the design in so the heel got the front it's gonna kick up a little bit okay now just draw in the design and just wrap it in real quick and make sure it's good with the inks so oh it actually comes hi little drop surprise in the movie he wears Jordans we're gonna watch you I'm gonna watch the movie later today pictures okay I'm not even sure how to write these characters it's gonna be so small amazing that's it do you know which uh which shoe the off-white tag is on you wanna put it on this shoe or this shot on the right shoe all right yes I'm glad to see this shoe there was another right okay his right okay let's see do you see I need it yeah all right or actually let's finish drawing the shoe so we don't need the reference anymore we do okay it's filling with the inks this year you can kind of just rough it you have to be exact got that would you ever get these shoes that's not look pretty nice but they're so expensive dude they can afford on that would tighten up the ankle because it's really in competitive no you're good spider-man has pretty been in cool do you imagine playing basketball you'd break his ankles in a second that's true dude haven't your rents so skinny no this is a Kevin Durant hater you're gonna he's not even funny to the right to handle now what do you think about that Dan dude oh that should be cool if Durango subscribe to my channel - god whoa what are you doing what do you think about kawaii then but this I guess the team Ashley Raptors were already pretty good before Harper is doing this earring what they do really poorly for a while I started for a while they were under a 50% right make a tiny bit yeah yeah dude actually so many teams I could worry they've been doing it all night oh oh watch out for your head oh yeah where the Warriors have been falling off all the time I'm just gonna very tiny tiny lettuce Duke your heads blocking right there yeah sure I just draw little hooks hey watch out your heads always in the way dude they did it I'm a little labels down yeah [Music] these Jordans are actually looking pretty sick see that they actually like the word I mean I kind of just scribbled them on okay and after that just darken up this part case it goes down do you know and I'm pretty excited to go in for the kopecks do you ever snip the kopecks I like drinking the kopecks they taste good it's a good energy drink really gets your engines running hey yours looks nice the fronts a little bit big but it's not bad I bet it's alright son ready to move on to the next shoe dude this looks like a little cat and then have them just wearing tissues Emily so draw the shape first do you need me to bring you through hump day I just draw the shape so it's gonna kind of look like this do you see that so rectangle that's slightly lopsided I made it too long and draw a little bulge at the bottom now you just will draw the laces first [Music] little flaps and hood The Joker lips [Music] this is the edge [Music] it's laced up ok the wrong parts a little bit hard because it's a little bit in perspective it oh dude I just messed up ok you can cover it up I just crisscross them in negative space if you want to go fancy if you don't want to go fancy just alright hey this actually looking pretty good we replace the tag on this side looks like that right like that no leave out the direction I guess it kind of worked that's good I'll just do that I'll put it as dr. Lacey okay let me get a little longer there okay now just kind of darken the bottoms just put some wine weight on there then should be good to go then we can start kopecks wait you ready just start coke oh shoot we didn't finish the arm yet just do the same thing I did all right let's get ready to draw his arms yeah she messed up on this hand I don't even know I shouldn't have gone straight in with ink mine likes even way yeah I can't believe I messed up on the hand oh shoot yeah it's supposed to [Music] fingers chopped up okay fingers are gonna be if you mess up I'm really really bad usually you just darkened most of it in so yeah I hope you in a second do I need to save mine first I messed up cuz I went straight in with ink and I left it for so long so I forgot what everything messed up I think it's aimed at the bit dude it looks so messed up it looks so messed up gorilla music yeah oh crap okay so we've got a really messed-up hand over here Danna dude I should have taken a second look it's okay but there's nothing we can do sometimes and we're just gonna have to live with our mistakes ah quit it okay actually if we do that it's it's not too bad okay scoot all backs Oh All Blacks better than nothing okay so actually your hands looking better than mine right now yeah I messed up like I was thinking about it boys here's to help that and actually doesn't wait that bad better than mine yes II heard she looks better than mine right now and screw it moving on okay this hand this hand is gonna be really easy because we're blacking it all this she actually I don't want to jinx it why should I do mine cuz my arm extends a bit over let me make sure you get mine rate first actually I got it yeah yeah that looks good that looks good so we're gonna are you gonna follow me my mom my arms all six dad I know what if L want me to help you with that even know what his shoulder should go okay I think your is a slightly different from mine so I hope you okay so here I'm gonna put it in here it's a big risk mmm that's what your wall said well if I'd love to kiss then she'll have an accident like you oh my god okay now she got this and how's yours do you need me to help you okay does it work want me to just help you real quick yeah I'll just help you so you can catch up the ring well all this parts gonna be black anyways just gonna show you that in and this part there's gonna be slightly easiest what is your hands directly pointed back got that yes if you want you can just black in that shape leave the see looks pretty good right no okay dude we don't thinking oh [ __ ] I forgot the upper but we're pretty much done with inking so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna take our kneaded eraser lightly yeah thank no trap lightly erase down the pencil marks so just to make sure we don't get the ink off too but lightly lightly erase the pencil marks no the pencil marks I'm talking about right just really really lightly erase them especially off the chest over here you got a lot of pencil marks in the middle okay this is actually looking pretty good dude chunky at the top good yours looks like the spider-man from that movie holy crap look at this dog dude do you big come in a bit look you this okay okay let's start going in with coping so what we want to start doing is we'll start out going in with do you want to go a little bit lighter a little bit darker than me you can choose n bigger and 4 choose 1 into it okay so and no so what we want to do is we want to leave a little bit of white space everywhere so actually let's do the Reds first so that we don't mess that up we'll do the Reds first so you can take our dead like oh yeah I'll go real quick I'll show you what needs to be done and then you can go after me okay so with the red you want to flick it up so you leave a little bit of white space okay so you see how this is a peck you leave a little bit of white space at the top see how there's like a little bit of white space then the rest you can color in red over here we can color it in all red but be very careful when you do it so you don't bleed into the black parts and later I'll show you what to do with the rim light which is the lights like you know how earlier with your lines down the sides that yeah I'll show you what that's for later same thing over here just be careful in the day okay and fingers are gonna be red and we'll do the Jordans at the end you got it and then we do the same thing with the blacks so actually I can start with y'all to start with end for the heck of it so you know what I'm doing right wherever there's blacks instead of doing blacks we just go like this and leave a little bit of white space you get it right is the fun part dude I love Kovac so much it goes on so nice okay we just flick it around a bit [Music] how's your red billing this easier than the inking part and you'd usually core pics are way more fun make time this other strike yeah yeah now you go in with the grey do what I did whoa see what I did with other cover okay okay do you be the bit everywhere yeah a tiny bit and I'm gonna go in with a darker shade of red now yeah yeah yeah okay pick it up I'm gonna go one shade darker with the red and start adding a little bit of shadow so we're just gonna keep repeating this process until we get it so that there's a long dimension hold on hold on so just has an example instead of going like this you go this that right try it on the lap travel at the last more forgetting yeah I'll bet okay nice yeah good where is that oh that's what most happily do that's what happened last time - you thought you're doing really poorly the whole way through until I got two little faces between the name yeah oh dude this entire part this is a sweet black here let's do it a little bit better going to the now we slowly go darker and darker the Caputo sadly just yeah just follow the striations yeah like that like that hey see that looks nice so we're gonna keep going hood okay so we're gonna keep going up one shade at a time so I find out we older what I do about the shoulder and his face just follow mine I'm gonna go up one one tone at a time so I start out with n 5 no I started out with n 4 so now I'm using n 5 shoulders it's a little like turds on there I don't know why you did that that's part of the right is oh listen our place is supposed to be red yeah it's okay well we'll save it later let's go keep going come on you're not done finish the arm [Music] [Music] [Music] so kale all the times that's what I do honestly yeah okay now go a little bit darker with n5 and then archwing for for the red right no I'm gonna go see like we target vines it's dark not retrace the line so you do the darkest part of the red so you look at which part is darkest so here let me show you can Oh an example so see how this place this parts to the darkest so you don't go all the way up again go down here so I'm gonna go in with Redknapp about up here and yeah I need to be dark yeah yeah yeah that's good nice okay keep doing them and soon we'll have a pretty cool piece who did the air jordans last nice now go slightly darker again with the grey see I'm going up to n6 now because you were n5 okay use the red you go today higher though yeah cuz that entire logos dark because some parts are the light red it's like a little gradient logo yeah I guess you didn't have to color it but it's just a kind of an indicator [Music] nice [Music] how's it going okay now they can just skip that doctorate look at ya is nice get in I'm gonna go in with the darkest right just to highlight the very darkest parts yeah you can probably skip it hey we'll call it the air jordans later now what we want to do is we go in with a really really light shade but we're just gonna go and do this and look it all up again and it'll kind of just blend everything together so there's what I use as a blender and it just makes everything look a little bit smoother doesn't it yeah since everything look a little nicer [Music] alright are you ready to go in with the the rim light so the rim light your aren't gonna be two parts I think it's gonna be red over here blue over here so just watch what I do first and then you can go right after me what we're gonna start out with is you know I'm trying to decide if I want blue here and right here or right here oh yeah blues on this nice of this entire place just color in all our extra spots blue oh my god this entire half that space is gonna be blue yeah this will give it a really cool effect how about this I have been building this grey yeah well it didn't look pretty real quick right now so this is called the [Music] secondary light source dude I completely forgot what this is called Gabbana the governor meet the governor [Music] pick over the needs to have this okay so it's like a really really white light and what I'm trying to figure out if I should put any over here nope and after this buddy's shoulder yeah I made that great or good no good yeah blue and after that we're gonna go in with the art 14 and we're gonna highlight the other yeah the other side red would give like a cool double lighting kind of effect damn you see that right what about the underside yeah see how that kind of gives it a double lighting effect ooh she looks kind of sick okay now after we get those base colors in we okay look really really closely at this one start real quick and look at this look at this so we're gonna take a darker blue and we're gonna kind of trace the outside line so that there's two shades you see what I'm doing barely trace the insulin what to write the genie our blue team I guess it gives it a little bit of the glow and after that we're gonna place a few weddings and pull it in the air jordans and we're gonna be done [Music] hey this guy doesn't have that many weddings they might actually been really bad right now to present great I think you have a ISIL give it a really hard line and know how to do this with the ratchet complete not at a smaller number lighter yeah the smaller the number the lighter for kopecks actually we could even rush every show use the paint pen for this wonder how thick the paint pen is Oh God oh wait it's uh time chasing over something yeah I mean we test the paint pen so I have these things called pasta paint pens and it might actually look good in this so see if I can go actually yeah this this might work well so I'm gonna take the pasta paint pens and I'm gonna edit some of the sides just a bigger size over here did you all how to do this because this is like fancy stuff give it a nice shine I'm digging this effect okay hey it's looking pretty decent [Music] okay let's finish up the eyes real quick yeah it's getting kind of long but we do a C over here and then she inwards you remember that here's the cat for afterwards and on one side we're gonna put a slight red tint and on the other side we're gonna have a slight blue tint and I'm gonna just look gray we're gonna have a slight red tint there just really lightly dab it then in the middle we're gonna take n3 and kind of just do this pretty cool huh like that want to do the Jordans like the very last no it often isn't just the wedding when I get the wedding done first okay let's do the wedding the wedding it's gonna be fast and easy and take this pin so draw it on your hand first to make sure there's there's stuff coming out is it good yeah okay now you know how to web spider-man right it is so draw a small circle over here and we don't want to highlight everything because some parts covered in shadow says watch me we'll start this will go most of the way down over here we'll go all the way down on the sides because that so just for this guy except you go straight up and down like that and then you're going to slice at the Webster - but on the other side make sure you keep it really really light because it's in the shadow then pretty much you for those of you guys I don't know you go like this and then you go curve curve curve so you connect the little ones together let's do that right now and don't go all the way to the other side because the other side is in shadow good yeah okay you know knit across that you real quick so for the cross-hatching it's really really easy pretty much just go up from where these places are so you see this just go oh just go up into the light so we're gonna do a few cross hatching things before we fill in the rest of the web you know and this is all stylistic right protects its causes yeah so cross hatchings mostly stylistic preference so you just choose what lines you want to cross hatch in ten it figure out which across a lot of stuff is that I'm done do but the webbing comes down over here draw lines going down the chest to the side then just get the whoops yeah connect the webs again you see what that that is just a little scratching is it up do I do the light part well like yeah yeah just do all of it and it comes down over here love the name of spider-man suit so you just want to really look always yeah yeah young way the size a little bit more pointed okay we're almost done we're almost I like that different Navy instead going down okay we've a nice okay now again just use your wipe and you toss in a little bit of highlights then we'll do our Air Jordans and then I'm gonna be done I'm highlighting his yeah sure you can skip it if you want but this is just an extra little detail for those of you guys that want to go above and beyond okay Oh highlight his eyes the top part of his eyes okay now let's finish up with the Jordans so the Jordan should be pretty easy there's steak what ready yeah our 2020 sevens not bad I'm using our tomboy so you know how the Jordans so great I'm trying to figure out which parts are red which parts are it's kind of one member and I'll bring out a tannish color so that we can yeah let me get up an orange and some orange that any light green never supposed to be light green somewhere no no are you sure the other Jordan off whites I saw some like a neon green solution doesn't have this make sure we can't add some they're very bright oh yeah wait I saw some what the laces green and orange light green and orange with some my mom's friends kid I even know him he took AP Physics in ma I wanna Vista got raped do really yes and now he's like panicking oh you can make green laces yeah I'm not gonna do that then it's your extra know it's like bike already okay so now wait where'd you get that 10 billion yes that one I'm gonna add a little bit of shadow to the side [Music] [Music] okay now let me erase the nonsense on the side dude yours is actually looking pretty sick too [Music] my god right this calf was so tiny we met a little cash shadow to the very bottom that's in cash I want to do that no I don't know what that even the black I'll just okay should I do that just randomly draw someone I don't know if I have enough space the last I can probably do with the thick marker say some time actually should be about done little cast shadow standing right there okay all right now all we got to do is sign our
