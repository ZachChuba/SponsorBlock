what you're looking at right now is my chiller I got it for myself 15 years ago as a birthday present and with a little bit of teenage engineering I was able to achieve Sub Zero CPU cooling with an overclocked be sixty six hundred and four gigahertz 24/7 I took it with me everywhere even to LAN parties and it remains the most potent cooler here at Linus tech tips but to say it's sketchy would be an understatement we've got sharp edges we've got no grounding we've got an extremely dangerous exposed capacitor and it also doesn't look too great but today that changes no longer will we have to cart around the ugly carcass of an air conditioner to cool our computers because now we can cart around the ugly carcass of an old air conditioner in a fancy enclosure this is the chill inator v2 let's get to building it you can tell it's already better than a Mac Pro because it has wheels that lock [Music] suppliers online of course check them out now at the link below so I'd like to say that we have a really legit complete plan but we really don't so basically the idea is you know hot side here cold side here some steel that you have in your hands we cut it weld it and hopefully it all fits together how does welding work the easiest way to describe it is you're just pushing electricity and well with aluminum we're pushing it both in and out of the material so we're just throwing lightning at things really I know I know some of you might be confused did he really just say that welding is throwing lightning at things well let's look at how welding actually works so you can go from a regular Bruce to a zappy zapping Zeus see mastering welding much like mastering the Kama Sutra is more about careful balance and making sure everything is clean than pure power when exposed to the air the molten metal in a weld can react with the oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen contained in the atmosphere become very porous and splatter all over the place the same goes for potential contaminants on the surface of your metal if there is grease or rust on there your welds will be more splattery than dads Sunday bacon but not nearly as tasty to get a good arc weld you need enough current to melt the metal but not so much that you blow clean through you need proper shielding gas coverage to prevent air getting in and also loads of practice if you want to know a bit more maybe watch this video by this old Tony he might not be a professional but in my opinion that whole accredited schooling thing is a bit of a racket anyway when you're welding you need to cover all your exposed skin anything that's not covered will get sunburned and it's not fun particularly in January and so this guy when it senses an article darken automatically to whatever shaded aside I think you should go away now I don't want to embarrass myself well Collins back at the shop getting started on welding I'm heading to the metal Mart and getting some aluminum it's all going to be cut to size so we should just be put it on either riveted or screw it depending on which one it is and our job shouldn't be all that hard at least as far as that's concerned so we just got some TIG rod that's the right size for the welds that we need to do in the steel and they didn't have any general purpose stuff there so we now have the premium grade stuff that's normally used for offshore piping and nuclear power plants so what we're doing before we actually push the whole thing together and weld is we're just tacking everything so this means we're putting little tiny dab welds on all the joints and we're gonna tack it all together loosely and if something goes wrong or we screw up an angle we can just tap it out it will cut it then once we're happy with everything we'll go back and actually finish weld everything now to do that we're using welding rod and a trick of my old buddy Dave taught me back when I was young is to put a little bend like this and all your welding rods so that way when it goes down on a table no matter which way it lands you always have something to pick up when you have welding gloves on and lacking in clamps we have a box it's nothing too incredible like it's not the straightest box in the world but it's actually not moving around right now so it's really not that bad we need some better clamps to get everything at perfect 90 degrees but yeah whatever next time the router is about to make us the holes for all the fans to go in I want to cut some ltte logos in it so it looks you know pretty cool this tape that we're using is actually supposed to hold carpets in place so I just did the math we're going to get about 4,000 pounds of force to lift this I don't think it's coming off I think this looks awesome I just have to be careful not to you know bend the whole thing while I try and get it off I'm just wiring things no one's interested in wiring things there's a hot side there's a neutral side they they go together that's it I pulled a bit of an engineer on you in the sense that I drew something in SolidWorks right clicked it hit weld and just didn't think about it again this has been rough I went through probably half a packet Tungsten's experimentation throwing things across the shop getting angry storming out coming back in trying again storming out and I figured out my issue I had a little bit of a gas coverage issue I had choked out too far on the tungsten and now I'm actually making semi decent welds but really good I don't think so nope the biggest problem with the current you know this is the chances of getting electrocuted if you get anywhere close to it you touch that you touch this you know water spills out onto the table and you touch like the table you're done to take care of all of that I got these wonderful terminal blocks they're really overkill but these are going to handle like live and neutral and then ground we only have one ground lead so I'm just gonna put that right to the chassis here the thing that really is going to save our butts though this is a ground fault circuit interrupter or or GFCI this is kind of like what you'd find in like your bathroom you know the one that's annoying that always does the pop thing that's so you don't get electrocuted basically how this works is that it's constantly monitoring the current going into the live and out of the neutral so if it sees that there's a difference between those two it means that maybe currents going like between this chassis and my body in which case it's like pop and instead of me getting electrocuted I just need to go over and hit reset a luxury boom has a really good video on this if you want to figure out how it works a bit better but this should save our bacon in the case that's something in here leaks we're gonna have to bend these a fish to get this in the middle button worse case scenario we vent a bunch of you know dangerous gases into the atmosphere and I was thinking that we would just reuse these rubbers but the problem is that they're they're kind of they're kind of used yeah you don't want to reuse rub there's no every bad might just be the easiest way to do this yeah it was kind of I was thinking too mm-hmm a little bit too much wobble rubber is just a little big ok I'm gonna no you know what we should just get some bigger studs studs for your rubbers yeah yeah so the plan was to use some power switches that we had just laying around but while I was out to get this big old terminal I also got two of these guys functionally it's no different but man don't know if you can hear that but like it's pretty funny seeing Linus's angle grinding skills from when he was just a young in kind of could've really used some deeper think I think that'll cut [Music] to mark out the holes here I've just gone to measured everything from these two edges because I know that they're although maybe not perfect they're better than the ones that I did with the angle grinder we'll just do the last one here just used some layout die and the the cheap calipers described everything and then we'll just Center punch and drill it I've made a plate that holds the compressor and we're going to make sure that the stud pattern fits before I take weld this all together and we start actually making mounts for everything that's gonna go in the box that we made so I'm just going to measure confirm mark out then we'll tack it through weld it and we'll put the plate on it done pump mount yep almost done I don't know weld is done tubing yes yes would you be definitely it's 5:30 okay we're supposed to go home now this is kind of like to speak now or forever hold your peace moment I know you and I had discussed the inlet and outlet and there were two key items so does the is the pump oriented this way more like this way so yeah we need a port here for the inlet of the pump is that the plan perfect okay then the cool it needs to come in here that way we have the coolant flowing across the evap because what I've observed is that if I have it configured the other way which I have actually done in the past just to experiment with it it really does cause problems like there's a significant difference in temperature across the two sides of the tank now we're gonna have to sew it just one for the pump one for everything else okay are we gonna have a temp probe separate from the one for the thermostat that's just into the water and just has a Rio I wasn't planning on it but it's pretty easy to do this is gonna be insulated yep cool I would probably have actually a lot of my airflow coming in right here and then the pump also needs cooling so I would probably have it coming in here but then not over here where all the cold things are all right is that all you guys need before sweet doing no I don't know where the putty is this happened why did it start Oh God I made a boo-boo by pulling this thing in and out of the chassis like 15 times we fatigue failed the tube and now it's leaking all the refrigerant atmosphere sorry mother earth all of that refrigerant is now gone so we need to get it recharged or remade or I don't know buy another one things are bad about two weeks ago I thought this project was totally done we spewed r22 all over this place which is bad for the environment and it turns out our 22 isn't exactly easy to get because it's really bad for the environment I thought we were done but it turns out that Brian here just has 22 pounds of it just sitting around 24 surprise I do refrigeration now yeah so now we have to tap these valves onto here pressurize it find out where the leak is fix the leak with acetylene then fill it with our 22 and we'll be good this here's the point of the build where we know we have to do you know what we have to do so it's just about getting er done I actually haven't seen this in quite some time you guys have made some real progress here casters aren't mounted yet nope do they lock yes hey and it's a head of the Mac Pro already got him yeah we still have a bit of time to you know change things around so that's why we have the Linus review yeah Nikolas really killed it on a little Nobby come there I like it beautiful fundamentally here's how it works our old air conditioning unit has its compressor it's got a hot side and it's got a cold side so these fans cool the hot side and the cold side sits immersed in this toilet plumbing reservoir that we've got right here then we've got a typical water loop except that it's going to be as cool as nearly minus 30 degrees Celsius so this pump right here which is validated for use with the obviously not water coolant that we're gonna be using probably windshield de-icer it's gonna pull that fluid in here then it's a simple matter of plumbing it up to whatever computer it is that we're trying to chill these switches turn on the AC and the pump independently that's really good because if you want to just like make sure the AC is working everything at the coolant chilled that nice and then if you want to run your pump later that's pretty cool turning off your pump it's good stuff this dial is actually part of the original mechanism so it's just a good old classic super analog thermostat doodad so we chuck that down there and now it'll automatically turn our compressor on and off depending on how cool we want our coolant to be and that's where my questions start have you guys given much thought to condensation in this thing everything here is going to be insulated and it's all along the bottom and then there's a drain port down on the bottom here this is all going to be insulated so hopefully it doesn't get too bad but if it does at least you'll be able to see you know water coming out of the drain port instead of water getting to the electronics on the other side are you insulating this spray foam oh yeah the RGB was such a pain like look at all of the cable and that has to be there jammed in there sophisticated jank I'm not a fan what were you guys thinking here what do you mean this like gooey crap why did you why did you put a hole in the reservoir why did you just bring it in from the top well because it's the thermal probe it needs to be able to get the coolant temperature like in the middle it's also a tap toll it's like a thermal probe that's threaded that's like put through okay are we ready to test yeah oh boy I don't see it going into the tubes which is making me a little uneasy because this is a lot of water that I'm pouring and I don't know where it is oh this is a really big tank yeah you guys should have done a smaller tank why should we do this all the time more thermal mass no no that's bad because it takes way longer to cool it down well it's smaller than the other one so the good news is it definitely prompt the prom oh it's also leaking yeah it's also leaking the point was to leak test it well you know leak test it a bit well yeah we leave tested it it failed well just you know let's make sure all this electronic stuff is not too close to it yeah I should be fine yeah okay so wait so the fans go on immediately there's no switch for them I figure that you just always want our gb that's fair okay so we should hook something out up to this yeah okay well that seems to be working all right I'm going to go grab some fittings for the BRB we don't gush too much water while we put them on yeah I guess that if you wanted well I get those you could always try and you know stop the pump from leaking oh I put a clock there good job after Brian did the repair you guys checked and made sure the hot side gets hot and the cold side gets cold right yeah like I sent you that picture of the cold side getting all condensation right we tipped it yes you need to wait you shouldn't tip a compressor and then run it again immediately I think it has more to do with lubricants and oils or something I'm not an expert I just know that you're not supposed to do that BRB all right well I guess while we wait for the compressor to do its thing should we drain it all right here it goes probably just put it on the ground yep wait the flow we have yeah it's training so we left it for a few hours let's see if the AC works works way better if you plug it in I read it all of the electrical in here it's way less sketchy look at this it's held in with zip ties now cool I think it's getting cold I could be imagining it I am fairly certain it's getting cold it's also grounded now remember last time how I was just like dangling mcdhh angling I see that capacitor is still just hanging yeah at it faster so but it's like you know it's mostly hidden I love that we spent all this time and money on this thing and it's still jank maybe that was just its destiny it's way less J it's less scary oh good god okay that was a bit of a miscalculation the point was to leak test it we can't leak test it when it's soaked oh is that fitting dripping I don't know it's covering water so I guess we could also test the pump right yeah ready and one two three well that did its job pretty fast yep for better or for worse this is the new and improved chiller yeah do you want to describe the final product right now I would love to everything I'm saying right now is a guess but I imagine a gorgeously painted monolithic cube of cooling prowess with a massive four gallon reservoir industrial switches for independent control the AC and pump a thermistor port so that we can measure internal temperatures of the reservoir and of course a gorgeous pink temperature control dial all held in place with a pristine combination of zip-ties electrical tape and hook and loop straps LTTE store comm fundamentally what we're looking at is exactly the same thing that I built in my in-laws backyard 15 years ago but with a degree of refinement so now instead of carrying it around in pieces and risking slicing your hand open you can carry it around as one big piece and risk slicing your hand open but at least less risk of slicing your hand open and no exposed capacitors so hopefully we're gonna be bringing you guys some great sub-zero cooled projects over the next little bit here with this thing and if not well it can always sit in the Indiana Jones warehouse until we finally do need it because we actually use it like quite a bit sometimes yeah I'd say quarterly the d-bots Osmo 2020 on alibaba.com for more than 300,000 new products we got to give this a crack with the 64 core thread over oh yeah yeah that's the kind of thing that can justify a 1200 watt cooling system
