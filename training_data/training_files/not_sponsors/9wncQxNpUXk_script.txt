so oh oh my god uh all right son it's story time all right let's get comfy come on settle in now here in the book of rust stories is a particularly grand old tale of a man who set out on his own into the dark disorderly world to carve out a slice of his own this isn't a story of kings and queens or orphaned heroes this is a story of a humble man with no tools no weapons no home not even clothes to warm his back he starts this story with nothing but a yearning for everything both man and beast loomed in the wilderness their blood-curdling roars and thunderous weapons were both testament to their presence but it was what you couldn't hear is what this man knew you should be afraid of and these men and beasts could not hear him washed up on a beach with nowhere else to go but inland our protagonist would begin to move quietly and swiftly through the land like a shadow with deadly intent but little did he know he was not the only shadow out there in the trees he could hear it something that made him tremble either with fear or excitement we did not know but it grew louder and louder and louder until it revealed itself okay guys it is a fresh forced wipe and i'm here going solo man i've had some bad luck lately running solo and it has not been good here's hoping that with the fresh wipe we can uh make that uh that luck turn around now we've got some desert military bases that have come in this wipe i haven't looked at the map yet so maybe i should just have a gaze at that abandoned military base right there that's kind of like in a really good spot okay that's where i want to build all right let's go get to this dirt road over here start running it up to bandit camp we'll get some scrap tools and all of that hopefully and uh then we're gonna cut across it's not really a good run after this is it hopefully we should have enough by the time we get the banded anyway and look at all the trash balls here we're about to get a tool out of this blue box here oh [ __ ] score gonna cheese the safe zone system all right get rid of that looking good jackhammer hatchet we're gonna be right in your outpost as well so we can buy plenty of water we need it so right now like in australia i'm an australian server i'm winter us actually it's 7 55 a.m the force wife hits on a friday morning for us so everyone's like in school and work there's only like a handful of people on the surface like 15 or something right now so hopefully we can get a good start but i'm just feeling like me going to build over here i'm going to run into people like fairly quickly i think that they're going to build their a lot of people it's got outposts and it's got that abandoned military base i think there's going to be a war for that i saw they fixed tc stacking as well apparently now i've just learned how to do tz staffing so of course for starters but i'm glad thank [ __ ] that thing had no place in this game was so broken kind of need to kill that scientist i think oh oh my god all right that's good that's good scrap let's see if we can stash our horse here hopefully that's still there when we get out we'll get some pickles and then we'll just zoom where do we want to build all right let's do this big recycle hey i think you dropped this thanks man all righty make some bandies what's this guy doing what do you want to follow me we've got a ways to travel let's go all right we're full absolutely full gonna go sell some of this stone to outpost uh buy some wood it's gonna be a struggle to hold them away hopefully it stacks in my inventory [ __ ] i love that bug oh hello sweet i'll take you we're going to ride through the area we kind of want to be at night so we'll keep our eyes peeled and see what the node stitch is like why it's not too bad i reckon this hill is where we want to be oh it's good the notes are just really good we're here we have arrived at outpost let's see if this is gonna work out for us okay that [ __ ] slaps i wonder if it lets us do it again i don't know if i want to take my chances all right we can do this please take it out of the 1k that's there yes all right perfectly stacked inventory i called my father's name away was father's name once more this water treatment near me yeah it's actually kind of yeah i run down there real quick and see if i can grab a weapon oh you're kidding me three logarithms shy three furnaces oh i [ __ ] up my base build i meant to put oh no damn it oh well we'll just have this is a starter or a second device besides i need to see if they've fully patched the uh my way of doing stones all right let's head on down to water treatment what are we k12 on k12 all right hopefully we can get a med stick here too under the gauntlet here open that stick can't see a thing moments oh my god have i done that in pitch black all right someone here this cheeky foreign thanks for the arrow [ __ ] him come out oh we can actually go to sword branch while we're over this way try and get a weapon that way my hazmat boots sound different they don't sound like hazy bits they sound like naked feet this is odd i wonder if that guy's still waiting for me treatment come on baby have some green boxes on top here two brands we should probably get on and then we'll try it we'll try and get into the abandoned military base after we dump there's a compound bow base here that's there too everyone's building around this i think i chose the good side all right let's do this how do we get in this sov is that one entrance there you go good side to sleep oh you can be sneaky as [ __ ] here okay we're doing pretty good so far of course you can't ah i'll [ __ ] finish you running it [ __ ] there's no way it finishes that it's too much noise it's too much noise you can't like to run this solo like you are gonna be the one who's jumping it or you're gonna get [ __ ] jumped or you gotta hold it off i guess like because people are gonna come are you kidding me are you kidding me oh he's gone well we saw it for a few glorious moments i might as well actually try and see while my bag's on time if i could still build my [ __ ] tc stack thing all right i think tc stacking still works maybe unless i'm missing something maybe this won't override that anymore i don't know like we'll see we'll see let's get back all right let's make some extra sleeping bags it's gonna be one of those bases over in the desert now is it the furnace one or the other little one i saw i can see the little one i saw that oh wait no that's the furnace that maybe does live in that furnace one furnace one was definitely active and he has my horse just got my compound so vengeance all right i saw a lot of nodes outside so i guess that's what we're going to grab right now stop right now it's over his face i'm pretty sure all right this is gonna be a battle and a half for this airdrop someone's on the outside too he has a sir bro i heard a [ __ ] nail got a crossbow and he has a sar all of a sudden goodbye to that airdrop i should have just waited fighting behind it huge huge i'm shaking i'm shaking oh that other guy's probably gonna be back and i don't care if i die oh my god got everything back everything oh man man along [ __ ] you know that's so [ __ ] good all righty oh man okay okay research table that and a med i think i know what i want to do though actually i want to go buy a bunch of wood i'm going to leave the stone we have here i'm just going to take the jackhammer because i want to make wood walls all right we have an inventory let's grab these inventory of stone pretty much i think it's time to buy some wood hopefully it stacks again oh you'll love it oh you love it okay we're on a roll that's nuts that is nuts that is not what is that what's the water here 15 30 45 60 70 k wood all neatly stacked we're gonna do 10 wall or maybe 12 holes though oh that is crazy all right let's do some organization i guess huh uh ah i guess we're sticking to this being our main base now [ __ ] who cares whatever we're chatting up we're about to have large furnaces we'll turn this whole thing into a metal base we'll put turrets everywhere oh my god okay man i guess it's just cover for when we opened the door [ __ ] i thought i would have been able to see out that window that's bad placement ah [ __ ] whatever oh we did one metal barricade man i [ __ ] this base this is this is not my usual standard of base i'll tell you that much ah whatever oh [ __ ] we have a horse i mean i guess he's gonna [ __ ] for me right we just need to go get him pickles oh i [ __ ] up the furnace placement oh my god i meant to put oh my god i gotta have honeycombing over there ah well [ __ ] whatever the base is [ __ ] like i said we'll have a chad lifestyle now all right let's head over towards dome see dude we can find a tommy actually we might like to try here as well so we get a green box oh python [ __ ] i kind of want that the turrets i actually might be able to research it here right now no not quite we'll go loot those hangers and then we should be able to all right let's go research this so we don't have to run all the way home nice nice nice nice and keep heading on over towards dome oh these laptops and cameras are amazing for us oh look at this guy that's terrific i just want heaps of turrets that's beautiful oh look at that pumpy not bad custom all right let's get home well tommy sadly i love tommy if i die with this hall that's brutal there's a horse over there i'm kind of close to him anyway all right good hole good hole nice five turrets we could make in fact are they two yep which high quality only ten like one jesus christ can i get a path though what's blocking me on the path this all right so we need 75 200 scrap so yeah windmill i got one level higher that's more stone and we're done uh so okay we've got the wiring done for the turrets all we need is a windmill so we need 200 scrap 187 to be exact having those five turrets down is huge for us wonder what's going on down here hmm let's probably get out of here it's another really good hole [ __ ] just little tiny bit more scrap really do another turret too scientists next to me i have a feeling that guy the original guy is going to show up that guy this thing's so worth okay how the [ __ ] was he in there dude that profile picture was [ __ ] mortifying so is that him driving off what a legend bro i got stuck in the loot box i saw him coming and i got stuck in that [ __ ] box that's his base there for sure spawn you like yolkers huh what tools have you got here nice move bro cheers oh he's gonna seal me in wait what am i doing are you so mad got a dog cam yeah oh yeah why is that uh so a secure even has a pookie bear that's lit [ __ ] almost forgot about that no this is my base you don't own anything this is mine i have the tc and everything no it's clearly not i've just put down the door it's mine i've i've just told you it's not what's with the door camp on the 22 pop server i mean you could say it's a 22 pop server but it's not going to be later when everyone's back over from school at work i mean yoka grubbin waiting in the in the mining in the new uh thingy the monument like [ __ ] it was a good move dude no i wasn't waiting actually i wasn't waiting i was [ __ ] farming it and then you all though no it's a good move i respected it i haven't called you a [ __ ] legend but sadly i saw the campaign didn't say it to you i said it to myself but i saw the camper van off in the distance that's cool but door camping's dog because i didn't take everything from you didn't you no you had then that's [ __ ] sad man we better load up and get home i have a feeling he's gonna watch where i go oh who doesn't put an air lock on straight away with all that loot he had ah that's his own all right we have the uh the thing the wind turbine what do i need gears of wood siren i mean thompson down here all right uh what do we need building plant tool hammer ah here all these turrets power on baby oh yeah there we go okay i think we need to turn these off if i can figure them to zero well that let this accumulate power yes geez it's going up slow you know we might do make another wind turbo that's too juicy bro i hear a scientist in there still maybe this guy died so good what's going on three more turrets on the way all right we're gonna need gun powder and ammo we're gonna need some high quality all right here we go was a python again so i'm gonna need nine pipes through springs oh hell yeah that charge going to go up yes that's freaking awesome we have so many turrets really need metal now and we need a tommy you also need to go empty out that other place i might go over there and have a look at that now do that all righty let's go try and get some metal there's snow right there go to the snow huh we have a lot of sulfur out here but not that much metal that's a lot of salt all this [ __ ] all right so the turrets keep turning off something's not right here i gotta give them more juice i can't fit another wind turbine on top so what i'm gonna try i'm gonna try something different where's my cord now that should have solar power energy and wind turbine energy and that should be good oh baby that's us it's like a nice little alarm system down here guys i love it of course it did drew people over can i get three times lucky with vengeance from this place i reckon he's come from that base over there the new one i saw someone over there at outpost here he comes bro i can't believe it again we are the kings of vengeance this one holy [ __ ] that's a sword-looking box of comps but i'll ever have seen one damn iq again shooting at someone in the dish nice to know that you can do that that was a gamble all right let's try this with our phone let there be light i guess we should craft up this gp and clear up some space i want to see how this um battery's doing whether it's just juicing one minute it's climbing so that's good that's good let that just forever climb all right let's see if this is gonna mess with our feng shui on that uh battery still climbing nine turrets baby there's more we could do yet with this battery i mean i have no idea what i'm gonna do with all this gp i have no clue possible i could pull off some cheeky raids solo it's so hard though not only is it normally an online well that you try and do if you're a youtuber but then you've also got the [ __ ] counter raiders to deal with can be brutal at times every time even with a group maybe i make an alliance with people say hey let's raid together type of thing why don't we go get a lay of the land see what's going on no way someone to kelly down in the water too damn i gotta turn my lights off back at base don't need them on god i love the rust plus app it is so damn good oh boxing power play man that rust needs to pay me i'll entice the [ __ ] out of me that crate could be huge for us if we could get it you know i could have a rocket and a launcher in it [ __ ] i mean we it's fresh white horse one no bps on winter us every month so that'd be real nice actually thinking about that look at it looming off in the distance all right game face i wonder if i stand out in this bush always when it's in the last few seconds you just drop someone else off up there i feel like you dropped someone up up there well that's a shame all that time waiting for that to happen but it's okay i guess i threw the c4 if i can't have it they can't have a type of deal i kind of remember what was in there i don't even think it was that good apart from the uh c4 maybe the balti was good too oh well it would have been nice to get away with but i'm not upset about that i was surrounded anyway come on what a couple of standby tommy's russ plus baby oil refinery on this tech tree was there and i can unlock it already beautiful that guy's built up quite a lot actually [ __ ] i see what's up two guys coming to outposts she [ __ ] got a road sign on you're not dying well i think he's still here i think he's still here i didn't kill the guy on the horse he's made ludum run and is this tripod the guy [ __ ] jump you with the nail gun i know tommy all right now right here that's a base spot l 15 top right [ __ ] you can build something big here plenty of nodes around sir actually i don't need this [ __ ] i have this base here i'm sure his shots were baked but i'm biting so i know where i'm biting too that's the guy i saw on the horse andrew imagine if it's dropping over my base sadly that is not the case must be a called in one actually these are like little successful hit and runs hitting run runs dude we're doing so well yeah i've jinxed it right let's see how this guy's doing his name like something monkey wait this base is built up that's not his wonder who lives here uh what's happening what's this tommy oh that building all right oh holy [ __ ] gg guys so baby man feels good yeah we just have to get home three extra tommy's that dude forgot to put the gears away from his garage door as well that's classic oh i could see the mighty home from here look at that fine castle sir winter had taken to the new world quite well from the cold windy shores of the coast to bathing in warm blood of all who dared to slide him he was now moving forward to great things vengeance had been his food to fuel him their tears of regret his drink their treasures his reward the flame burned heartily in his bosom and conquering near death had never made him feel more alive his fortress grew fat with wealth but there was still more chests to be filled still more men and monsters to be slain still more ways for him to enhance his keep because if he didn't do any of these things well a chain is only as strong as its weakest link and sir winter needed to keep his chain strong poor guy he didn't have that much on himself now come on man please i'm like literally new you cannot please get rid of it please bro please don't be weird please man i beg you i beg bro please please just let me be jesus christ yeah is that not them all right they're headed that way large oil most likely all right so armored car huh let's see what we can do out here first things first garage door two shop fronts why wouldn't i be able to put a car ramp there now let's gather all the scrap we can and see what we need to research here where's the armored stuff the armor stops on t3 isn't it [ __ ] although i think we need that we could get a t3 i mean why not all right screw it we're going to recycle this is terrifying [ __ ] i got one of those stacks of wood on me all right at least we're here we'll get some water here too okay all right let's recycle it's gonna take a little bit all right that is a [ __ ] load of stuff jesus what am i doing why am i farming it's a [ __ ] base right here i got a bad feeling oh oh my god we're back with a heart attack it's quite the handsome amount of metal frags all right tier three wow oh they're all 28 hop easy all right i'm a cockpit armored passenger we want a tray and an engine so let's place this back down here engine to make a guy and a tray to store all the loot beautiful how much do we have left not enough for an armored door which is a shame where are we in the scheme of things what do we need first a little rocket launcher we'll start here by that all right we need a rocket launcher it's next up 500 scrap 500 625 plus 300 800 scrap 1100 scrap 1600 scrap 2100 22 and 25 is what we need two thousand two hundred and twenty five scrap oh boy did i say two thousand two hundred twenty five or two thousand one hundred twenty five i don't know they're gonna think this is a base coat if they're busting it we have 38 okay all right we're going to think of a plan of attack here scrap do i get scrap i think that's what we're going to do server's starting to fill up a bit now please man take my stuff don't mind if i do 697 scrap i could have got a lot more to whoa nearly at the explosive stage how many do we need we've got 197 nearly 30 downstairs i think it's 315 scrap just chilling here okay you do explosive sweet all right what's that airfield way what the [ __ ] is this okay i'm back home what do i need now 1125 because of the launcher as well that dude up there i'm distracted i'll do it what's not worth was not worth to scenic view that with that cliff there this is cool for some reason i don't know it looks nice i like it even though it's stupid oh this is where i was about to head i can't see anyone down there scream boxes on top still foreign he where's the ak guy i thought i scored there all right we've got the launcher now as well all right let's get some explosives now ah got back just in time for them to be done nice coming morning or going night i don't know sounds like morning birds outside i might make that air drop i better get a four times out of it or a rocket all right let's go another successful run i could burn this off and [ __ ] replace that wall kind of isn't a shitty spot all right let's go how can we do our sneaky over the wall no one's gone in there with a gun i'm not i'm never hearing he's shooting back actually he might be at the entrance he's not here so got a good amount of scrap man what the [ __ ] jesus these halls of scrapping ice [ __ ] we can raid now bro what the [ __ ] crap i reckon that bass is getting ready right now is the one next to the outpost with the guy shot at me with the tommy me and that other bloke oh no actually it's probably further than that no i'm having a little snoop see how many people are raining what's going on it's not that it's further along out in the desert uh i got a mid-range weapon so what's getting hit that metal base no way there's a guy on the roof and missing high walls oh yeah that bass i think has been busted into i wonder if there's any chance of me getting close so hehe man might have bubbled you right now so is he camping the door or something crazy that i was able to sneak up on that guy well hey we had a look and i guess there was nothing there maybe the defenders won that guy was just there out of spot you know oh i killed him it was the guy i killed on the road kind of like next time so we're just going to donate a kit to goldie i got jumped by three dudes wow i knew what to say we lost okay so i've just woken up guys we're unrated terrific but we need tech trash so we can make our uh armored car well i've got a windmill here actually a spare windmill but i still need two tech trash for a large battery and i don't think i haven't i could recycle for it real quick yeah we're going to have to all right let's go do that i've never really done this before actually so it should be interesting i like the learning experience i don't leave this door whoops oh someone using the thing all right i think someone might have just used that and i got caught up by a bunch of sand sites the the thing that shoots rockets my god someone's calling in five airdrops actually those are heading towards the base from yesterday that first to kelly there must be a big superpower or something okay cool we got the tech trash the bag's been secured guys all right we've made it back home all right so we're gonna need stone this windmill this car thing any high quality and that 4k stack of wood love it um building plan some rope tool hammer there was something else i needed like one battery making we wouldn't have to have a turret as well over there inside i saw a load spring all right now i think we're good oh am i right now do i want the turret on the roof or inside probably inside we can always come back and add another turret to the roof superman bring the wire tool beautiful oh one more thing this of course the main reason we're here oh yes there we go right let's go get a car now i think i want one with the four slots so we're gonna need a pretty long car maybe i should take a little bit of what i'm gonna need definitely low grades but i should probably take some high quality metal price with me just in case the repair turn over with our wire tool here oh low grade right yeah i just wonder if you can shoot rockets out the window of cars well anyway let's head on over to this road that's a two slot car three does the water tank take up two slots i think it does no way why's there no parts in this actually okay all right we gotta get back to uh our marker which is where our car is we'll cut through airfield here when we find a little hole to sneak in through all right here we go okay 12. let's get this home baby all right here we go smooth look at that terrific okay let's think about what we need here so if we went into there's another yes other we're gonna want high quality car parts which are all metal frags but you need a level three to do it we want an armored cockpit which is also a little three luckily we have a level three we want the engine and the storage and the armored passenger although i don't really know why i need a passenger but we'll have a look anyway all right we better go craft those things up bring some extra over to repair actually i don't think we need them okay let's make our car parts only the highest quality for me oh [ __ ] i forgot what i need double of i'm pretty sure it was double of these three we don't need to make an engine and a tray there we go i think that's everything right remember all that i should have bought over some high quality metal franks for the engine but i guess that doesn't matter right we got the cockpit the passenger and the box oh get that out of the way look at this raid mobile sheesh how much storage not bad not bad it's like a small box and a half i mean i don't think we need oh it's so risky shooting a rocket out of that i might have to test this on a server or something i could definitely raid with explosive bullets but [ __ ] and if i wanted more storage i really don't think i need the armored passenger vehicle i could technically just take two of these bottles oh yeah we need to make kind of scary with the key you know like once you lose the key you lose the car i guess it wasn't that hard to get right so here's a replica i've built on the server it doesn't go that fast but all right the reason we're all here it's gonna hammer does it damage this at all no only problem is you can't aim up let's test how far i get all right that's pretty decent and besides we don't particularly want to raid from it well that would be sick ah that'd be so cool oh man but you know we kind of want to be near it while we're reading so we'll probably stand out here close this oh you can hit the storage from the back baby okay that's even sicker all right oh actually we didn't test the c4 okay so c4 is out the door oh yeah it's definitely definitely not going to work for us well this car's gone right we need to scout a base something doable for us you know you know what we need we need to scout my bill ah [ __ ] all i'm gonna need low grade because with a car like an armored car we can go anywhere on the map we want you know maybe i read these guys they kind of slighted me a little last night they've got garage doors open in there oh there's nothing in there as well goes to the roof oh wait hold on what's this ah oh four rockets i mean i'm going this way for a car they care that's towards the mp5 if i'd killed that third guy that would have been cracked i reckon i would have if i'd [ __ ] been i just grabbed the locker and no bullets that fight was mine that fight was mine well i guess we don't need to scout the bill now we uh kind of know what we want to hear okay time to do a raid solo boy bit nerve-racking we should be good though hopefully just going to make sure everything's good do i have to okay that's locked all right let's open the door all right here we go so oh no all right we need to get the smear key i didn't i didn't even think all right you're limited you learned are you look at your load all right let's go back again more so i think that's it i think that's all we need to get out of there what a successful little raid man dude using the vehicle is [ __ ] awesome oh definitely do not need um the passenger vehicle another loot storage would be nice for this we need a smaller vehicle to go scouting with i reckon all right let's go look for a smaller car what's that up ahead looks like a two module one yes it is beautiful i think i like the engine being on the back of this oh my god i can see better all right we need to move this bad boy out probably all right let's name these what should we name your car a little one what's his favorite scout it's a cool name scare sons we're coming up too so let's go out on a drive around the world we haven't really left this area too much have we furthest with bitters dome all right fuel it's the last thing we need and then we can like feel like i'm going on a road trip dude this is sick okay so let's plan out a route for us maybe we head just down to the normal road that we go and just go from there all the way around we might even go around power plant so then we're going to be going off road a bit we could go to launch all right we'll figure it out might have to take it easy off robe i want to break that car too much so hard to see this there in pops a little all right we're on a road now let's get to the main road and go exploring oh smooth all right let's go okay little problem only lost that health i'll assume we hang right there oh look at all that purple smoke over there there he is maybe we could debate see this bear can attack me oh god it can where am i they've got that in their compound like that needs outside their compound you know there's a potential sneaky that could be pulled here possibly my base getting hit gotta get back i don't think it is i think it's closer towards outpost wall oh did i just see the explosion there yup here it is ow ow ow all right they have a helicopter propped up there they're not from these parts you reckon i could do it slam the helicopter okay well that [ __ ] my car up quite a lot he shirts me in the back through it bro it's hard bro there's a guy just bombing here they're all together so there's four of them interesting he's just got on the horse well i have no glass to protect me now what does makeup uh oh i couldn't get in the car pushed oh well rip that car so it was just too terrain every time i try and charge towards them the car would like [ __ ] tumble everywhere oh [ __ ] four of them they must have needed more rockets someone please counter right though it's my car still there no he took it what's he gonna do with it are they dumb stupid or dumb watch out oh you're getting pushed bro go off king oh come on kill him bro kill him so i can kill you and take my car and everything tell me he's not dead i got outposts at my back there's nothing like a third i reckon those counters are gonna show back up to oh bro then i'm going to bar but they're out of there land mine there the other hell is about to take off we just need to get on the roof and wait i haven't fully busted any yet what's in these garage doors so [ __ ] [ __ ] high bomb 125 scrap all right let's grab the launcher hopefully there's ammo outside ripper it's all about delaying multi's aks everything going off up here oh what'd i do run into another [ __ ] three man i gave that the rockets to do it oh my god it sounds so juicy i think i have to come from the top of the hill there i want that bolty this guy's shooting him in the back he's gonna shoot me we've got everything we need to research yes four times yes we've got to try it again there's still more over there this guy pushing down there now let them fight let them fight foreign gg okay oh my god how's it going is it safe is it is it safe to go that way yet okay i'll tell you what there's a lot of losers pass that way there's a lot of loyalty to that base dead bodies yeah i just started last night go go go get some quick out of that bases guns everything oh my base is past here i'm brought a pc because i enjoyed it so much oh yeah yeah my base is just on the other side of the hill there pancake layer on top oh yeah nice nice yeah just trying to get back looks like it might be safe now looks like the hatch is running i'll tell you what a safe route would be to go down to the right hand side and go around that way sweet cheers mate no worries i need this tier 3 as well for my auto shop look at all that high qual all those gears i don't even need these gears i'm going to recycle baby [ __ ] am i going to be able to hold all the [ __ ] that it recycles i don't think so yeah yeah we're going to do it we need to scrap all right oh [ __ ] uh we should skin what we're wearing because we look well where are their stuff but i don't you know let's hot shot this [ __ ] we gotta run through the forest so as i'll get some forest camo going there we go and we could wait for night too oh man look at that hall ah yes the f-39 has a four times on it you know what oh my god i'm so happy let's go over here let's research it

it let's run home we even got our launcher back on that foot did we yeah we did we did we even got our launcher back all right let's leave some high quality here slap this tier three down maybe even leave an extra few metal frags in here or 20. right we have 1500 scrap let's have a look on here these look at that now that worked out so well all right what i want to do is i'm going to just prepare a kit for upstairs in case i start getting online rated or something all right i put down a water catcher got my meds and everything to bullets i think i'm ready to go for a room see what's going on man this is this is a good wipe so far so happy with how this is going i mean are you do you live in the base with the shop just down there no you want those boys no no another four times probably worth running home hey it's that guy again actually wouldn't mind trying to take next heli too i haven't heard it come out in ages actually hello have you been farming all right all right all right not really a i've got a bit of stone on me and that's it do you want it you know what i'm gonna believe you all right cheers dude have a good one thank you so much oh oh my god seriously holy [ __ ] happy farming good luck thank you so much dude she is i saw he had a shitty pick on his back and oh i hate using those things as well kind of fell for the guy you know all right scientists are a person you know i could actually find some barrels and head to bandicam by heli hello welcome welcome addition to my collection all right cool let's go buy some tuna cans eat some tuna buy a heli fly home all right and we'll fight like to buy a mini copter please beautiful i'll set a course for k12 i already got it on so well now that we have a heli what should we do oil rig's just been done we don't even have a red card though maybe we'll just leave the heli there for now kind of like bait all right i guess we can go back out on another room see what's going on i wonder what's up on that base you know what i'm gonna make some ladders oh my god kidding me [ __ ] it's all open in there i think there's a closed garage door at the back though one rocket and 10 explosive bullets and we're in pretty deep though even just through the ladder hatch do i just remain oh come on we gotta go to it i see him doing the top of that is he chasing the other guy surely they're together where are they gone oh my god hold on man i'm coming i feel bad this is the guy that was new wasn't it [ __ ] he was running this way he's got to live over here somewhere db sorry what's up oh cheers dude didn't have to give back absolutely i feel bad gear i'm just that's all good so good uh i'm just i'm just farming up yeah i'm trying to get a good start i've got all these i've got gear and guns yeah now it's all good i'll stretch the two how's he going oh okay and i thought like you know they ran towards you i'm surprised you didn't run into them actually yeah i didn't get everything i was running around and stuff it was just like some shitty tools and stuff yeah one of your friends getting on uh hopefully soon yeah need a bigger base and i seem to get keep getting killed really fast yeah it's got the wee pancake layer on top wait on that green hill no no this one just just right here it's more them oh yeah okay player that's called honeycombing yeah on top though yeah honeycomb oh helly yeah yeah all right dude i'll let you get back in there good luck sweet hesitant i got you snapped davey he's done that i left it at your door quickly grab it oh he's gonna die i'm sorry yeah you killed my new friend oh no wonder he was sorry jeez let's cross more okay we are stacked on component absolutely stacked i might take this jackhammer out because i saw some juicy sulfur nodes outside some little juices what have we got here more stuff that we can research let's have a look yeah do we want an ak or an armored double door we don't really use double doors much so i'm thinking the a cat and then just on the balti and then double do it last i guess i do need metal too i guess i wonder what's in there probably worth cracking open we live right next door to it that person just killed db and then they ran over the landline that's just [ __ ] classic those lamplights from before that we saw oh he thought he was getting away crack the case about fh ghost that guy's had no luck when it's come to fights with me actually he knows where i live so he might be cutting me off you can see my front door see you mate he knew where to look to cheeky dog you know what i might run over there and try and make some peace with him you know a guy on his roof with an l9 is your neighbor to be a real [ __ ] pain in the ass hey dude why are you placing landmines around my base no that wasn't me oh okay i've nearly died to the moment this happened to my friend earlier yeah my friend my friend went to one earlier there's a guy placing land ones around here yeah no there was one right next to my sleeping bag over there do you know who raided the space up here what this one right here yeah someone's rated it you sure yeah oh well because they changed their front door because i guessed i guess their code on accident are trying to die and guess their front door code oh and then now it's changed and garage doors open but i didn't get any of the loot because i changed the front door code and i forgot what the code was so oh no that's a bummer yeah cause they've been they were being annoying yesterday yeah i yeah they'll run before shooting from the room actually with a platform no one's ready oh how long ago i guess so they changed the code yeah well they blew the door off so they could change yeah i'd say that's probably what happened yeah i'm just gonna build a compound suit because i feel like they're gonna raid me yeah that's the first thing i did was a compound insurance do you have any type of psycho research i'll treat you you have a tier two i can make you one if you have the staff i have a tier two uh it's probably deep inside your base though isn't it how much does it cost to make one camera one laptop 10 high quality that's easy yeah if you call me i'll just bring the tier 2 and place it outside i was thinking we could ally are you solo yeah i have a friend but he's not going to be until heaps later all right i'll sell them for the first uh i can yeah i have like all the bbs pretty much by now so i can make you whatever you need you need a winner as well yeah actually that'd be nice that's my base i guess 10 high quality gears three changes oh that's easy okay fact just give me the stuff i'll craft it over there okay i don't have i have two sheet and then i have the rest all right that's mine looking for the wood okay i'm gonna go find some wood uh yeah do it on the hillside where i was all right i should have it all all right i'm heading over i'll be right back is that a heaven where oh no what is it all right good luck all right we've got an alliance that was an unlikely alliance too he saw me for sure oh my god hello hello look at your hub you're so sneaky yeah well there you go sorry about that is that you guys over there as well right no did you see my tummy it's on your body i put it on your body thank you no worries all right we're going on another round i think we look for a base nearby oh no there was the bases over there look like they might be a little juicy raid only problem is getting the raid mobile to them kind of really rough terrain here gg bro gg oh [ __ ] got some fat loot there man got some fat loot there man can you pick me up though please my first run man you got me that's so broke where'd you go to airfield oh [ __ ] uh sorry yeah dude come here come here come here hey i'm gonna give you some guns there look now yeah that was my first first guns bro uh i got it man i got a rock right here mate i got a rock give him those guns hopefully that'll make for some entertaining pvp a bit later on hey i got more comps than i'll ever need a full year too you know what they probably limited that base and i was thinking about raining they weren't running that way well he was and the other guy came from that direction this thing here hey how's it going yeah hello hey what's your base just so i don't rate it i don't have a base i don't i don't have a base mine oh you're not with that guy i have one no i don't know who that this guy's annoying i don't want him building around here four rockets to the back i wonder i mean [ __ ] it four rockets why not let's do it that many rockets here just the double armor door to go and then that's all tier three blueprints except for the fire bullet but who wants that all right got the raid mobile find the spare key for scout that was over there you know might even still be there i wish you can't look at some point uh i just want to add an extra loot storage onto this actually there we go you know i should probably put these rockets here put the key there and mark the exact location in the base because it's very hard to see where you're going in that armored vehicle uh i'm literally about to pull out and go for a raid dude okay it's in my base or anything ah i might just go at solo see how i got it's only four rocket raid hopefully or did you do all right it was yeah i killed him okay it's not worth oh that was smooth smoothest one yeah oh the key lost all my smooth cool points look right above us i had some bad tommy's shots over here too anything good oh you can have the leftovers now it was [ __ ] like 2k sulphur was the best and an m9 pistol yeah i'm actually kind of happy that you're ready to move as the first day of what um he sat in his air like with an m92 pistol and i double headshot him across he and he didn't come out of the airlock do you think there's any counters coming yeah maybe i don't know if it's c4 rockets can i have it absolutely if it is you can have the air drop anyway i just want to see what's in it can you keep me safe for a second i need to do something yeah bad place to keep you safe i'll try okay hopefully there's something good what should be a nikkei nothing oh mp5 that's actually nice have a look yeah look not bad take it all bro okay thanks i needed the mp5 do you need any of it no no no no i don't need anything that's what makes an explode bullet to keep raiding i might get him to come watch my back on this one i need to get up some stuff out of the raid all right here we go on another raid why tc and open that's a nice cc if there's a d okay you gotta keep going or not oh he's gonna look for counselors be careful watch out for counters yeah i'm going to take a i'm going to go around more so i have a different angle yoga grubs is i go get their tv so do you think you'll be good that'd be right take whatever you want bro okay okay i might start heading back actually do i oh i'm stepping out wait dude can you can we break this box for a sec can you oh come on yeah do this yeah because there's something behind it i don't know what's in there anything good watch out yeah just keep an eye out for the raiders generators i literally just could help this guy out yeah that was my first first guns yeah i broke that's it someone's getting shut up i seems like wait oh i hate this i'm stuck so come on what am i stuck on oh i'm [ __ ] come on big guts no take it easy god kills he's right beside me all right i need to have a break i reckon ah i'm back just had a date night with pookie went out and had chinese look at a k-mart you know every girl's dream yeah we're gonna go uh patrol and you know what this will take the heli why not whoa [ __ ] hell is here come on helen come this way baby this [ __ ] hell is coming back i'm going to be pissed yeah wait i'm going to die at your gate spawn at my base so i want to rock it to this what the [ __ ] all right how bad is this damage not bad ah some solar panels gone one solar panel gone all right we got our first heli well we haven't got it yet we've got it down oh [ __ ] okay people are close [ __ ] calm down he died so hey i'm on my [ __ ] turret box i'm a solo who just took helico stop judging me all right i'm a [ __ ] people all over me yeah all right whatever i'll do it i don't see him he's gone i mean come on you shot at me while i was taking helen it was a compound though i don't know the [ __ ] tier 5 weapon double barrel rule [ __ ] he's got a p2 holy cow i need to [ __ ] go back to uk and bro holy [ __ ] oh look he's camping mp5 bro get him winter bro he's right your [ __ ] door i killed another guy over there too behind this rock here are they still door camping i don't know there's a hazy coming around here he's dead an mp5 get out of here goldie who did i just kill hey the only [ __ ] reason you kill me is because that naked [ __ ] oh you're naked get out of here yeah what's that you guys counting right back to say i [ __ ] i screamed and slammed my desk is that naked who was the ak i killed that was blip oh [ __ ] slap lip holy [ __ ] the outside cheers for the help dude oh good um just type in chat if you need me to help anymore i'll come back yeah same to you speak of the devil oh um i knew you were there lock i just wasn't sure how many were there that was all the naked you made one footstep i was crouched the whole time on your way up you made one footstep so i knew someone was on that side you [ __ ] beamed me dude i couldn't even see you and then next time i'm getting [ __ ] railed by bullets i was like [ __ ] well gg dj i'd take that helly [ __ ] soul over i was [ __ ] brutal oh you actually took get long enough well yeah they're like trying to shoot it from base to like [ __ ] i was screaming at your name i was pissed because i got [ __ ] shot by a turret and then you killed me because there's a there's a [ __ ] there's a fat gap in between that that is the best misplaced wall i've ever [ __ ] done it is it has gotten me like a few kits now yeah got me cheeky [ __ ] put me on 50 hp all you have to do is hit me twice lucky lucky luck has nothing to do with you make your own luck you make your own gaps on your walls you're a roof camper neighbor too uh he was he's my ally okay i haven't spoken to him before i alive with some guy called fh ghost because i was [ __ ] i [ __ ] him up every single fight and then i killed him as he tried to run into his base and i was like oh [ __ ] that's my neighbor like any i know he was on his roof with his old line at one point but he wasn't roof camping real bad and i was like oh i don't really want a [ __ ] roof camper for a neighbor so i just like went over and made an ally with him and then he had another friend come on and then this guy came on so but it's just him on at the moment by the way was nothing good in that halloween yeah definitely an interview sorry give me brought in sir what's that what's that sorry oh yeah bro what's up not nothing much that came to contest and i heard your voice oh true nice oh good value nice to meet you dad yeah you too bro especially when you run that far are you guys on the same spot no no he moved way too cause i [ __ ] kept running into the pedal today he's the only one of them one at the moment i see him on a roof camp for a neighbor so i was like oh [ __ ] make some peace this area has been crazy did you get him yeah i got him he just said in the team chat uh old main store behind your base and i said oh that's my friend not playing with me i'm just solo she's new just to rub it in um sorry what's your uh grid location um ice six yeah we just ran down to hallie oh [ __ ] you're up there there was a raid up your way before what yeah i tried to find it couldn't find it it was in between you and i actually no it was it was it would have been around g the f9 somewhere around there f10 maybe yeah yeah so i was running but by the time i got there i heard like three explosions and that was it it was over i almost went to counter the raid because the heli wouldn't fly anywhere near me and then it started coming back i was like oh [ __ ] yeah as soon as you were losing interest it was like no way i lost interest twice and [ __ ] it started coming back both times as soon as i was about to leave i believe i clapped blooper like [ __ ] i gotta be the best players what that's not hard to kill me man when you have a turret that took me hard you're beaming you're [ __ ] harder i was coming i was gonna come back mp5 just to piss you off to be honest at least you're honest you're gonna lost your head sir i told you i was farming yeah i didn't think and then i saw a hat just saw a hazy and i'm [ __ ] well that's that's not stop stop stop stop it's all right it's all right he doesn't know me stop stop it's all good it's all it's all good hello he's dead i'll pick you up you don't have to live in this area i do careful yeah not bad i'm with i'm with fha that's the same spot same area that's the goal sir winter had turned enemies into friends and friends into enemies and then back again a chance encounter had seen him reunite with lost friends from days past and the reunion would only have been for a moment if it were not for the distant sounds of thunderous booms all three parties licked their lips hungrily like starved dogs that could smell blood in the air and like dogs they knew the pack stood a greater chance than the loan an unspoken agreement had been made a temporary alliance the dogs would hunt together because the expo will cover our tracks this base will be [ __ ] stacked by the way i saw them calling five air drops earlier i've got a [ __ ] full inventory just from those crates did they go top down yeah probably not i'm running wide smart because then no one can yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] my pants yeah i score your head as i said as i saw you say is that you oh we may as well run around now when are they gonna [ __ ] dead wait did they jump over this [ __ ] rock sure oh receive all the mad dogs oh i just got done yeah he's up on the hill i see him on the same team he's hazy he's has the l9 what the [ __ ] another again uh what direction he just got me with a rocket i headshot him and hit him did he kill you all i got two onlines [ __ ] yeah i'm dead yeah i'm dead i'm probably going to go coast side boys yeah he fell i'm dead i headshot him he's gone there's no way he's gonna come back unless he literally ran the [ __ ] outpost yeah i'm trying to get my body sounds like someone doing their taxes or something like way like no probably not all right mp5 man [ __ ] that actually i got a [ __ ] laundry high balls oh no no you get knocked you get locked out of the heli now no you should go outside that'd be silly don't be daft doesn't it don't be valley yeah exactly like it doesn't kill you just like it actually makes you jump out of the heli when you shoot a rocket yeah yeah what yeah yeah legit send you out just think so i don't know but yeah you can't really do it anymore it [ __ ] each out of the seat that's [ __ ] dumb roof campers win again all right what's your quads left i'm at the base at r6 l6 all right all right i'm here is this your base with a metal roof yeah am i above it yep those are the [ __ ] best beat downs i've ever seen fairness dead dude you [ __ ] love to see it boys there's no point running over there they're going to fly there's one in here they're in the building he was kidding up maybe i should just get in the hell and go oh does he have an angle on his body right here this body right here this body right here get the good stuff and get out gunpowder on the dead body [ __ ] i got all the soul from it [ __ ] it uh what should i try can you fly it out pick me up if i get there no way bro all right so i'm gonna get it ready and you're gonna jump in okay yeah let me press you safety holy [ __ ] [ __ ] me man [ __ ] you are they all are they all vigils they know you're winter now that's why here we go you just blow up three hit markers [ __ ] are they all dead [ __ ] all right i'm gonna get you on the windmill i've got no more i'm gonna get you on the windmill all right here we go i've got nothing i've got nothing i got nothing you know what [ __ ] it nice yeah nice one dude killed another one cool kid i would assume so by the sounds of that no he's on a very magical place you need to climb up that two by two and get that heli um there yeah let's just ladder onto the two blocks no i do it where was he nah he's up on the roof how are they [ __ ] in there like what is going on i guess they own it solo killed me he's not solo he's a [ __ ] liar so winter's blindness had cost them control of the raid and with his sacrifice of the helicopter there was now no way back up to the top but in the distance they set a base on the side of a hill that had been relentlessly mowing down any who dared to get near the raid with their sniper rifles and on their roof did sit a helicopter a devious plan they all did devise oh my god little stop being a [ __ ] chad she [ __ ] famed me i'm sorry she did ask multiple times did you want to be added to the team i was already i was already up with thomas with the essence he was opening doors sorry sorry sorry that's all right sorry it happens i had i had to yell so you knew not to [ __ ] finish me i'm gonna watch this door um oh yeah i can obviously watch it i got you so what's up on me right now oh no they're watching they're watching they're watching now it's going to get [ __ ] just take it back all right just so you know you're i didn't hit [ __ ]

going to watch the ladder oh [ __ ] i'm down level up kill him let me get back i'm really close really close i'm picking up your gun though we're gonna yeah go for it we're gonna break back the [ __ ]

socials hey that's my horse please sir i have a long ride home ah another day let's survey the surroundings see what's going on everything looks good up here how are they going oh yeah good good still got all my turrets and everything man these turrets i reckon i've been a big deter for that people raining man all right let's go see what's going on not many people on now at this point service started to dial up a little i got some boom to use still uh i kind of want to see what that big squad that called in all those air drops last night they're doing and by big squad i think they're a four man oh wasn't that bad like here oh that's what we get over there what's on the roof quick little head shot you know what what if i raid the base that [ __ ] started it all this whole thing this whole snowball is this bass here look his furnace face decay now what i'm gonna do it my final act so so so yeah i looked at your last name actually there's so much [ __ ] loot here yeah there it is i don't know why they filter like this there's so many shop runs do you want the satchels how many searches oh that's crazy do you want them yeah yeah yeah [ __ ] bro that's so much what the hazies have they didn't have anything but go outside for some reason why do you know if there's anything in this open base over here there's a base with open boxes no idea all right help yourself bruh whatever you want do whatever you want okay watching thanks surprise no one showed up this time yeah i thought they would have come back for sure i'm going to have a literal truckload of scrap so all right time to get recycling holy crap we ever saw it let's go see what the total tally is so so sir winter had survived the days he lived in those lands showing what he was made of the fairy tale endings are left to fairy tales as he was just satisfied with being able to live through those experiences and retire like a dragon of old on a mountain of treasure and to have filled his mind with extensive knowledge of craftsmanship for future adventures and of course that's what there was to be more adventures stood on the horizon calling his name the end guys have you made it this far holy crap this has been my longest movie yet and i feel like my best ever video the amount of work and that i put into this oh it's crazy um if you guys got this far i mean leave a comment with a love heart at the end of it and i'll be sure to give it a heart as well because that's such an effort to make it this far into the video right at the end here now also with the raid shadow legends ad if you guys could
