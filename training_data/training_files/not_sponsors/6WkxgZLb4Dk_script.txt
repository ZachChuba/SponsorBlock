it's a note 10 nothing no 10 you thought it was the Meno 10 bang bang now people this is a different price point of course it comes from Xiaomi this starts at five hundred and fifty bucks so why don't we do it oh by the way this one midnight black 128gb of storage and six gigs of RAM up to 256 and and in different colors I assume Aurora Green glacier white and midnight black this one's midnight black okay what is cool about this phone well actually look at that a hundred and eight megapixel ultra high-resolution camera with a one by one point three three super sensor you're about to be stunned well Penta camera all scenario imaging system 10x hybrid zoom with oh is you heard it correctly Penta Penta that's five a five camera setup I'm gonna compare this setup to some of the other smartphone setups that are out there 6.47 3d curved AMOLED display and look at this one fifty to sixty milliamp hour high-capacity battery with 30 watt fast charge now of course we've seen faster charging than 30 watts in the past but good enough for a lot of people and particularly when you pair it with an enormous battering my goodness gracious this one doesn't have the top-tier Snapdragon processor either so you kind of make a trade down so look that's pretty reminiscent of some other stuff that's on the marketplace has been on the marketplace one two three four five camera setup there's a 5x zoom 2x zoom you have your standard camera with the crazy 108 megapixel sensor there's a macro camera holy moly look at this wide ultra wide telephoto telephoto macro this is what we're talking about the other day now does protrude a little bit as it would it's got this mirrored finish the midnight black a USB type-c connector for the 30 watt fast charge there's also a headphone jack on there there's also an infrared sensor which these things still pop up here in there we're gonna get case and some paperwork this is a basic one to get y'all get you up and running it's got the smoke color to it although this thing still gets its very own fingerprint so see that well it's your very own fingerprint right there quick charge power brick as I said 30 watts the type-c cable and that rounds out the most exciting for me is to test out all these cameras because it's just it's kind of wild all the mainstream flagship devices expanding in the camera department even Apple who people were skeptical when they first saw the mock-ups people were going crazy they can't do all that they can't have all those cameras then they did and everyone bought it this right here with the five camera setup you might be seeing this sometime soon on your other devices as well a different plant Kirk just displaced the famous fake plant with another a real plant spare risky this could go sideways alright so this gives us our first glance at the screen to body ratio you can see the type of notch that they've gone for it's that little teardrop it's it's about as small as it can be no other fancy sensors embedded in there it's just a front-facing camera of course you can use it for face unlock optical based face unlocked and your selfies they've also hidden the speaker unit right above there it's ever so tiny let's just get to the comparison so here's the iPhone one two three four five that's the BRE that's five obviously they've gone for the square dimension like many other manufacturers this over here that's the pixels and as you can tell that's how they implemented it again quite large always latest the mate 30 Pro which to me it might be the most pleasing of the bunch that's four cameras there's a lot of text there too a lot of text on this phone you're walking around town with a hundred and eight megapixels you gotta let people know they do that's a lot of mega-pick you don't want to wait megapixels you got there yeah yeah registration taking a few more taps here maybe it wants to be more accurate I'll do why not rhodium yeah okay we'll are you ready to rock No yes the display extends over the edge of the phone some people worry with devices that really push that edge where they're gonna grip this one I can grip I have some room that I can feel the metal this is Kirk's plant that he's keeping alive and he has decided that this plant deserves some attention because he's taking such good care of it here we are 1x ooh a nice little satisfying sound when it grabs the focus ooh I like the sound effects xiaomi doing here very subtle here we go to eksu okay and then all the way in that's a 5 X boom we've already used three cameras and we ain't done yet okay point six boom what is this Oh macro macro oh yes so macro whoa alright so I kinda have a thing for the macros I have a thing for the macaroni ladies and gentlemen look at the cold hard steel Jackie ever seen cold hard steel that's the ultra wide obviously a very wide photo as it would be that's the idea the 5x zoom allow me to examine that okay the 2x zoom interesting whoo the main camera is the nicest looking by far if you look at it it has it has slightly more dynamic range that's tremendous versatility that's really the story of this phone although you probably expected that coming into it I gotta keep your mind it's five cameras on the back what you're really hoping for probably as a user is to be able to take advantage of this creativity now I understand there's all kinds of techniques for things like zoom in the software computational hybrids and so forth and they do work but take macro for example there's no real computational version of that that I've seen that can replicate a proper macro photo you're gonna feel confident having in your pocket if you want to do something cool well like you could have an iPhone sitting here you've got to get right on that and now all the sudden you've got dust particles the focusing distance is just bananas actually look at all part of couples fibers there's fibers on their horse skin flakes yeah of course it's this is how you know the detail this is what you should be demanding if you're watching any type of smartphone video and you don't see smudges and you don't see particles you're not getting the real test you understand this is not an apple no you put the cloth away because that's actually it's funny it's those imperfections it's like the beard hair test it's actually those imperfections to really analyze the camera performance that's a fun camera interestingly enough there's a hundred eight megapixel option which they keep as separate but they keep it they put it by default very close to the typical photo mode snap it you know there's a processing going on this taking time okay it worked though I suppose if you want to get crazy with your crop but if you're not gonna get crazy with the crop you're just making your life miserable storing underneath the pixel photos obviously yeah twelve thousand by nine thousand pixels sixteen point one seven megabytes per photo that's trouble now of course we've also got tried the front-facing camera for obvious reasons we Came we saw we conquered we've done it before we'll do it again those right there our beard hairs alright let's listen to the speaker on this I believe it's only a single speaker setup it was a double tape it was a I scrolled eyes I scrolled again I know I know it's all coming out of one speaker it's one speaker units not the best I ever heard it works it's I mean it's clear you can hear it I don't remember what the renders were but there were so many different ones we talked about yeah but keep in mind you got the headphone jack classic headphone jack so you got options fingerprint speed hmm you have to obviously start with the price it's around 500 bucks 550 this one says no they say you can live with the 700 series Snapdragon processor so what you really need is camera versatility that's what you care about the camera is your number one party possibly the battery as well here's the thing how many people truly take advantage of the top-tier spec from the snapdragon standpoint I don't know I guess that's up to you to determine it's up to you to decide but I will say at least in this preliminary testing the phone feels plenty fast and snappy you can do smart phone things on here but what you can do on top of that is camera things that other smart phones can't do so it's really a smart phone camera decision as much as it's an overall smart phone decision so if camera is your top priority I think you're probably going to want to take a look at this device if you have around 500 bucks spots are by
