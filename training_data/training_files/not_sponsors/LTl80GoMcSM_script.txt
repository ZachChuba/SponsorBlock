Vic successfully takes down Diego Mendez and Jerry Martinez despite lanced arriving just too late to help his brother out the two vance siblings readily agree to never go anywhere near drugs again and leave vice city to send Pete the money for his medication but even though they fly off into the metaphorical sunset the story of the Vance brothers isn't over just yet Vice City 1986 clearly 1984 was
