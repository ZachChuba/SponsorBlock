and then she would like they'd eat and whatever she'd come back like a day later oh they still have food because the seeds were still there yeah and she did that for two weeks and she starved my parakeets while I was away at summer camp yeah no they were eating it but she's thought of the seeds the outside of the seeds were food and I came home and they were dead on the bottom of their cage
